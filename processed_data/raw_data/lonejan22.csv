lonely,"I honestly get too excited when I get notifications from reddit, discord or one of my dating apps.","I honestly get too excited when I get notifications from reddit, discord or one of my dating apps. - A lot of social medias stress me out, and I read reading my tiktok notifications most of the time because people are so argumentative there. But I usually get some serotonin feeling whenever I see a reddit notification in my bar, or one from a dating app. It's always especially a pleasant surprise if it's a DM, or on discord if it's a mentioning of my username. 

It's honestly probably a problem and unhealthy. Sometimes I even *save* certain notifications for later. Like if I see i got a DM I may wait a bit to open it. Like if I wake up in the morning and have a lot, ill save a dm or dating app message for last. It's really weird."

lonely,"20m, suffering loss of identity.","20m, suffering loss of identity. - This crushes my ego, but I need friends. I also think it's pathetic of me. I'm just so ashamed of myself. Where else can I find friends? I don't go to school; I had to drop out at the age of 16. 

I only made friends outside school... They made me see how beautiful life is. I just have to find the right people, in right time. Though life is not in favor of me right now.

We had to go seperate ways just last year. So I'm left alone again. 

I now finally admit I can't do this all alone. I thought I can do this all on my own. I'm so demotivated in life I can't do the things I have to do. I feel lost.

I want... and I need to make friends. If they are sad I, too, wish to support their emotional needs.

 Some might think I'm just someone from internet, but I'm also a living being with a soul just behind the scene; we all are. 

So if anyone wants to talk with me do PM me ^^ Thank you for reading. And take care."
lonely,I started talking to a friend again recently but I feel just as shitty as before,"I started talking to a friend again recently but I feel just as shitty as before - I’m  btw. I’ve felt lonely for a while, lost my friends, hate how I look. I held a knife to my throat 3 weeks ago, mad at myself for the way that I am, but I pussied out. I saw that she kept on trying to follow me on Instagram. I went ahead and directed my anger towards her in a self-deprecative type way asking what the hell she wanted to do with me. 

She knew I was hurting. Kept trying to get me to open up, tell her what’s wrong. The thing is it’s hard to trust people when you think everyone’s against you. I opened up some, she says she’ll be there for me, that she can hold me. Said she knows what I’m going through, the loneliness and the hopelessness. 

I was gonna hang out with her today at the park. Her mom was mad at her for coming home late last night so that didn’t happen. 

I hate the way I think:
I wanna fully trust her like she says I can but I don’t. I think she’s lying to me. I think she’s trying to get at me to embarrass me. It annoys me that she takes for ever to respond when I have all the time in the world to respond fast. I feel like she doesn’t have a enough time for me. I’m afraid that I’ll do or say one thing and that’s it. I’m scared I’m uninteresting or boring. I think I’m gonna lose her again. But it’s bs and I know it’s not true but I just have trouble believing it. 

I know we have a lot in common. Love the same music, have similar dreams, share similar hobbies. I texted her on and off during online school in 2020 and 2021. Then we drifted away from each other. I’m here now thinking what the hell does she want to do with some lonely freak like me. She has a mass of great friends, and she decides to dedicate some of her time to a waste of space like me. 

I want to improve my social skills. I have trouble saying hi, at least she always does it first in school for me. I wish we hung out more but I just don’t know how to ask without seeming like a creep. I do have a crush on her, but Ik that’s just born out of my lack of human interaction. I just don’t want to lose her making mistakes and I want to keep her as a friend even if I am a mess."

Somethings are left unsaid. 😔 - Of all the people that could/would have treated me this way, I would have never expected it from you. You were my friend, and from everything We spoke about, I thought I was the same for you. You stuck with me when I was down and out, helped me feel happy. I tried my best to be there for you when you needed me. You were always there calling me when you felt alone and made me feel like I had a true friend that cared about me and that I wasn’t alone. We kept eachother company day to day, and with your company you helped me in many ways, made my life fuller. Maybe we haven’t been a good friends to one another lately. We should have sat down and explained how we felt, I would have understood that you needed space. An maybe I should have realized the signs and spoken to you myself. Then maybe we could have worked on still being friends, But now I’m not sure if we could ever be friends again. Which even through the bs, I still care about you and hope that you do somewhere deep inside. I hope that even though we aren’t friends and we don’t talk anymore that Maybe someday we could try and be friends again. It may never happen because honestly I don’t know your true feelings. I know I have my faults and I know my anger is one of them, but that’s no excuse for my actions so for that I’m truely sorry. If we wont be in each other’s life’s anymore, I hope you know that you’ll always have a friend in me. I hope your life moves forwards and that you can be truely happy. I know your life has had a lot of struggles so I hope that you become happy with yourself and your life. Until the day we meet again"

You don’t have to, because you’ll always have a friend in me. Cheer up. - Aloha from the sunny golden state. I hope those of you who are from the east coast are keeping warm. 

Can you believe we’re almost in February already! Crazy, right? How was your first month of the new year? Any different, better, same than the year before…? 

I gonna browse the news, watch some highlights of the World Cup qualification games and I’ll be here if you’re up for a fun, spontaneous, interesting and lively chat. 

I only have a couple of things to ask, try not to bring your negative energy my way, don’t be too awkward or weird and I don’t care if you have a bandonkadonk, and I won’t get disccccorrd, follow anyone on instaaaa or any of those lame spammer gimmicks. 

I just want a lovely conversation for a change! 
And again, I am only looking to chat with someone really interesting and hopeful making a friend! Nothing else… I don’t wanna know about your bf/gf, husband/wife drama, I don’t want to get involved with anyone or anything out of the ordinary! I am not chasing a wifey, and more importantly I’m not chasing anyone else problems, and definitely don’t want to get in anyone’s pants (unless they are yoga pants, that is… haha! JK) 


I’m gonna be honest, I miss the good old days, before the pandemic, and even Reddit… where meeting new people was a lot easier than this! Haha. 


Cheers"
lonely,Young and lonely,"Young and lonely - Let me give a little bit of background - So I’m 22, and I recently moved all the way from one coast of the U.S to the other (not kidding) to escape my toxic mother and try to scrape together a life for myself. I’m trying to finish my bachelors degree, and I’m living at school in the dorms. My father, my best friend and support system, died a little over a year ago. I have a brother, but we’ve never been super close. I’ve always kind of been an island of a girl, even when I was receiving serious medical treatments for a couple years in my late teens. I never asked for help, even when I really needed it. Never asked for pain meds, or water, I didn’t want to bother anyone. I learned over time that my mothers manipulation and emotional abuse shut me down and forced me to be as low maintenance as possible. But this also means I’m terrible at making friends, because I almost never make the first move on anything. I watch others, and then jump in when I feel confident enough to try, and that’s how I’ve done most things in my life. Hell, making an account on Reddit, a social platform, to try and reach out to anyone is really scary for me. 
 
But I have this weird pull in my heart. I want to be in love. I want to find love of some kind. Crazy right? I don’t even know how to make proper friends! I’m kinda shy and keep to myself, but I do know that I’m at least kind and patient with others because I always try my best to be! People tell me I’m beautiful, perfect strangers even, and that’s been true for years, so I can’t be too terrible to look at. 

So I guess what I’m looking for is a myriad of things. Has anyone else felt like this, or been in a similar situation? How do I start to find people to be friends with in a place I’ve never been to before? How do I find love of some kind, without accidentally walking into a disaster because I’m looking for it so hard and so willingly? I can’t drive because I was under my mothers thumb for so long, she was reluctant to let me have any independence. People are kind of cold and distant here, so it’s really scary to think of approaching anyone. And the masks make it so hard to tell what anyone else is thinking, I can’t see smiles or the little expressions we all make that say so much about our moods.  So nobody even looks approachable. I just hide in my dorm all day or go to the gym. 

I’m desperate to find some advice. I want to have a life, I want to find warmth in a mans arms and laugh with friends. I don’t want to fail and end up on my mothers doorstep."

lonely,"To the point where nobody close to me (33M, gay) wants to really listen","To the point where nobody close to me (33M, gay) wants to really listen - So, I am pretty much at rock bottom right now.  I'm not even sure writing this is the right choice since having someone who doesn't know me reach out to me really doesn't counteract the fact that the people who know me best don't offer to talk or truly listen, but I feel it may be healthy to vent here.

I've suffered with chronic illness, both physical and mental for over a decade and currently have chronic pain and severe insomnia.  I live with my parents still because of it, I have no job since we moved across state a few months ago, I have no friends, and I have to start from scratch in every way imaginable but barely have the energy to function daily.  On top of it, my long-distance long-term relationship with someone I loved deeply ended last month.  

We understood each other beyond what words can say, and we would talk and support each other in healthy ways daily.  I wanted to still be his friend after the breakup since the relationship ended due to logistical factors beyond our control, but he finds it too hard to be my friend because of his romantic love for me.  So, I am respecting that and I am not contacting him as per his wish.  

In the meantime, I have tried to get myself and my life together, but my support system has been lacking.  At first, when the breakup occurred my family was receptive and supportive with letting me talk through my struggles and feelings, but that's went by the wayside.  When I mention that I have a day I'm struggling, there's never a ""Would you like to talk?"" from them.  This has been a recurring dynamic throughout my life despite me repeatedly telling them that I would like for them to offer to talk to me on days I am struggling.  I even flat-out said today I needed that, and yet still no offer.  I just don't understand.

Also, my therapist, who I've been seeing for two years, has shown that she is really not listening or invested in what I have to say or in my case in general.  This has also been a recurring theme

I am not an overbearing person, and most of the time I keep my problems to myself and just try to distract myself.  It's not often that I need to vent.

I just don't know what to do anymore.  It seems I've lost the one person who I was close to who cared enough to talk with me and help me get through life in a healthy way.  I'm not sure what I'm even looking for in posting this, but I thank anyone who has taken the time to read it."

I'm going to university next month so I will have to move to another state (far from home) and I have nobody to care or anything. I finished high school with 3 friends but only 1 month later 2 of them were gone already. Now (1 year later) I thought I still had this friend who stayed but in the last 2 months he avoids me so I think I don't have him anymore (and he doesn't give a shit when I try to talk about leaving or hangout).
My brothers don't care, they are living their best lives and don't even want to spend some time with me while I'm here.

and that's all. University has always been my dream and everyone knows it but here I am, with no one to share my happiness, my last month with or my stresses. hope you all have/had a good moment when is the most important of your life because the feel of this is horrible."

But no one knows how I am, they would all say I’m a very happy person, but the truth is I’ve been chronically depressed for ten years. I had a bereavement a few weeks ago, and it’s tipped me back into self harming.  I’ve been throwing up all evening after self harming with medication and I’ve got blisters on my thighs from burning.  I feel so terribly alone.  Yet I push people away. This is completely of my own making.  It’s like another layer of self harm or self sabotage; push people away when you are lonely."

However that's not all it's like a Rollercoaster, I browse through FB and Reddit and other social media. I see these amazing beautiful women and I think that's what I want. I want so.eone in my life, then I talk to people and get ghosted or left and think why do I keep doing this.

Up and down over and over and it's a vicious cycle. And it's not just recent it's been this way since I was a kid and I didn't really know what was going on in my head until about 4 years ago. I  doing what I can to get help and alot of days I am ok I can function. 

I wish I could let others feel what I feel so they under stand but I can't. So I send it out there and honestly not looking for advice or a reply just looking to get this off my chest because I think it's killing me"

We went on two dates that I thought were really great, but she told me the other day that she’s not ready to be with anyone after breaking up with her ex in the fall of last year. Her reasons are perfectly valid, but I can’t help but feel that she was put off by my eagerness to be with her. I have a tendency to hyper fixate when dating and try way too hard to become the ideal partner. Meeting her and falling head over heels right off the bat only to be rejected is so painful that I can hardly bear it. I realize now that I have been extremely lonely and can’t shake the idea of needing to be with someone. Though admittedly I need to work on being happy with myself, I want to be in love more than anything. If anyone has advice or kind words, I could really use it. I feel so low."

lonely,I came out of my lonely corner but it seems like I'm slowly going back into it....,"I came out of my lonely corner but it seems like I'm slowly going back into it.... - So there was a time when I was 17 and changed schools, for the main purpose of getting a fresh start and finding new friends... I wasn't insanely popular but I got along with a few people and even tried to ask my first crush out.... Skip to the end of school when I was 19, I was heartbroken but thanks to an online chatroom I found a few irl friends to talk to and even got over my heart ache... Now queue a few years forward to when I'm about to be 23 in a week... I haven't had a single relationship and most friends I've had have gotten into relationships and they're distant... But there were a few friends left still... Now during the new years eve I lied to my parents about spending time with friends while one of my best friends went off to celebrate with my other friend and another one of my best friends said she wanted to be alone but I ended up seeing her partying with people... Skip a few weeks into 2022 and it's her birthday coming up, since we haven't met for half a year then I figured I'd ask her out and we'd just see each other and talk and I even planned on getting her a few roses since she likes flowers, we have known each other for 4 years now and I've always been extremely supportive of her and always ready to listen.... She said she has no plans but said let's see when the day comes.... Well then that day came and she didn't even open up my messages despite sending snaps to me and when I was about to go to sleep I saw that she's with a guy she met a week ago ... It broke my heart and despite her saying we're still friends and she wants to meet she never makes an effort on her side and whenever I try to meet up she gives an uncertain answer... Now I feel like my one friend group doesn't want to hang around with me outside of gaming (people I met irl) and one of my best friends who I've always supported and at some point really made me feel like she cares about me, has also gotten tired of me and is trying to make me leave her alone despite my best effort trying to be there for her... I recently moved on my own too because my mum left for America and even though she sometimes writes to me she quickly starts sending me thumbs up emojis as if she wants me to leave her alone instead of trying to talk to me... At this point I don't know what to do and tbh I'd like to punch anyone who says ""treat others like you want to be treated"" because it's the most bullshit thing ever"

lonely,I need advice,"I need advice - I have been struggling with severe feelings of loneliness for the better part of about 2 years,  as of now. I don't have anyone but my ""superficial small talk group"" at school. I don't have a single genuine friend or social life.
At the start of this school year however i got to know a girl, she's in my class. She's always been very friendly with me and we chatted here and there, she always seemed very genuine and it always made me happy to talk to her. She noticed that i wasn't doing well mentally and checked up on me. As small as that might sound, it was a huge deal for me. She was the first person in years to really make me feel somewhat cared about except for my parents.
Because I'm a dumbass i started liking her on more than just a platonical level. Around christmas time we texted here and there and once again, it always felt genuine. However now that school started again i feel like we are drifting apart. Some friends of her know that i like her and even made some hints she might like me back but i just can't seem to approach her recently. I truly like her and she often told me about how she relates to some of my struggles but on the other hand seems so unreachable. She's got plans for after school, good grades, friends..
I know very well that if i just ""wait for something to happen"", nothing will happen. I'll stay miserable by myself. But approaching someone like this after a large period of social Isolation and all my past experiences with girls ending in rejection, it is extremely hard for me."

I've always been pretty introverted. I don't mind going out, but I've never really gone to clubs, bars, or parties. Never really drank, and definitely never smoked or did any kind of recreational drugs. I do a little cardio throughout the week, but I don't live in the gym. Don't want pets or kids. Not looking for casual sex at all. I wouldn't mind going out and trying something new, but I'm really at my happiest when I'm at home playing video games, reading, or watching stuff. Based on what I saw, there aren't really any women out there who are like that. I don't want to force myself to do things I'm not interested in and become someone else just because I don't have a lot in common with women, but I feel like I'll probably be alone forever by just being myself."

Not everyone can be the kind of person that gets reached out to, some people need to do the reaching out. And I feel like that’s the people who are lonely.

I used to be too anxious to ask for help, too anxious to meet people. But by doing things that made me really uncomfortable and working on myself day by day. I’ve become a person that doesn’t hesitate to say what I need to say. I’ve been happy with my aloneness.

If you need help, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Everyone has a unique path, but I’ve reached the end of my loneliness."

I've graduated from an engineering degree just over six months ago and with the pandemic impacting my degree length, i've moved back home to my parents. I was initially meant to be on a placement year in 2020/21 but we all know what happened.

Apart from my family, I have little relations here. I'm not from a very well connected city and jobs within my studied field are not anywhere close by. All my college friends have moved out of town or are still in university elsewhere. 

I'm currently working at an electrical engineering firm to get some experience and apart from that, I have no real desire to go out anywhere. I feel so out of place in my job as I've been away from home for education/university and everyone there is from the local area. I feel I have nothing in common with my coworkers. I'm lonely all the time and I feel as if I'm stagnating in life and my career. I wake up and don't feel bothered to go to work but I need the money so I come home and do the same routine every night.

-when they couldn't do that anymore after we moved to a rich town, they all ""mysteriously"" started to hate me
-living in a racist part of town, I wasn't allowed to play with other kids because I'm ""too dark skin"", but my brother with lighter skin was allowed to play with whoever.
-bullied in school thru elementary to highschool
-kicked out after I came out as gay
-when my family wasn't inappropriately telling friends in my life all these lies about me it was people who bullied me
-young adult life, someone who said he was obsessed with me in HS unfortunately became my neighbor &amp; after a year, I was forced to move far away and get a restraining order.

-his rumors and family's rumors destroyed my life and every single one of my friendships.

I have agoraphobia now. All of 2021 I refused to go outside and spent the entire year in isolation. The few times I did go outside, people I haven't talked to in years still had strong hateful reactions to seeing me.

Any attempt I made to befriend ppl in the past and these others would threaten to put them in danger just to get them to stop talking to me.

What do you even do about all this? I keep telling myself I should just live life and ignore the hate, but when EVERYONE'S become as violent as that previous ""neighbor"" of mine, it's hard. 

I don't want to be this lonely anymore. But there's literally no one left. I have no one to turn to. I'm getting life back together financially, but it doesn't feel worth it if everyone in town has fully rejected me. If these people say I'm not allowed to LIVE around here, unless I wanna risk my safety and my life... Then what the fuck do I do?

The current group chat is still pretty active and it is used on a daily basis but sometimes when I look at snap all 11 of them will be online at the same time. The group chat hasn’t been used at all today but everyone in the chat was online at the same time. This has happened multiple times already but each time I brush it off as just a coincidence. Then I saw that they all went to a friend’s house and, because there were no messages mentioning this on the chat, I came to the conclusion that they made a group chat without me. I don’t understand why they would make a chat without me and still bother to talk on the main one when I’m pretty sure that I’m the only one that isn’t in the other chat. I feel like shit right now and I don’t know what to do. I could either leave this group of friends and be a loner for the rest of my high school years or I could stay with them and act like everything’s fine. I don’t understand why they would choose to make a chat without me. Just yesterday they were texting on it but today the chat has been completely silent. When I talk to them or hang out with them all is fine, they are all really friendly and we have a good time. The whole day I’ve been thinking about this and I can’t take my mind off it.

Then I saw everyone around me have all those things just like I imagined but I stayed the same. Alone. Trying to be normal. 

I would do anything to feel anything at all right now. I just want to be held.  Oh and it looks like I’m finally pushing away the one person that cares. I was supposed to kms today but I didn’t because of him. I wish more than anything in the world that I had done it. It was the only perfect time I’m gonna get in a while."

lonely,The Answer to all your troubles,"The Answer to all your troubles - Yes, I have the answer to all our troubles.

This subreddit is so sad. So many people are lonely and want affection yet they don’t show it to their fellow lonely individuals here.

I honestly am not lonely anymore, but have been on here for a long time reading many posts, but change within myself had to come into effect before someone else could come in.

The answer to what you need is to change your diet!

Quit eating fast food, smoking, drinking, doing drugs, and do not waste your life not trying to do these things I am telling you.

I was 237 lbs! That is heavy for 5’10!

I did the KETO and “intermittent fasting” and am happier, healthier, and more good looking than I was in HIGH SCHOOL. I am 35!

What do you need to do?

I did this as the CHEAPEST AND EASY ROUTE!

2 meals a day! Yes you will save a ton of money! Quit drinking pop, beer or liquor!

I don’t cook! perfect. Buy SPINACH, Ham, Califlower, Brocholi! And eat that with a dressing (if you want… I am not eating it all plain!)

Buy OIKOS Vanilla Yogurt
Buy PREMIER PROTEIN SHAKES (Chocolate or whatever flavor you want) 

One Salad
One Yogurt
One Shake

as much water as you want!

Do that twice a day! I lost 47 lbs! in one year! I look phenomenal! And I don’t want to hear “I can’t do it. My body is not built to be thin.” YES IT IS! I was you, and now I want you to be where I am!

You can do it! Man or woman! Adult or up and comer! Fuck what other people label you as! You are special and whether you believe in God or not, we are designed (in my faith) by God to be in the Image of God. So if we can do all things through Christ, (Phillipians 4:13) then we need to act like it. Yes I sin, yes I am not perfect, but I am rooting for you! I didn’t die on a cross for you, and I am not God, but I do know science and what worked for me can work for you!

If you want to be a better person, all you have to do is trust what I am telling you. I had a friend who was there for me, and I want you to know you are made for better things than this.

Satan (the evil one) dangles drugs, mediocre sex (trust me I plowed a lot of mediocre pussy) (yes I said bible stuff and pussy in the same post), And I have had many of the devil’s opportunities, but he never delivers. He is a slot machine of mediocre sales pitches that never live up to the highs that I imagine after the sin is done. Throw the cigarettes out, dump the alcohol, subscribe to DR. BERG on youtube and follow his videos. They are short and to the point. I’m here if you want to talk."

lonely,I don’t feel connected to anyone,"I don’t feel connected to anyone - I’ve always been kinda lonely and not had many friends. Sometimes I get so sick of trying to make friends because it seems no one cares about anything genuine. Although I try to have the mindset that if you are a human being and a decent one at best, I will gladly talk to you and try to connect with you. But most people I have tried to talk to feel so fake. Either they care way too much about what others think of them or they seem to only care about themselves.
Although I understand humans are flawed and we can all have moments like this, I find it so irritating sometimes. Most likely because I so desperately crave to have a friend that is looking for a deep connection, which most people my age (17-18) don’t seem to care for. I just feel like I’m too mature for my age group.. but I can’t be the only one who feels this way.

lonely,How can I be socially apt and likeable?,"How can I be socially apt and likeable? - I am one of the boring people you know. I am generally very nice and helpful to people (not gender specific, I swear I am not one of the nice guys). I do have people who I know but I don't have any friends. I have reached at the point I sometimes cry out of loneliness. 

I have been mistreated by many so called friends in the past, even after I didn't do anything wrong. I was diagnosed with depression few years ago, and I was taking medicines and therapy but had to discontinue due to some issues in family.

At this point, I doubt myself that am I even worthy of Love and friendship? There was this one colleague at my workplace who I was once talking to, and I casually mentioned about an another girl that she's hot and I should ask her out. She laughed obnoxiously at my face and said have you looked at yourself, she is totally outta your league. Needless to say, I was hurt even though I'm not sure if she was joking. I know that because of my low self-esteem, I would never have dared to ask her out, but that bluntness hurt me. 

I tend to overwork on weekdays and rarely leave my room (Currently Work from home going since last 2 years). I dread weekends because I don't have anything to do then and I often cry on weekends.

I don't know what should I do.

I wish I could just find somebody who actually wants me. I'm not a pervert I'm quite conservative and careful actually. But idk I think some men are just destined for this and I was unlucky. My last chance probably ended today because she lost interest. It's about to be valentine's day and Im going to get so high I forget I'm even on earth cuz it's gonna be rough seeing everybody else be loved. And just be lonely and cold.

lonely,"Oh man, this sub is depressing","Oh man, this sub is depressing - Yeah yeah, I know. What should I expect right? Honestly, I had to look away a few times from these posts. All those dark 13 years of my life dealing with severe depression, really bad social anxiety, and non-existent self esteem came flooding back. I was also suicidal, but tried to hide it as much as possible. A void in my life that I'll never get back, from 14 to 27 years of age. Most of my youth, now gone. At 27 years old, I was filled with a terrible fear and dread that I can hardly describe. Now that I had recovered from depression, what the hell do I do now? 'What now?' was the real question. I was aimless at that moment and full of fear.

A few years later, I'm finally making some real progress after working some shitty job I absolutely hated to my bones. The stress at that job was unbelievable. I used to have strange numbing sensations on the left side of my neck. It felt like I was gonna have a stroke and the anger made it worse. Now, thankfully, I'm working towards a career in tech, so there's some light of positivity in my life. Still, I've been cripplingly lonely for years and do have bouts of self-loathing, so I do belong here haha. It's so strange to me though, being so lonely to the point of insanity but not having depression anymore. I've been lonely for so long, my body is numb to the pain sometimes. The loneliness is eating away at my mind while I sacrifice and study.

The loneliness becomes almost unbearable some days that I can hardly stand it. I don't plan to give up though, I've sacrificed way too much to throw it all away. FUUUUCK THAT SHIT. No fucking way am I throwing all my hard work away. I've met some lazy, entitled coworkers and shit managers after I had recovered from my depression. And I used to think I was lazy and worthless all those years ago during my depression phase.Those losers can fuck off and die for all I care. Getting promotions they didn't deserve. Entitled pieces of shit, rarely or never helping others. They are lazy, entitled garbage who I will surpass and be more successful than they are. The more I think about those assholes, the more determined I am to succeed.

I've already been sad for years in the past and achieved little. I'd much rather be angry and determined instead. I NEVER want to feel humiliated at work again and I never want to feel helpless again. Fuck that shit. Is it healthy to be like this? No, of course not. I'm not blind and I'll deal with my frustrations at a later time. Right now, all I want is a career and the deliverance it will bring. I'm so fucking tired of struggling and being financially insecure. Just one more fucking mountain to climb..."

I'd appreciate that and I would make every moment spent together worth it. But, no one wants me like that. No one wants my physical comfort. No one wants my emotional comfort. No one wants _me_ and what I have to give. No one wants me. And I'm sad about that.

About Me: 
Whenever someone asks how I'm doing, I usually lie and say 'good', even though I am doing fan fucking fantastic. I guess that's a bit cocky, eh? I may appear arrogant and unattainable. That's because I am :P 
But I'm also a hopeless romantic who believes that passionate love can be like a shooting star. 

I don't know everything, but here are a few observations I've come to in my life: 
* If you're not dead to one person, you're not living right. 
* Most hot girls will never know if they are actually interesting or not. 
* Money can't buy happiness but it solves 95% of problems that make you unhappy.

I am in university. I am a firefighter. I love leather jackets."

I’m just tired of revealing bits of myself (which is hard for me anyways) for it to fall on deaf ears because of what these people expect from me. 

Is it unreasonable for me to expect people of the opposite gender to approach me without ulterior motives, or is it just past trauma making me second guess everyone’s motives…?"

lonely,Recovery Loneliness,"Recovery Loneliness - (M18) I’ve been on the sofa or in hospital for 11 weeks now battling pericarditis post-covid. All my friends are at University having the time of their lives like I should be and when they all came home for Christmas I couldn’t see them because I’m a vulnerable person. I’m stuck at home, with the only people I see being my mum and on the weekends my dad. I am keeping in touch with my friends but I’m having more frequent feelings of loneliness. I also think I’m loosing out on personal development since by the time I’m better I will have been robbed of so many months of the prime of my life. I’m well aware that many people, particularly on this subreddit, have it worse than me but it’s to the point where I feel I need to get this off my chest. Any advice or comforting words would be really appreciated."

lonely,I've begun to feel jealous of people with friends.,"I've begun to feel jealous of people with friends. - I'm 19M. Before 18 I didn't really think about friends, I had them, but I never really ""cared"" if you know what I mean, I enjoyed my own company. I had 2 or 3 friends when I was 18, one I used to smoke weed with but stopped hanging around because I didn't want to smoke anymore, one that I could tell everything to, but overdosed. And one that I met at the pub. I've still been meeting the one friend at the pub a few times, but I feel like he has so many friends that I'm just one, I'm not really his ""friend"" anymore, more someone that used to be his friend.

&amp;#x200B;

After 18, I began to go out with my friend who I go to the pub with sometimes, but I only went sometimes, but I enjoyed going out, the only thing is I rely on my friend. If he's not available, if he got too drunk and has a bad hangover, what can I do? I ask him beforehand if he's available on the weekend, and he goes out the night before instead, with his real friends. So, I began to feel jealous.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't met my friend since New Year's Eve, and we didn't fall out, but he kept saying he couldn't meet. Now recently I've started to feel really weird when I see people enjoying themselves with friends, anyone, people I don't even know. I feel on the verge of a breakdown, and I don't even know what a breakdown feels like. My heart feels unhealthy, weak, and broken but broken because of myself. My confidence has deteriorated, I feel like a loser, a weirdo. I'm not even a socially awkward person, I just feel like people aren't wanting to speak to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope something can change because I shouldn't be feeling like this. I've changed as a person, I'm a good person and I know good people probably shouldn't say that at all, but in terms of sympathy, I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, I even reached out to a God I don't believe, I do good things and get nothing back. What is the point? My heart is in the right place."

I would just really want to discuss the meaning of everything and the loneliness with its anxiety altogether to improve upon ourselves or get more attunement with acceptance of the things which we cannot change. It would be great to go into things deeply and seriously while keeping a light positive atmosphere and room for humor and casual talk."

lonely,I feel like im living in a world by myself,"I feel like im living in a world by myself - This might be long so i apologize. 

Wanted to post on here to get some things off my chest. I dont feel like anyone in my life currently would understand or take me seriously, even though i do have some people in my life who care its just going to either make things awkward, set off alarm bells, or worst of all i will be blown off and told im overthinking. Venting into the internet void seems like the better option. 

I feel lonely and despite that keep pushing people away, i don't take chances when i should and fear rejection more than loneliness. I see the years passing by and realize i may have missed my chance. At this point people have accepted the status quo and i am a known quantity. 

I guess i should start at the beginning, there's a lot of things that have worked against me in my life and despite that i have done well for myself, in my opinion at least. I was born with congenital heart defects and had open heart surgery when i was four, im lucky in that i remember very little from those times and the doctors say im doing well considering all that. 

Im lucky, but i dont feel lucky. Growing up with all of that on my mind and into adulthood is stressful and my parents though i do love them always downplayed my fears. Shits scary, and yea its bad to sit and think on it but when your bored and the mind wanders it tends to go that way. Nowadays im still doing ok but supposedly my heart is damaging my liver and obviously that is fucking bad. Again though its a weird waiting game because the doctors have no idea how long it will last, could be 20 years, but its like i have a clock over my head counting down with each passing year. Transplant likely mean a heart and liver when i do get that bad. They dont really talk about it because its likely years down the line.

All that along with a tough time in school growing up has left me super-introverted and makes me hard to get out of my shell. I never really dated and have no real close friends anymore after slowly crawling deeper and deeper into my hole. I need to open up more but living in a rural area and not having many close friends has made that near impossible. Work runs yea down and when you do have time its hard to be social, and in a rural setting its hard to meet people outside bars or people you already know. It could be worse though, i do have enough common-sense to try and better myself even if i have to have a panic attack to push me over the edge. 

Every once in a while i take a small leap forward when this shit really starts to scare me, a few years ago when i turned 30 i realized if i didn't get out of my parents soon i was defiantly done for. My parents are good to me but they hate each other so i fucking hated living there but again leaving scared the shit out of me. Eventually though my anxiety pushed me over the edge and I found the cheapest apartment i could and even though i lived in solitude the freedom of my own place was the best feeling in the world. 

Then in September of last year i bought my first house and love it, i worked so hard to get it and that rural area that has been so bad for my social life repaid me in kind with a house i can afford that i really like and coupled with the current low interest rates im trying to pay that off ASAP. I feel lucky to have my own home when so many people cant afford the crazy prices right now. Its not all bad. 

Despite that though i still have trouble pushing myself into a actual relationship. I know im a decent person but i feel like i come with too much baggage and how do you even explain all this to someone? It seems unfair to even get into a relationship when my life seems so uncertain, and yes i know all our lifes could end at any time but its more complicated then normal. Will my health prevent me from working? When will things get worse? Do i have the self confidence to even have a real relationship or even close friends at this point? I guess i have too many question and no good answers. Im doing good but feel like the clock is ticking again. 

Going to stop there as i risk repeating myself, if you read all this i appreciate it. Felt good to type it out even if it doesn't help in the long run. Im not much of a writer and my grammar sucks so sorry for the crap english! Have a good one!"

lonely,I feel awkward around everyone,"I feel awkward around everyone - I’m in a situation where I feel like I’ve always been an outcast. I’m an ethnic minority that grew up mainly around white kids. I’m an only child and only really have my mum as family so was alone a lot as a child. I had quite a visible disability up until I was 14/15. I had surgery to correct it but I feel like this still impacts how I interact with people because for the majority of my childhood I knew people saw my disability before they saw me and would either avoid me or speak to me out of pity. I also missed three years of secondary school for the surgery.

So I came to another city for university and became aware pretty quickly that I was one of the only working class people in pretty much every circle I’ve found myself in. 

I try to be social but I just find it very uncomfortable the majority of the time and feel like all of the above contribute to this. 

This is even causing issues in my relationship because my boyfriend thinks I don’t like his family because I’m often really quiet when we’re at family events even though I’m trying my best to be as social as possible and I’m pretty sure it’s becoming a dealbreaker for him. I just feel like there’s this distance because out lives are vastly different.

I haven’t always thought this was the case I just thought I was shy and needed to come out of my shell and have tried to get myself to do this so many times in the past. I have tried therapy for social anxiety and after completing the whole course at one point I still just can’t seem to shake that awkward feeling around people. I don’t think it helps that I’m naturally introverted as well.

I’ve thought about moving cities to try and start over because maybe I’m just not around the right people but part of me just feels like all the qualities that make me up as a person are so different from everyone/the majority of people. So do I just need to try to working on maintaining these relationships even with the awkwardness? Or should I move on and try and find my place somewhere else?"

lonely,I feel so out of place.,"I feel so out of place. - 30F here. My feelings of lonelyness seem to appear in waves. Sometimes I hardly feel it, sometimes it hits me like a bag of bricks. I'm a nurse and they just lifted quite a few covid lockdown restrictions. I see how everyone is very excited and I am... Just so very tired. I don't have much friends to do things with. I have a boyfriend who's busy doing his own thing. I have a childhood friend who's busy being a mom. I have a handful of acquaintances but I don't really feel connected with them. Before covid I had quite a few years of being depressed. I had emdr and therapy and got on meds. I was just starting to make get a social life when covid happened.
I always worked in nursing homes but made the switch to the hospital last year as that was my dream. I started at a lung ward and when they accepted me, they said I probably wouldn't have to work at the covid ward. Sadly, after two weeks, I started taking care of post ICU covid patients and worked shifts at a non invasive breathing assistance unit.
Because of my job, I've lost contact with a lot of people that I wanted to become friends with. Most said they didn't believe in covid, that it was a flu, etc, while I was taking care of people dying. I will never forget rushing a little kid out of his room while his dad had to be reanimated. I am so bitter. Cynical. People complaining about masks while I was dressed during the summer in full PPe gear sweating buckets. 
I feel a disconnect from my coworkers. They all started at the covid ward together and have been friends for a long time. They didn't invite me to a few events and talk about group chats that I am not in. I'm not a typical girl, I'm childfree by choice and can't talk mom business. I do think I do my job well and I try to put myself out there.
I recently started working out too but it's evenings like these, exhausted from working, crying about little things, that really get to me."

Today he cancelled his appointment tomorrow and is basically unresponsive. I feel so upset and misled, and can't for the life of me figure out what I did wrong. We also agreed at the beginning of this that if it wasn't working for either one of us, we'd be upfront and honest.

Used to think, maybe a time when i would be more mature, I would be able to handle all this. My shyness increased through college and so did anxiety. Now will the pandemic and everything, i think my major years where people socialise are gone. I don't know, I am working on myself, going to gym, reading but you know when you see people your age in relationships, partying, having kids for that matter, for me i'm just stagnant.

lonely,I'm lost and alone. It's just a rant.,"I'm lost and alone. It's just a rant. -  Hi, Hi 

It’s been a while since I’ve been here. Almost a year... what a year. Started with covid, lost a month of my life to it. Then went straight to workaholic work - nice 300h/month, over time not paid... ended up below minimal hourly wage in my country (yay me!). Then they’ve fired me without a word... went to company base for some shit and get ppl to my site. 

Was greated by HR with termination letter on wednsday with mandatory days off to take so friday was my last day of work. Then boss didn’t pay me over half of delegation fees, but oh well. I’ve got home that last day and drunkedly procastinated weekend. 

Luckly my job hunt lasted less than, a week. Got like +1/3 salary and after 3 months with extension after “trial” time another +16% raise. So after 3 months of getting fired I’m at +55% $$, less work time and some nice benefits! Just when I’ve got that sorted out... 

I’ve got letter from uni that I’m getting kicked out again. For not putting up thesis on time... and it’s final this time. I’ve appealed, it got rejected. Appealed again, last possible time. It went throught! Dean gave me deadline on 24th that I have to put up thesis by 30th or get approval on paper from supervising doc that he’ll accept it. I’ve read that mail on 27th ;( Got approval mail from doc by 30th... at 23:14. Redirected that to Dean 10min later. Next day Dean accepted and gave some conditions to allow me to finish! 24th January was THE DAY - thesis defence with 3question exam! aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand I’ve passed! Now I don’t know what to do.

 Last thing that was weighing me is gone. 

But what now?! 

Work is left. My ‘hobbies’ are glorified procastination acctivites.

Idk I just wanted to rant. or seek guide or something.  If you are still here, I wish you all the best.

I have trouble making good friends. I can talk to pretty much anyone, but when it comes to finding people that I actually connect with, it is really difficult. I want to meet more people and make more friends or meet someone special, but it is difficult. Tinder, Bumble and OkCupid does not help me. I have tried so many things, but it seems I am just stuck.

lonely,"Excluded by classmates and a teacher, I hate my ""gifted"" mind.","Excluded by classmates and a teacher, I hate my ""gifted"" mind. - Hello. Just to clarify: I'm not here to smugly cry about hating being academically gifted, I'm here to cry about why that's the only thing I'm good at and ""gets me 0 bitches"" or friends.

So, when I () was younger, around 15, I graduated highschool and decided to re-join again last year September. This is because my highschool experience was absolutely horrible. I was an alcoholic/substance-abuser, and I went through gross amount of sexual trauma. My grades also made no sense in combination with the subjects I chose, so... I decided that going backwards would actually be a step forward for me. I'm three years sober.

Anyway, I improved a LOT. My overall average seems to stick between 94%-100%, and I think I'm pretty smart, but not smart enough to warrant the reactions I'm getting at school by my classmates. Mind you, I had NEVER focused in my previous highschool, so everything I'm learning is relatively new. If I'm not being asked for academic advice, to help someone cheat or getting copious amount of hostile praise for my work, I'm literally just sitting all alone, doing nothing or scrolling through my phone. At first, it didn't bother me much because I am a new student, but after a while, I began to notice that even my Maths teacher intentionally avoided allowing me to participate in class activities, and is beginning to get more hostile or dismissive with my participation, though she always is KIND to everybody and goes on &amp; on about how much she loves our class. It took me a while to notice that when she says ""class,"" she means everyone but me. I've loved her as a teacher, and I don't believe I ever over-stepped any boundaries with anybody in this school to cause this reaction. I am not arrogant. I humble myself to the extent that it begins to pain my pride, and I don't talk about things that clash with our culture here. I keep up with social media and celebrity drama. I listen to some pop music. I dress like everyone else. I am not too proper, and I am not too slant. This has caused me to feel like that something is severely wrong with me, like I am fucked up or give ""school shooter"" vibes, when I know myself that I am perfectly fine, and I am actually an incredible fuckin' catch. My self-esteem is not in ruins... yet. The only weird thing about me is that I am an articulate English speaker, and in school, I get so anxious that I speak very formally, but I'm trying to break that down and introduce some more slang or my first language or whatever.

So why do I feel so extremely lonely? What can I do to battle this? I feel like the more I put my heart into my projects and presentations, the more it pushes everybody away. I feel like a pushover. In my fifth week of school, some kid spread a rumor about me, saying that I took a pregnancy test at the toilet (I obviously did NOT) and they based their argument on the fact that I'm 18. In one breath, this is hilarious, and in another, this just makes me want to disappear. It keeps me up at night."
lonely,Loneliness has finally beaten me,"Loneliness has finally beaten me - I'm 30 years old. I fit the neckbeard redditor stereotype to a T. Fat, ugly, pseudo-intellectual with below-average IQ, quick to anger, emotional and unpredictable, unempathetic and cruel, the list goes on. I truly don't have a positive trait in my body. I'm too analytical, not at all creative, and I have 0 social skills. I have no friends. All I do all day, every day, is either work, or play video games. That's it.  

The only thing that I've ever wanted was a relationship, but I've never had a romantic relationship or even so much as a single woman interested in me in my entire life. I haven't had even a single match in online dating in almost 8 years. And why should I? Like I said, I have 0 positive traits. And unlike most human beings, my worst quality by far is that I am incapable of change.  

Medications and psychedelics don't do anything for me, and therapy doesn't work on me. If I'm not instantly good at something I lose all interest in it, and as a result I have no interest in any hobby I've ever tried (and I've tried a ton - 10 years of 0 friends and lots of free time will do that to you).  

So now, after trying everything every doctor, psychiatrist, therapist, counselor, and redditor has told me to try, I'm left with a choice. Either live this miserable ""life"" (if you can call it that) until I die naturally, alone and unloved, or end it early. That's not really a choice, though. The real choice is ""how early."" Right now, that's looking like a matter of a day or two. But no one cares, and no one should. Just one less bitter, lonely, cynical asshole redditor to deal with in your daily lives."

Always have to be an edge, always have to win, need to earn fast, take care of responsibilities, sacrifice personal goals for the sake of family (Eastern thing, west is more individualistic). On the contrary I see some women around me living the life they want, their money is their's to spend, they travel as they want, get fan following on Instagram, be in &amp; out of relationship as they wish.

I failed early in life to settle down fast, then there were family issues to take care of, it crippled my confidence, changed my world view forever, I don't find anything interesting these days, my life just revolves around earning, paying bills, single child, taking care of mother &amp; tolerate my father. I drink &amp; smoke once in while enough to not go insane, but now loneliness is slowly getting to me, it has started to affect my decisions, my ambition, my desire to work properly. For past couple of years I tried, I tried to improve things, to work on myself, switched jobs to earn better, but that has also led to some precarious situation, not going in that details. I have trouble waking up, don't have the will to go on like this. Can't take long break, can't start fresh somewhere else, I am not dateble anymore, I was already ugly, average, genes were not on my side, I have become this boring depressed hopeless person, un dateble, I tried once, gave it a shot, but girl had some gut feeling and backed out, I think it was fair, better for her. Now I don't think about it anyway, I never really wanted kids anyway, I don't wanna pass on my genes, so fine.. marriage always leads in that direction, so no point in pursuing it.

If not that life, &amp; not adventures life, no fun in life, feeling trapped even when I earn money, then what's the point of all this? I think it would be good bye once my mother is no more, but it's years away, hope I brain don't go berserk till then, it runs in the family."

The ones who did seem interested all eventually lost interest. I don’t know for sure why.

Is it something about my personality that makes people turned off? Is it something about my behaviors? Anyways the bottom line is of the matter is:

1. I strongly desire friendships and relationships 

2. Despite my best efforts I am unable to acquire friendships/relationships 

3. People generally don’t seem interested in me

4. The people who have shown interest in the past all eventually stopped talking to me. 

Now I have seen people who have many fulfilling friendships and relationships so it makes me feel like I’m abnormal. Realistically are people like me uncommon?"

lonely,please help. parents unsupportive while I'm financially making my own decisions.,"please help. parents unsupportive while I'm financially making my own decisions. - Hi everyone. I am going through a tough time with my parents right now and if anyone has any guidance and support, I would greatly appreciate it.

I am 22 for reference. I am finishing my final semester of my undergraduate degree, and I am currently in the graduate application stage. I have a full ride (plus a 20k additional scholarship) to my current program, and I work 4 jobs while making almost $2k a month on my own. While not being fully financially independent yet (I don't pay for health, car insurance, etc). I have a full time job offer set up for next year, so I will be making more by that time. I have not asked or needed money from my parents in a long time. I study two areas and I am trying to do my absolute best to make accomplishments and please them.

But it never has been enough. Every time I bring up going out of state, it ends in them yelling at me and saying that I am selfish and only think for myself. They are very over protective of me. I currently live 3 hours away from them for college (in-state) and that was a huge stretch for them. My mom recently told me that if it was up to her, I'd be commuting at home with a closer college.

My field of study that I prefer requires for me to travel many places and be independent, which is something I told them 4 years ago before starting my undergraduate degree. And either way, no matter what field of study I choose to work in, I have been passionate about moving something new for my own career and life choice.

I recently got into a bad car accident which totaled my car (not my fault) and my parents are using that as an incentive for me not to travel out of state, because if something like that were to happen they wouldn't be there to help. The thing is, I handled the insurance myself and also took care of everything with my car. The insurance company even messed up some information and I got it fixed when my dad couldn't, and in return he just yelled at me for taking matters into my own hands.

Right now my parents are approaching my grad school dream as a ""if THEY approve of it"" outlook. They only seem to support me if I want to stay in my home city. Tonight I was told that if I don't get free tuition, they won't ""let me"" go and they also won't let me take a gap year to work for it again. There is 30k in college savings funds that I didn't need for my undergrad since I got a full ride that I currently have. Even so, I offered to fully take out loans and pay for everything myself. Even if I wanted to stay local, it would never be enough for them. I would never make them fully happy.

I have hit a very stressful bump in the road. I don't know what to do or think anymore, and I feel incredibly unmotivated due to the stress the situation is causing me. I REALLY want to move out and be on my own, and I know I can do it. I get told I'm selfish every single day, and I'm so scared right now about my future. My friends, teachers, and colleagues have been highly encouraging, saying that this is my decision and I should not hold back. But while my parents say otherwise everyday and that they can decide my future, I have thoughts in my head now telling me that.

If my parents say no to graduate school, can I still take out my own loans, commit to the school, and go?"
lonely,"A bad day, everyday","A bad day, everyday -  and have been alone for quite a while, I have a few friends that I don't see much anymore (I am very grateful for though), but I have never had anything close to a relationship.


A few months I started college and slowly realised that I didn't have any friends with me. I spend everyday alone, most days not 1 word is said to me. I thought I could handle independence and didn't mind this, however the other day my headphones broke and I realized how alone I was. The music was just a facade that blemished an overwhelming void of loneliness, that nearly brought me to tears.

I was surrounded by people at my high school that I considered friends, but I now realise that I meant nothing to any of them. I was just used to laugh at and pick on, i've only realised recently, that it wasn't banter and I just used to let them walk all over me, unknowly. None of them speak to me anymore.

I see couples walk past - holding hands and leaning on each other. I want to feel happy for them, but that is overshadowed by jealousy, guilt and self hatred; I can't help but feel like they are showing off and rubbing it in my face, like they know how much it pains me to see. But they don't.

I'm not suicidal, but everyday keeps on getting harder and harder. I know it's my fault that I'm alone but I don't have the confidence to speak up to anyone and the few times I do, I feel like I get laughed off. I'm stuck in this cycle of lack of self esteem, rejection and guilt. Forever forced to run on this treadmill of shame.

I've been bottling this for a while as I don't think I deserve this pitty, so many more people live harder lives and I'm whining about not having enough attention, anyways...

Thank you if you read all of that"

lonely,Why can’t it just be easy for me?,"Why can’t it just be easy for me? - It’s so easy everyone else. For them to make connections and put themselves out there. They barely even think twice about it. They don’t deal with the constant embarrassment of just existing as the person that I am. They don’t hate themselves like I do. They aren’t absolutely ashamed of the way they look like I am. 

When I hang out with my friends it reminds me why people don’t give a single fuck about me. People like my friends because they’re not ugly and they’re not awkward. They’re attractive and confident and sociable. 

I’m the opposite. My face is shitty, my mannerisms are strange, I have trouble just participating in conversations, I have nothing interesting or important to say about anything. It’s obvious why nobody bothers with me, I don’t blame them, but to be the one that has nobody and has never truly had anyone because of a defective existence is too hard.

Lonely is putting it lightly. This reprehension of myself and seeming disregard by everyone else has left me a complete shell of a person. I don’t know what to do. I want to give up."

lonely,I want to see what happens with this.,"I want to see what happens with this. - Hello all. I am 20F. I am dealing with self hatred. It started in middle school. I got bullied a lot for my weight and appearance. Because of this I was suicidal and angry as a teenager. I had friends in middle school, but I would reach out to them and tell them what I was feeling and they told me to stop and just kill myself because they didn’t care. After that I stopped taking my problems to them. Still getting bullied, I isolated myself because it was safer. I left the school eventually because I couldn’t take it anymore. The first year at the new school was amazing. The change felt needed. I met a friend on my second day, she was cool. She was the first person in four years to be nice to me other than family. She help me meet a lot of people but I don’t know how to react to people being nice to me. It just makes me uncomfortable. Skip to 11th grade. The friend got kicked out of the school for having sex with students and I was alone for a while but I eventually made friends again. That year the school was being shut down, teachers weren’t getting paid, and everyone was unhappy and there was a lot of racial tension. I’m black by the way so it’s just uncomfortable all the time for me. My depression got out of control being there and I began to isolate, lash out, and didn’t show up to school. Because of that, I lost a lot of friends. I had unhealed problems coming back and I didn’t know how to deal with him and how to stop it. I hated myself for it. I hate myself for what I did to people. I hate myself for not trying harder to push back my problems and fake it. I would have friends around me if I faked it. At home, my mother was getting abused by my Half sisters father. My mother also has an immune disease that causes her body to attack itself. This is usually aggravated by stress so I never bothered to tell her much was going on. So I had to help her but I didn’t want her to help me. My mother also has depression from when my father died and also childhood trauma that she is getting through with the therapist today. I don’t want to burden her. After all of this, I have a lot of self hatred. I hate the way I look. I hate to think about my body. I hate that I want to be with friends but I don’t think I deserve them. The reason I’m still alive is that I love helping people. I love walking the elderly to their car after grocery shopping. I love helping kids with their homework. I think I would even pull someone out of a burning car . Helping people is the only reason why I am alive. It just keeps me going I’ll always have somebody to help. And my mother. If I killed myself, that would be the most selfish thing I could ever do to my mother. She tells me I’m worth it but I don’t believe her. She reminds me of all the amazing things I’ve done for people but I just shrug it off. I want to love myself but I don’t know where to begin and why I should. If I go to a therapist which I have recently, all they told me was to get out side and do things that I like. But it feels like I’m wasting my time. Right now, I am a college student. I do things online because I’m afraid of going to school and looking and feeling like this. But I also want to do some thing for the community because I’ve never been part of a community.

Do you guys have any tips? 

Sorry that this is long"

lonely,Sometimes I just straight up don’t wanna live,"Sometimes I just straight up don’t wanna live - I don’t have any close friends. I rarely go out. Dating and Relationships feel dull after a fucking week. I’m not living, I’m just scraping by. It’s so bad to the point where I get jealous over my gf because she goes out and I don’t. I’m 16 and I feel like my youth is slipping between my fucking fingers like sand. Everything felt so new, fresh, and fulfilling in middle school, but now I rarely go out and hardly talk to people outside of school so life’s just fucking dull. I wasn’t meant to live like this, I was meant to run around outside, skateboard, talk with my friends in an empty parking lot at 10:00 at night, or enjoy the outdoors during the day, not wallowing in my sea of sorrow. I’m not fulfilled and I don’t know how to fill that void in my chest."

lonely,i dont know.,"i dont know. - Im turning 18 in two weeks. I feel like the peak of my life has passed and everything will only go downhill from now on. I have one friend who I am afraid to talk to who will never love me as much as I love them, and besides them, I haven't had any other friends sich I was 13.   


I've been dealing with suicide ideation literally my whole life. I am incredibly, dangerously lonely and I don't know how to fix it. Online friendships have always been an easy gateway for me, but recently its been hard to make online friends. I don't know what it is about me that makes me so unlikable for others and I feel as if I should just end it. I don't think that I'm ugly or boring, other people are just naturally against me.

lonely,I don't know if anyone else feel like that too...,"I don't know if anyone else feel like that too... - I'm actually trying to learn to live with the fact that I am at a time of my life that I am experiencing loneliness on a regular basis although I still got friends and see them frequently. 

I just don´t feel connected to anyone of them anymore. I don't know what is happening. I'm getting scared tbh, I feel like I can't trust my friends, that I'm not really their friends and at the end of the day I'm just lonely and by myself. I feel that this can be my depression (that I am already treating) putting thoughts like that in my head, I'm not  sure if the questions I am bringing up to myself are valid on a rational basis or just paranoia. It feels weird, I do not feel safe sometimes, I feel the need to isolate myself. 

I'm also experiencing a strong loss of my identity, sometimes I really don't know who I am anymore.

All of these is getting really weird, I have on fucking idea what is happening. All started gradually after iniitating an antidepressant. It worked pretty well and maybe now I'm experiencing a drastic change in how I see the world and in how I behave around people, how other perceive me etc. Maybe it's not a problem, just a transformation of myself.

Maybe this is an opportunity for me to handle loneliness by myself, to learn how to be ok with being by myself."

lonely,Forgotten..,"Forgotten.. - It took me a while to start writing this, but today my internal pain grew much stronger, I need to vent at least a little bit altrough I usually hide everything inside..

When I was 20 yo, I had quite a lot of friends, some of them were my childhood friends and we were hanging out together for years. Altrough I wasn't a party-type guy, I enjoyed little house parties, hangouts in house of one of us, local pubs, going to cinema, etc. Typical things that young adults usually do. 

Then I met my wife, Aleksandra (We're from Poland BTW). We were dating for about year, and got married. Well, typical couple: we had some bad moments and good moments, but we stayed nearly always together, and we're still together.

Problems started when our first kid was born. As a fresh father, I couldn't spend that much time with friends. I always tried to divide my time between my new family, work and social life. Well, I tried, that's a key word. Time passed and my friends slowly stopped inviting me, messaging me, even responding to my messages. Through all this time, more and more friends forgot about me, just like I've become someone not worth hanging out with, because I had some important responsibilities.

And here we are. Now I'm 29 yo, I'll be 30 in the middle of december, and I have no one to talk, no one to meet with or even drink one fkn beer with. The only person that's still with me is my wife. Now I have problems with meeting anyone new, I gained some weight so people tend to avert their eyes when I try to talk to them, I think I got some kind of heavy depression cause sometimes my mood goes straight down below ground and I tend to cry a lot when it happens (just to remind, 29M - that must look pretty lame). I'm just overwhelmed by all my bad thoughts, my sad memories, my social loneliness - I'm trying to endure everything and stay strong when needed (I was even able to deliver my 4th baby when it was too late for my wife to get to the hospital, don't ask how I managed to do that without any help) but all of this feelings and memories that accumulated through years, it's starting to seriously damage my heart and head. Even to the point of getting physical pain in my chest when I'm so down..

I'm starting to lose against my loneliness, I miss my friends, I wish I could see them again, I wish I could meet someone new, I don't know how what to do, I feel like I have no strenght to do it, nor confidence or determination.. the other thing is, I have to work a lot to provide my family safety, food and everything that they need, so It's hard for me to take some time for myself, for regaining my social life. My wife is studying at weekends on medical university in Warsaw, 200km from our home, so I have to keep an eye for our kids. We got no one to stay with them, so I could go out sometimes. My wife's mom lives quite far away feom our home, and my parents...ehh, nevermind. They're too lazy to do it, always making excuses..

I don't know if anyone will understand my story a little..
Maybe someone will laugh at me, and it won't be a first time, but as I said, I had to let some off me..

This evening is terrible, and I'm criying again.."

lonely,I'm feeling strange,"I'm feeling strange - I'm 26 yo and I found myself in a weird situation. Because I've been craving romantic love for a long time and miss the chance to know someone, go to dates and slowly evolve step by step. I only go to work, then home and everything begins on the next day. I've been introvert in my whole life, so it's not new. I don't meet new people and I don't find anyone in the near I feel attracted to and see something in them.
I know a girl a few minutes away from work, we even meet sometimes because their place belongs to us a bit and we can meet sometimes. She's a few years older than me.

It's interesting because she's not my type but I can't avoid thinking on her in the last 1-2 weeks.
I may even find her more attractive how time goes. I basically like her style and she seems kind, smart and she's honestly way better than my past crush who was not this good. I mean I feel her a better person. I even said when I was in love with my crush she seemed like a bad person, althought I loved her but I used my heart to see the real person. But this girl seems much greater, that's why I like to be around her.

Lately, I visited her place often like 5-6 times. I had to go there for the first 2-3 times but I intentionally visited the place since then. Even her colleague said I recently go there quite much. Her other colleague told me that who I meet everytime there and we know each other since I started working here a few years ago...
She makes comments about it nowadays like today I was there and the girl was away. She said ""admit it, you thought she was gonna be here"". Or when she gave me some cookies she cooked at home the previous day. She didn't know if I was gonna go there or which day but I hit the day when she had homemade cookies at work and I ate some. And I told her colleague she didn't know that I wanted to go there, so she didn't cooked them for that. She said there are no accidents. Or how to say... everything happens for a reason.
There are lots of comments by her like these and I think she sees more in this thing than it really has.

I'm sure this happens because I'm lonely and I didn't want anything serious because I got enough bad in the past and I was praying for not getting into trouble again."

lonely,Slowly losing my friends...help,"Slowly losing my friends...help - Hello guys. Im 16 years old, have had the same friend group for about three years, we were very close, would do ANYTHING together but the group is slowly falling apart. It all started from a fight I had with one of them, at first it wasn't anything too bad but eventually it got worse and worse until we just stopped talking to each other. A few of weeks ago we ""solved"" the argument and decided to just move on and forgive eachother.
The thing is: in the meanwhile the fighting and all ruined the friend group and slowly some people created a smaller group and others got left out. I was one of those who got left out. I thought that once we had sorted things out it would have gotten better but it didn't. 
Now we just text very sporadically and see eachother just on the weekends and tbh I don't even have fun like I used to. My therapist suggested me to keep seeing them even if it's not as I want it to be, because it's better than completely isolating myself. 
Honestly yeah, it's definitely better, but I still feel alone. I don't have anyone to talk to about the random stuff that happens to me, I dont have anyone I can text when I feel sad and need someone to vent to, I don't feel close to anyone anymore and sometimes I wish I could just disappear. I dont know what to, I wish I could find new friends but I'm just so shy and it's hard for me. I'm so scared ill remain completely alone."

lonely,Trans guy losing hope of making any friends,"Trans guy losing hope of making any friends - I’m a 21 year old guy from the UK, and it’s sad to admit, but I don’t have any friends. I’ve never exactly had the best record when it comes to friendships. I can’t say I’ve ever had a best friend, or even a close friend. I’m becoming really lonely but I’m struggling to make any new friends. I moved to a new city in September last year and I hoped things would get better. I come from a small rural place, so I thought there would be plenty of opportunities to make friends, but I’ve had no luck yet.

So I’m a trans guy, meaning I was born a female but identify as male. It’s definitely not something I go around shouting about, but it’s something that really holds me back, and is part of the reason I seem to have problems making friends. In terms of my appearance, I look like a guy, but as soon as I open my mouth, my voice is so high, and it just gives it away. Even though I look like a guy from my appearance, I look way younger than most guys my age. I can’t transition yet due to family issues so I’m just stuck in this awkward in between. I feel uncomfortable around my family because I don’t feel they care about me if I’m being who I am. For the family members who’d don’t know I’m trans, I doubt they will want to associate with me when they do find out. Yes, I know I’m 21, and I can technically do what I like, but it’s not as easy as that when I’m financially dependent on them. As a result of all this, I have absolutely zero confidence, and I’m finding it more and more difficult to leave the house. I’ve always been shy and introverted so this doesn’t help.

I don’t really seem to fit in with LGBT people or non-LGBT people. A lot of LGBT people I have met were very vocal about their identity and were somewhere on the gender spectrum, rather than the binary male or female with how they identified. I by no means have a problem with that, but I’m someone who just wants to get on with life as a guy and be able to fit in with people. I guess the problem is that other people like me might not necessarily hang out in specific LGBT spaces. I did end up going to a trans youth group in the city which was both a blessing and a curse. It was cool to meet other people like me, but they’ve all been able to transition and get on with their lives, while I’m just stuck. I found it hard to socialise with them because they had things going on in their lives, where I just feel like I’m not going anywhere or doing anything. I’m not only trying to make friends with LGBT people, but I can tell sometimes that people don’t know whether I’m a boy or girl, and I feel like I make people feel awkward. I’ve also tried making friends on social media, but most people have their own friends and don’t need anymore, so they sometimes reply for a bit or not at all. I feel a bit pathetic, because I have a bit more confidence online, but still people don’t want to talk to me. 

I don’t feel like I can move forward in life, because with anything I try to do, I’m having to explain I’m trans to people as soon as I meet them or otherwise I just stick out. The way I’m living my life at the minute seems to be for other people’s benefit and not my own. I feel like I’m falling behind and just wasting my life, because I’m stuck in my room thinking of goals and dreams that seem unachievable. I’m living in my head a lot, dreaming about the future and being surrounded by people who care. As time passes, I seem to have less control over this loneliness, as I’m running out of ways to try and meet new people, and I don’t know if things will ever change. No one seems to speak to me unless I initiate the conversation. I feel I’m not even seen a lot of the time or just forgotten about in the background. Everyone I meet seems to have a significant other or at least one friend, so I’m not exactly anyone’s priority. This loneliness is really starting to get to me and I never have anyone to talk to, because I can’t even relate to people who are vaguely similar to me, and there doesn’t seem to be anyone out there in a situation like mine.

Honestly, it would just simply be cool to have a friend. I’m not saying they’d have to be trans, because it’s not something I fixate on or talk about a lot. I know this post shows the exact opposite, but it’s just causing me a lot of problems at the moment. Just someone who would just accept me for who I am and then we could get on with doing fun stuff as mates. Whenever I go out and see people hanging out together, I think I’d love to have someone I could go to the cinema or the beach with, anything really. I’m not even asking for a group of mates, just one person would be amazing. I’m sort of hopeful there may be someone on here in somewhat of the same position, but at the same time I hope no one is feeling the same way I do. I just needed to vent this somewhere, and sorry it’s so long, but if anyone wants or needs someone to talk to, please feel free to message me. Thanks guys"

lonely,Feeling left out by my close friends,"Feeling left out by my close friends - I just started medical school in August 2021. Everything was going great at first. I made a big group of friends and was so happy to have found my “forever friends” or so I thought. For the past couple of months, my friends have been hanging out a lot without me and I keep seeing them together. I have developed a bad habit of checking their locations and seeing them together, which only makes me feel worse about myself. I don’t think they’re doing it on purpose, but ever since knowing that they do all these things together, I’ve been feeling really sad and lonely even in the presence of others. I feel like my mental health is deteriorating and I keep thinking about feeling left out and unappreciated and as if they wouldn’t even care if I was a part of the group or not. 

How do I feel better? I’m trying to work on myself and fill my time alone with things that make me happy, but I’m not even sure what makes me happy anymore and I don’t have enough time with school in session to fully care for myself."

I haven’t dated in like 6 years and the sole thought of it makes me uncomfortable. I haven’t been interested in anyone for the same amount of time too. I am also discovering that I’m probably (and by probably I mean 99.9%) asexual, which doesn’t sit right with me and in my eye only makes things more difficult. It sucks because I always thought I would be just like everyone else, in a relationship, with friends and with an ok to happy life but it’s the opposite. It’s just lonely all day."
lonely,I’ve lost my personality,"I’ve lost my personality - I was going through old pics to find my old job password to get my w2. There’s a lot of pictures with my ex, whom I loved, or thought I did, idk. She dumped me out of nowhere, she was cheating and never told me but I found out anyways. A tall guy sponsored by Yamaha, then they broke up a year later and she matched with my friend (he didn’t know it was my ex, he didn’t message back), he’s a good friend. I don’t know if I’ll ever be that happy again. Ever since we broke up I’ve been a shell of a person. She was a narcissist. 

I haven’t tried dating in 2 years. I have no confidence. I live at my moms. I don’t make enough money to live on my own. I did try dating after the breakup, but people weren’t interested after I told them my height or living condition. So it made me feel even worse. For the past two years I’ve been coasting. I don’t feel love anymore, I’m not attracted to anyone. I’m hopeless about the future. I know whoever I do date will either cheat or find someone better, because it happens again and again. 

Now I’m taking 3 medications. Bupropion, mertazapine so I can eat, and lithium so my mind isn’t going insane every day. I wish I could be happy, but I can’t. I’m so alone, and lonely, even if I’m surrounded by people. I no longer allow myself to be vulnerable because that’s the worst pain (mental and physical) I’ve ever been through. I literally start shaking if I allow myself to be vulnerable, I subconsciously protect myself and I can’t change it. 

I’ve been in the military, prison, and graduated college. I feel like life has chewed me up, swallowed me, shit me out, ate it again and vomited and buried it with dirt. 

I’ve been thinking of suicide for a long time now. It comes and goes. I’ve tried everything. I used to be a gym rat, now I’m like what’s the point. I get tattoos because it makes me feel alive somewhat, I just got my armpit tattoo’d, it hurt but felt good. 

I’m just venting, I post here sometimes. I don’t answer dm’s because it’s just people trying to take advantage of others. Comments are usually nice. I know a lot of people here are just like me. 

Not even sure what I’m doing. I’m tired man. I’m so tired. My grandma is 86, battling cancer and I’m amazed she’s still alive. Meanwhile here I am 27, and ready to die. But I can’t, because if I do my dogs won’t know where I went and my brother passed away, so I’m the only son my mom has left. 

Everyday I’m filled with hopelessness and anger. Angry that I was born, angry that I’m not good enough, angry that I can’t feel anything towards anyone else."

And the worst part visit I am sitting here alone in my living room thinking how easy it would be for me to disappear and no one would care. Yes I have kids and they would miss me for a little bit but I feel like in the long run would they be better off.

I am just tired of feeling alone and all I  good for is fake girls, scammers to try and get money from because no one real would ever want me.

lonely,I'm getting played. I know.,"I'm getting played. I know. - I (M30) met a woman (F32) out here before. She messaged me and checked if I was okay since my post is kind of disturbing (well, according to her). We started talking on a daily basis and we kind of hit it off. For the first time in my life, I wake up each day with a smile because of her txts. She's cool and funny and smart, she makes me happy and what I like the most about her is how she takes care of the people she love. 

I was starting to fall in love but we live in different countries, so it's hard to keep up with each other. I try to connect with her as much as I can, I would initiate phone calls, conversations, anything that would help us make it work because I know I really like her. 

Since I don't know a lot of things about her (yes, she only wants to talk about me), I started to think that there's something going on with her. I stalked her profile and saw some evidences that she might be living with another man. I think she's married or at least have a boyfriend. I don't know how to take it all in because my mental health is really deteriorating. I cried about it but never had the chance to confront her about it. It hurts so bad but I don't wanna lose her. 

Please tell me what to do. At least help me, please.
And just an advice to anyone who is seeing two people (unless you're in a polygamous relationship), please think about what your partner is feeling, just be honest because it can really destroy them. At least tell them. Please."

First, thanks to the people that either reply with something positive or disagree respectfully without argue.

You know very good what it's like to feel lonely,  depressed and all the other bad things in life and also know how hard is to wake up everyday and push yourself to keep going..... yep, fucking  damn hard!! 
I'm a person that likes to try my best to be positive even though the world is falling apart, i can be giving advice on how to solve problems and my life be on fire, so when i have my good days i take advantage to do the most i can , enjoy things i like, eat my favorite food and make plans and obviously hop in here to share positive comments with other that feel down because maybe i can cheer up someone  else and share a smile while i still have a good mood.... 
then comes the people that laugh at the comments and tell me that being positive is a Fucking waste of time and life sucks and will always suck and everyone is horrible and we all will die alone.... why the fuck you want to crush others like that??!! Knowing how it feels to be put down from others why would you come here shaming someone for having hope and trying to cheer others, it's such a hypocrisy bullying others like that then come here complaining why people don't talk to you or doesn't want to answer dms and how selfish everyone in this sub is because they're  not looking for the same things as you.
well I'm  sorry but not everyone have the same problems or is looking for the same things in here, i like to read others , i dont look for friends or talk to people but i join this because you can always relate to how others feel and find support, if i don't  like something i just don't read it, if i read it and i have nothing to say or nothing useful to add then i just don't  say anything and if i think i can help or cheer up then i comment, but whatever my action is i shouldn't be shamed for do or don't,  we're all here because we're lonely for some reason and want to vent and look for support not being  judged on top of that......
Honestly i just became angry because i read a post from a 14 yo looking for sympathy and people in the comments saying stuff like ""yeah the world is shit and it wouldn't get better, oh wait until high-school"" and stuff like that... when you were little didn't you wished support love and someone that gives you hope? Didn't you lack of it?? There's a different between being realistic and kill others hope, and i get it, trust me i do know  how you feel when nothing has ever go right in your life and everything seems pointless and horrible but i don't  believe, at least in my case,  my bad experiences will be an excuse to put others down, i know how all of this feels and i never wish to anyone to feel like this, and i like even when someone is in a dark place other person feel the same and they conect because of the same feeling/experience amd that exactly is the purpose of this group, I'm  usually a person  that respect other's opinions but in this subject if you're going to add a bad comment please don't, you're  entitled to your opinion  but think it twice, you never know how can you affect others just with your words and honesty it hurts when you're put down by the people that share the same pain, thanks for reading."

For example, I met this guy at New Year’s Eve rave.  We were both into racing and he owns a brand company that has serviced NASCAR and sports car teams.  I told him about starting a race team and he was interested.  Fast forward I send him my business Sunday and he basically said “I don’t mean to blow you off but I am blowing you off”.  Sad this is that he is going to the NASCAR exhibition race in DTLA as am I and I wanted to meet up with him there.  But I guess since he doesn’t want to work with me he saw no value in meeting up with me and doesn’t want to hear a pitch.

I was pretty depressed for a day until I realized that I need to be harder on guys.  I can be hard on women but I like to expect the best from men.  Wrong.

A longing to be something different, to be seen, to be experienced. An adventure that has yet to be fulfilled, a dream to be realized and a goal to be accomplished.

In darkness, you walked, striving for a warm light that encompassed a sense of security, safety and belonging.

Yet, the night is cold, vast and surrounded by uncertainties.

Like a moth, you threw yourself toward the brightest flames, only to be burned by reminisced lights and unfulfilled sparks."

As a result of that I ended up failing out of college this past semester.

I have one guy who texts me maybe twice a week, but we never hang out and when I ask him he's too busy. I'm almost 20 and every single one of my"" friends"" will put no effort into our friendship. The worst part being that on the rare occasion that I do hang out with someone I end up hearing about what they did with they're friends recently and for some reason I'm never invited. I made one of my closest friends ever this semester and when I knew I was going to fail, I called him up and we talked. That isn't something I do with anyone. I don't open up about how fucked up my life really is but I did. Since then I literally haven't gotten one text from him. So clearly opening up just drives people away. Am I supposed to be lonely forever? Is this a normal experience? Is it my social anxiety? Am I reading too much into this? What can I do to make real friends? I feel so pathetic just writing this and I really wish I had killed myself when I put a gun to my head, but I was too fucking scared. Help."

I don't really tell people about my thoughts about life or worries. The only thing I do is work and study. I'm usually too tired to enjoy any hobbies. After work I just space out while watching YouTube or tv.

Really the only reachable goal that I want is retiring early and comfortably. I kind of wish that I could fast forward my life 20 years from now. I'll finally be able to get a dog then so I guess that's something to look forward to.

I lived a very full and social life throughout my 20s and 30s, but my 40s have been spent mostly in solitude. About 10 years ago I lost several friendships that I'd kept for 20+ years, and it did a job on my confidence which has made me struggle a bit socially and made it hard for me to forge connections in real life. Then of course COVID struck and made it even harder to meet new people, as my middle age just keeps ticking by... The state of the world is definitely contributing to my isolation; I can't stand what's happening right now (the pitting of us against each other through politics and the media, the takeover of our country and our livelihoods by corporations and the elite, etc) and even though I've tried to seek out people like myself in a variety of places, I have been so far unsuccessful in finding someone that wasn't standing firmly on one side with a pitchfork and a hatred for anyone who dares show compassion. (For the record, I do NOT believe that compassion and kindness are weakness; I believe them to be strengths that are very unappreciated these days). I guess I'm here as a last ditch effort to try to make genuine connections with others. Regarding platonic friendships, gender and race are irrelevant. I'm a straight female and definitely open to meeting a love connection also. Age is somewhat relevant, as I have a harder time connecting with anyone too much younger than me.

I can’t let my walls down and let love in, not that anyone cares enough to love me. It never gets better, and at this point my depression is too far gone that things can’t change.

The smallest tasks seem impossible and I can’t get out of bed. I don’t want to do anything, can’t imagine having ambitions or hobbies.

My perception is distorted and I’m constantly having flashbacks to each and every awkward social interaction and feeling incredibly guilty. I feel unworthy of life or attention but I just wanna be seen for once. I’m always extremely lonely and I can’t take it. 

I’m broken and I can’t even console myself. I have no self-compassion, my thoughts are so cruel and I’m doing this to myself. I grew up with a narcissist parent and now I’m *that* cruel to my own self. That’s a bully you can’t escape; one that’s in your own head. 

It doesn’t get better it never does. I’m 17 and I first wrote a suicide note at the age of 7 sooo I’ve felt this way for a while now. It’s not sadness, it’s deep despair. There’s no hope in conventional mental health treatment. I’ve never truly gotten better. It’s sad bc I try to convince myself that life is improving but fuck no. I’ve learned a lot of philosophical lessons that I thought would solve my problems but yet I’m gonna keep feeling like shit bc depression is like my resting state."

lonely,Asked a girl out for the first time (23m),"Asked a girl out for the first time (23m) - Hi,

I guess I just need a place to write as my mind is buzzing right now.

My social skills have always been shockingly poor and so has my perception of women. I found porn really young and I guess got addicted. Along with being bullied at school with multiple comments about my appearance. That probably creates a me; a walking pile of insecurities.

In my late teens I could barely talk to women and kinda saw them as 'objects to fuck' inside of people. I also thought everyone was judging me for any action I did. As a result I became reserved and bland so there was literally nothing to call me out on, nothing to make me stand out. I also started going down a bit of an incel route becoming resentful of most people, especially other girls I was around. Also around this time I hated myself the most and was suicidal.

I did notice this and didn't like what I was becoming. I saw a fresh start as I was off to university. I tried to socialise as much as possible always just bring friendly and nice. That works temporarily but it felt ingenuine and I think people kinda knew I felt a bit off. Over the 4 years I kept at it slowly getting better I found you can still be nice but to you need the banter, a bit of roasting now and then. I felt much more comfortable and more genuine. I started working on myself, physically and mentally. Trying not to care what people thought and being more out going. But one thing that still remained was my insecurities around girls. I could make friends easily enough hand hold conversations which were great, but anything more than that is a hard no.

I'm so concerned not to be a creep or to be inoffensive that I am just bland again. And it is something I do want to work on but don't really know how.

After uni I moved to a new city for work and I'm in a house share with a couple of people, one of which is another girl that is also a recent graduate. I go into this situation like I approach all situations now, just relaxed and with the thinking 'what ever happens, happens' as in don't force anything (personally wise). Over the next few weeks we're talking and getting on quite well, I don't see her as an object and I really like her company and being around here. We've spent a weekend exploring the new city and another weekend going to a museum as friends, even watched a few movies together in the house.

I rarely feel this way about anyone this is probably the third girl I've liked in this way. The first two I was too afraid to say anything and ruin the friendship, of course I leave it too long and they end up getting boyfriends, but that's cool and does help reduce my feelings for them. This new girl I've known for about a month now and I don't want the same thing to happen again and be filled with regret. I spent nearly 2 weeks working up the courage and trying to pick a good time. Tonight after dinner I asked if she enjoyed the time we spent at the museum together, she replied she did. So kinda stammering a bit I asked if you wanted to do the same this weekend with as a date, maybe get some lunch as well. She looked a bit surprised and said 'we'll see'. I said cool have a good night then to which she said the same and now you're caught up to the present.

I mean it's not looking promising and that's ok I'm glad I did it because it was eating away at me that I hadn't, just like the times before. There's no resentment which is nice, I hope we can still be friends and it isn't too awkward.

That's pretty much it I just wanted to get my thoughts our there tbh. I'm still very much a WIP still occasionally have bouts of depression but not longer see women as objects. Just wanted to share, thanks :)"

lonely,How to have a good birthday when you are alone and have no friends,"How to have a good birthday when you are alone and have no friends - 1. Make yourself a cake. It’s fun. If you aren’t the baking type, do some research on grocery stores near you because many of them will actually give you a free cupcake on your birthday, which is really nice. 

2.  Watch a movie you’ve always wanted to see but never had the time or motivation to. Pair it with some snacks, and maybe take some chances and see if a random person online would wanna watch it with you lmao

3. Cuddling services. Ok. I have never done this and am not in a position to, but totally would if I could. You can pay by the hour for someone to come over and cuddle and even watch the movie with you.

4. Don’t seek sympathy from anybody or feel too pitiful about it. Birthdays are kind of a weird thing that not everybody celebrates anyway. Nobody really cares if you’re lonely or feel unloved generally because they feel like it’s normal, even if they have the friends and relationships  that we could only dream of.

5. Listen to pity party and cry on your free cupcake in the arms of a paid stranger"

I'm a guy in my early 20s and have had a friend for two years. We've always been good friends, close, we've always told each other our issues, made each other feel better about things. Around a month ago though I told her that I liked her more than a friend, she didn't like me that way though. I thought things would be fine and would go back to normal but I've never really been the same since. She sometimes talks about finding people to talk to on dating apps and going to meetups to meet new people, all of this is cool and I'm happy for her but it just makes me feel bad when she keeps mentioning it. It makes me feel lonely. I told her last night and today she replied saying she won't being that stuff up anymore but she doesn't really like hiding stuff from me. I know my feelings for her don't matter whatsoever and I just need to get over it, but it's really difficult when she's my only friend. I just want to see her as a normal friend but it's really difficult. So yeah, not sure what else to say. I'm not the type to meet new people, never been in a relationship anymore and I know that if I get over this feeling I will be fine again.

lonely,You are not alone in this world.,"You are not alone in this world. - I know you are lonely. I know that every day you wake up is a struggle because you feel so alone. But in this world, you are not alone. There is someone out there who is like you, who feels the same way you do. Someone who is longing for company, cuddles, laughs, friendship, romance, and just doesn't know how to get it. They're out there.

I think in the dredges of loneliness it's easy to lose hope. It's easy to feel like you're an island in a sea of people. I know meeting people is scary, I know a lot of us are introverts, and I know it seems hopeless at times. But there is someone out there like you, who is lonely too, who likes what you like, who would be so happy to see you. 

My advice? Start feeding the pieces inside of you that are yearning for a good time. Yearning to be happy. Feed them scraps if that's all you have. Just get them some nutrition. Any. You like to read and haven't in a while? Read for five minutes every other day. You want to get to the gym? Go for a ten minute run once a week. You want to draw? Doodle one thing every day. You want to be happy? Give what you can to that piece of you that hungers for that.

Your confidence is key. And the road to confidence is through self actualization. Treat yourself kindly and feed the fun side of you, feed the side of you that yearns to do things. And go do them, just a little at a time. Your confidence will build, and you'll feel more comfortable interacting with others because you'll know that no matter the outcome of the situation, you're okay with who you are and you will be okay. 

Then, you can start searching for that person. That lonely, sweet person who is like you. You'll start the hunt, and don't be scared! Sometimes it doesn't work out, that's nothing against you. There are so many people on this Earth, not all of them will like you. That's fine, you don't have to like everybody either. 

But there is someone out there like you. You are not alone in this world, no matter how lonely you are. Feed that which fuels your joy and work up from there, and keep hope. There's someone out there like you, someone who cries themselves to sleep because they just want a friend, a relationship, some hope in this lonely world, and *they'll like you*. You all, each and every one of you, have an opportunity to find this person. It's hard. But it's worth it. And you all are strong people, otherwise you wouldn't keep going in the face of such an overwhelming emotion such as loneliness. So don't give up. There's hope for you. There's someone out there *just like you* and as long as you keep fighting for your happiness, there's hope you'll meet them.

My love goes out to you all, and wish me luck too! I know loneliness hurts. But that doesn't mean it's forever, and that doesn't mean it's hopeless. You are not alone in this world. You are lonely, but you are not alone."

lonely,Suicide Talk (TW),"Suicide Talk (TW) - I'm seeing a counselor for my depression and anxiety (to say nothing of my '21 divorce) and near the end of our session last Friday I was dismayed to hear her tell me I ""lit up"" when speaking of my ex. Hearing that made me realize just what I had forsaken, not through the divorce but by being a huge asshole for the first 5-7 years of our marriage (which in turn led to her being equal but opposite after we both agreed to reconcile rather than divorce in '15).   


To put it bluntly, she was everything I ever wanted and more than I deserved - I was just an immature prick. I ruined my dream of growing old with one person. She's not without fault mind you, but at least she *had a reason* to destroy me. I was just an emotionally unavailable/hurtful douchebag because I don't know why in hindsight.  


I would never tell my next partner this but know that having a relationship would ease the regrets and self-loathing...I'm spiraling **because** **I'm so lonely**. I've decided I'm going to do my best to stick things out until my son graduates but that is 2.5 years off. If I don't have a relationship by then at the latest I'm going to kill myself by loosing inert gas in my vehicle with all airways duct taped from the inside.   


Everything I've read says it's painless, and while I have been terrified of ""what comes next"" my entire life it's going to come someday anyway, and it beats being trapped in my self-abusive mind."

But the process was drawn out for over a month. A month of on and offing, a month of considering, letting go, changes in perception, etc. Grief happened, hurt and anger was felt. Ultimately we both realize we weren’t going to work out. Initially we wanted to stay friends but ecentually i thought it wasn’t a great idea. I then cut ties with my ex and told him never to see me again. I just don’t want to be hurt.

But now I feel so empty and lonely. Every night I feel so. I missed the idea of sharing everything with him. I missed the idea of waking up to his good morning texts, and his good night texts, I miss his soothing voice. I can’t see just about anything without thinking of him. Even my favourite songs, every love song, every heartbreak song, everything reminds me of him. But I know we can’t go back now. And that’s ok. It was a decision I conciously made. For the best. Even if I still loved him even if he still did, this will never ever work out."

I have only one friend, but he is a man in his 50s so I don’t have a single friend my age, I don’t have or have ever had a boyfriend, and my entire family either doesn’t care about me or doesn’t want to help me because they are narcissistic and a huge part of my trauma. Because of covid there are no support groups meeting in person, and meeting people through zoom does NOTHING for me, I can’t even see most of their faces. My family has my dog who they got for me as an ESA but he has behavior problems and they don’t trust me to care for him so I don’t even have him. I’ve been waiting desperately for a job so I at least have something. Every minute of every day I have to lie to each person in every interaction, even my hairdresser who always asks about my family because she used to cut their hair, and I’m constantly lying. Even when I tell the truth people try to deny it or say “no your family loves you” or other selfish crap to make themselves feel better and not actually have to show real empathy. I got sexually assaulted and abused multiple times in a mental hospital so I no longer trust mental health facilities. So even though I feel incredibly suicidal I have nowhere to turn to. I’m honestly planning to end things soon because this is such a pathetic way to live and bad luck is all I can blame.
I’m apparently beautiful kind charming and likable but people abandon me the moment they find out I’m a real person with real trauma and not some stupid fantasy in their head. People have always used me to feel better about themselves and do not treat me like an actual person. And when my very justified anger and hurt comes out I get accused of being negative or scary or too intense and dumped. I’m sick of everything and everyone. I literally don’t know where to find anyone to live with, I’m estranged from community, and if I continue this old hermit existence I’ve been forced into that caused me to lose my mind, I’m ending it :("

16(M) my mental health is getting worse with a crazy speed since about 2 months, I crack more often than usual and frequent suicidal ideas, I became almost dead IRL, no more strength to study, no more strength to think, no more strength to wake up, even no more strength to do the only activity that still gave me the little pleasure I had playing video games 
I spend absolutely all day/night sleeping and listening to music to think about something else, even during class I sleep and it's severely killing my grades because next year I have my degree...

I was told that seeing a psy is a good idea (even a high school psy) but after asking around I found out that they call the parents if my situation is serious (it is) and I would absolutely not want my family to know about my situation... I've already disappointed them too much, they have enough problems, I don't want them to see me as the failed child of the family tree, I try to pretend that everything is fine, even if at the moment I seem to be more and more tired and they have noticed it 

I really need to see a psy but that's what's stopping me...

lonely,I discovered the best way to lose your virginity or get laid easily.,"I discovered the best way to lose your virginity or get laid easily. -  

So i'm a 32 year old guy. I'm not a virgin but its been a few years since I had sex. I'm not the type that goes to bars and pick up girls easily, i'm too shy/introverted for it.

So I tried online dating. But the problem with dating apps is that its one huge picture contest. The girls are showing their makeup and curves, and the dudes are showing their muscles at the gym, cars, and holiday pictures. I HATE pictures, I don't have any good ones. So what now?

Search for an erotic advert site that doesn't force you to add pictures, you can just add a topic title and text. Its a kind of erotic craigslist/Reddit I suppose. So search for a free site like this in your area.

So in this ad, I posed as a 29 year old virgin who wants to lose his virginity. It turns out that some women (not a lot of them, but some) find this cute or interesting. I got some messages in my mailbox, most of them were from hookers but 1 or 2 from normal women. I gave her my tel number and we started chatting for a short while and exchanged pictures. She was a hot looking single mom who had this hidden kink of sleeping with someone who doesn't have any experience.

We set a date and I went to her house last saturday, and spent the night there. We watched a movie and then we started kissing and went upstairs to her room, we took of our clothes and she started to suck on my dick for a short while and ofcourse then came ""the big moment"". I wasn't a virgin ofcourse but I needed to pose as one so when she gently guided my dick in her (without condom) I came like a fountain deep inside her. Great relief after years of not getting laid. The next morning I kissed her and thanked her and went back home.

So I'm sharing this with you because, if it works for me (and i'm a really introverted and shy guy), it can for you. If you are a virgin, and you are affraid to approach women the normal way, this might work. Or if you are not a virgin like me, and don't like hookers that much, this is a good tactic to get laid as well.

So good luck, give it a shot, and keep safe. :)"

When she went through her darkest moments during this time, she asked for my help and I would always be there for her. Yet when I was feeling low or depressed (admittedly not reach the depths that she did), I would get only the briefest attention.

As I've said, I've known this friend for 4 years yet we never did anything together outside of our place (we lived together in social housing before I moved out recently). We never went to the pub to have a drink or chill out somewhere even though I asked numerous times. Either something came up like a family appointment or she wasn't feeling up to it. Yet whenever she needed something from the shop, wanted money for her nefarious habits or wanted her supposed best friend to be with her, I would always be there. Yet I could never get her to go with me for a drink. I made sure I never persisted and I would only ever gently nudge her. She'd tell me how she wanted to go, that it was overdue.

Anyway, my frustrations towards our friendship came out the other day and I don't her exactly what I thought of her. And I also told her to fuck off before blocking her number. I felt so let down knowing how our friendship only ever felt one way. Maybe I shouldn't have flipped out in my text messages but the damage is done and I've lost her as a friend."

I've read about others experiencing the same, even if I've only had a couple occurrences myself. Granted, I don't actively seek out anyone to talk to, I just offer once in while to certain people. If they ignore it, that's fine, but it's a bit more of a bummer to be left on read.   


The last person was maybe banned tho, so idk what that was about, but still makes me a bit bummed.  
And I'm not even gonna pretend I haven't done the same! (elsewhere). Not often, but it's happened, so I get why it's just hard sometimes. Just some ramblings from my end. Hope you'll all find the connections you need. &lt;3"

lonely,What do I want?,"What do I want? - Discussion/Venting

I've come to the conclusion I'm going to be stuck alone and as such might as well enjoy myself by soley focusing on my hobbies and things I enjoy. But in reality they seem more of just distractions. When they are done I feel empty, a sense of extreme loneliness returns and everything feels pointless and wasted if it isn't a shared moment.

Is it the depression? OCD intrusive thoughts/feelings? Or do I just not like the things I used to love? Why do I have this erge to need someone? Don't people keep saying focus on yourself, love yourself, focus on making money/completing goals/being successful? I mean, I don't really have the opportunities at the moment but I always try to keep going with my goals whenever possible. I just feel whats the point? I've never particularly cared about money, I'd be happy homeless if I was with someone I loved and who loved me. I mean that, I obviously wouldn't want to stay homeless but that sort of connection means far more to me than any ammount of money ever would. But why?
Everyone I've ever met seems to care more about money.

It's been the same with everything. What they can get out of me. About what I can give them in terms of anything and what's out there that's better than I can offer, so that I can be replaced after they get fed up or bored of me.
They seem happy. I got told several times I'd meet someone eventually who wants me for me. It's never them of course and it still hasn't happened yet and doubtfully ever will. But when people are like that, when I've been constantly hurt, nearly killed by 3 people and told I'm just being melodramatic because that was years ago and I'm a man so should just get over it, and when I've been involved in trying to solve people's dramas at their request many times in the past, and seen the things people do to each other. The risks of dating and constant rejection or outright ignoring of my existence, why on Earth do I still feel lonely and want someone? Am I stupid?

I know not everyone is bad, but I don't fit in anywhere, and don't really feel welcomed for long either. I'm not perfect and I never pretend to be. I've tried to work on myself, my therapist even said I was ""hyper self aware"", and I've ask people how I am and how to improve and so on. I've been more than accepting and open for others. I'm not a doormat either or unable to talk to people, but no one stays for long and I've often found I enjoyed my own company. But that feeling never goes. Even in my sleep or when I wake. It feels like I'm being punished for something. Why do I have all these, hobbies, goals, and aspirations if they don't really mean anything to me in the end and then at the same time I long for love and a relationship even though I know it can't happen no matter how I try, (yet I still try), and have been hurt so much before to the point I don't trust anyone and prefer my own company.
Am I crazy? Stupid? Or am I missing something?

I know no one can answer this directly, but I wonder if I'm alone, or if anyone has insight. I've had existential dread many times before, so prehaps it's related to that, I don't know. I guess this is a cry for help, because I really don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to be trapped in this situation forever.

Thank you for reading. I know you all have your own problems and I sincerely wish you all the best.
If there's anything I can do to help, let me know.
Even if it's just to lend an ear or give some advice or perspective. Or even if to give the slight comfort of knowing you aren't alone in some small way, give me a message."

lonely,I don’t think people are attracted to me and i feel that i may just been lonely for good.,"I don’t think people are attracted to me and i feel that i may just been lonely for good. - Not really sure how to even start this off as i don’t exactly even know why or how i feel this way. To preface, i don’t think i’m not completely unattractive, i mean if anything i’m just average. 

I guess what makes me feel this way, is that i always see my friends and more specifically 2 of my close friends always with new girls every other day and always matching with people on tinder and always going to girls places. It just makes me wonder why they are able to do it so easily, like i even think i’m more attractive then one and i still just barely get any matches on tinder, meet new girls, etc. I just don’t get it or understand why that i can’t get lucky or get something. I also know however i shouldn’t even be comparing myself to others but recently just intrusive thoughts makes this all just 10x worse.

Which at the end of the day just makes me feel more self conscious that i’m not attractive, people don’t want to talk to me, etc. And i quite frankly don’t know exactly what to do.

tldr;can’t seem to get the interest of girls, always see friends with new girls every day and wonder why i can’t even get one. which leads me to be more self conscious and negative about my appearance."

lonely,Feels like I'll be alone forever.,"Feels like I'll be alone forever. - I'm aware that's probably a common feeling, and it's also likely irrational, but it's how I've been thinking recently.

I don't interact with people often at all. I prefer to just be quiet and reclusive, which isn't really conducive for any possibility of a relationship or whatever. 

I just fear the idea of spending year after year in isolation, only speaking to my very small number of online friends I'll have. 

And any attempts at socializing are dead in the water for a multitude of reasons that would take too long to explain (and frankly, they seem egotistical).

I don't know. This lack of knowledge about the future is fucking killing me day to day. It eats me from the inside out."
lonely,Anyone else? Fatigue for making new friends,"Anyone else? Fatigue for making new friends - Has anyone else every experienced this? 

How have you ""managed"" it or changed it (etc)?

I've moved cities quite a lot growing up, I lived and was schooled in 4 countries and had 6 schools and 2 universities. 

Because of this there was a lot of ""always the new kid"" time happening - being the new kid, developing connections, having to move on, trying to keep connections that don't last, start again.

I found that almost always the reason (as far as I'm aware) that the friendship/connections didn't last when I'd moved away was that it's so much easier to maintain a relationship with someone that you see in person regularly and have big/small interactions with, than with someone who you need to send emails to/facetime - it's almost like the extra effort is too much in comparison to everyone else that's still there around you and you can see in person - a situation of out of sight out of mind.

I've been in the same location now for 5 years and have made fleeting friendship and aquiantances, but I can't seem to dredge up the emotions in me to put great effort into keeping up regular contact to deepen the relationship, or to dredge up the energy/desire to try to enter new friendships from people that I meet. I don't know if I'm trying to be subconsciously self-protective, or have slid into seeing people as just transient now. I would love to have the deep connections that you hear about or see online (etc), but at the moment I just feel largely unmoored from everyone.

Because this is not exactly the type of topic that you would enter into at a dinner party or find someone easily who quite understands or has been through something similar, then I don't know whether this is something that others have felt before, or whether it is something that I have developed by myself alone."

lonely,Grown up woma trying to feel less like a teenager,"Grown up woma trying to feel less like a teenager - Hi everybody. Im a 29 years old woman from southamerica just really going through it. I’ll keep it simple: App. 6 months ago my boyfriend for 7 years (and close friend for almost 15 years, since middle school) broke up with me. We had a home and 2 cats. It was very sudden. I didn’t expected it, so it truly hit me very, very hard.
I cryed a lot, i suffered a lot. It was the most difficult time of my life. I’ve never experienced loss like this before, even considering that i lost my dad on 2020, just for reference. It was absolutly heartbreaking for me. 
anyways, it’s been 6 months and i’m doing pretty fine. I’ve overcome the crisis. I’m a functional human being again. I laugh, i party, i work, i do sports, i act like myself. My ex and i even decided to keep our friendship as long as it was possible, mostly because we share a good amount of friends and it was easier for both of us to try to keep our lifes going as usual. 
I dont regret this, i really like our friendship, probably because i knew him first as friends (we started dating after almost 10 years of friendship). I really like and appreciate his friendship. 
Anyways, that’s the background. The reason i’m posting this today is this: i,ve come to the realization that he has moved one; he’s starting to date again, to be interested in other women (which is 100% normal, dont get me wrong), that he has decided to move forward with his life. And i’ve not. And i feel lonely, really lonely.
I’ts a very strange scenario: i’m young, i’m fairly good looking, i’m a lawyer, i’m really funny. I dont have major issues, i’m doing pretty well for my age, i’m smart, blablabla.
But, even knowing that, i can’t help but feeling like i’m not worth it, like everyone is destined to meet someone but me, like i’’ not pretty enough, that i should loose weight, that no one is going go really, really like me.
I just feel hopeless.
I know that i’m in a good position,everyone tells me that, that i’ll meet someone, that i’m just lost. Maybe i am. Mayb you are right.
But i can’t help but feeling absolutely lost and devastated as i walk home crying, no seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I’m not worth it. Everybody is going forward with their lifes but me. 
I’m stuck.
I’m lost. 
I’m really having a hard time."

I truly have no one to go to right now and am feeling really suicidal. He was all I Had good left. and I completely fucked it up. I know I cant rely on one person for happiness but I'm completely miserable without him. Does anyone think he'll contact me again?

lonely,"""What's your excuse?""","""What's your excuse?"" - The GM of the store I work at just had sex last night with a stranger that walked right through the door at work. She walked in, saw him, talked for a minute and *immediately* began flirting. They talked for a solid twenty minutes at least before walking off with his number and they began texting the whole night


Come to find out, last night he had sex with her -- despite him being married. I don't want to get into too much of the details in the one in a million chance of him somehow seeing this post but it just baffles me how easy it is for some people 



I think the worst part of it all, though, was when the guys at work were talking about it earlier today and one of my coworkers said ""damn, this guy's pulling bitches. Psalm, what's your excuse for not finding someone?"" 


So I said it, without missing a beat actually. ""Sorry, you must be *this* tall to find someone"" and proceeded to put my hand over my head, palm down. It's not a lie -- I don't get taken seriously by literally anyone because of my height. I'm the butt of everyone's jokes and that by itself would've been fine, but **now** people started saying stupid shit like ""WelL I kNOw a GuY THAt's oNlY 5'1 aND He FouNd someoNe!!ONe!!1!!

She talked up the guy who started at the same time as me while ignoring my very existence. What's the point in trying? I might as well just give up and resign to a punch-in, punch-out mentality"

To couple my diminuated stature
Product of neglect to all my matters
I guess that makes it sadder
That people can look down
without making a sound
And judge the pain I found
I mean I abandoned everything else
How much longer till I abandon myself
Where pain is all that's left
And others are forced to bear it at my behest
I guess thats the truth of travesty
That I'll be the only one who can appreciate its majesty
While those around are filled with loss
Unable to understand the feelings I fought
Despite the the fact its written on my skin
That there was no chance I could ever win"
lonely,1st time posting.,"1st time posting. - People never wait, they simply talk to the ones thier ""crushing"" on then simple fall in love. There's no waiting in that yet then tend to vanish from thier friends. Why couldn't they just leave me out of thier  life and just talk to the ones they were liking. I'm nothing but a  distraction to people! Yet if that's what a friend was called back then, then this year I don't want it. Why make a friend, then have it where their so happy to date and leave you behind? Im done with people. Im only used yet I give support to everyone? Tsk! I was a fool then and still am a fool now. Still doing the same bs. And they have the mind to come back when things don't go well for them? Naw. Not anymore."
lonely,My biggest regret in life..,"My biggest regret in life.. - Well, I just want to tell my story since it's been bothering me for like 2 and a half years or so. But it still going to bother me even after telling someone but I just want some of the burden to get off my shoulders. So 3 years before, in the year of 2019, there was still no covid. Still had school and stuff. And for the 2nd time, I had a relationship with someone who's older than me again (sorry, I just really like girls that are older than me but smaller than me). She was 2 years older than me and I was 14 at the time, 2nd year junior high school student. We really had great times, well great is an understatement. The thing that I really like about her is, she's a really simple worth it girl. And I also really like when she gets angry or moody sometimes because it's like looking at a kirby that's holding a knife, that's how cute she is when she gets angry but anyway.. We always ate streetfood (If you're Filipino you'll get what I mean), always had fun in the most simple ways. Every day/night having video calls, talking with her and sometimes when her little sister caught her having a video call with me, we'll have a very fun conversation. It was one of the best moments in my highschool life. I realized that I loved her more than my 1st girlfriend. But one day, I introduced her to my mom but not physically at first because... it's complicated. I'll go simplify it. ""I don't like her looks, go find someone else who looks better). But don't hate my mom, please. After she knew what my girlfriend looked like, everything got complicated. I was being forced to break up with her, But I didn't tell my girlfriend because I don't want her to get hurt as well as be angry at my mom. So after a week or so, I get blackmailed again and again just so that I would break up with my girlfriend. I got grounded again and again. Blackmail after blackmail. Everyday after school, me and my mom will argue. She didn't even let me hangout with my friends outside anymore. And after a month, I got tired. I made the hardest decision I ever made that time. I called my girlfriend at night, it was by 9pm or 10pm maybe. I told her that we should breakup. Then our friend joined the call after my girlfriend told her what's happening. They both asked me why but I didn't told them. I wanted to protect my mom. My girlfriend.. I watched her cry, I listened to her asking me again and again why I was breaking up with her. I pretended to cry that time because I thought, she would think it's real. Then she asked me to let her see my face if I was really crying, but I didn't do it. I just said ""I'm sorry"" then left the call.
I didn't feel anything that night, I was just staring at my ceiling thinking ""Did I do the right thing?"" Again and again and again until I fell asleep. The following days were really akward. Her friends kept on staring at me like they were going to kill me. We broke up in march. I was happy for a few months. But right when july hit, I suddenly felt this sense of guilt. July 2, my birthday, I felt kinda happy but mostly down. July-december I felt so guilty because of what I did to my her (my ex-girlfriend). Then the whole year of 2020 until to this day. January 27, 2022... I still feel the guilt. I feel so bad, I feel so angry at myself for doing that to her. Everytime I attempt to talk to a new girl, I don't feel happy or satisfied. I still love my ex-girlfriend. I know it's kinda wrong because I was the one who broks up with her, but it was forced. But I can't do anything now, she may be happy with someone else or she may be having her best days of her life now. I don't want to bother her anymore because I don't want her to be sad again. But I guess that's life, we always regret in the end. Thank you guys for reading my story and maybe, just maybe if she's able to see this. I just want to say I am really sorry, and well here's the explanation that you were asking for.. sorry it took almost 3 years.. Love you always and take care and live the best life that you could ever have. Again, thank you guys so much. It means alot to me.

I enjoy nature, healthy living, art and dance. Also movies, browsing the internet, travel (but that's expensive), and occasionally things like bowling or whatever. 
I grow a few plants and was doing more, but I got busy so some died. I plan to set up and start a compost pile very soon. ~~~
I like looking up art online, like all styles, including interior design and fashion. I sometimes doodle or color myself, or I do bigger projects like for example,
I made a collage from old birthday/greeting cards. ~~~
And I sometimes dance around, mostly in my house or yard, perhaps will go out one day eventually, but the pandemic is kinda rough lately so whatever.
I totally wrote this entire post once already then clicked off the page and had to rewrite this. Haha.

I remember during the first year we met there was this interesting quote. It stated that if your friendship lasts 7 years then you with will be life long friends. We said we would reach this goal one day. 

Happy 7th year. 
Sorry we failed at year 6. 
Things got complicated when we fell in love in year 1. 
Broke up in year 2.
Tried to reconcile in year 3-4. Sorry I wanted to move on with someone new. How you left me hanging after I hurt you and apologized scarred me. I apologize now because I know that we both were just reacting. I had so much anger in me those years. But you still made me smile.

Year 5 I got married even though I shouldn’t have. That was the year you wanted to be serious. I apologize for not telling you that I was going back to her. She was a safe decision. I was scared to task a risk with you. I know now that you don’t cut as much or the dark thoughts aren’t there. I realize that for some reason I’m the one who made them worse. 

Year 6 we almost had an affair. We decided to leave each other alone after that moment. You even got a new man. It hurt but I was happy that you were happy. 
Year 6 was also the year you came back for friendship. I wish you didn’t. Because I fucked it all up being unable to move on from you. I’m a despicable person. I reminded you of your past that you wanted to do better from. I guess I am just toxic. 

Year 7…."

lonely,Villain,"Villain - 
Honestly, I don’t even know why these moods come and go so much for me. It’s been a year since we last spoke. I know you consider me a manipulative user.

I probably was. Something about that alcohol and you on my mind. It just made a horrible concoction and I hurt you because of it. I told you we couldn’t be friends anymore. I didn’t choose you. I chose her. 
I know we almost went down that taboo road after I got married.

I’m regretfully happy we didn’t. 
You found another man to love which I even gave you advice on. That was suppose to be it. 

Why the hell did you come back, offering an olive branch!? And now look at us! You allowed me a chance to fuck everything up!Damn it! I never told you I was drunk that night when I asked a question that I shouldn’t have. I was also tipsy when I sent that long winded complaint text message. I didn’t even remember it in the morning.

We were suppose to leave all that behind us and I brought it back up again because I couldn’t deal with the pit that I was in and I needed you there again to lean on like old times.
Yea…I was toxic and manipulative. I knew I shouldn’t tried to be your friend again. I knew I wasn’t healthy yet. But I said yes because I can’t ever deny you. But you left me. You left everything behind to strive on for a better future and I’m proud of you for that.

But I hate you. You couldn’t even tell me you forgave me after I apologized profusely. 6 years of love and friendship and you left me cold in the streets. Sometimes I forget how much is bitch you can be. I should have never forgiven you of your toxic behavior. Of your lies and deceit. But that’s my mistake.

And now as always I’m the one picking up the pieces and can’t face you again because of my pride. How I was the fuck up. 
So here’s my last damn apology. I apologize for giving a damn. I apologize for not fucking you over. 
I apologize for not leaving you broken when you were depressed and suicidal.
I apologize for stopping myself from screwing you in the car when I had the chance. 
I apologize for always giving you my time and tears and this fucking heart.
I apologize for all the advice I gave.
I apologize for ever loving you. 

Don’t worry. I’ll be the bad guy. I’ll wear this title proudly. 
I finally realize I lived long enough to see myself become the villain."
lonely,"19m, can't even find a friend who will do stuff with me.","19m, can't even find a friend who will do stuff with me. - I go to football every week at my local football team, it's fun, I go with my dad and my little brother and we have drinks at the pub. I have a season ticket, and when someone can't go you can just pass it on to someone else.

My dad and brother couldn't go to the game due to it being in the mid week, they said I can just bring a friend along. I couldn't, I can't. I have one friend who made an excuse instead of saying he just didn't want to, and that's all. At 19, I couldn't think of anyone because I can't. I went to the football game by myself, got a pint by myself. And I enjoyed it for a time, but when I looked around and saw people laughing with their friends it just hits rock bottom.

It reminds me of my old friend who passed away every time, it makes me think ""what would we be doing? Would we go for a pint now that we're adults? Would we still have fun and go to the woods to make random shit like we used to? And most of all, would we tell each other everything like we used to, instead of hiding everything inside for myself to slowly break apart?""

Anyway, that's the life. Hope something changes soon, been trying to be ""outgoing"" for months and nothing has changed"

Tried out a few apps, tired finding like minded people on reddit too, but even this a hustle, it's like 1:100, women get hundreds of messages even though the world's sex ratio is almost 1:1, it's strange.

The possibility that I won’t find someone and that I will be single forever is not some lighthearted fear I can brush off like other girls do - it feels like a real and accurate representation of what is waiting for me. The truth is I want someone I just click with, whose hand I can hold and not have to let go (unless sweaty palms demands it). I want to care about someone and have it grow to be something special. I just don’t know how to get there. I don’t know what to say or do. I let myself drown in feelings with the wrong people who I know are safe and that will only ever amount to friendship because this eliminates risk of being hurt, right? I don’t know what I’m doing but everyone else seems to know the secret. Where was I when they learnt it? Why did I not get that same curiosity? All I got was the fear of missing out and labelled the token single girl. I’m sad. I’m nerdy. I like cats. I’m chubby. I don’t know how anyone is supposed to love me like this?"

lonely,3am Vestiges,"3am Vestiges - No Title:

I find it disturbing that my hands curl up in disgust whenever they get close to touching you.
I just don’t know what the source of this emotion is…
Is it me? Because they recognize that I cannot measure up to my previous self?
The raw passion I had…
Trying to hide myself from the world, right between your borders.
Or maybe they are disgusted with you?
How you handicapped me and lured me in with a promise of sanctuary…
A place where everyone is equal, ugly, twisted, dark, afraid…
Understanding of the scars we all have on us…A family I guess..

I think I lost my key…
I think the paradise became too small
I mean we all out grow apartments or houses…or if you have new additions to the family…
I mean we all have to move on right?

Ha! Who I am kidding, 
But for some reason I needed to leave you…
Pathetic right?
Trust me I still laugh today…
I laugh…
I keep the blanket over the mirror
I tell myself I’m getting better without you

Am I?

Okay yes earlier I lied and said I lost the key… 
Yea I still have the key…remember? Yup the pencil with chew marks on it and no eraser.
I believed I should never erase what I released inside your lines…
I needed to look at myself…with every Iota revealing another Centimeter of my character….

Sadly….well lately I’ve woken up most of the mornings and never looking in the Mirror to see who I am.

Actually….I threw the mirror out the window….

Every poem, journal entry, memory, tears, misspelled word…every inch of me….

Gone….
I just wanted to say hello, you know for the longest I hated you…I hated her…I hated this amalgamation….

I wanted to watch it all burn….
And I did. 
But I think I’m worse off because of that decision.
Forgetting who I was...was the dumbest mistake I ever made

Because now I don’t even know what my innocence used to look like…


Sincerely,
……………."

lonely,No one to confide in,"No one to confide in - I’m a 33(F) unhappily married to a husband who cheats every year. I’m supposed to “get over it.” 

I have no one to talk to about my pain, how much I hunger for touch and love. I’ve outgrown or distanced from friends, we’d say hi here and there…nothing really. 

Disappointed a best friend of mine won’t grow out of her clubbing ways and I’ve outgrown that stage of my life…she has no ambition or goals. So I’ve gently distanced myself because I have career and financial goals. 

Besides that, Everything hurts still. 

I’m currently working on a career, saving up in hopes to move somewhere..surprise my husband with papers when I have enough to go. I’m still hesitant…lack of self esteem. 

Trying to lose weight…started a weightlifting challenge this year. Lost 4lbs so far. 

I just want someone to love me as much as I love them. 

I am ever so craving touch, connection…someone I can pour my thoughts to….

Just some thoughts for tonight"
lonely,I think I’m stuck searching for something I can’t find…,"I think I’m stuck searching for something I can’t find… - Sigh, I think sometimes I’m stuck trying to replace my ex girlfriend/ best friend. I’m even married but I feel lonely a lot. I even thought of at least finding someone to chat with the same. 

You know…the dark humor. The jokes about suicide, depression. How we had to put masks on sometimes just because. The late night conversations or the poetry we used to write. And it’s weird because to me we are normal people. Well I was…was is the key word. Maybe because she exposed my naive ass to so much that life without the highs and lows…I’m probably just broken.

And living this normal life now is draining me. But you changed to. Now I’m the toxic one. Sigh that’s why I had to drop the alcohol. Said way to many words when I shouldn’t have been speaking to you at all. I wish I could find that connection again with anyone but then how would that work? No idea. Anywho these are just my late night thoughts and I wish y’all the best. Feeling misunderstood and lonely even when you are surrounded by people is an interesting feeling.

lonely,I thought i had a gf for 5 days,"I thought i had a gf for 5 days - ig technically ive still never had one. trigger warning
tho. i was trolling this girl who has been rejecting me
since 2020 on instagram. sent a funny pic of myself. We
actually started talking. she would reply quick, she
would text me at work &amp; when she woke up. this post is
gonne be a self doxx i have to delete eventually. she
was my type but maybe not everyone's. she was
beautiful to me. we actually ended up going out &amp; she
would always kiss me in public. We went grocery
shopping together &amp; got caught kissing by an employee
and laughed about it. she would come to my house &amp;
always pick me up. we would go to her place and i
would spend the night. we kept finding out things we
had in common. she never made me pay for anything.
even gave me money that i didn't at all ask for. i would
clean her apartment but she never asked me to i just
did it. I would always cook for her &amp; sometimes have
food for her when she woke up. she was really
impressed by my cooking if i were to believe her words.
but i am pretty good at it ig. she was really soft &amp;
cuddly &amp; we would cuddle pretty hardcore. i enjoyed
the cuddling more than the NSFW stuff i'm not gonna
bother typing out. i've never been cuddled before that.
i've never had my hair played with that much. never
kissed anyone that much. never enjoyed someone's
scent so much. I've only had 3rd base with one other
girl my entire life. anyways long story short i was being
used as a rebound. she was not over her ex. it was way
too much to find that out. gaslighting projecting i think
she's a psychopath now. she blocked me &amp; it was kind
of a relief, still sucks that i have to go through a mega
withdrawal of oxytocin. like an overdose of it. yep. idk."

lonely,I’m dead inside,"I’m dead inside - I’ve gone my whole life of only knowing emotional with some physical abuse from men including my dad, step dad, brother, and ex of 7 years.  My grandma who helped raised me was also emotionally abusive.  She always felt that women should be seen and not heard and should be in the kitchen and I’m a huge activist so you can imagine how that went… for example she caused abandonment issues in me telling me my mom should have been home from work by now and she probably left me and my brother and she didn’t blame her.  She’d call me fat even though I was very fit since I was a dancer etc.  Now I’m starting to feel my mom only acts like she cares and I’m realizing there was a lot of emotional abuse there too but more emotional neglect than anything.  She let the men in her life talk down to me and say whatever they wanted and then behind their backs say it wasn’t right.  She also won’t talk to me if I come with my concerns to her.  She will never say sorry if she’s wrong either.

Ultimately, I’ve never known a normal relationship.  All of this was highlights as I have my own struggles including ptsd, ocd, major depression disorder and anxiety.. 

My ex continues to be abusive by using our kids as tools, my brother is still in my ear even tho he just got out of prison and I have his child in my custody and my mom is still doing the same as always.  I have no friends as my friendships never last.  

I’m at the point that if I didn’t have my kids I would have killed myself a long time ago. 
I don’t want to do this anymore.
Everyone I’m attracted to or that I attract are the same cycle and now I’m wondering if this is just normal? Is everyone like this? I’m over 30 and I’m miserable.  I can’t do this for another 20-30 years. What is the point? All I want to do is take my kids and abandon everything and leave everything behind but I know more problems will wait for me as it is the people I attract and am attracted to..or back to maybe that’s how people really are.

I know this is all over the place but I’m so lost and I’m on the edge. I need guidance"

lonely,Seeing the parallels of my loneliness vs the support my boyfriend has makes me lonelier.,"Seeing the parallels of my loneliness vs the support my boyfriend has makes me lonelier. - My boyfriend of almost 5 years got into a huge fight we broke up and he called his mom to vent. His whole family is rallying around him telling him they’ll fly him out so he can be around family during these times. He has friends too and although I know he wouldn’t open up to them, they’re there and he could go to them if he needed them like he has before. Ultimately we decided to take a break and talk things over once we’re ready while continuing living together. I moved from another state to be with him and left friends behind and the friends I’ve made here are great people but not the type you vent intimate problems to. I don’t have any best friends and even if I needed to be talked off the ledge, I wouldn’t say anything as to not be a bother. I can’t tell my family bc I’m  under pressure to portray that my life here is perfect and don’t want to admit that it’s not. My mom would be there for me, but i just cannot reveal my struggles to her. I’ve always been a lonely person but this is too much to handle. Even if this wasn’t a relationship problem i don’t have a soul to talk to. I wanted to not feel alone when it matters so bad that I just hugged myself to feel something. Seeing his family call him up to check on him vs me in the room completely alone with no hope of a shoulder to cry on when that’s all I want is sending me into a hopeless place that’s making me realize maybe I don’t matter in the world. All I am itching for is a someone. Loneliness has followed me my whole life but to see this cruel juxtaposition is making me realize this is what my life is doomed to be."

lonely,I want to do better,"I want to do better - I'm a recent college graduate. Lately I've just been greatly struggling with myself. I have days where I am feeling pretty down on myself and depressed at times and I do not know why. Things are not bad per say currently I help manage a hotel (which is a hour from current main home and the city) the hotel is owned by my foreign parents, they are pretty loving and I usually spend 2-3 days out of the week at the hotel assisting my parents while my parents are there all week(they also live on the property). The hotel has been a little difficult for my parents to manage because of the language barrier and technology barrier now since they are older but all in all they still manage, but me being there definitely makes things a lot easier for them. Managing hotels has always been the family business and something they have done for 30 years, while I love being able to help my parents and be there for them, I myself hate managing a hotel but I know my parents need my help for the time being. My parents also pay me decent for my time. Outside of the hotel I do photography which I do in the city, I am currently on a hiatus trying to rebrand my photography business but I have been struggling to find the motivation for it, many days I feel depressed and low and I do not get any work done. I get all in my head. I really want to advance in my career and find a path but I don't know how at times. I feel stuck.

Im also in a loving relationship and she is doing wonderful in her career something I would never say to her because I always support her and want the best for her but I do internally feel jealous at times at the amount of money she is making because its a good bit more than me and how she has a clear pathway for her but besides that I love her very much. I guess I just want to be on a good path like her, I get scared sometimes she will think I am a bum and leave me. I also struggle with also achieving my personal goals like working out, reading more etc.

Many days I have had thoughts of killing myself which sucks because I know I'm in a good position in life and I am still very young. I know my life isn't bad and there a lot of things to feel positive about but everyday when I wake up i think i want to do better. I want to do better in my career and get back to doing photography consistently and not struggling to work, I want to be a better boyfriend and son, I want to do better for myself. I struggle with staying focused and disciplined. So many days i feel lost and I do not know where i am going. I also find myself in the cycle of comparing to others.

Also last thing I am also addicted to porn and masturbation and it is so hard to stop like I have been trying and it is so hard."

I managed to get a couple of nights sleep, At least 5 hours, but I wake up restless and exhausted.

Then the girl suddenly pops up again saying she's  here for me, so I straight up tell her how I feel, but she starts talking about this random guy she met while playing Fucking fortnite like if he were a knight in shining armor. I told her not too long ago how I feel for her, and she's  never answered how she felt about me.

I've completely stopped doing most of my hobbies and now just use my free time either crying alone in my room or reading stuff on Reddit. Sometimes I walk around my neighborhood to help myself breathe and calm down, but it always only temporary. I started school today and I feel even more alone knowing that people don't want to be my friend or even talk to me in class.

This turns into me mainly just being used when convenient. But I can't say I blame anyone. I keep doing it and I don't try to change it or talk about it. I just smile and say yes and try to make them feel cared about and safe like I wish I was.

As a result I don't really have friends. I have awuaintences that I care deeply about, who don't think about me or know me much at all. 3 of then just moved away in the last month and now I'm alone physically, although I guess I've been spiritually alone for years. My heart hurts."

When I was younger I was confused, and curious. My family kept an eye on my behaviors and ended up confronting me and telling me I was too young to have a clue and would essentially be ruining my life..  I was moved across the state and pretty much forced to “start over” as all my home town friends (and family friends) had already become aware of how different I was.. it was always in the back of my mind.. am interest in same sex relationships, open to love and wanting to embrace this or atleast talk to people about it.. but my parents essentially ignored it, told me who I was, and kind of forced me into a box that was easy to manage..

Now I’m much older and while I have this being inside me.. like a whole persona that doesn’t really exist wants to just be validated. But over the years I came accustomed to being inside that box and coped with drugs, drinking, sex, and on many occasions “restarting” and moving around. But that’s not working anymore. I’m stable, I depend on others as those people depend on me.. but I’m not living as myself. And if I tell anyone I feel like I completely lose credibility and respect. And those people that I love will no longer love me."

lonely,I don't know how much longer I can take this.,"I don't know how much longer I can take this. - I have a constant and consistent nagging need for companionship that is never fully addressed. Yes, I have friends and I socialize as much as I can (lately less because of the challenges of Covid, which doesn't make things better for me). But I have a constant, nagging need for romantic companionship. I'm 28 year olds and I've never been in a relationship. I have a need for a deep, romantic connection and I have tried very hard to address this need. I have gone out on a number of dates and I've put myself out there, and they've never lead anywhere. A recent one ended poorly for me.

In what other area of life does someone communicate, ""I have a need that's not being met"" and the response is: ""Learn to live without it""? I'm so tired of this bullshit. I am constantly told, learn to be happy with being single, you don't need a partner to be happy, not everyone gets partners, etc. Great. I've had plenty of time to exist without a partner. I have my own apartment, my own car, two cats. I pay my own bills. I don't have someone to help me carry up heavy groceries to my apartment, I don't have someone to help me take out the trash -- I never get any help with basic things. I'm single and expected to be fully independent and capable of doing things that partnered people get help with on a consistent basis. I'm so sick of this. I don't want to be independent anymore. I want someone who cares about me, loves me, provides me with companionship, and helps me out as I do them.

I have a need that isn't being met, and I don't know how much longer I can take this. I've told myself that if by the time I'm 35, if things haven't gotten better, I'm ending it."

I don't even know what love is really, apparently, other people do though. I get called disgusting for being curious about dating. Sex and relationship subs hate me because they can just say ""were sex-positive banned!"" and laugh about how I'm not allowed to participate. 

Ive been wondering how to get into dating and such, but the only thing of is to have more money. 

I have quite a bit of money so far, but the number I keep hearing is 6 figures this and 6 figures that, I got maybe a quarter of 6 figures at my disposal but I'm still not getting dates or anything, so it does appear to be a threshold, where once 6 figures reach, you will be noticed. Or I will, I'm talking about me here. 

Like how water reaches a boiling point or freezing point at certain thresholds ill be noticed once I have 6 figures at my disposal."

But the only thing I can't change is the emptiness inside. When you work with enthusiasm, it's inexplicably sad when you come home to an empty room.   
At 37, I wanted stability and reliability; I'm not very demanding.

lonely,Any advice for someone with BPD and PTSD?,"Any advice for someone with BPD and PTSD? - I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder and PTSD after a four year stint in prison. I have learned a lot about BPD and I feel like I have come a long way in curving behaviors that are toxic and can create unwanted situations and cause loss of friendships. 
However since my release from incarceration I have become almost reclusive. I dread going into crowded places and such, checking out my corners and being overly cautious of my surroundings, etc. 
I used to be so outgoing and ready to get out of the house and be surrounded by friends. Now however I don’t keep as many friends as I used to but the ones close to me that call and invite me to do something currently I get so indecisive and dread the social interaction that awaits. It’s like pulling teeth. I just want to be like how I used to when I didn’t think about 100 different things and just went if I wanted to and wasn’t so high strung when do go places.
I’m a good friend to others I think but I’m alienating myself and creating my own prison of loneliness. Any advice about getting out of my head?
I see a psychiatrist and have explained my new social anxiety and my medication has been moved to higher doses. My meds are working great I know this because I don’t randomly hit rock bottom depression and lay in bed for long periods of time. 
Maybe some friendly motivation can help me out"
lonely,The hardest part is having nothing to look forward to.,"The hardest part is having nothing to look forward to. - All my friends have moved, my best friend recently, and I have been spending the last month and a bit in almost complete solitude. I’m back in uni after a break due to a close family members death, but due to my background and what can only be described as “rough” demeanour Ive been really struggling to connect with people. I don’t really try anymore, by this point people have made up their minds about me.

I just want to get my education down and go out into the world, cause I know things will get better once I do, but I find that with no friends or family, it’s very hard to be motivated. It used to be that the thought of having fun on the weekend would motivate me through the week, but know I know I’m just gonna clean the house, go to the gym and play video games. 

Guess I’m just sick of feeling sorry for myself. When people say they don’t know why they get up in the morning I get that, I just do it for the sake of it at this point. I have long terms goals, and that’s probably why I drag myself through the days, but it’s hard to comprehend the long term when it’s just the same repetitive emptiness every day."

I don't know what it is. I've sat here for 3 hours now, trying to talk to people, but on days like today, when nobody wants to, that alone feeling is crippling.

But then at the end of September, one of them fell very ill very suddenly and within less than a day he was gone. I still miss him a lot, he was the sweetest little boy.

Today I had a vet appointment with his sister. My beautiful, loving girl. Her kidneys are failing hard. Right now she's still lively and cuddly but it's a matter of days until I'll have to let her go.

This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Losing my two babies within four months of each other.
By next week I will be coming home to an empty, silent apartment and I don't know how to handle any of this.

I'll be spending her last few days with her, I'm not going anywhere as long as she is still with me. And when the time comes I'll have to get through it somehow."

&amp;#x200B;

But when you’re really alone you skip all that, because the only thing you’ll ever really do is die. And besides the empty distractions, you know it, it’s like being terminally ill, morbid sadness as your life passes by like scenery behind a car window. Your death will be a story in itself, your life will be reduced and objectified by how you died, how it was sad for the people who knew you, or failing that for the people who found you, or the paramedics who couldn’t save you, who’d forget about you the next day when someone else dies, someone who lost more, who will be missed more, because there’s nothing to miss of a lonely life. Lonely people are worthless collections of uninteresting sad days. The only thing they’ll ever do worth mentioning is die."
lonely,16M Struggling with getting my stuff together,"16M Struggling with getting my stuff together - I’m 16 and i recently got out of a lengthy toxic relationship. I’m one of those people where making others laugh makes me happy or just spending time with people makes me happy. Due to the pandemic i lost touch with basically all my friends and on a day to day basis it gets really challenging. I’ve also put on a lot of weight from being fit in the beginning of quarantine and i’m working on myself as in mentally and physically but every night i breakdown because i feel as though i’m never doing enough. I’ve been training ever single day and dieting just to at least be happy with when i look in the mirror and i’ve been seeing progress yet i still don’t feel happy. I told myself after my last breakup (a month ago) i’m not getting into any relationships or dating in general. However i managed to start talking to one of my old friends and we began flirting and it went on for like a couple of  days and i finally began to feel appreciated and loved again. I know people are gonna say love yourself before you love someone else i’ve gotten every speech and and advice ever. I just wanna share my story and not be judged like everyone else. Anyways i definitely thought there was a spark and even though it was just a few days, someone who’s been not even being able to smile whenever we’d even just text i couldn’t take that smile off of my face. Last night she told me she can tell i need to heal still from my previous relationship and that “we shouldn’t be doing this” i understand she cares about my well being and stuff which is good in the bigger picture but to me i just lost the one person who was pulling me out of the dark. I know i’m just 16 and im fairly young compared to the people here but i’ve experienced a lot and been through a lot. I try on a day to day basis to message people and just have some sort of interaction to make me happy knowing they’re okay but most of the time i don’t even get a reply. I don’t expect anyone to message me or check up on me because the people that knew me knew this is how i am they’d be shocked. I’m usually the life of the party and always smiling and laughing.  I guess i’ll just keep on training and staying in my corner because i’ve never been this scared to be hurt again and last night was tough especially because we were flirting for the whole night and then she hit me that she’s a good girl and at the end of the day she’s right plus she deserves better anyways if you’ve made it this far thanks for listening to my story ♥️."

One has been my friend for almost 2 years and a while after we started talking more mid-2021, he doesn’t say much back when I text him but he’s explained it’s because he’s an introvert and just doesn’t have much to say. But it’s still frustrating telling him a life problem he used to comfort me about but he just likes the message. Or I talk about my day and he says nothing back. I’ve been pretty lonely since adulthood began and it’s very frustrating and affects my mood when I either have no one to talk to about my day or I tell someone but they don’t say anything back. My other friend is more of a talking stage and we were talking a lot, I liked him back and he says he really likes me and would date me but he now takes half a day - days to text me back. He explained he just isolates himself when he’s going through something and isn’t used to texting anyone but it just makes me feel very lonely to not have someone to message about my life or anything. I hate that I’m an extrovert and this is my brain and I need to talk to people who I like to be happy. Social anxiety has also made making friends super hard and makes it all hell because I need so much social interaction, I don’t get nearly enough and then I’m scared of social interaction with new people. Then I’m scared I’m annoying and a burden for just sending 5 texts a day. Just wanted to vent somewhere lol."

I had left the house to actually go and my key fob wouldn't starty car. The alarm went off.  It took me over an hour to find my other key. The Court house was closed by than.  No big deal do it tomorrow.  I went and picked them up because they had no ride.  She asked did you get them and I told her what happened. She accused me of lying and got quiet. Now she's.nuts sometimes.  We get home I start making food. Everything is fine. Than she's watching TV and her mom calls.  She gets really angry and says no I'm not ok and turns to me who's behind her in the dining room and I say ummm what did I do?  She says fuck.you stay out of my life.  Than goes to the room slams the door. She does all this in front of our child.  I can hear her mom say why don't you stay with him he's always been good to you she says out loud. I'm not gay I've never been gay we've been together for 15 years ! She's full of shit.   I got up went and knocked on th door and she went nuts.  She opened it said I'm a liar I'm a piece of shit.  She shoves me into a door and starts screaming and growling saying she's going to kill me iny sleep and that gay and trans people are gross.and that I'm gross and that out child isnt. Mine and I'll never see her again my daughter ndaid stop I'm scared I love pop you can't do that. I started crying she said you little baby bitch wah wah. Than shoves me again and told her mom I was abusive to her which isn't true. All over not getting papers.   Sorry venting. I left the house for an hour. Came back she was still very rude she went to sleep. And I haven't been to sleep at all. I'm at work now and devastated. My heart is pounding.  I only have my daughter. And my one niece.

lonely,Sucks having so few friends and such terrible anxiety towards making new ones when you're constantly craving company.,"Sucks having so few friends and such terrible anxiety towards making new ones when you're constantly craving company. - All I want in life is people to play some videogames with, alright? Like, just some buddies I can Discord with and hunt some monsters in MHR, play Apex, Overwatch, shit like that. But I've got next to none.

It feels like that should be WEIRD, shouldn't it? I'm a twenty-something woman, sweet as hell and not particularly strange, but I have NO friends.

Scratch that I've got all of three friends, all of which have — a lot more friends to hang out with than me. And I'd feel so, so bad trying to demand some more attention like a best. So I've been trying to make some new friends, y'know? Discord servers, subreddits, etc.

I just — can't do it for some reason. It's not like there's anything wrong with me — I've got people that really try with me, but I'm so anxious all the time. I don't even know why. I want to hang out, laugh, have some fun — I just want to CHILL. But people make me clam up and before I can even step out of my shell they're too tired of waiting and give up, it seems.

Christ's sake, the past couple of Discord servers I REALLY loved the people in them. I felt bold and spoke with them a little (even if I was too shy to VC, which sucks 'cos I feel like I haven't had a conversation with anyone outside of my family in ages), then I woke up and suddenly want to leave as quietly as I can. For what reason? That doesn't even make sense, it just IS and I hate it.

It's so miserable. I want to socialize so badly, but I feel completely incapable of managing it.

I want LEADERS as friends. Because I'm not one. I'm too shy to even really be called a follower. I'm more like a lurker waiting for someone to just magically know I'm there and want to talk. But that's a ridiculous expectation. It isn't friendship if everyone involved isn't BEING involved, but for some reason I can't even do that.

God, I'm so bored and I'm so tired and I wish I had what other people had. I want random friends that text me while I sleep and just call me while I'm making dinner, that'll play games with me and watch the latest trendy anime with me, teach me how to play DND, just make me feel like I'm on someone's mind and give me a reason to want to see stupid memes and send them because, ""Oh, ___ would get a kick out of this."" 

Nobody's ever patient enough with me to let me get there, though, and it sucks. I can't help being shy. I really wish I wasn't. I'm so lonely all of the time because of it. But it feels like there's nothing I can do about it at all."

lonely,I do not have even one friend for 8 years now,"I do not have even one friend for 8 years now - Hi  girl from Eastern European country first I want to apologize for my bad English 
I am disabled and I have severe autistim I have the highest degree of disability on paper I say it so you could imagine how bad it is 

I do not even have one friend for 8 years now as I was homeschooled and when I still went to school or kindergarten they would bully me because I was and I am still different 

I am so lonely I worry about my future and my parents are old and I bring them only suffering because of how disable I am in fact they must help me with such simpe things as taking shower, getting dressed , they cannot work because they need to take care of me 24/7 and the government gives us insurance 

I do not know how it feels to have a true friend I never had any true friend 
I am very tired of life last time I went outside alone without help of my parents was 3 years ago and I do not know how to meet someone new in my small town as there only live 5000 people and people already know of me and they have built my impression on me 

I do not want internet friends I want to have a contact with someone I. Real life I am tired of everything and of the suffering I bring to my parents 

I do not know how to start 😔 but then again every body knows about me :’( and I will never move out of this town or ever get a job :("

I have just spent so much of my time already talking about things. So much thinking. The definition of overwhelmed. Then something even worse happened today, outside of anyone's control. I haven't been sleeping, distressed over certain other things, and then this really awful thing happened. Nobody is here to comfort me because everyone is distressed, or busy, which is OK. I've offered my service and heart to the people around me today, to help them. But man, I am so overwhelmed that I am just about totally mute. Please say hi. Tell me about something positive happening in your life. I do not only just want to be distracted, I want to think about you instead of myself or the people I know."

lonely,I feel like everyone hates me,"I feel like everyone hates me - I'm a  and I feel like everyone I meet hates me. For some reason no one wants to talk to me. I occasionally have small-talk with people, but its mostly just brief discussions about school. Even the people who I've previously considered friends don't talk to me about much aside from this now.

I can only assume it's a problem with me, as everyone else seems to socialize fine. I don't know what I'm doing wrong though. I don't think I'm that socially awkward--when people try talking to me I don't avoid the conversation and I try to be interesting. I don't think my personality is that bad too: I'm not rude/mean to anyone. I don't really talk to new people unless they initiate a conversation with me first, through--out of fear that they don't want to talk to me. Multiple times just in the past year when I have asked someone new something they ignored me.

I only have 1 person I consider a ""real"" friend now, as in he seems to be the only person who actually wants to talk/listen to me. Then again, our conversations aren't very ""deep"", just about a few mutual interests. I just wish I had someone to open up to and have personal conversations with, but I don't feel comfortable sharing with any of the people I know. If most people don't even want to even talk to me, why would they want to hear this? The one person I opened up to in my entire life was an online friend, who's since stopped talking to me, unfortunately.

I was just wondering if anyone had any advice on how to open up more and get more social. I feel like its too late for my current situation, as I'm graduating high-school soon. Hopefully I'll improve by the time I start university."

It's a constant nagging sadness, sleepless nights of shameful tears and clutching until I manage to fall asleep. With no one to really turn to else I feel that... I don't know. This all goes, hand in hand with other feelings I've had these past few weeks that have come to a head tonight.

I've never really made these posts before... or reached out in this sense, so i apologize.

I don't really have anyone online, i don't have anyone in person, I don't feel like what I do have is... well, available or willing to help. As I mentioned, like I'm stumbling alone... waiting to fall.

I feel numb... Incredibly numb lately and it scares me... and wish I had something, anything, truly...

lonely,How long can one pretend to love themselves?,How long can one pretend to love themselves? - You hear it all the time. You can only make friends or start dating when you learn to love yourself. I’ve really tried and even went out and did things alone if I didn’t have anyone to go with but at the end of the day. I feel like it’s just coping and being alone makes you want people around you more. My favorite thing to do is to take long walks at the beach. I’ve done it alone many times and every single time I wished someone was there with me. I really tried to like being alone but I know I’m just pretending to like it. I always tell myself I’m better off alone but I know that’s a lie deep down. But that’s just me. The worst part honestly is seeing couples around and knowing that it’s something you don’t have and feels unachievable.

I just don’t get it. The only time someone might be willing to talk is if I message them first and even then, I may get late responses or none at all, yet still they constantly post on their stories. I am a nice person you know. Like, I care so much about people more than I even think of myself and they don’t seem to even want to hang out or text.

In my country we are free to go out despite the whole covid thing, but even before it began, no one would ever invite me to a party or a chill session that they keep with other people. I’m used to staying home alone. 

I delete numbers just cuz they leave me on read most times i text them. Like whats the point. I’m not included in any friend groupchats. my whatsapp and imessage is always empty unless its from work or my parents.

Im getting tired of this loneliness and maybe id be better off in the ground. probably if i was a celebrity they’d always answer my messages or calls."

The other day there there was a group of 3 playing on my team and I was the odd one out but it was okay, it really fun hearing them cuz they were a group of friends and i could hear them laughing and making jokes and stuff, and then the match ends and i cant hear them anymore. and i realize how much i miss that, how much id like to just laugh with someone playing a game.

I have a girlfriend and we play other games and im so thankful f or her of course, but i'd just like a group of friends. We watched a movie last night about a boy becoming more social and getting a friend group (a silent voice) and at the end i just kept thinking how much i wish i had that"

For a long time, I’ve been trying to keep a positive attitude and stay motivated, stay in contact with friends and just continue moving along day to day. But I’m realizing recently that I’ve just been going through the motions. I’m so depressed I can barely get out of bed most days and I try to keep in contact but I can feel my friendships drifting and my only instinct is to survive, rather than continue struggling to build any sense of community or deep friendship. The only thing I look forward to these days is drinking on the weekend and having just a few hours where my brain can shut off, but even that is just making me feel more depressed and disconnected these days. I have a partner who I love and who treats me so well, but I struggle even to connect with him as I feel like I am spending most of my time trying to avoid being present. I guess I just need some positive words, some ideas about how to connect with myself and the world again. I feel so lonely and exhausted."

lonely,Has anyone ever gotten out of their pit of loneliness only to get pulled back into it?,"Has anyone ever gotten out of their pit of loneliness only to get pulled back into it? - I'm asking because I'm trying to mentally prepare for it. I'm almost 27 and I've been horribly depressed and lonely most of my life, but in the past 2 months, I've finally found a local community of weirdos like me and have probably been the happiest I've ever been. What sucks is I'll be moving 800 miles away in May, and the town I'll be living in is way out in the middle of nowhere. Like, it's a 15-20 minute drive to go to the grocery store, not to mention there's barely anyone my age around, and what few there are definitely not really my kind of people. On top of that, even when I was at my worst where I live now, I at least had some concerts and events to look forward to, but where I'll be moving to, everything like that will be 3 or 4 hours away; it's just a weirdly located remote place where any major cities are super far away.

I have no choice in the matter either because I'm currently living with my dad and can't afford my own place, probably not even with roommates, and it's got me totally unsure of what to do. All I can think of is to try and emotionally brace myself for taking 30 steps backward socially. Does anyone have any advice on preparing myself for this?"

lonely,"Fixing loneliness through the implantation of a ""lunch break act""","Fixing loneliness through the implantation of a ""lunch break act"" - As most of you know, loneliness is a big issue in the world. The United States and Japan are both labeled as some of the most lonely countries in the world. For a while now, I've been trying to figure out why is this the case. Why isn't working enough? Why is finding social activities that benefit our interests so hard? Why are we scared of talking to someone we don't know very well while in high school we could've known over 50 people and not scared to talk to any of them? I believe the solution to this situation can be found within the public school system. 

School is a lot like work in a way. Kids are expected to go from one class to the next to learn things that should be beneficial to their lives...But there's just one thing sticking out. Children are given double the opportunities to socialize than adults in the workplace. Due to the many clubs, they could join down to the most important thing in my opinion...The lunch break.

Working is like school with the expectation to be in class and follow rules all day. Sometimes without a break. This causes people to become distant from others because imagine how hard it was trying to socialize with your fellow students while class started. That is working for more than 8 hours a day. 

Now how do we fix this? We must understand that this situation cannot be systemically fixed through people's advice online on ""how to be confident enough to make friends with your coworkers."" It sure wasn't like that in high school. And you know it. It was a lot easier to talk to someone because what else were you going to do when you weren't pressured into listening to what a teacher said or doing a pop quiz. At work, they expect you to do outside of what you're supposed to do just to keep you from ""wasting your boss' clock."" That's why your relationships with your coworkers are so much more divided than it was with your classmates. And to fix this, it won't take the kindness of your manager or the hope that the CEO of the company you're working for will give in to the loneliness epidemic in your country...But a simple law was passed by the government to make things better.

It starts with something simple. I dub it, the ""lunch break act."" This act will require companies making a certain amount of money to shut down for a certain time for their workers to eat in peace without their breaks being cut short because they're needed in a certain area. Food would be provided for free or very inexpensive. Now you may be asking, what is the point of this? When you were on break at school you were kind of forced to talk to people to break whatever awkward silence there was when eating. This caused people to find their social groups where they fit in and grow closer with their classmates. And the same effect should happen in the workplace. I believe work tricks people into thinking that they don't want friends by making it so hard to make friends. But when allowed to do so, I believe these ""work-focused"" types will break down and socialize in the same way as the ""academically focused student"" does.

lonely,"men, do better.","men, do better. - It’s official, I hate reddit men. They all are just horny ass things that jump around in every sub reddit with the goal to make every underage girl uncomfortable. I don’t get any of them tbh. Every man on here is miserable. They either are insecure, a horny pedophile or hate themselves and are lonely. Now I get being insecure, it’s nothing wrong with that at all. I know me telling you that you’re good is not gonna make you not be insecure anymore, if that makes sense. But like, why must you be so fucking negative 24/7, damn. You ask what’s wrong and they don’t fucking talk, like dude. I honestly do care about mens mental health, it is just as important as womens mental health bc women are not the only ppl that have problems, things do happen to men too and i understand that, but like you can’t get the proper help if you don’t fucking talk. Wait, that came out wrong ngl. Sorry to all of the men on here, your mental health is truly important to me and you have the right to open up when you’re ready. I’m saying it’s not good to hold in your feelings, you don’t have to try to be so tough and manly 24/7, it’s okay to feel down some times.  I hope you all do better in life and I hope you find something that genuinely makes you happy. And not temporary happiness. Men can cry.
To the horny fucks on here, don’t be so weird and stop grooming young ppl.

TLDR; i hate men, but i feel so bad for them, their mental health is important. fuck the pedos fr tho"

lonely,Have you ever wondered ... ?,"Have you ever wondered ... ? - To set the context : i'm 27M,  i moved out from my parents last year and have been living alone in my appartment since then, i haven't dated anyone in 4 years despite searching and i barely communicate via facebook with the few friends i have left who all lives hours away from me. Anyway i spent most of my days off-work alone in my appartment geeking.

So it's a little bit edgy and cringy but since my social life outside of work has become close to non-existant, i've started to often asked myself that question : 

If i happen to die (ex : heart attack), how much time would pass before someone would be looking for me and knok on my door and who would that person be beside my boss ?

I honestly am too affraid to find the answer and yet i still think about it a lot as dark as it is. 

So i am curious if anyone else ever did the same  and if that would be considered somehow ""normal"" when feeling lonely. And to be clear i am **not** suicidal ! Just bored and miserable."

lonely,Pain,"Pain - In ways, I (28f) don't feel like I deserve to complain here because i'm married, but I still feel so alone, all the time, sometimes even more so. Ive been sick and I just have to weather it the best I can while being a good wife. When he (29m) gets sick, I have to tend to his every beck and call however. This wouldnt even bother me if he at least say nice things like he used to, now he just cuts me down at any chance he gets..everything i do seems to be wrong. I just spent all night crying in pain in a different room so I wouldnt wake him up and make him upset. Something is wrong with me medically, but if I would have woken and made him sleepy for work the next day, he would have been pissed. We used to be friends and play on xbox but now wont even play xbox with me, sex definitely is now just me giving blowjobs or him just giving two pumps and a ""sowwie :( "" in that voice too.  I feel like im never good enough..... its funny but ive tried suicide twice and my own husband doesn't even know. This is obviously just a rant, probably gunna delete or something, I dont know, hell.  I don't know what to do anymore,

Today was one of those days where my mom and I got into it because I didn’t want to pursue medicine

She kept on telling me why I didn’t want to do it?

I said it was never in me, never had a passion for people, I never had a say with what I wanted to do anyways.

I also said that no one in my immediate/extended family are doctors anyways.

I keep on telling her the pros of what I want to do. And if that doesnt work I’d just pursue music.

She interrupted me saying that I’m too hardheaded and I never listen

Your choice of friends? Look at you now you literally have no friends

A job? Look at where you are now?

Driving early (without a permit)? Couldn’t do that

Hobbies? You’re literally pathetic and on Reddit 24/7 if not that you’re always stuck in your room or watching porn 

You want to do computer science? When you can’t even naturally interact with others…good luck with that

And if not music again, your choice

Majority of these artists are poor and stuck into crappy labels. 

You just don’t fucking listen do you?

That’s why YOU FAILED ME

In my head I was like, I could never please her

Let’s say I finally take the premed route but choose another specialization they’ll still be conflict would I still be happy?

I mean everything she said isn’t wrong either, it’s not like I have anything going for me either

I essentially feel blind to my own intuition as every mistake I make, not even mistake but every choice I make is always comes out as shitty and bad.

It sucks because at one point I was like damn ma, you were my idol at one point. And to throw it all away just because you don’t want me to do what you want is sad and disheartening"

My school was far from home (it was a posh one) but it was never fun! As a result after lockdown the interaction with my only 3 friends stoped!
My parents had that old ideologies where it's better to beat your kids to death when they start showing personality traits or asking for privacy so they never tried to support me mentally (mental support isn't a thing according to them) more on that I am a failure to them.
That's not it I have a sister too who loves to bully, shout or yell at me for unnecessary reasons (I'm like a punching bag to her)
I haven't talked properly to my father since I was like 14 two years later I stopped talking to mother too, cause was like those side taking beings who like to take side and corner the other.
And from the last 2 years I living like a rental guy in my own parents house. Gonna move out and never gonna look back again. Over these years I had stoped giving shit about things, stoped being bothered, I am more on the selfish side of the spectrum.
I had never felt loved all I have felt is alone!

27F Back in Dec, we went out to dinner and talked for 3 hrs. We were in contact via Instagram messages. Later in wk we talked on the phone to buy tickets &amp; see the Spider-Man movie. Eventually I asked he could stop sending those IG video reels politely, it was a bit overboard. I was not as bubbly at movies compared to when we first met up, I was very quiet (not against him). He was annoying me during the movie, he’s the type to laugh and make noises when something exciting came on. He nudged me during the movie and asked if I was ok because I was quiet and I said yes. At the end I told him thanks, he said you’re welcome and he said drive safe. When we first met, we ended with a hug. When we spoke on phone, he told me that he talked about me with his friends but at movies it was odd, he sent a message after saying that he wasn’t really feeling it from me and it’s not going to work for him. Flash fwd to yesterday, he sends a message on IG with a reference to Xbox exclusives, we used to be back &amp; forth about console wars. He continued to follow me on IG but I removed him when he called it quits, yet he unmatched me on the dating app. While I would have stopped talking to him regardless, why is it so hard to find connection?

So yeah I’m kinda drained right now. Me and this guy are getting along, he says he treats his friends as his “precious little treasures” and I can talk to him about anything any time. He says he’s really chill with anything and he just wants to support others and make them feel special.

I message him today and he’s going on about how he wishes his close friends were in the same time zone so they can play together. I suggest we play together. He suggests a moba that we both played. I tell him that mobas tend to get people really tilted and it might not be a good idea. He reassured me that he just wants to have fun with friends. I tell him okay then let’s go standard because I don’t play ranked. To which he says he doesn’t like standard because of how hard it is to find good players. I just tell him that it’s standard so there’s nothing to lose and so no reason to get tilted but he won’t go for it. Here’s the full conversation afterwards.

Him: “oof I’d help you climb but I probably can’t match with you”
Me: “I mean climbing isn’t the problem I just don’t want to play ranked”
Him: “fair enough, I don’t really blame you for not wanting to” (I assume this is his way of trying to say I’m trash for not playing ranked)
Me: “alright guess that’s off the table then”
Him: “well I play standard but only with friends so...”

I guess fuck me then. I don’t understand how this makes any sense."

My boyfriend hasn’t been around so the only human contact I’m getting is sitting in lecture and waiting on tables (I waitress on the side to pay for school). Anyways I’ve been really lonely lately. I’m kinda scared where I live from past problems with my neighbors so I spend all my downtime home alone worrying I’m unsafe. Anyways, I got off work today around 3 and was so sad I was going to have to go sit in my apartment alone for the rest of the night. To my surprise, a coworker asked me to go shopping and watch a movie at her place. I had never hung out with this coworker before but she’s always been so nice to me at work. I had a great time, I never shop for clothes as I’m anxious to go alone so I was so excited to go. I even spoiled myself and bought a couple outfits for clinicals. I had sm fun but as soon as I left I got pulled over plugging my phone in bc it “looked like I was on my phone”. I pulled directly into the arbys besides where I was pulled over to buy dinner before going home, My heart was beating so hard from getting pulled over and I was shaking. During my panick attack I hit the curb. I destroyed my tire (I bought 4 months ago) I destroyed my rim, and scuffed my paint. Now I’m in bed crying myself to sleep bc I don’t understand why I can’t ever just be happy? I had a fantastic night and this is how it ended?

lonely,Trying to do good things every day hopefully something good happens.,"Trying to do good things every day hopefully something good happens. -  currently in college. 

In my whole first semester of college I have made 0 friends and now in my second semester, I have on average 1 conversation every 2 weeks with my therapist. It’s incredibly lonely and I struggle with so much self doubt and anxiety and this contributed to the fact I have no friends in college. 

I have friends back home from high school, but I am the least social one and I realized I was always the left out one at parties and things and it only got worse as I got older. I would leave functions by myself just to excessively punch myself in the head because I felt like I couldn’t fit in with them and I hated myself for it. 

I thought college was going to bring me a fresh start and it did, but I have just become a loner. I am always by myself, I do everything alone. All my friends from high school notice too because I would tweet depressing things about how I was lonely (regret that btw). I hated myself so much i started cutting because I lost control in the loneliness
 
Fast forward to now, nothings changed about my environment, still a loner, but I just keep myself motivated by telling myself keep doing these good things (working out every day, eating healthy, finishing all assignments) and good things will happen eventually. 

Its just so 
Fucking 
Hard though 
I still have intrusive thoughts and I always have thoughts of quitting but I’m just stuck in a paradox i guess"

I can’t do them alone cause I’m too scared and not independent enough to make sure I don’t die along the way. It’s better to have someone to do these things with.

It’s weird cause I have no issues talking to people, I can carry a conversation and I can make connections. Ir just never feels like any of them are genuine.

I was able to have a heart to heart with my mom and brother recently. That felt good. I still have my 3 so to a normal eye it would seem like I’m not lonely. Little do most know though that loneliness isn’t just being alone. You can have people around, but when you you aren’t checked on, it’s just useless. 

I have hope one day I can get through this feeling. I hate this shit."

lonely,"Use to be a social butterfly, now dead","Use to be a social butterfly, now dead - It's a rant so it's probably gonna be long - if you have any suggestions feel free to drop it in comments

Start from the starting - i used to be a very shy socially awkward guy with little to no talents - My parents never let me as a kid to step out and my whole pre teen years i was pretty much locked up alone in home (without TV) so i used to read books - and slowly i got studious - Straight 10 and became ranker


In class 5th i saw a girl (maybe noticed for the first time) - liked her - But she didn't care enough to talk - I tried to start talking (random stuff - school work and cartoons - i didn't know what and how to talk to girls) but i was the loser so obviously she never even responded (not even courtesy)

6th class - we all sections got mixed up - i saw the opportunity- became the most loud, flamboyant boy i could - Started getting great response - immediately scoring chicks - i went by fake it till you make it attitude - just started playing cool and everyone want to be my friend (sounds dumb but worked back then)

6-8th i had my blast -  fun fun and fun - everything happening around me - i was the hotshot

9th - I started getting higher ambitions - made new friends - older and more influential- moved upwards - still hanged around school friends but my new social group was the main one - parties and adventure- meanwhile in school i had a fight (very major - almost rusticated) so since then i realised school dudes are bunch of dumfucks - i absolutely didn't care to be a part of anything - my life was beyond school - with my new rich kid gang (FYI I'm not rich , I'm not even middle class - Straight poor with extremely strict parents)

10th - One of the rich kids girlfriend got attracted to me - i tried my best not to indulge , but things piled up and all those rich kids ganged up and beat me to pulp - barely left me alive , it was a task to not let this come to my parents - and i didn't have any influencial plugs or money to pull anything on my own since all rich friends ganged up on me (and the girl was given a clean chit even though she was at fault - she almost raped me - cent per cent)

11th and 12th i told myself to focus on studies and not indulge in anything - Even my school group reshuffled in 11th and i was all alone without a single friend - Made some acquaintances (they were so dumb but still i needed atleast someone in the class for homework and stuff)
I put all my energies , deleted all social handles , absolutely cutoff from the remaining good friends to focus on studies so i could land a good college and hopefully a reboot in social life

End of school -  didn't get a good college - Absolutely no social circle (i mean it - I dont have a single person to talk to - sometimes it gets weeks or months without me talking to anyone except teachers and my own parents)

Covid came in 1st yr of college - Now I'm about to graduate - i don't have any friend circle - I'm not the dumb kid (i swear - whosoever talks to me - I hit it off pretty well) - During covid i tried my level best to catchup with the school friends but they simply didn't want me back ; Cabt try to catchup with the rich kids cause they might be still dangerous and violent (i hope not since it has been 5 years but they are literal goons fucking politician kids so i dont want to take any chances)

Made some friends in college (like 2 3) but due to covid we never got to meet- They all have their own social circles and beyond assignments we never discuss anything else 

Back in 6th to 10th i used to be the king in my School - even when i didn't cared enough , everything and everyone use to be on my fingers 
Now if i die tonight - Nobody would care enough to give a flying fuck
I have been for them whenever they needed, I'm a good person , even when i didn't wanted to be a part of school drama - i always protected them from externalities.

Now i have a group of dumb school mates (only those are willing to take me in) - And recently i fucked up my face even worse - i got braces

I also have soooo much family issues and abuse - which lead to pent up angerr soo deep - even when i try to be most sweet - My voice comes out to be the rudest and meanest of all - even when i say things in love- sounds like Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley all the time

I can't get girls , dont have friends, didn't get any major academic achievements (i invested alotttttt of time on that with hopes that It'll pay off well and atleast it will first of all make me financially independent- so i can crawl out of my hellhole house and abusive parents - and give me a status to bring back some social life and fun in life ; but even that didn't panned out as it was supposed to be)


I don't know what to do , some nights i feel so suicidal - can't even explain. (No sympathy just sharing my state of mind)"

lonely,Handling rejection sucks monkey butt,"Handling rejection sucks monkey butt - When your dreams reminded you of what you could have, it sucks.  You try to be compassionate, rejected!  Make cookies for him on the first date, rejected!  I just want a loving relationship.  I want to meet people but at the same time I fear heartbreak.  I can go into deep depressions about heartbreak since I really don’t have that many guys wanting me (hard to believe since I’m a girl on social media.).  It makes you cynical and it makes you feel even worse about yourself.  Getting ghosted before the second date is the worst. Especially since you thought you had something with this guy.  I don’t how people deal with getting rejected all the time (especially if they don’t get approached often).  This makes me even more self conscious everywhere you go!  It makes me feel like I have to be perfect before even getting a little bit of love.  It doesn’t help that I heard on the internet that you hit the wall at 25 where you can’t attract men anymore."

lonely,What is loneliness?,"What is loneliness? - I would like to hear your opinions.
I have been asking myself this for years. This all comes from my situation, I'm a very shy guy who had to change university after the first year and because of both things, did not friends the first year, and neither the following ones because you know, most university connections are made on first year or generate from that ones..
So, now I'm in a city where I have nothing near to a close one, but the thing is... I still have a little group of guys from school that I'm very friend with. I love them, but you know, they are now in other places meeting new people and we only see each other and almost only talk when we come back to the city we grew up and, to be honest, I've changed a lot and sometimes I wish we had more things in common 


I feel very lonely sometimes, it hits me hard the fact that it's been literally 4 years of making nothing near a friend, makes me doubt of myself. I have obviously spoke with people, but all of the conversations are about university work.

Is it bad to feel lonely when I have that group of friends that really makes me feel great, but only in certain periods? 
I sometimes feel bad because I've never told then how I feel for them to change how or relation works but it's hard to change that hard the way our group works, and also, I don't want to just have them, I want new connections and the lack of that makes me feel alone but because of having this little friendship I think I don't end up to gather courage to try harder... Because you know ""I guess I have something"".

Lonely? Idk :c"
lonely,Does anyone else act recklessly just to not be alone for a little while?,"Does anyone else act recklessly just to not be alone for a little while? - Every few weeks when I have another Friday or Saturday night stretching ahead of me with no plans, I say screw it, and go to a local bar by myself. Sometimes that means a couple of hours drinking alone and then I go home; but I’m a relatively young and somewhat attractive woman so more than half the time, it means some random mix of loser/creepo dudes hitting on me. (It’s never the good ones, they’re there with friends and girlfriends.)


Because I’m lonely I usually entertain the conversation and then at least some of the time end up taking them home, mostly just so I won’t be alone. And then we have meaningless sex which is rarely good because they’re drunk, or I go down on them because honestly, it’s just easier. And then they go home the next morning, I never talk to them again, and just ultimately feel worse about myself.


Anyone else do anything like this? I know the ‘smart’ answer is to find healthy meetups (like literally through meetup), but those have a whole lot more pressure and anxiety attached."

lonely,My pathetic story,"My pathetic story - Used to have a so-called normal life;  married, kids, friends, social life etc. Belonged to a conservative Christian church my whole life, meet wife there. Have medical condition that is treated with abusible meds (opiods, medical marijuana etc) which i began abusing a few years ago. 

As the meds affected my decision making, i sought some help from church elders who decided instead that i ought to be expelled, excommunicated. Family sided with the church - their choice. Everyone i know disappear from my life back 8 months or so ago as no one is allowed to speak with an expelled ex-nember.

Quit the meds, in pain often but clear headed. My life was full - so many things always happening and to look forward to. Now, between COVID and this, i haven't spoken to a soul in over 5 months except for phone contact with MD or banking. 

Completely alone now,  I'm a guy in his late 40's prime looking for an affectionate relationship with maybe a married woman who is also very alone. I have a lot to offer, have no job, no commitments on my time, can meet up, can afford weekend's to play in NYC with you... or here discreetly in NJ.

Would love to just get to know someone who is interesting, mature, lonely but not desperate, not ashamed of her looks or body, interested in getting to know a potential soul mate and is open to a  potentially physical relationship. I long for touch, cuddling, laying around in bed undressed, laughing... wasting days just being together. Fucking is on the table too if we are both in agreement. The table, the floor or a bed. 

Anyway hmu if any of this is appealing and you might fit the paradigm. DM's are best."

lonely,Title,"Title - Fuck men why is life such a bitch on us? I'm tired of this. Why can't my own mind stop hijacking my wellbeing. 

And let me tell you, it's not anyone's fault. They have the chance to go with the flow and live happily, in their own bubble, they don't suffer like we do, so why would I blame people for ignoring me? But we, the lonely, are doomed to misery. We are the last step in society. Not a single soul looks at us, marginalized and miserable, that's how we live.

And the normal people still have the guts to give advice. They told me to have hobbiers, excersice, balanced diet, set goals. It was a fucking lie.

What else do I fucking need to be happy? I did everything they told me, and for some time I deluded myself into happines, but the illusion broke down, I'm left with the ruins of a once happy person. But I'm lucky, I have friends and a loving family, but even then, the same misery as always. 

I wish I could go back to the summer of 2019, when I was blissfuly ignorant of my sourroundings, I felt extremely loved, and everything was fine, but looking back, people were just laughing at me. I even thought a girl was in lov with me, but of course, no. 

It's always no, it's always something wrong, it doesn't matter when I do, I can't stop being lonely. Please i just want a hug, I just want to hear ""you're my best friend, I love you"" once more please i don't want this life, please, life, fool me again into happines.

Also, I'm really ugly, sometimes people look at me and laugh, I have froggy looking eyes, I'm balding and I'm extremely disproportionate. I look like a fucking alien, so if I ever get the guts to talk to some girl, she will just go with her friends and laugh. I've had people take pictures of me and forget to turn off the flash

I stayed up late nights till morning with her before because she was suicidal too, and other emotionally heavy and difficult situations in her life. But the one time I need her, she f*cking ditches me.

It's been 4 nights since that, and I haven't been able to sleep more than 1 or 2 hours per night.

lonely,"Kinda lonely, kinda bored","Kinda lonely, kinda bored - Hey Guys!

Im so excited to be on reddit. Its like the most fun place ever. You get to meet all kinds of cool people. 

I guess my only probz is why am I not meeting cool people like you in real life ?? 😅


So I moved back to my hometown after college. And got a job here. I had some friends here growing up - but some of them were really toxic (involved pulling some really bad shit on me, involved theft, blackmail, bullying etc) - so I cut them off and the other friends, I tried to get back in touch w them, we hung out a couple of times but they were reallllllyyyyyy boring. I got really bored lmao. 

I have a cool place where I live.  Its a huge community. Lots of people my age. Lots of amenities like squash courts, basketball ball, library, a pool … But I guess I dont know how to befriend people ? I srsly dont know how go make friends and im fckn 24 - I know thats a lame ass thing to accept, but Ive just got to accept it lmfao. Altho im trynna get out of that stinky victim mentality but it creeps in from time to time 


Any thoughts would be appreciated."
lonely,Just my opinion,Just my opinion - Everyone suck no one real and no one give a damn about anyone but themselves. Fact. Forever. Never changing truth. Literally u open yourself up a bit and someone will always show and remind you how stupid that idea was. Enough doors shutting in one's face makes them turn around and walk a whole different path to a land where no one will ever need to feel disturbed by that person. Everyone ghosting blocking leaving on read. There is no such thing as real love here in this realm of hell. Only thing that's real is being alive and dying. Everything else is illusion.
lonely,Feeling lonely by choice?,"Feeling lonely by choice? - Hi I'm new to Reddit. I'm 23 (M) and I've generally been quiet my whole life. I think this stems from my autism and social anxiety, but I've come to accept those things. Since the pandemic, however, I've been obsessed with the fact that I don't have any deep connections with others. While I do have a few acquaintances online via Discord, I don't find those connections very deep and I feel like I'm missing out on ones that could be better. 

My main issue is that I've been increasingly reluctant to make new friends. Doing so irl is proving to difficult because I am still trying to protect myself and my mother who is also a cancer survivor (we still live together). Online, however, I feel like it's increasingly hard to find anyone I fit in with. Unlike most of my peers, I don't invest time in online gaming, social media or interest-specific things that bring people together. I've occasionally tried getting into new discord servers and introduced myself, only to feel uncomfortable and end up leaving the server before anyone could really notice me (I've kept myself away from the ones that tried to initiate conversation with me).

My past experience with friends has been... mixed. Like I said I have a few acquaintances online whom I get along with, but I've had closer ""friendships"" in the past that ended up being toxic and harmful to me. I've pulled out from those, but I have a hard time trusting new people. 

There is plenty I could do to branch out more, but I find myself questioning whether it's worth it. I generally find socializing draining and an obstacle to things that are more important to me, like learning to code and getting a job that suits my interests. On the flipside, my brain is making me feel bad for not having a social circle and functioning like a ""normal"" human being. I don't know why I get caught up in that because deep down I know I don't mind being an outsider. I try to convince myself that maybe I won't feel so lonely if I just follow my dreams and let the rest sort itself out, but what if I'm wrong? Am I a weirdo for putting myself in a ""lonely"" position before I've even set out on the things I want to do?"
lonely,I feel like a caged animal.,"I feel like a caged animal. - I know I'm not. I have freedom to make choices but I feel so stuck in life right now that I just can't seem to make progress. I lay in bed, switching through the same few apps, pining and obssessing over someone who only kind of likes me back. They know I like them a lot, but they don't know how deep it runs. I check my phone constantly for messages from them. I check their social media a dozen times a day. I can't bring myself to message them first too often or I feel like I'm coming across as annoying or too clingy. I have a few friends, and I enjoy their company a lot, but I feel so lonely still.

 It's gotten to the point that I feel suicidal. I began self harming. The person I love knows I did it once, and made me promise to tell them if I did it again, but I did it for the second time recently and I can't bring myself to tell them. I'm scared it's going to make them pull away more. I know they'd be upset if they found out I did it without reaching out. 

Yesterday I blocked them on Discord, I told them I meant nothing mean of it and I just needed to do it, because I really did need to - I couldn't stop myself from checking their profile every half an hour to see what they were playing or listening to. I still have other ways they could contact me if they needed to, like through the phone, because I didn't want to lose all contact, I just needed to stop myself from basically cyber-stalking them.

I just want to be their main focus, like I used to be when we were together. I know that isn't healthy, but I can't stop this."

lonely,Pooped in my pant inhigh school,"Pooped in my pant inhigh school - I was a very timid shy and lonely boy as a child and got scared easily. In my high school there was a time i wanted to go poop, but did not dare admit because everyday there was a fat guy going there, and people used to make fun of him. I asked the teacher if I can go for a piss, and she said no you can wait, so i sat down. But I couldn't control and asked her loudly again but she shouted at me this time angrily that it was an important topic and my piss can wait. So i got afrain and sat down, and tried to control it as much as I can, but I couldn't. And it came out. I was so embarassed i didn't even move. When my classmates noticed some of them laughed and other made disgusted noises and ran out of the class. As it is i was a lonely guy trying whatever I could to fit in with the class because till high school I never had friends. By that time i was already the class clown, doing whatever I can for their acknowledgement. And after this incident shit hit the fan, and bullying got worse. My parents and sister were disgusted. I did not come out of my room for more than a month, and even after I never spoke with anyone and never made friends. I became paranoid and always think people make fun of me. Like, literally everyone. Everytime i meet new people i ask where they are from and what age are they just so i could estimate if there is a chance they might have this incident, and know about me. Even if it is unlikely they know it, i feel like somehow they will know it, and whatever impression i try to make in front of them now, will be overridden by what I did in high school. I had a girl propose to me at a later point, and even though I loved her ( like really really love her and i still think about her, even though she is in a different country and has a boyfriend ) i rejected her because I thought if she knows about this incident, she will think less of me. I was into self harm a lot and there are huge marks on my hands and thighs. I feel bad about how I look and how i talk. I have huge insecurities and inferiority complex. Everytime i accidentally make eye contact with a woman, i feel like they are disgusted at me for some reason, and i get an urge to go to them , say sorry and tell them I'm not eye-raping them. I go out of my way to avoid any eye contact with random women, and that makes it even more odd, but I can't help. I don't ask any hike or promotion from my manager even though I know i put in more work that any of my co-workers ( 13 14 hours daily sometimes around 18 hours ) because i feel like maybe I'm not doing any quality work. Even though I know thats not true. In my heart I'm still the same guy as i was in high school who want to meet people and make friends. I'm not this loner who likes to stay alone and spend time on my own as everyone thinks. I would really like to make friends and talk to them about the movies and series i see, the songs i listened to, and the books i read. There is so much, so much i think and sometime even at the expense of my sleep. Sometimes when i read any philosophically heavy books, they just make stay up all night and finish it, and when I'm done, I'm hit with this immense clarity towards life, and just want to share it with other people, talk to them, ask what their opinion is, and just spend some time together, just talking. I don't get any happy birthday messages or have some small talk texting relation with people, but occasionally when i get a message from someone i barely know, that just makes up my day. I forget everything and I'm happy. But for the love of God, i can't make any friends because i will end up thinking they think bad about me, and as an adult it's especially hard to make friends anyway. After all these years when i think about it, i think i might be depressed. And i don't know what to do about it, other than just accept my fate as a sad guy, give up on life, and just go whereever it takes me."

I feel like I have missed out on everything. I feel invisible. Always the damn background character in everyone else’s lives. It hurts and I’m tired.. I know I’m not the only one that feels this way but damn it sure feels like it..

lonely,Anyone else find ASMR comforting,"Anyone else find ASMR comforting - Ever since I have become isolated, especially since covid started, I discovered asmr videos and find them very comforting. 

I hope this doesn’t sound too weird but, I like the personal attention ones a lot because I rarely get positive attention from others. It feels nice to get compliments and feel valued, also the tingles from asmr are super relaxing. Most of the time it puts me right to sleep which is where my safe place is. I also like the videos where the person asks questions or ones that are specifically made for soothing someone. It sounds weird but I always talk with the person in the video in my head. 

I know it’s probably not the healthiest or a good long term solution but it can really help me cope when I can’t get to sleep, am stuck inside my own mind, or on those days I feel truly desolate. I just wanted to share to see if anyone uses asmr as a coping skill or go maybe help someone out who hasn’t tried asmr and needs something to cope."
lonely,Lonely in another country,Lonely in another country - We moved to another country 4 yrs ago. I am not very social so have struggled from day 1 and really do not enjoy living and working here. Cousins who have been living here for 15 years convinced my fiancé to move but now they suddenly flew back home yesterday because of all the mandates being implemented leaving us all by ourselves. It’s so lonely and frustrating being in another country with no family and no friends. Even my generally social fiancé has changed since living here. Unfortunately we cannot move back due to financial reasons. I have been an emotional wreck and it’s getting worse every day. Hate feeling like this. People I used to know barely contact me anymore so I literally have no one to talk to. At this point in time I hope everyday that I’ll just drop dead or something.
lonely,What did I do to deserve this?,"What did I do to deserve this? - All my life I feel as if I have been treated like I just don't matter, like I am a joke, like my feelings don't matter,etc. I was never anybodys first choice, etc. 

Even from a young age I was always excluded from stuff and made to feel like an outcast. People would do this to me on purpose. 

Then whenever I got older as in like middle school age I was heavily bullied. I was never invited to anything by anybody in school. I never really had any lasting friendships either. People would regularly do stuff to me to get a laugh at my expense, etc. But if I ever tried to speak up or defend myself I was "" crazy"", "" stupid"" etc. 

This went on all throughout school. I literally just came to school, got bullied, went home, etc. Then I graduated. I tried my luck at online dating. Let's just say I failed. It's basically like I'm a ghost no matter what app I use. I never get any responses or the rare few times I do its literally me trying to put all the effort into talking to these people and them leaving me on read and barely replying so i just give up. 

Now the only people in my life thus far who treated me like anything are family members. My mother and father were literally the only friends I had for multiple years. They both died shortly after I graduated from high school. 

Here I was literally 23 years old with no parents. I finally come across a guy online some months later. He actually tried to talk to me. We literally talked for months and then we finally met and it was amazing. Things were finally looking up for me I thought. Key word thought. 

We ended up moving in together and things went great for a while. Then he would purposely put his other friends first who he barely even saw, he let them be rude to me and did nothing about it and of course whenever I said anything about it, just like before ""oh you're crazy"" 

So basically I have endured over two years of mental and emotional abuse from him after that, along with cheating and sometimes physical abuse. But every now and then he will be nice to me. 

I can literally find no one else to talk to me. I've discussed how him treating me as made me feel, especially the cheating and he once straight up told me "" either deal with it or be alone like you were before "" 

So here I am 26, no friends, no parents, just one person in my life who treats me horribly. I am scared to leave him as there have been times when I actually have. Or he has left me, etc but we always get back together. And during those times when we are apart, literally NO ONE but my grandmother will talk to me. No one. I literally can not stand to be alone or ignored any more because that's basically been my whole life. 

Actually a few months ago whenever me and my guy friend I mentioned were apart, I met this other guy and we talked for a while, we met up and he acted all super interested in me, etc. Well he ended up pressuring me into giving him oral sex. I did and then after that he pretended he wasn't feeling well and left. I havnt heard from him since and I don't want to. He claimed we were gonna meet up for dinner and to watch a movie.  Before he left he literally told me "" here's $20 buy yourself a dinner "" UGH 

I don't understand why people do me this way. I have always tried to be a nice/ kind person, im generous, have a good sense of humor, and I'm at least average looking. I just don't get it."

lonely,Disposable,"Disposable - I feel so incredibly disposable. In the last few years since 2018 I have been (seemingly) randomly ghosted blocked by basically all of my closest friends. First, I was going through a major mental breakdown (I have suffered with severe mental illness all my life) and a group of my best girlfriends alienated me during that period of time. I take responsibility for some of that, because I know that it can be difficult to know what to do with someone who won’t help themself, but I thought these girls were friends for life no matter what. I never did anything directly to hurt them or our relationship. Then I had a couple of other friends ghost me, one of whom told me that they were in a very bad place mentally and then when I asked around to try and make sure she was okay she told people that I was stalking her. My husband and I separated shortly afterwards and I lost even more friends, even a few who initially praised me for leaving but who would go on to later randomly block me and re-friend my ex. Then I discovered one of my very last irl friends had blocked me without any indication as to why, and that strangely she had apparently asked several of her friends who I didn’t even have a relationship with to block me as well. And most recently my last long-term (10+ years) close irl friend stopped responding to or even reading my messages. She never blocked me or deleted me, but she just pretends I don’t exist? I have tried a couple of times to contact her to figure out what’s going on and have given up at this point. I genuinely feel so lost and confused after all of this. I feel like the accessibility of people on social media and apps has made friendships extremely disposable. The block button is easier to push than talking it out or even just saying “I can’t do this anymore”. Since all of this, I have been incredibly desperate for friendship, but I find myself incredibly closed off to meeting new people. I’m friendly and nice, but I assume that literally everyone will one day decide to block me and move on, so I don’t put genuine effort into getting to know anyone beyond a superficial level. I can’t identify the common thread behind why this keeps happening and I’m sick of banging my head against the wall trying to figure out what I did wrong or how I can take the blame. I even reached out to a couple of the girls from my past this last year just to apologize for whatever happened and let them know that I cared about them deeply, but i only got a generic thanks response from one person (and another one blocked me). I don’t feel like friendship is worth the effort anymore and that’s a fucking sad way to live. One of my old friends once told me right before she cut me out of her life I am going to die alone because of my mental illness and I’m fucking heartbroken that she’s probably right. Am I just constantly finding the wrong people?? I’m working so hard on myself. I don’t know what the fuck is going on."

lonely,Race affects dating prospects,"Race affects dating prospects - My opinion and from what ive seen: its easier for unattractive Caucasians to find a partner than an unattractive black person. I see so many Caucasian people that you would think would struggle to get a partner and white men that dont look after themselves physically (e.g.unkept hair and facial hair i see a lot of men with unkept hair and facial hair overweight, un fitting clothes, and dont look after their skin) who are in a relationship. Caucasians also have a higher marriage rate than black people. I dont know if its because of lower standards or what but an average Caucasian has more dating history than an average black person from the people ive met in school, work, hobbies and social events."
lonely,Does anybody else...,"Does anybody else... - Does anybody else feel like they don't fit into a specific group of people and don't really have a community they're part of? Gets pretty sad and lonely sometimes. Hard to make and keep friends. 

Also the friends I do have I've had for a long time and love them but adult life makes it hard to see them and keep up with them. More so because they're more busy than I am. It's lonely. I wish I had more friends that were the kind of close friends I always hoped for"

And Pls dont give me that “oh the right person will show up eventually”, there is no right person for me. Nobody will ever love me, i know this. It just sucks y’know? Nobody want’s to or would want to deal with the bagage i have. I know I’ll never have a partner. I cant even keep platonic relationships or even family relationships, let alone romantic. 

I know I’ll never be loved, but it’s still hard coming to terms with it when all you see are couples and whatnot. 

Anyway. Guess i just needed to rant, even tho none of it made sense. Back to crying myself to sleep lol. Hopefully i won’t wake up tomorrow. Not that I’m suicidal, But if i didn’t wake up tomorrow that would be really fkn cool."

lonely,I am starving romantically.,"I am starving romantically. - I'm an 18 year old dude, I have a loving family, a handful of good friends whom I honestly really don't see as much as I want to but we're in contact regularly. I have friends around me, but I think what bothers me is that I'm single.

Over the last few weeks my mental health has taken a nose dive, I really want a relationship. I don't really have an interest in sex, I value the emotional connection and having someone to love far more. I have a thing for a girl at college at the moment, and I still miss my ex. I find myself late at night looking at their social medias, which usually ends with me feeling even worse about my pathetic self, and saps me of all motivation to change my life for the better.

The girl I like at my college has pretty much everything I'm looking for. She's intelligent enough to make me challenge my views on things, which I think is great because it makes me a better person. She and I have the same sense of humour, making each other laugh is like a button we can press, and of course I also find her very attractive. I dropped her several flirty hints and she hasn't once played back. Sadly I think I'm not in the running. She's talked about her interest in another lad a couple of times recently, and I see her text him constantly. It is what it is.

Tonight my ex posted a photo of herself with her new bf. We didn't break up because of relationship problems it was long distance and Covid straight up killed it, so I still very much have feelings for her. He seams like a nice guy so I am genuinely happy for them. She's a great girl and I hope she's happy, but I can't say it didn't hurt to see them together and the guy even looks a little like me. I don't know if I should say this but I spent the next hour researching the least painful suicide methods just so I know my options if things get worse.

I am starving for someone to be with romantically, I want to text someone goodnight, I want to cuddle on the sofa and fall asleep, I want to be head over heals in love with someone who feels the exact same for me, and every day I'm not is a whole world of pain."

lonely,Does anyone else experience some form of discrepancy between idealized people and tangible people?,"Does anyone else experience some form of discrepancy between idealized people and tangible people? - I have a very strange personality contradiction. 

When i'm alone, i experience nostalgia for certain people that i've never met. 

For example, last summer i saw this girl on a street corner near where i live and i found her very interesting.

Something about her mannerisms, poised posture, relaxed gait, and melodic voice was captivating. She wasn't a very attractive girl, but she seemed ""different"".

The best way that i can put it is that she made the average person seem like a poorly manufactured chucky cheese robot - gangly and with limited mobility.

I have a lot of daydreams about such people, and then i feel an intense desire to be around them and experience what in my mind is a cinematic level of peace and excitement. I even have certain music to go along with my daydreams - like pumped up kicks and xx intro. Everything is perfect in my daydreams. Time is slowed down. The colors are so vivid that you can smell them. The air is like a warm vacuum. The sense of cosmic significance and anticipation is quite alive. Every interaction is completely fluid.

But then, when i'm around other people, i want to be alone. 

I'm cold, stiff, introverted, shy, and imminently sad. 

Does anyone else experience this sort of thing?"

Does anyone want to vent chat? Does anyone want to discuss suicidal ideation? Does anyone want to simply chat and see what happens? 

I feel empowered when other people come forward and discuss their mental health or their feelings. I've seen other people post here and wonder if anyone is lonely and wants to talk. Please in your twenties or older.

You can be rich, intelligent, solid GPA and even a partner and still fail at life if you don't have a solid emotional support system you can fall back on. 

It makes me angry when I hear people say they went through hardship but they still had friends, family and lovers who had their backs. Its so much easier living life without being alone. Without the support of others my life is basically a death sentence from the get-go.

If it wasn’t for my dog and cat there wouldn’t be anything to live for. The one thing I have going for me is my career (school counselor) but it’s exhausting to go to work every day and put on a happy face so everyone thinks I have it together. My good friend (only friend) and I had a falling out 3 months ago and since then all I do is go to work and come home. My social anxiety prevents me from going anywhere alone so other than grocery shopping I just stay in my house all day on the weekends. I feel like I’ve turned into a hermit. My life wasn’t always like this, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve become more afraid of the outside world. If it wasn’t for meds I’d be in a deep depression rt now. I’m too embarrassed to even talk about this with a therapist so I thought I would try to find support online."

I have a good friend I've known since high school and sometimes we talk on the phone, but it's hard for us to hang out together since we both lead busy lives. We're both college students with a lot of studying to do and sometimes when I call him up, he tells me that he can't talk and that we should talk another time. Now I just feel guilty calling him, so I don't anymore.

Life is just so busy with people living in the fast lane constantly it's nice nobody wants to slow down and have a conversation because there are more important things to do, like going to work, paying the bills, etc. It's hard to create and maintain friendships when we're all committed to other things.

It's a big one too. Big proud number, I guess. And nothing really. 

Got covid. Got more weed. Haven't talked to my girlfriend much or at all, but they've been hanging out with their friends for the last few weekends. Which is good, I'm glad they're happy. But it definitely still stings to see them doing so good without me. My younger sibling has gone out more than I have in this month alone than I did all of 2021. 

Everyone seems to have a someone or something. Someone that they click with and always want to have around, where they feel safe and allow themselves to be vulnerable with. A something that they can depend on to make themselves feel better, a skill that'll never really fail them. 

I don't really have either of those. I forget how forgettable and replaceable I am sometimes. I doesn't feel good to be reminded, but apparently it happens a lot. Where I need reminders for how terrible of a person I am, how I've failed to be a friend, a partner, and an older sibling, and for how little I'm really needed.

Not that I want to be needed. I don't really know what I want.

I dunno, it's weird to say this, but sometimes, in very small moments, I want to be cared about."

To keep things brief, my future is now uncertain and due to a series of unfortunate events ™  I am left with no money, no shelter and no way to get home to my family.

It would seem someone in my shoes would desperately need money to get out of this situation... which is true, however, I feel like asking strangers for a piece of their livelihood is too needy and I am in no position to make any promises of repayment in a short term capacity. So instead, I ask for some company during this stressful time of mine. I welcome anyone with a spare moment and some interest to reach out to me if you're curious as to the full scope of my situation.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as would any words of wisdom or even a person to talk to.

Other than that, everything's peachy! Take care :)"

I am a woman in my mid 20s. I grew up in an immigrant family. I am 3rd generation. My mom had me and my brother young. They would abuse each other a lot and use us as children to get back at each other. My dad was only around my younger years. He no longer speaks to me. He has children with my step mom. My other brother got diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 19. He’s the only person I’ve been through stuff with but he has a mental illness. I feel like he’s not him anymore. My little brother and other siblings are too young to understand. They don’t know anything about how I feel or what I’ve been through. I have depression and anxiety. I self sabotage a lot. I am a friendly quiet person. I am very loving and caring. I don’t have any friends. Any friends that I make never last long and I am trying not to blame myself but I feel like their is something wrong with me as to why I don’t have friends or why I have family that doesn’t talk to me. I am the black sheep of my family. I have moved to so many states and cities all of my life on my own. I feel broken. I feel like there is a reason why I feel so alone and misunderstood. I’ve done p0rn for a little bit, I’ve been a st1pper before for a little bit. I’ve been SA more than once. I’ve had men mostly use me and women despise me. I am actually a people pleaser. I don’t know why people hate me so much or think I am strange. I have a bf who I feel like doesn’t understand me. He says he does but I don’t think he does. I am now sitting parked in my car at a park feeling the most alone I’ve felt in awhile. I turn 27 this year. I didn’t think I would make it this far. I planned my suicide at age 13 and again at age 16. I almost did it again at 24 but I think god called my family to my house because they showed up unannounced. 

Me sitting in this park is the most peace I have felt in forever. I feel like dying everyday. I don’t think my bf understands the pain I feel each day. I see life so differently than others. I just don’t want to exist anymore but my anxiety makes me keep going because I always wonder how far could I have gone if I kept going. And I’m still going. I know that most of what I’m saying probably doesn’t make sense. I just don’t wanna feel alone anymore…. 

Will I ever get better? If you relate to me… will we ever get better? I want to pray for us all…. I feel so sad today. The scariest feeling I’ve ever felt is the feeling of nothing. Emptiness scares me."

lonely,I screwed up and I feel like I lost my favourite spot in the park.,"I screwed up and I feel like I lost my favourite spot in the park. - 
It has been a nearly 2 years since I met anybody new. My social circle for the last two years has been just my parents and my two friends. So I decided that today I was going to meet somebody new and have atleast one conversation outside of the four people in my life.

I went to a park near my place but when I tried to approach someone it felt like it was impossible to talk to anybody. Everybody had their airpods on, counting their steps, checking their fitbits. The only people there talking were talking on their phone or they were with someone already. I felt like I just couldn't talk to random people, I felt like giving up and went to go sit in my favourite spot in the park. I was sitting there for like half an hour watching Netflix, thinking how I couldn't even make conversation at the park. I felt so stupid and decided that it was time to go home. So I got up to leave but as I was about to climb down the stairs I saw this girl from the corner of my eye, I had seen her a few times before and I thought I should say hi and ask her name. 

I climbed down the stairs and got on the walking track but I was a little ahead of her on the track, and there were quite a few people walking, and I felt awkward going in the opposite direction just to say hi to a girl I didn't know. So I walked around the park to a different sitting area, thought I would wait till she catches up and notices me, then I can go to talk to her.

 But no, when she came around, I just couldn't, I froze on the spot, my heart was beating super fast. I sat down trying to calm myself. I always thought I could talk to anybody, I have no problem talking to strangers at work, or at the store, or in the metro, or anywhere for that matter. I was sitting there wondering what was wrong with me, I hadn't said anything, I hadn't done anything, I was feeling so bad, I had a mini panic attack by just trying to talk to somebody at the park.

Once I had calmed down, I realised I had freaked out over nothing, nobody saw me, nobody knew that I was freaking out. I thought, since I had already had a mini panic attack, I had nothing to lose, I might as well go talk to her. 

Oh I couldn't have been more wrong.

I walked up to her all nervous and said, ""hi"" she flinched, took a step back and got so scared. It felt like everybody was looking at me and now I was having another mini panic attack I was mumbling and I said ""I'm sorry I didn't mean to scare you, I just thought you were cute and I wanted to come say hi"". She spurted out nervously ""okay"". Now I thought the difficult part was over I introduced myself and tried to get the conversation going by asking her ""what do you like about the park?"" to which she said, very hesitantly, ""it's my first time coming here"", which I knew it wasn't. Seeing as she was so reluctant to talk, I said ""I'm sorry if you are not comfortable talking to me, I can leave if you are not comfortable"" and she replied ""I don't know"", I said ""it's best if I leave"" and I bolted out the park and ran till I was out of breath.

Now I can't go back to the park and sit in my favourite spot for a while or until I grow my hair and beard out and become a completely different person."

I had 2-3 guys when i was at highschool but sadly they turned out to be something else.I tried making friends online but it barely worked out for me.People just have some chat and they ghost me . It's one of the reasons i have always been upset and lonely as i lack of friends. Well , it's also true that I'm not really interesting because i don't have much hobbies and i spend my time mostly reading my academic books and sometimes listening to music. Yet I'm hopeful that i may find someone who's very similar to me. I mean like we both may have same feelings and we do want someone who can be supportive in our hard times. So Yeah just hmu.

My DM's are open to anyone, I really could use some friendly chats right about now!

Ever since both my fiance and grandma passed away from Covid I feel like i've been crippled forever, it's like I can't breathe. I have no-one left, I look at this empty house and all I feel is like I am dead already too. They were my everything, my only family and friends. Damn covid, it took everything from me! I don't know what to do, how do you cope with the loneliness, the fact that the persons you loved the most are gone forever and you'll never hear their voices again? I don't know what to do, I just want to join them, feel their touch once again! 

After my fiance died I had a mental breakdown, was admitted in a psych ward for 2 month, after that I was in no shape to go to work, nor was in any shape to socialize or even leave the house. I ended up pushing all my friends away, isolating myself from everyone and everything, it was like all sorts of bonds I had lost their meaning.

I survive because I was put on welfare, so I make some 215 USD (minimum wage in my country) a month, half my usual salary. It's barely enough for my meds, therapy and food, but not for rent and stuff, so i'm being forced to leave the house in the next 8 days. It's hard, probably gonna become homeless again. 

I have a severe difficulty in socializing because of my depression, social anxiety and bipolar disorders, it was suggested to me that I should try make some online acquaintances, this is the point of this post, I see a lot of lonely people in this sub that could use some friendly chats, so, DM me, please!"

It's not there's anything radically wrong with me. I consider myself a decent human being, who has his own style, passions, and goals. I am not 'ugly'. I have no problem talking with people (in general) (for the most part). Both men and women.

But this lack of romance hurts me a lot. I would love to have a girlfriend/relationship. I am working on other aspects of my life (career, education, health, goals, etc) but for this particular aspect, I have literally nothing to show.

I have the greatest fear ever of asking a girl out. Firstly, I feel like she will think of me as a creep and desperate. Secondly, I just cringe at the thought of it. And most importantly, no girl has ever shown me that level of interest, that made it obvious to me that she likes me. Trust me, if a girl even hinted that she likes me, I would definitely try to gather the courage to ask her out. But that has never ever happened throughout my life. I also feel that by asking out a girl, I 'm disrespecting her in a way.

I feel jealous of guys who have girlfriends/relationships. I crave that too. I would love to have a romantic partner. I sometimes feel 'lesser' due to my lack of love life.

I have tried dating apps, but I've found no success there. And as I said, asking a girl out is a big big fear for me. I really don't even know how it works, and how you are supposed to 'romance'.

I am really sad due to this. Almost everyone my age has been in a romantic relationship up till now and has experienced love.

P.S. Before anyone says this, I already work on myself and my self-improvement constantly. I already have my own education, career, and passions. And no, I do not identify as an 'incel'. I do not hate women, or blame them for my problems. This is just me venting out my true genuine feelings."

lonely,I'm alone.....maybe?,"I'm alone.....maybe? - It's not hard finding someone to talk to, but it's hard holding or keeping their attention on me.

I'm not an ugly or bad looking guy at all. Quite the contrary actually and even then I've been compared to Robin Williams and Jim Carrey personality type wise and I believe they're both ENFJ lol but that's besides the point 

I think or feel me being extra is what causes women to not want to continue dating me or seeing me

All my life I've always been told I was extra as fuck
I never understood why until it clicked that what I do or say at times can be extra in a petty way or loving way or in any way tbh it'll always be extra with me

Ex: I hold the door open for people walking from the pumps instead of the one or 2 getting out of their car near the entrance like that's extra as fuck 

But even then my ideologies and how I perceive life can be a little *wtf m8* kinda moment because I've always had an obscure way of thinking. I don't think like majority of people do. I fancy the odd and weird possibilities of how this world is and how it came to be and all that other good stuff but most already have embedded in their login noggin that God is why we're here and he's our purpose like YUCK NO GROTESQUE-- how dare you limit yourself to the endless possibilities of our existence and meaning. Whether we even have one or not you know?

Well shit like that can scare and possibly worry someone into thinking they're dating an autistic person or someone that's mentally ill. Idk it's what I've been told in the past

So yeah I feel like I'm forever just destined to be alone

Despite how far I've come to be better and do better

Mind you im a Virgo (a joke for those into astrology)"

I struggle to sleep at night as I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Having those connections I used to have.

lonely,parents,"parents - I really have nobody to talk to, it sucks knowing that everyone i know has such good lives which im glad they do but how awful mine is. My mom had me at 15 so her entire life she was working to support me and my siblings. I am now 17 and have moved out of my moms house due to problems in the past and now am living with my dad. I never really received attention like all my other siblings, i was always forgotten. My siblings are half siblings and having a step dad really messed me up. I grew up wondering why i was treated so differently than all my other siblings. They'd get new shoes new clothes, toys, and anything they could've wanted but my stepdad never treated me like that. He would always call me names and make fun of me whenever i would mess up or show any sort of emotion which makes it hard for me to ever express how i feel which is why im here. Until i was about 8 i found out my stepdad wasnt my real dad and everything started making sense. I used to be a good kid in school and always do my work and such and get good grades until my stepdad and mom split. I was always surrounded by abuse constantly as my mom would always end up with some abusive boyfriends. I got so tired of it and eventually moved out and with my dad, and can i say it was the worst decision of my life. I had a bestfriend at the time and he was the best. I never had many friends as i always was the annoying kid and very poor so was always made fun of. His family loved me and i loved them and felt at home with them. After moving in with my dad a couple weeks later he passes out and is rushed to the hospital. They found out he had internal head bleeding and said he would be lucky if he lived another 24 hours. I cried for days and couldn't eat or id throw up. My dad would always get frustrated because of how i was acting and would call me names and tell me to stop acting like a girl or little bitch. I repressed my feelings so much i changed completely. Now 4 years later i see how much it affected me and wished i always had supportive parents as i see in so many videos. I still am very poor and dont have my own room, ive been working and never has my dad bought me anything. I buy my own food, clothes, and even bought my own car. No matter how hard i try its like im never enough. My dad didnt even seem proud at all. He threatens to take it all the time. He always disrespects me but if i show any disrespect to him he threatens me. He claims to be such a good parents but never does anything for me. Im never home and i still keep in touch with my moms side of the family. After so long i see my mom finally doing what i wish she did for me. She supports my siblings, goes to their games and cheers them on. She supports them no matter what but whenever i tried telling them how i wanna pursue something they dont even seem like they care. I have a couple friends but i feel like im always just a back up whenever someone else cant make it. I sit in my car all day because i have nobody to talk to. How do i tell someone how i feel without scaring them off or just make them think im just so messed up. I just wish i had someone care about me. I work and try so hard and wish someone was atleast proud of me but i constantly am reminded about how lame i am to everyone. Im so alone."

At the moment the only once that spend time with me are my two dogs who I love but unfortunately they can not run to the pharmacy or go grocery shopping for me. I just hope to get better soon."

lonely,I no longer see a point to this charade of a life!,"I no longer see a point to this charade of a life! -  Why live? Why go on? I just want my suffering to end!

I was never enough, but more was always expected of me.

I was never loved, but that is all that I wanted, and it was always denied to me.

For several years now, I have tried and tried to form romantic relationships, but I can never get there.

I can flirt, make women laugh, even break the touch barrier, and have them touch me back as well.

But,  when the rubber meets the road, I can't get a girlfriend. Tons of  people want FWB, but I'm not about that life! Why can't I have someone  to love and love me back?! Why does this always escape me, no matter  what I do?!

The answer is obvious: I am not enough. I am not enough to be caressed, kissed, cared about.

I don't want yet another ""friend"", and that is all I get. ""Friends""!

They  love flirting with me. They love touching and being touched by me. They  love looking into my eyes while we talk. They love to smile at me. They  love my company. They love to snoop on my life as if they have any  designs on making me a boyfriend. They love getting my hopes up (even if  it is unintentional!). They love shattering my hope for a love into  countless pieces.

Well, I can't  put these pieces back together anymore, and I am tired of sleeping  alone. I am tired of never getting any texts asking how I am! I am tired  of not being missed, needed, made love to! I have no one to give  birthday gifts or receive gifts from!

Valentine's  Day is coming up, and you know, as always, I will be alone, unloved,  single, cold, and full of hatred. My anger and hatred for myself and my  situation is the only thing keeping me alive! My hope is gone! I will  never know what love is! I will never be a loving husband and father!

I  wish I could just sleep and never wake up again! I just want to go  somewhere warm where I can finally feel love, touch, acceptance.

I just want to be human.

Why,  why, why does my life involve a never-ending series of disappointments  and rejections?! Why am I to live? What is the point? Who gains from  this misery and isolation?!

Someone  give me the same advice I have followed all my life. Please tell me  that self-improvement, not looking for love, making tons of friends,  having an active social life like in the movies is going to solve all my  problems and wrap a giant red bow on top and bring me what I have  always wanted, what I have always needed, what I am apparently unworthy  of!

I have lost my will to live."

I was never bullied but I was alienated from everyone and those experiences resulted in pretty negative thoughts. Despite having friends and family, I don’t feel like I can truely talk to anyone about it because every time I’ve tried to in the past, they never understood what I was talking about. They’d either get confused or laugh at what I said and I’d have to play it off as a joke or just a crazy thought.

I graduated last year and ever since, people have told me about everything I’ve got ahead of me. They keep telling me how great life is but all I can think about is how useless it all is if I have to live it alone.

I try so hard too. I always try to invite my younger siblings to do stuff, but they almost always say no. I invited my siblings to go to a bigger city this weekend to do a bunch of fun stuff without the parents around. I was looking forward to it for 2 weeks. Today they all declined and now I’m alone with nothing to do. They’d rather be with there own friends or sit in their rooms on their phones all day, and that’s ok I guess.

There’s a girl I like and I really enjoy being around her, and I can always make her laugh, but I don’t think she feels the same way about me. That’s ok too she’s out of my league, I’m too weird, fat and ugly I guess. I go to the gym to exercise and play basketball all by myself. Everyone else has friends with them.

I don’t what I did to deserve being this lonely. Am I too creepy, weird, annoying, mean? Was I too rude to my family when I was younger? Idk if I’ll ever know. I honestly wish I was never born.

I have nth but platonic love for these men but i’m trying to make it romantic, i dont know how i’m supposed to force myself to like, like someone. this is not just with two men tho, it’s with numerous men. i have to force myself to love anyone, or just like. if i do “like” someone, i believe i rlly don’t, i rmbr i like lovvvveeeddd this one man even tho there were reasons for me not too. plus he was weird asl and ik he was in love with me too bc he said it. i had an unhealthy obsession with him but that’s bc once anyone does anything that remotely requires them to like talk to me, and then they’re like nice, bruh idk. i’m bad at explaining. anyways,  here, anyone wanna be friends? discord: me duhh#6811"

lonely,"Hello friend, I'm lonely, my crush is not answering, etc","Hello friend, I'm lonely, my crush is not answering, etc - Sorry, I think this will be longer than I thought. 

Hello friend, I'm a 19 year old dude from Germany.
I'm dealing with loneliness for about four years and it's partially driving me crazy. I have some days where I'm completely fine, the beginning of this week was one of the best times in a long time, I'm about to tell you why.

I confessed my love to my crush on a Thursday (last weekend). After texting a bit, she didn't answer for almost two days. And then suddenly she showed up at my work and asked if I would like to go walking with her after work, that would be around 10pm.

I said yes, we talked and walked around, it was beautiful.

She had a crush on me one year ago, but she hasn't the same feelings now. She said that she really likes me and that we have a special connection.....

Fun fact: We started texting each other in June 2021, and we literally just met for the first time a few days ago.
When we started talking to each other back then, we both felt that special connection, we exchanged the most intimate stuff. But as I said, that was a year ago...
We also had a little break in between, I think October was the month of silence, she said we needed a little distance. 

Present: Well, we are talking to each other and yeah I confessed my love to her. We met, we still are talking,...
 I think. I asked her yesterday how her day was, she didn't answer (she does this often). We haven't talked today, the whole fucking day, it's driving me crazy.

I know I have to give her time, she has her own problems, everyone does. And I also don't want to destroy out connection or relationship. That's why I'm not texting her again, even though she didn't answer. 

And now the problem is back again: loneliness

I hope it's not chronic loneliness lol.
I feel like I'm losing touch to everyone. I know I have my parents, my siblings and friends.
But that's what loneliness is, right? You still feel lonely af, isolated af even though there are people around you.

I haven't met friends, besides university, since New years eve

A contact, someone I can be intimate with, someone that's understanding me, someone I can talk to, someone I can hug and cry in her arms.

I just want someone to hug.

That's just a little episode of my live and my current state of mind, it may not sound that extreme but I think it is. At least my heart pounding doesn't start that often.


Thanks for listening friend, love you."

I messed up something, now I have to pay the consequences. I see a light at the end of the tunnel, but my stupid lonely brain messed everything up. Now I just ended up being lonelier.

I don't know what to do, everything just feels numb. I can't even bring myself to do my hobbies, that's how severe it is. I just wished everything can go back just like the way before. If I have a time machine, I'd abuse that intensively. I don't care how unhealthy it is, I just need something right now. But that's not how it works and I have to suffer more longer."

I have zero friends.
I have never had a girlfriend. 

And I personally do not believe that this will ever change, I am permanently damaged because I lack the experiences that my peers have had because I have spent so many years in social isolation.

I feel like it is too late for me, that I have wasted my life. And I sometimes feel like it might be better to just end it all. Life is not worth living like this."

I had somewhat of a conversation with my ex and she told me how good it feels to finally move on. I don’t think I have though after two years. I think I’m stuck and I don’t know how to feel except very hurt and afraid of what I might do to myself."

His friends say I’m the best girlfriend he’s ever had and that they can see us getting married. I can’t. I’ve been so unhappy these past couple months. I love him and he loves me but I know he loves me more then I love him I can’t truly and genuinely love him because I feel like he doesn’t completely understand me and he’s just happy he has a “wife material” girlfriend. 

He says how he never had a girlfriend that cooked before or cleaned up after themselves or straightens up the house. I feel so alone because I know that he doesn’t truly know me yet even after a year, he won’t listen even if I try to tell him things about me. He’s just happy he has someone that is wife material in the housekeeping sense of it, that’s what he loves. 

My heart aches constantly all day long because I let myself into this and it’s going to be so hard to get myself out of this because I do love him but just not enough to spend the rest of my life with him."

I wake up in the morning, have breakfast and coffee, and check my phone. I have pets (1 dog, 2 cats, 1 rabbit). I attend to all of them and clean the house. I take a shower and rest. I really feel lonely. There’s literally no noise in the house except for the music I put on. 

I feel ridiculous for feeling this way since I’m 24 and should know how to be by myself. My boyfriends grandmother passed away 3 days ago and I also feel a bit uncomfortable and sad since we were extremely close for almost 7 years.

I always talk to myself everytime i have a problem, like making an imaginary questions in my head and answering them on how would i solve my problems without even trying to solve it. I can't talk to people about my problems because im afraid that i might be taking my problems too seriously. I'm still a child and there's still alot of problems awaiting for me. Suicide would never been an answer for all of my problems. I'm just sad that alot of kids my age are having fun while i'm just in my room talking to myself.

lonely,I'm so lonely and i have no idea what to do.,"I'm so lonely and i have no idea what to do. - So I'm 21(m) and back in school I had tons and tons of friends and was out every day after school. I really was living my best life without knowing it. 

But since starting my new job. working 8-4:30 mon-fri with the youngest person being 13 years older than me. I just feel so fucking alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got one real friend irl who is always busy so I don't even get to go out with friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Gaming and the gym is my only escape. I've got tons of online friends that I speak to. They give me a reason to not feel so alone but then reality hits. I've started going to the gym recently and when I'm there I feel relieved. I feel free. Then I come home and once again reality hits.

&amp;#x200B;

Over christmas I met a girl. I asked her out January 1st and since talking to her I felt so happy. I had a text to go to bed to. a text to wake up to. Facetime calls with someone who cared about me. She made me the happiest I had been in so many years.

&amp;#x200B;

But she broke up with me on Monday. It was a short relationship but my first real one. She made me so happy and now I'm back to being so sad and so alone. Luckily I had my online friends who actually took my mind of her. And still are. It's still early days into the breakup but I know I'll get better.

&amp;#x200B;

But I had no one to go to in real life. I spoke to my one friend and my brother. That was it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just praying to stick to the gym. To stop being lanky because I'm 6'4. I want to be able to go out this summer. Even if it's by myself. Go to the beach and not be insecure and make friends. I'm wasting the best years of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to know what other people in a similar situation are up to and how they deal with the aloneness."

I really hope my sufferings comes to an end soon either by my hand or from someone else's.

Even if something was seriously wrong, why not talk to me? Did the man I thought I knew not exist?

I feel physically ill trying to get to know new men on dating apps, they all talk to me like a dog. Less than that.  Demanding sex or demanding I behave like a free therapist to them when they don't even care about my issues. Randomly ghosting, throwing insults,  barely carrying the conversation unless I ask them questions. Over and over and over again. I can't take the pain of it anymore, I just want to die at this point. I'm not beautiful enough or interesting enough to jump from one fulfilling relationship to another. Nobody really wants me. 

I just want to be in a relationship, not with just anyone with him. But the bond of trust has been broken now since he randomly blocked me, and to be honest I highly doubt he'll ever reach out to me again. I can't eat, I can't sleep I feel hollow without him."

In a large friend group you are also probably never really alone because you always have at least one available friend at all times to talk to. I feel extremely sad and depressed when I watch those high school TV shows and I see those large friend groups. I wish I had that. I feel like I'm wasting out on my youth (I'm 17), the supposed ""best years"" of my life. I never really had the high school experience due to virtual learning for a few years. My older sister always tells such fun, memorable stories about her high school years with her large friend group. It's my last year of high school and I will never experience that. I hate being alone because when I'm alone I worry too much about existence and what happens when I die and how meaningless life is. I get really anxious and depressed. So many of my mental problems could go away if I just had friends. When I'm around people it distracts me from my thoughts. I wish I had lots of friends so I was never alone..."

lonely,Missed friend,"Missed friend - I had a friend reach out through another friend asking about me. She is local, great person, and a salon owner. 

There was a time about 5-6 years ago we were pretty good friends, I helped her attain her barbering license (I was the practice dummy for hot towel shaves) and even went to her state boards with her again as said dummy.

The point of this post was the sabatoge I feel internally. Being alone makes me not as trusting. A big part of me hopes that her reaching out is a sign she misses the friendship, wether or not more is or would be on the table is irrelevant. My not trusting side has me thinking she reached out to try to get a client back.

I don’t even know how to proceed, so I might book a beard trim and get my head shaved and see how it goes. Would it be safe to assume that if by the end of the cut things aren’t looking like she missed me as a person and friend that it was in fact the missed customer thing? Is that stupid? 

I’m so bad at all of this stuff, that’s why I isolate."

lonely,December 2020 was the last time I was in control,"December 2020 was the last time I was in control - As the title suggest, December 2020 was the last time I had total control of my life. I had a medical emergency that left me partially paralyzed in my right leg and unable to walk. For months and months the only thing I’ve ever been able to do is lay in bed while I recovered. 

Previously I was a healthy 24M and had no issues with my health. I’ve always been independent and free spirited. So suddenly I was living with my parents again, lost all my money, had to sell my possessions and assets, and most importantly my ability to walk and the freedom that comes with it. During the last year I’ve lost nearly everyone I cared about. I didn’t lose them because they weren’t around or didn’t care, instead I pushed them away. I’m angry, I’m depressed, I’m anxious, I’m everything under the sun but happy. Between spending months in and out of the hospital, then to being isolated at my parents house away from friends I finally had enough and I broke down about a month ago. 

I’m so tired of living like this. I rely on my parents for so much now. I’m so incredibly grateful to have them be here for me, but fuck me… I can’t do anything because they’re so overbearing. They refuse to allow anyone over because they’re deathly afraid of Covid. Anything they deem as “risky” like using the microwave above the stove is off limits or getting in the shower. What few things I can control are still out of reach for me due to nerve pain and limitations on mobility. I can no longer sit at my computer to play games with my friends on discord, even laying in bed with a laptop ends up being painful. 

I miss my old life, I miss being able to do laundry, I miss driving, I miss work, I miss my friends, and I really miss the little things we take for granted. I don’t even know when this is all over if I’ll ever get back to my old self, I feel so far removed from everything and everyone that it’s impossible to reintegrate back into my own life. 

I’m so lost. 


TLDR: I suffered a medical emergency that crippled me. I ultimately developed severe body dysmorphia to the point I pushed everyone out of my life for fear of who I had become. Now I’m stuck living with my parents again and suffer from extreme PTSD anxiety attacks and depression."

lonely,"Lonely people who messed up and created drama in their friend groups, and are no longer welcomed back, how are you doing now? What are you doing now?","Lonely people who messed up and created drama in their friend groups, and are no longer welcomed back, how are you doing now? What are you doing now? - One of my ex friends of 3 years (online) created drama, was upset when we didnt want to do what he wanted all the time



 (we switch main games. we would go out of our way to play the same game and then switch to another game and he would refuse to play even if he owned it)




and decided to burn bridges with me and say some fucked up things. I never would have shared his message if he did not BRAG about it to others in a group call he made. I was APPROACHED and asked if it was true he ""sent me a really nasty message"".




others were very unhappy with what he said. he met these friends through me (that shouldn't matter) but many do not like his actions and what he said. 






this friend reached out wanting back into the group, but others have said if hes welcomed back, the potential for drama is too high, and they would leave if he was welcomed back.






this friend, unaware I think of what's going on, wanted a mediation. we attempted to talk but he shut down and wouldn't acknowledge his message and saying that message didnt matter he wants back in.





we are all in our 20s btw.




I suggested he take a few mins to gather his thoughts, and he asked for a few days to try again. I agreed.






THREE days later he contacts a mutual friend of mine that he HATES and tries to pull some more drama, even telling him very unbelievable lies.





its been 4 weeks since he said he wanted to do a mediation, and radio silence from him.




he actually has a habit of removing people, people who haven't even done anything to him too, when hes feeling bad.





apparently he has been extremely lonely, not even his other friends outside this group have been talking to him.






and no, I can NOT reach out to him. its cruel to text him when I know 1. he is not welcomed into the group, 2. I know I cant balance a friendship with him bc of what hes done and that I'm always with this group 3. I'm super unhappy about the lie and how soon it was after wanting a mediation.






I have another friend who... I wont go into what he did but it was bad and the last straw for a different friend group. hes lonely, I try to chat with him but we dont play shared games anymore. hes not doing too well either but has gotten used to being alone and plays alone now. he wont change his behavior and at this point doesn't think what he did was wrong either.

lonely,17f. My school switched to virtual learning this week and my only friend is ignoring me.,"17f. My school switched to virtual learning this week and my only friend is ignoring me. - Basically, I am lonely and I want to talk to my friend but I feel like I annoy him because he takes several hours (sometimes an entire day) just to open my message, and usually he doesn't reply and just leaves me on read, or if he does reply he gives the driest responses. 

He wasn't really much of a texter before this anyways but I thought that was just because we saw each other every day in person at school,  and we are much more communicative in person. But now that we aren't seeing each other I feel extremely lonely and I was hoping we would start texting a little more to compensate, and possibly make plans to hang out outside of school. I offered to drive to his house so we could hang out but he never took me up on my offer. Okay, maybe he is just really busy. I get that. He is a busy person usually. We don't have to hang out but I would at least just like to text him. I don't think I'm asking for much. To just take like five minutes out of his day to text me once in a while on his free time is all I'm asking. Just saying hi, letting me know what's up, and asking me how I'm doing. That would make all the difference, just knowing that I still have my friend. 

I feel like if I tell my friend how I feel or I express my emotions he will think I'm like a negative Nancy and get even more annoyed with me. I also feel like I'm being selfish and clingy for wanting attention from my friend. I'm kinda known for like being chill and not really getting sad like that, so I am worried that if he sees this side of me he won't want to be friends anymore. 

I am in a very bad depression right now. I hate being alone. I feel really isolated and lonely. I hate not talking to my friend and not being around others. I need to talk to someone so bad. I feel so lonely and I can't take it anymore. School, literally the one thing I ever had to look forward to, has been taken away from me. Yeah, my life is so boring and lonely that I literally look forward to going to school. It's the only time I ever get out and have a social life. I've literally been self harming because the loneliness is that painful. I have no one to talk to and I want to talk to my friend but I can't. I don't know what to do anymore.

lonely,Is this reasonable thinking,"Is this reasonable thinking - Im literally so lonely i thought i was depressed and i was blaming my failures in competitions and overall my dumbass beats myself so hard when im underperforming and it went to the point where i was literally setting such insane bars for myself i could not do anything so i spiraled into complete despair at one point.

I think im not depressed, is what im trying to say. Instead, i just feel like im the loneliest person alive^((not even remotely close)) and that it completely destroys me to the point where im hopping on r/SuicideWatch daily to realize i have it better than most and move on with my day.  
There is more to this: im a very goal oriented person^((hopefully thats a thing)) and i did not have a long term goal for 3 years now. Which means for the past 3 years ive literally been running on autopilot to the point where im looking at youtube videos from 5 years ago and im expecting them to be from 2015.

I had an amazing start to 2021 but all im going to say is that it was not a blessing; it was a curse. I became thirsty for touch so much that ever since 11 months ago all i think about is hugs and cuddles.  
I jerk off thinking about how much better it would be just to sit next to a loved one and just *cuddle*. 

And here i arrive at the conclusion...  
I am probably the pickiest motherfucker on the planet earth.  
Finding a person i love will take longer than it took Oda to draw One Piece ^((he is still going..))  
All my motivation to do anything is lost. I play games all day or watch twitch and youtube. ^(I picked up writing as a hobby i could say but its basically just expanding on my dreams and writing them down, at least thats how it feels so i dont take it seriously.)

I also wanted to say, why is there no real ways to find dates on reddit? Like all there is is ForeverAloneDating which is still a dried up land for eu people, not even talking about r4r which feels like its literally only americans but i digress.

Actually i dont, IM 21M, straight, fucking loser, sleeps 10 hours a day, plays skillbased games for the purpose of being better than most, i take my vitamins, i have curly ass afro i dont care for so it looks like *shit.*  
I like everything that involves dedication and skill. I love art and music. Im extremely anxious and shy about 70% of the time. 180cm skinny ass. I want to leave my home but there is nothing to do there so i sit at home and STILL DO NOTHING FU- I speak 2 languages, Polish and English and at this point i dont know which one is my dominant, i would say english but at the same time polish even though i fuck up with both equally. I watch^(ed) a buttload of anime and im breaking the r-u-l-e 5 of the sub but fuck it im that fucking desparate.

I decided to get grindr again as I so desperately want to talk to someone but its the same shit, I ended up finding my only ex, a guy I dated in middle school around five years ago, but the conversation seems to only be revolving around past sex experiences with others, it got me to think how bad I have it right now in that aspect

How fun everyone must seem to be having as I struggle to find a reason to live, not that I want to kill myself but truly, what is the point of living? My only motivations are to graduate and begin to help my single mom who doesn’t deserve the struggles she sometimes faces but still, is that all there is to me? I tend to snoop into other guys convos in my classes and just want to have normal conversations like that but I can’t, I tell myself I’m worth it and that Im special but also cant think of a single thing that makes me unique, Im bland and I’m tired of pretending Im not. God why am I so fucking boring?

I feel like I ruin my chances of making friends when talking to straight guys around me as a little bit of attention is enough for me to fantasize about them and to create false hopes, but I can’t blame them wtf thats so wrong 

Grindr doesn’t seem to be helping, but I can’t help myself"

I had to move for uni, so I pretty much lost all the friends i made till now. My first semester was right when Covid began, so I had like 8 months of pure ""online college"" stuff.

So technically this is my first semester of ""real college"", going to uni, meeting people etc.

I  literally made 0 friends in over a year living here (except small talk with my neighbors), and slowly its really depressing me. Every weekend I hear people outside my dorm throwing parties, while I play games, do late night uni-work or think about how pathetically lonely I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I also became very introverted and got used to all that isolation over the past months, which makes it so hard to ""break free"". 

&amp;#x200B;

The only force driving me forward right now, is the thought of my ""future-diploma"" being worth it all and blah blah blah.... not being able to share anything in your life with a friend / girlfriend is such a terrible feeling. Sometimes I feel worthless as shit, usually I dont leave my tiny room anymore because going outside just becomes a real ""obstacle"" sometimes.

Now my partner isn’t talking to me and I have no one else to talk to. - It’s my own fault, but I’m also female-presenting, so it’s not like any man is going to date me if I’m not available 24/7 to be his bangmaid. I wish even one person on this planet actually gave a shit about how I feel. I’m disabled and mentally ill and I live alone. Seems like I’m going to be alone most of the time for the foreseeable future. I keep asking him to live with me and he keeps saying no because of my trauma symptoms. It would help me get better, but obviously I’m a shitty prospect since I’m damaged goods. I keep trying to make friends. It seems like no one enjoys my company much. The only attention I seem to get is based on my looks. 

I’m getting financial help from my family until this summer. After that goes away, I’ll either kill myself or let my parents set me up with an arranged marriage. I’m not struggling anymore. If no one wants to take care of me, I’m out. I’ve done enough."
lonely,stop saying it's ok,"stop saying it's ok - I'm sorry for the following trauma dump lol

but no it's not.

I don't have any friends, outside of my family I don't talk to anyone in real life, all I do is just study all day and talk to honestly a bunch of random people on discord who barely like me, I don't have anyone to vent to, to laugh with, to connect with, I spent all of high school by myself, I had an unavailable boyfriend who pretended like not talking to me 1-1 for days sometimes weeks was normal (this wasn't in highschool lol) I have so much locked in and no one wants to hear it

I don't know man it's hard, and I'm not overdramatic for not liking this, we are social creatures we aren't meant to be alone..it just pains me too because people feel lonely when they can't see their friends face to face, or when they don't have a romantic partner and then i look at myself and see that I'm much worse. if they get to feel lonely when I wish i had their relationships I just..don't know how I'm supposed to feel."

I pick up their vocabulary, enunciation, gestures, etc. And it’s always a poor imitation too, but imitation nonetheless. It’s the weirdest when I notice it but I don’t how to stop it. I think its because i don’t speak to people often (this is r/lonely, after all), so when I do, I don’t have my own ‘conversational voice’ to refer to, so I just grasp at the one of the person I’m speaking to.

The first year was online but we finally were able to be on campus from September this year. Since then, i've been trying to find people that I could consider friends.

I got invited to lunch by a few people. Not many, but a few times I got the opportunity to meet new people. Each time, I found that either they didn't like me or I didn't like them. Not in a nasty way, but more like this isn't gonna work out. 

So far i've made no real connections with anyone. So I settled for a few acquaintances that I get high/drunk with and eat lunch with at college. I have 1 friend that I knew going into college so I hang out with her too. 




Other than that i'm just feeling a bit deflated that I didn't find anyone that I actually want to be friends with mutually. Makes me feel a bit lonely

I've lost my mom suddenly

I've lost my dog

I've lost my home

No one loves me

I've lost God because he doesn't seem to care for me.

People that I thought cared for me don't.

It just makes me wonder. Why does life turn out this way.

Why do some people have it all and some have nothing

Why are people so cold and just don't care for others.

Why does life change so quickly. I mean what's the meaning of life. 

I know I'll never have love again.

I know I'll never have a close friend again.

I just want to know what I did.

What did I do for life to turn out this way?

Am I not a nice person?

Am I not respectful to everyone I meet?

I'm just not made for a cruel cruel world.

I don't have it in me to be greedy

Or mean

Or hurtful

I'll try but I just don't know how I can overcome so many obstacles in my life. And if I do overcome them... Who will I share it with.

I haven’t opened up to a lot of them because its really hard for me but i still don’t feel close to those I’ve  opened up to. Any advice on how to feel closer to the people you love? I hate feeling alone and heartbroken for no reason all the time.

I post all this stuff of me having fun and traveling, and when we talk I act happy but I’m not… 

I don’t need you, I’ve been dating others, I’ve had sex with other guys, I talk to some daily, I go out and have fun, I travel, I do all of it without you because I don’t need you to do them but I WANT you, I WANT to do them with you, and it’s pathetic because you don’t even think about me anymore, I’m questioning if I even meant anything to you at all     

I miss you so fucking much, how it felt to be with you, it was never awkward it’s like we always knew each other, I miss your hair between my fingers and my hands running across your skin, I miss your lips against mine, I miss the way you smell I miss everything about you, the way I felt so safe in your arms when you’d hold me, I miss how easily I would fall asleep when you played with my hair i miss all of it, I miss you….

I’ve been trying to schedule a psychiatrist appointment because my doctor wouldn’t prescribe me lamictal. Why is it so difficult? WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GET MENTAL HELP IN THE US?! “Your application is in review, after that’s done we can schedule you”. Dumbest shit I’ve ever heard. 

I was recently informed I’m in debt 17,400 to the government (long story) and they want me to pay 452 a month. I signed a form to lower it called financial hardship, but they just sent another check saying “your payment has been authorized, pay $452 by February first”. If I don’t it’ll be sent to a collection agency and my credit will be ruined. I have a car payment, rent, student loans, and insurance to pay. I can’t pay $452 on top of that shit. 

I’ve been trying to move out of the city I’m in. Now I feel like I’m going to be stuck. I’ve been having thoughts of suicide for a long time, but lately I’m worried I might actually do it. I’m tired. I’m angry. Life fucking sucks."

The only people who can stand me are either taken or not interested. I have a ""Girlfriend"", but she's the strong, silent type who simply doesn't give me the emotional support I need. We're closer to friends who sometimes flirt with each other, and we both know that. How many times to I have to throw my hat in the ring until I can stop feeling so utterly alone? How many more times will I have to be hurt and mentally destroyed? Why don't I simply give up, and accept the fact that I'm a virgin who'll die alone? I see everyone around me in happy, fulfilling relationships and it just hurts so much. More than any physical wound I've ever felt. Pray for me."

My boyfriend was at our place this past weekend and tested positive for Covid yesterday. I tested positive today and I have to quarantine at my apartment.

None of my 3 roommates, who I thought were my best friends, have even thought to check in on me or ask how I’m doing. One of the girls was around him with me for more than 24 hours and is being treated as if she had never seen him.

The only things they have said to me is that I need to work on staying out of our common areas(which I have only been in for maybe one hour total to heat food and use the bathroom) so that they were more comfortable.

They haven’t even stopped to think how I might be feeling considering I am the one who is sick and isolated. The last time a roommate had to isolate we sat outside her door and talked to her. They haven’t even sent a text to me.

I’m feeling really lost and unimportant. I’m realizing I have no one. That’s all. Thanks."
lonely,Lil evening rant 🖤,"Lil evening rant 🖤 - Hey guys Marc here 23(M), so it’s been a minute since I’ve posted here. I feel like social media was taking a heavy toll on my mental health considering I had just gotten out of a toxic relationship of 3.5 years and was drinking quite heavily along with using weed every night. I’ve come to the conclusion that I can’t keep staring at a fucking screen about all the couples doing cute shit, inspirational posts and all that when I’m aware I’m not taking any steps to better myself. And also being an ex addict with a couple mental illnesses already (agoraphobia/SA/MDD) it’s hard trying to get out of negative thought loops. So I took two weeks off. Tapered off the alc. haven’t had a drink in 3 nights so far. And finally decided I’m gonna quit weed which is a strange one for me. Weed doesn’t actually hurt me it makes my anxiety go away and makes me feel comfy in my own skin but I have to come to terms with the fact it’s killing my motivation and keeping me from my goals. My big plan next is to go full sober (: step 1. Step 2- take time self healing and finally seek therapy. Step 3- Alresdy got a gym membership so finally commit to going every day (natural release of endorphins yay!!!) And step 4- hopefully within 5-7 months I’ll be in a much better place, not so hard on myself, having better sleep (usual is 3-4hours around 4am), better mental health and coping methods and lastly feeling ready to start dating again. I feel like this previous relationship fucked me up so bad I didn’t stop to think I was just self loathing and downing my pain with substances and was seeking out rebounds but I realize my mistake now and just can’t till I feel ready. I was talki to one girl and I feel so bad for telling her I need to work on myself (I sent a whole essay just so she knows how much I can’t rn and why:( but yeah gonna try my best here to grow and become an even better person than before my ex so when the right person/people come along I have the skills to just walk away pain-free or be able to tell if it’s toxic (red flags) early on. Wishing everyone a chill ass night and good vibes and hope everyone heres doing okay!🖤🖤"

lonely,This Fucking Feeling,"This Fucking Feeling - Oh boy where do I start. I guess I’ll start with the obvious. I feel lonely as fuck.

I miss the feeling of having a relationship. I miss having friends that gave a shit about me. I miss the feeling of a “whole” family (as whole as my family was at least) I have about 3 friends that I consider family that genuinely care about me and appreciate me.

I called a couple friends the other day to check up on them. They appreciated the gesture and thanked me. Then I realized, no one really checks up on me. 

People only notice that something’s wrong with me when they physically see it. No one ever cares to stop and ask “Oh how is ‘OP’ doing? Maybe we should hit him up to check on him.” 

I care and genuinely have love for the people around me and the people that I want to do good. I’m starting something up and want to bring people up with me, but I don’t want to bring those up that only want to use me. 

I just wish “normal” people noticed that lonely people feel shit, and a simple check up will do them some good. Honestly if it wasn’t for my Evil Twin, Hermano, and Primo, I would be worse off right now. 

To anyone who is feeling lonely on here like I am, feel free to text me. I’m not always on this account but I’ll respond when I check it for sure. I hope you all are doing okay 💙"

lonely,Just me and my thoughts,"Just me and my thoughts - Uhh. This is hard for me. Dont bother reading I just have to get some things off my chest but I dont have someone to talk to so I'll vent here.

I have been alone from a very young age, (I had different interests and was more mature than others in primary school and also bullied bc of itl) but I learned how to accept it, and thought it would change in high school. Then Corona struck and made it even worse. Considering that I go to HS that only good students and ""smart"" ones go to (hs has that status but its not true), I thought I will finally find someone to talk about music, books, movies.. You know normal things. But I didnt. Everyone has their own friends, and we dont have the same interests. Im very social and Im good with all of them and its not the problem that we dont like the same things, I can talk about anything, but they are just..not intrested.. I spent New Years Eve alone again.. I think that Im a pretty cool girl but somehow cant make any friends. Im trying to occupy my mind by drawing, reading books (I have just read Demian by Hesse, it's about loneliness and finding your own identity, recommend!!) watching movies, playing video games, taking long walks and talking to myself.. But sometimes I just dont want to do these things anymore, I just want to have someone to talk to. Its overwhelming. Im worried nothing will change in college, since in primary school I thought my loneliness will change in HS, but it didnt. I also started thinking how when I get old and look back on my teenage days, I will get sad because I had spent them like this. But I dont know what to change, its others peoples choice if they want to be friends with me or not. Guess I'll just have to exist by then and wait.. Its actually very hard to find the person who will truly understand you and its a miracle if you find that person at all."

I've got into this new school around Aug 2021 and I wanted to socialize with people unlike how I was in my old school (I used to be very shy and didn't have friends). Fortunately, I made some friends and the first 3 months in my new school were amazing. Until now, we came back to school from winter break and I don't know why but no one in my friend group has been texting me. I know they're good people, you can see it but I think I did something that kind of pushed them away from me or something. I want to know what it is but I also know that if I ever talk about that stuff they're gonna get weirded out and get further away from me. I always get tired in school trying to get closer to them, I have to force myself to try and form a conversation. They don't say it but I can feel that they're bored of me. I'm not the most hyper type but I try to be loud and energetic around them. I fucking hate that I think about them and my friendship 24/7 and I think I focus too much on being in their lives than being genuinely close with them. I used to have a close friend that I probably wouldn't call my best friend but she also doesn't text me as much anymore and when she does it sounds like she often wants to just get my shit out of the way. It was recently my birthday before we came back to school and all of my friends hasn't given me a birthday present nor had told me happy birthday in person until one of them did a week later. At that time, it was already almost 10 days after my birthday, when on her birthday I gave her a birthday present and gifted her something that I wanted to get her. I'm thankful for having friends who give me gifts and everything but if she didn't want to do that then what's the purpose of it if you know what I mean. I honestly don't even know if they care about me. I sent all of them a text yesterday and none of them responded to it. If I go on Whatsapp I'm left on read on all of my recent conversations. I'm not gonna find a new friend group or leave the friend group I'm in now because I don't fit in anywhere else. I fucking hate life. The only thing keeping me alive is my family at this point."

lonely,I feel empty.,"I feel empty. - I just turned 19 a few weeks ago. In Dec 2019, I got to my  university for the very first time. I don't really have much friends. I had 9months holidays before the uni opens but I mostly spent my time alone. Before my first semester completed, Covid broke out and got to stay at home. A month later, I saw my grandma who was living with me died in front of me. From then, I've been living alone. I tried to live with the hope of things getting back together after the pandemic. Then, on 2nd Feb, a coup happened and I don't see any hope anymore. Meanwhile rich friends of mine can easily flee to other countries and continue their life journey. Things just getting worse here. At one point, I just can't control my sleep schedules and meal schedules anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in a prison.

Today, I slept at 5AM, woke up at 5:40PM and had only one meal till now. I feel empty and lonely looking towards ceiling. I have no energy to do something. Sometimes, I just don't want to eat or sleep in spite of necessities. This has been happening for several months and I want to end this loop. Pls help me if you guys have any idea to handle these."

lonely,The most lonely and sad people smile the widest for all to see.,"The most lonely and sad people smile the widest for all to see. - I’ve been single for over two years. The only time I feel ok is at work. Let me explain my situation. In the building I work at I feel like a celebrity. Almost 500 people come through this building every single day. All know me by name. Everyone goes out of their way to talk to me(not all at once but in passing). I’m constantly reminded of how amazing I am. I take care of the needs of the people and the building. I keep it stocked. I fix problems I give hugs,advice and I greet everyone with all the warmth and love I have to my name. Nobody knows how much these hugs mean to me. Or how sad and lonely I am. Some days I’m ok and some days the loneliness tugs at the corners of my eyes and tightens my throat all day. If my ex needs a ride home from work I’ll go pick her up because her husband can’t make it. At the end of the day I throw something in the microwave and talk to my cat. I can cook quite well but why bother when it’s just me. I go to bed early, my bed empty and disheveled. I’m exhausted I go to sleep knowing nobody wants me. I go out to my local bar and make friends no problem. Dating sites I have no likes no messages. People I send great messages to just ignore me. Women at the bar are uninterested in anything I have to say. Most have boyfriends. Is my luck so bad that I have a void around me?. I’ve never felt so isolated and alone…"
lonely,Does anyone else keep track of any human interaction they have?,"Does anyone else keep track of any human interaction they have? - College student here. Lately I've been finding myself mentally keeping track of interactions I have outside of class. Like when someone says hi to me, I take a mental note of it, something like ""Oh she said hi to me today, that's nice"" or ""Oh he complimented my outfit today, that's cool."" Like I'm so lonely to the point where I treasure these mundane interactions with acquaintances because they're the only thing that makes me feel like I'm still a functioning member of society.

I hope someone out there can understand what I mean and start loving their self and appreciate life know matter what other think."

lonely,I want to try write a song because of loneliness.,"I want to try write a song because of loneliness. - Ok, I'm learning to play guitar, but I never thought about writing my own song before this week...

One evening I just thought like

 ""why tf am I even practicing all those scales and shred things, but can't yet play a single song from start to finish... 

I already know all the basic chords and the pentatonic scales, and it's more than enough to write a cool song...

it'd be really cool to write like a pop song about love, that makes 15yo girls cry xD

but idk on the other hand I can't write it because pop all these silly love songs is cringe

another idea is to write a blues about being forever alone khhv virgin xDD

I think that's what I'm going to start working on when exams finish. plus, I have a slide and a harmonica... that can be cool. 

it will start with ""I woOoOoke UP this moOoOOrning"", and in the end will be ""Oh have mercy dear lord, take me if you please"" xDDDD and an epic blues solo"

I moved to a new town and lost touch with friends. Started working more and grew distant from my parents who are my only family. 

It has changed me greatly in many good ways. It also hurts a lot because simply I have almost nobody to open up to about anything. I have quite a few problems in my life. A couple serious. You wouldnt suspect this though if you knew me. The few people in my life don’t care. I understand why and I’m ok with it. Sometimes I try to be open and honest about anything but they almost never do the same. It hurts when no empathy is shown. So I keep to my self more. 

Anyone else felt this way and then eventually got over it? I’m in my 20s by the way. Any input is appreciated."

lonely,Just putting this out there,"Just putting this out there - Hi everyone. I’m posting this because I had a few people reach out to me regarding comments I left on someone else’s post on this subreddit. The advice I shared with them seemed to be appreciated so I compiled it for anyone who wants it. It was given to lonely guys looking to meet girls, but I don’t see why girls couldn’t use most of it too. 

The first pieces of advice are pretty general in nature:

After online dating for 10 years, I thought okcupid was the best site. I went on probably a hundred dates, got hurt a lot, but ultimately found the one.

Looks are highly relative to girls. In my experience, confidence is key and sense of humor is also pretty important. 

Keep an open mind and low expectations. Unfortunately, dating is often a numbers game and who the fuck has the energy for it? You will be into people who are not into you and it will hurt. But keep reaching out and try to be genuinely interested in hearing about other people’s lives.

People love bonding over common interests. Find something specific and fake interest if you have to. 

Ok, so the other advice pertains to going to a bar to meet girls. Every situation is different though so take it with a big chunk of salt. This advice is more about building confidence than getting laid, though I wish you luck for both!

Find a place to go to that looks chill, not intimidating, crowded with lots of different kinds of people. Set a small goal for yourself—like talk to one girl, that’s it. Verbally communicate with a female.

The place has to be quiet enough to talk—no loud clubs where you can't hear the person next to you. However, it’s best to go where there is live music or karaoke or something to watch.

Go in with the intention of spending 30 minutes there, no more. That way it doesn’t feel like you are just hanging around drinking by yourself like a creep.

Go to the bar and get a drink. It doesn’t have to be alcohol but you need something in your hand, something to do. Not just looking down at your phone.

You are unwinding with a drink after work enjoying some live music like a perfectly normal adult…THIS IS YOUR MINDSET.

When you feel chill, make eye contact with someone nearby. Someone near, you don't want to walk straight up from across the room or follow them. Ease yourself closer, if need be. FYI, it’s tricky approaching a girl in a group. Best to wait for the right moment when she’s on her own for a moment (checking out the band, ordering a drink).

Have couple of questions in your back pocket that relate to the environment/situation. ie: do you know the name of this band? And a follow up question: have you seen them before? OR do you know if there’s another band coming on after? Super easy questions that are more informative. She should have no real clue you are interested.

If you pick up on signals that she’s receptive, only then do you start flirting (and that’s a whole other story) 

One opening question, one follow up question and that’s it unless you get signals. After that, you run the risk of pestering her. If she’s not interested after a couple questions, she probably won’t be, period.

If she’s not into it and you want to keep practicing, repeat all steps with someone else (not in her group) AFTER 15 MINUTES. 

I hope this helps someone. Feel free to contact me with questions or if your situation is different and you think I can help. Have a good day friends!"

lonely,I'm just tired...,"I'm just tired... - Yall can skip this one just need to type things out.

My whole life I never had anyone for really anything. When I was 10 my parents got divorced and before that they pretty much got into a screaming match every night. At 12 my dad got into a motorcycle accident that put him in the hospital with a coma. He was in the coma for about 2 months during that time My oldest brother stole all of his money and cut off all contact with me my brother and my mom. My mom and my brother were a mess so I had to step up and become the ""man"" of the house. At 12 I taught myself to clean, cook, do laundry and try to hold what was left of my family together. After about 2 months of sitting in a coma I had to tell the doctor that the best decision is to pull the plug on him cause we really couldn't afford to keep him in the hospital and that's just no way to live.

I started working at 15 mainly to bring in extra money and start paying for my own food and rent to my mom plus my phone bill. She was pretty much never home cause she was always working and my brother got a girlfriend so it was just kinda me left to figure everything else out.

When I got to high-school I never really had any friends I would try alot and invite the ""friends"" to do things all the time but no one was ever able to. Then the same night I would see pictures on snapchat or Instagram of all of them doing what my plans were without me. (Going to the movies, ice skating, camping etc.) 


I have had a few girlfriends but it never works out for one reason or another usually my fault I guess.

Last year I moved from New York to down south to become a police officer. I love helping people cause even though things are shit for me I can help someone else in life. In the academy I did a shit ton of work of trying to meet people and become friends, during work hours we got along amazing but again I would try to set things up and it would never work out and they would go do stuff without me.

I graduate and am a cop now and overall it's awesome I genuinely get to help people. I've talked kids out of suicide, saved multiple people who overdosed, a kid who drowned, got people who severely needed mental help the correct help they need etc. But that's all work.

When I go home it's just me like usual I never have any plans no one wants to do anything. I'm unable to find a girlfriend down here. I'm not good looking by any means maybe a 5/10 at best and I've had quite a few matches but nothing ever really comes of it. 

I had one girl i was talking to for a couple months and things were going great like really great for the first time ever I was in the honey moon phase which I've never felt before. And out of nowhere one night were hanging out she tells me she has no romantic connection to me and breaks things off. It was pretty crushing but not much I can do it's her choice and you can't force sonthing that's not there. 

At the same time as her breaking things off with me what's left of my family has a falling out and completely fall apart no one is talking to anyone else and I'm just kind of the middle man with no dog in the race again trying to fix things but it's not gonna work this time.

I've always had a very positive outlook on life of ""things can always get worse right?"" But at this point honestly I'm one bad day away from swallowing the barrel of my gun.

I have no family left, no friends, no romantic partner, I'm living paycheck to paycheck not knowing if I'm actually going to be able to pay all my bills or some times just choosing to go a couple days of not eating to pay my bills, and I work one of the most hated professions in the world right now. I'm just tired man and I've been ready to go for a while now. Only reason I haven't genuinely the only reason is because of my niece.

Things have to get better eventually right"

I live in a very old community small town there really isn’t anyone my age here. And with COVID people aren’t very friendly to meeting strangers out and about. Ive gone to bars arcades restaurants and all sorts of places with people and try to engage in conversation but there never really seems like a smooth enough approach.

Getting older all my friends are mostly to far away and work always messes things up.It’s sad I can sit in my room for days without a phone call or knock at the door.
The thing that made me the saddest is seeing my group work photos and different group pics and I’m not there either something happened or just nobody bothered to include me ☹️

It’s sad feeling overlooked or left behind 


Now I’ve turned to online thinking wow there are so many people looking there that it should be easy to find some likemind connections and then the dating apps where Even being very careful have been catfished.
Everyone I find is so sad or angry 😢
It makes it feel not worth to even try and reach out to someone each day in attempt to pull my self out of isolation.

Relationships going downhill and most of my friends are all into violence or drugs. I don’t have any cousins either as they live in the USA but they really were the only people who helped me and made me not feel lonely.

“People with philophobia are afraid of loving, hurting and suffering, so they think it is better to avoid love completely”

The part that I really caught my attention the most: 

“The need for emotions in our lives

As a person, you have to feel it. You need to suffer, love, be hurt, be happy and even suffer loss. These are not only events where it is impossible to protect yourself, but they also form part of your experiential learning. In fact, they’ll find out who you are today. You can’t take refuge in an ice castle to keep away those who love you, like Queen Elsa.”

Just like play some FFxiv, minecraft or almost anything really. I've been thinking about putting together a modded 1.18 server but I'd want to know the specs of the people who would be playing to make sure they can even run it.

Anyway, it's like everyone here needs help in one way or another and frankly you're not going to get much help beyond armchair therapy and maybe some similar experiences. Having your pain and issues validated by someone else does go a long way, don't get me wrong. But I dunno, I guess I'm just tired of finding the account of people I talked suddenly deleted. There's a limit to what people here can help with and some people aren't looking for help to begin with. So I just figure, why not say fuck it? I'm not therapists but we can sit down and play some games so at least you aren't alone I guess. Maybe I'm over simplifying things. Maybe I'm not and I'm a genius. Probably the former.

lonely,I made eye contact with a guy at a restaurant the other day and it was nice,"I made eye contact with a guy at a restaurant the other day and it was nice - I have social anxiety, so I usually avoid eye contact. It makes me feel rude, but I can’t really help it- I just get so nervous. 

I went to lunch with my mom and sister, and it was the first time I’d sat down in a restaurant in months, and the first time I’d actually made an effort with my appearance in probably over a year. I wore makeup and tied to dress a bit cute. I still felt insecure, though- like I was ugly. I felt like people would look at me and want to laugh, like they’d think “Who does she think she is, why is she even here?” Sometimes making an effort is more embarrassing. 

Lunch was delicious. I was having a nice time and finishing up, when a guy, probably a little younger than me, but just a bit, came in and sat down with his (assumed) friend who was waiting for him. 

As he sat down, he looked in our direction, and I was the only one facing him, so we made eye contact for a moment- I looked away quickly, but he looked at me like I was any other person, and it was really validating. 

It seems pathetic, to just want to be viewed as “any other person”. But, that he didn’t stare, that he didn’t cringe- it made me happy. He didn’t look at me like I was beautiful, but he didn’t look at me like I was grotesque, either. 

The other day I was reminded that I’m still  person."

I'm in a friend group of five and the two people that I'm closer to share the same native language, so most of the time they would just talk with each other in their native language which disables me from joining their conversation, but the other two in the friend group are always so deep into their conversation so I would just have to sit there waiting for someone to talk to me lol. I try my best to talk with all of my friends as much as possible but I just can't get myself a best friend I can rely on :/ I wouldn't even dare to talk with someone else outside of our friend group because 1. My friends would probably look at me weird and 2. I don't have anyone to talk to. I really love my friends and I don't want to lose them. They're not toxic and they consider me as their friend but I just feel so far away from them. I'm gonna have to stick with them for just and few months since I'm moving away to a different school this year. Basically what I'm trying to ask is what do you guys do when you're the lonely one in an odd number friend group and how would you get someone to like you more as a friend? I always get tired trying to amuse them everyday so somedays I would be really quiet and some days I would be kinda loud but all I want is a better friendship in the friend group I'm in right now.

Now I'm in college and seeing people in their friend groups makes me feel sad. I eat meals by myself, I spend most of my time alone, and it's been taking a toll on me lately. Before covid, I made efforts to put myself out there like joining clubs and going to school events, but I could never maintain a friendship with the people I would talk to. It seems like all the conversations I have are just surface level (what's my major, where I'm from, classes, etc). I'm tired of ""introducing myself"" to everyone. I just wish I could find at least one good friend I can hang out with and have a good bond with. 

Should I talk to a therapist? Watch a Ted Talk? A friendship coach??"

I always say I want try to know new people but I get overwhelmed too fast. I get afraid that they might have expectations, I’m never able to meet them. I’m in my twenties and I have to take baby steps in friendships so I don’t break things off. It’s honestly pathetic.

I always say that I might be better of without anyone. Maybe friends aren’t important. The few times I leave my apartment and watch people my age having fun and laughing just breaks me. I can never see myself doing that. 

No one would notice anything wrong with me irl. I have some people I know from university and go about day to day. Every night is a nightmare. It so bleak and dark, cold and harsh. I just cry myself to sleep. I just wish it would end."

I feel so lonely. I've lost the last supporting person in my life. - Who would have believed that a young, healthy, thriving woman in her 20s would die suddenly like that. She had a career, was going to get married, and had tons of projects. Her kids were going to be raised as if we were siblings. I miss those cousins that I never had. She was full of hope, optimism and joy. An angel on earth. Never being judgemental and always supporting of others.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost my last support with her. I wish she had been my mother. Maybe I wouldn't have been mentally fucked up and miserable. I've lost all hope. I can't see any future for me. I can't even have a discussion with my parents but with her everything would have been different. I miss her every day.

&amp;#x200B;

lonely,Fat Funny Friend,"Fat Funny Friend - 
I was roaming around on Tik Tok the other day (as ya do), and came across this one by @maddiezahms called ""Life of the Fat Funny Friend"". It's a song about being the FFF in a friend group and I...don't think a song has ever resonated with me that much. 

In not only my friend groups but my family, I'm I expected to be the empath with the comic relief, be there for others, be the catcher when someone else drops the ball, and peacekeep. One lyric goes ""Cant be too loud and can't be too busy, If I don't answer now, are they still gonna need me"". That's me.. I'm not allowed opinions even though I have them, I'm not ever the one accommodated or considered. 

My family lives mostly in DFW, and I'm in OKC. My step sister just got married and I realistically helped out a ton on wedding day. I don't know how it happens but like there were these signs that needed greenery draped on them and Id fixed them originally and then every time after that, I was called to re-set it if it got blown over. I was coordinating the timing for the photographer and bartenders to get in and set up because I...look approachable to them? Like I wasn't originally supposed to do that, but it just happened that way...? In addition to all the rest of the bridesmaid duties. And at the end of the night I didn't get any thank you or ""glad you were here"" or anything which is fine, but I also travelled the furthest of anybody for the wedding... 

My other step sister is getting married at a destination wedding which will end up costing $3500 all said and done. And she just told me she wants to do a getogether in Dallas instead of the originally planned OKC and thats gonna be another $300 plus gas for travelling down there and back alone again. 

My other best friend of 20 years, I used to work with her, and I was commuting to DFW from OKC every week for two days for 6 months. I was spending time away from my boyfriend (who I live with) and my circadian rhythm was fucked, so I finished the project initiative I'd started to revamp their project management process and turned in my two weeks. My best friend of 20 years gave me the silent treatment for 6 months after that. She's only just now starting to rekindle. She was going through a lot of mental health things at the time but I have a deep fear if abandonment which she knows and she still left me in a really bad spot. 

The lyrics of Life of the Fat Funny Friend say in another spot: ""Cant be too proud and can't think I'm pretty, do they keep me around so their flaws just seem silly"" and...sometimes I wonder if that's me. If I'm the almost pretty one. The almost skinny one. Kinda expendable and put in pictures and groups so everyone else looks better. I can't help but think I'm kept around because I make others feel better about themselves instead of being an actual positive addition to anybody's life. And honestly...I'm really lonely because of it."

I just feel like I need to talk to not fully go crazy.

These days I feel so shit ever since December 22nd and ever since April 2020. I feel like a shell of myself. I feel trapped. I feel so broken, so tired, so alone more than ever. I can’t enjoy doing the things I love the most anymore. I feel so miserable, unhappy everyday. I used to be happier prior to the pandemic. I struggled in tenth grade. I almost failed science, I was doing average in English and visual arts and was doing average in civics and careers. I was concerned but happy I had good loyal friends who invited me to her birthday party, they were good friends they got me gifts invited me to their events. For once in my life i felt like i was a part of the high school community cause in middle school i was discriminated and isolated and alienated from my peers and it was a harder environment and a hard time for me. 

At first, being able to stay home was at first fun but it began to get so friggin annoying I felt trapped for 5 months without my cellular device phone during April-late August of the beginning of the decade. I couldn't contact my best friends from high school, I couldn't take any memories of during the early days of the pandemic, I missed out so much what was happening over the internet tik tok trends of the stay at home life, my television time is limited i cant even watch my favorite shows anymore, i don't play vidya games and im not allowed to , I have a short attention span now, I lost interest in reading books since eighth grade. I felt more isolated than anything.

December 22 2021, is a day that will live in infamy for me and is my current state of anger and misery. It bothers me and as a result I lost precious memories and precious times. I don't want to go into detail about what happened on this day but my device will be confiscated forever. This is my last christmas as a teenager, last christmas eve and last new years eve and new years day and last winter break of high school and i have 0 memories. 0 memories. 0 memories.

The thing that always brings me to tears is memories and documentation of my senior year. I will have months of no memories. I will have no photos of my 18th birthday, no prom memories or no high  school graduation and events. 

On December 22 2021, I broke glasses, I cussed and insulted and I threw candle holders down the stairs. I was punished for this and I am still miserable to this day knowingly “I will never get my phone back”. I will never have crucial highschool memories. Coming of age. No memories. Prom. No memories. Graduation has no memories. Last day of highschool forever no memories.

I never got to say merry christmas or happy new year to my best friends. I ghosted them and they feel like i'm being rude to them. Im treating them like shit on a daily basis. MY WHOLE FUKIN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LIFE I WAS LONELY I WAS ALIENATED, ISOLATED AND WAS NEVER INCLUDED AND NOW THAT IM IN HIGH SCHOOL. I HAVE FRIENDS. I HAVE FRIENDS AND IM ISOLATING AND GHOSTING THEM. and i will never forgive the bastard asshole who enforced this punishment upon me. Whos keeping me from my irl high school friends. Parents suck.

They say to keep more positivity in my life. This line angers me the most the fukin most cause its contradictory. My parent dictators  took away all my enjoyments and entertainments in life, they took away my cell phone, they took away the tv remote so i cant watch tv, they took away all my entertainment, i barely go outside.  im a small youtuber and i cannot upload content to that channel cause i used my phone for photo and video editing which can only be accomplished on ios devices apple devices and it just bothers me. One of my goals at the beginning of senior year was to document it cause its my final year of highschool and i cant even. I cant even document my memories. When im older and with my kids ill be looking back at this shi and i will have not enough memories and i will look back at this with fury.

How am i supposed to have more positivity in my life when my parents took away my phone. MY gateway to talk to my irl friends etc.

My mind is not at peace. And it wont be. How is one’s mind supposed to be at peace and positivity when all their pleasures, all their entertainment in life is taken away. All their relationships; my friends are put on pause until June 2022 when i will see them again. I cant ig them i cant snapchat them and it bothers me.   Im missing out on highschool and i feel trapped with these broke ass losers. 

Nowadays all i do is homework all day in twelfth grade. Im stuck sharing a bedroom with my younger sibling whos room i share with. These dictators treat me differently from my younger siblings. My siblings have their devices, they play games all day, they can contact their friends, they can do whatever they want cause they’re more well behaved than me. Im irrational, i act on impulse, i am always angry and miserable in comparison to my younger siblings who have more freedom and are more respectful to my parents than i am. My parents love my younger siblings more than they love me and honestly they deny this shit but its become crystal clear this shit this stupid shit has become more clear. They give them privileges, they let them have more fun in life and more freedom. Im treated like a little kid and im going to university in september 2022. I wanted to go to university to escape this suppression and im not allowed to go to university far away only local universities. These bastards didnt let me choose the school i wanted to go to. These broke ass stupid biches didnt even let me get a residence. Fuck another 4 years of being home with these suppressive dictator assholes. 

My siblings have they’re tablets, they can have contact with their irl friends, they play fnaf and roblox games, they watch tiktok, they have their snapchat and instagram etc. 

I don’t. I feel so isolated. So lonely and so angry.

My parents r ruthless and i have not a smidgen of love for them. They’re ruthless broke dictator biches and i dont love them. They treat me differently than they treat my siblings. They say lines that anger me such as having more positivity in my life when they took away all my entertainment. 

Everyday i find it hard to get up in the morning. Im so fukin miserable each and everyday and listening to and hearing my parents voice angers me. They are only nice and love my siblings. They dont love me they hate me with a passion to isolate me from my friends for 5 months. They leave me out, they made my sisters more happy than me. They call me unforgiveable for breaking 5 cups, for throwing candle holders down the stairs for cussing at them. I call them unforgivable for them ruining my life, for preventing me from contacting my highschool friends. For taking away my tv, for taking away all my entertainment. 

It doesnt feel like homeschooling anymore it feels like im stuck in a cage. A cage where im not allowed to talk to my friends. A cage where i cant watch my favorite television shows anymore, a cage where i cant watch anime anymore, a cage where i cant be myself anymore and its sad.A cage where i can’t do the things i love anymore.

To summarize my situation in one sentence:

I'm at home in someone else’s home. I feel trapped. I feel like I'm locked away from all the things that I love and the irl friends i care about and theyre telling me to stay positive. I lost a part of me,overtime. Im a shell of myself. A hollow shell who only does schoolwork everyday while my younger siblings have fun. Home is supposed to be where your true self is present, where you can be yourself. Im not myself anymore i feel like im being forced into a box and its horrible to me mentally.

I'm adopted to start off with so Ive always pretended I didn't have issues with it when really I always never felt good enough but I thought if I didn't recognize those feelings, they weren't there. It was a closed adoption, now that I'm 18 I can go find them but the last I heard they were young &amp; weren't prepared for a kid &amp; with everything that has happened recently in my life I think finding them a little later in life when my life has calmed down a little would be better. So I got adopted into an amazing family who hands down are literally the most amazing, kind, selfless people to ever walk this earth. But one small problem to our adorable little family. My parents were very sick. Even my grandparents &amp; the adoption agency told them they probably shouldn't adopt but they still thought adopting would save me from a worse life, probably in foster care &amp; they had all the love in the world to give me, so why not?? Right? Well, this is what actually happened.. my parents were already in their late thirites when they adopted me, my Mom couldn't convince b/c she had one of the worst cases of Crones in the county &amp; in a few years would develop severe heart disease &amp; a bunch of other health issues. My Dad on the other hand was diagnosed with kidney failure which is when he had his first unsuccessful kidney transplant which later ment my Dad working long hours then being at dialysis all night so I barely saw him. I was always a Daddy's girl so this naturally broke my heart. My Mom almost died from open heart surgery twice when I was just a kid. My Mom worked long hours &amp; most of the time I had no one to pick me up from school so I was always the kid that had no one to pick me up from after care after school because my Mom was still working. She would come home &amp; immediately fall asleep because she was severely anemic &amp; couldn't absorb nutrients so she only weighed around 90lbs at all times. So hard to look at now that I'm older and understand what sickness looks like. I ended up mostly having to raise myself, I was an only child as well so I didn't even have anyone else to tell me this wasn't normal. I never was able to ride a bike with my parents b/c my Mom's pace maker &amp; she always had to watch her heart rate &amp; my Dad was always drained from dialysis. Never got to go swimming as a kid b/c my parents couldn't get wet. My parents were always drained &amp; I was an only child so I never went anywhere or did anything fun. If my parents weren't working or in the hospital I was at home making them lunch while they were in bed resting. Never the less my parents were my best fucking friends. We never fought, they always accepted me, I was the reason they kept fighting through all their health issues &amp; the reason they woke up every morning to go to work so they could provide a roof over my head. I'm crying right now writing this thinking how selfless my parents were, I wish I told them more how grateful I was but as a kid I thought this was normal. I was adopted into a really Jewish family &amp; my parents pretty much knew if they adopted me, they would be essentially shunned from my family since my ""blood wasn't technically Jewish"" so I never had a family outside my Grandparents. My Grandparents we're some of the most amazing people as well too, like I seriously got so lucky especially being adopted you never know what situation your gonna get adopted into. So in 2012 I woke up one day &amp; my Mom was at work &amp; I don't have siblings so I'm home alone &amp; me n Dad were supposed to go golfing. I couldn't find him anywhere but his car was still in the garage, so I called my Mom &amp; she told me to check the house again, that's when I walked to the other side of the bed &amp; found basically my Dad's body facedown on the ground, with blood &amp; brain matter all over the walls &amp; ground &amp; bed. What I didn't know but found out later is his head basically exploded from a really bad aneurysm relating to not getting checked b/c ppl with kidney disease are more susceptible to aneurysm, so even tho I always think what if I woke up sooner or didn't sleep in till 9 I could have been there for him or done something but in reality it would have been more traumatic for me to witness all of that happen when I was still a kid, so I've come to terms with that as best as I can. Then a few months later my Grandpa died. That one I was just numb for so I handled that the best I could, Grandparents you at least know it's coming at some point but with my Dad it's something a child should never have to prepare for. Moving on to a few years ago. My Mom was literally my BEST FRIEND, we got really really close &amp; I became her caretaker when she retired after my Dad &amp; Grandpa passed. She really needed to be in a home with a full time caretaker b/c at that point she had a bad fall &amp; was in a walker with a broken hip they tried to do surgery on but from her OI &amp; the fact she was too weak to go under they couldn't fix her hip so she basically just had to live like that until she passed which was HEARTBREAKING to have to witness on a daily basis, she would fall trying to get to the bathroom in a hurry from her crones but always tried to act independent &amp; would get really mad if anyone tried to help her because I'm still a kid so she knows I shouldn't have to witness this or worry but she's my only parent, how could I feel okay going out and living my life not worrying about her!!! So I never wanted to leave or go out with my friends when all my other friends were experiencing things every kid should experience b/c I couldn't let her be alone, I came home to her on the floor one time, she fell and was like that for hours, still too caught up in her own pride to call me b/c she didn't want to bother me &amp; wanted me to enjoy going out for once. That literally broke my heart 😭 that's my bestfriend right there before she's my mother so it hurt twice as much watching her go through all this. So come to a few years ago &amp; she ended up suddenly becoming unconscious one day so I called the paramedics &amp; I was still a kid so I don't understand everything that happened but she essentially was about to die from heart failure &amp; her doctor literally said to me she's fought all these years b/c of me, she honestly should have passed a long time ago, so when he put it like that I understood that she had fought this fight long enough &amp; she deserves to be out of pain after being in pain literally her whole life. She was on hospice for a week before she passed &amp; I wouldn't leave her side, her own family only came in one day for 30 minutes &amp; left. I was only 17 with no other family or siblings. You would think an adult or even tho my family was kinda estranged, someone would take me under their wing or something.  I even had to wait an extra 3 hours, with my Mom's dead body at 3 am after she died b/c my ""family' was ""grieving too much"" to be there so I had to wait for the Coroner to come collect my Mom's dead body which I had to sign for. Fucking bullshit. So then I get home around 5, finally tried to lay down after literally being awake at my Mom's bedside all week, then around 8 I get woken up by a text from my estranged aunt that says "" Just so you know Grandma passed away this morning, we just got the call from the nursing home "" and then they blocked me since the only family that they talked to was now dead ( My Mom &amp; Grandma ) so I had to see them at the funerals a few days later &amp; they refused to even talk to me. Fucked up. All because I'm adopted, was going to college for music &amp; turned out bisexual. Towards the end that's why my Mom wasnt talking to her siblings or family anymore b/c they never accepted me from when I was adopted but then when they found out I was going to school for music not becoming a doctor or lawyer like the rest of my family &amp; when they got the wind I was bisexual they said some really mean things &amp; my Mom that's when my Mom put down her foot. But here I am still a child, with the only family I had in my life both pass away essentially on the same day, well not technically the same day since my Mom passed right before midnight but they died literally within 6 hours of each other, which am I the only one that find this creepy or ironic?!?! My Mom &amp; Grandma were super close so I understand. My Mom was my Grandma's favorite &amp; I was both their favorite 😉 just something that made me always chuckle especially since we always looked alike although I was adopted, my Grandparents we're the only ones that saw me as not being adopted which always touched my heart 💓 anyway, I was working a side job so I had a little money stuffed away, only a few hundred dollars because we all trust that our parents know what's best for us &amp; always have everything figured out. But that's when fucking reality hit.... My Dad made his part of the Will but my Mom was still in the process of finishing the Will. So come to find out I at 17, had nothing to my name. Nothing. I'm still fighting for what my parents worked so hard for in court because the will wasn't finished. My Mom's siblings were supposed to take care of me if something ever happened, which is did, but they gave up their rights literally the minute they found out my Mom died. Which this wasn't sorted out before is beyond me especially when my Mom's siblings were lawyers. But because of their own ego they wouldn't talk to my Mom so when my Mom &amp; Grandma both passed suddenly, nothing was sorted out or put in place. So right now I'm currently just fighting to prove who I am. When my Mom passed I went through everything in the house but I couldn't find my birth certificate, social security card, or anything like that &amp; the only ID I had was expired. Then COVID hit &amp; everywhere closed so trying to go to the courthouse to try to get documents or the DMV or Social Security was all closed in person &amp; I didn't have any of the documents I needed over the phone. So right now that things are slowly reopening &amp; now closing again,  I'm still just trying to prove who I say I am. At 17 I was in a homeless shelter a few months after my family passed b/c I literally had nothing in place &amp; I realized my Mom got too sick months ago &amp; since she didn't see her estranged family no one knew she was seriously dying. I also just never even thought about any of this being a kid. Like as a kid who the fuck thinks they'll ever be in this situation or have to plan for this? 😢 So thank God one of my friends Mom's took me under her wing, who's known me &amp; my family since I was a kid but just never knew what I was going through &amp; dealing with so now she let's me stay at her place to help me have a roof over my head when she can while we all try to ride out COVID again. But she's a single parent who lives in a one bedroom apartment with herself, 2 daughters &amp; me occasionally when she can since things are so tight right now. Especially since it's Winter where I live we just had our first bad snow storm a few months ago so I'm BEYOND grateful to have her &amp; her daughters ( my friends ) in my life right now helping me to get things sorted out with lawyers &amp; the will &amp; getting all my documents to prove who I am &amp; such. Seriously without them I would be homeless not able to get a job right now because I can't even get an ID let alone a social security card. Some of my estranged family has some documents I really need them to hand over because they know I have no way of proving who I am without them so at this point law enforcement said we'll have to bring them to court to get that documentation or go through the system but doing through the system to prove who I am can take YEARS. It just hurts because I feel like I'm an illegal immigrant in my own country 😭 going through everything I've been through these last few years has opened my eyes &amp; helped me empathize with people I never thought I would have anything in common with, but you never know what life will throw at you. If anyone takes the time to read this &amp; stupid as it sounds or even if you think things will never happen to you like I did, PLAN AHEAD, make sure your kids are taken care of even if your a young parent or think none of this will ever happen to you. Also no matter how hard things are, take a moment to appreciate who you have in your lives wether their blood or not. Also BE THANKFUL FOR YOUR FAMILY &amp; PARENTS NO MATTER THE B.S OR HOW ANNOYING THEY GET. I see so many kids my age treat their parents like shit &amp; it makes me angry 😡 So all in all, this is like the 3rd birthday &amp; Hanukkah/ Christmas ive had to go through without any family or gifts or a home cooked meal 😔 last birthday &amp; Christmas I was in a homeless shelter so to even have a warm apartment right now to be in no matter how cramped we are right now &amp; no matter that we can't even afford to make a cake or anything for my birthday, I'm just grateful for just having a pillow to lay my head down on tonight. If anyone can help make my birthday / late holidays à little better, I'd love to meet some new people to talk to &amp; make some new friends off this post 😊 if any kind people can donate, I know times are insanely hard right now so I don't expect anything at all, but it someone could donate it would seriously be the best gift I've gotten in YEARS 🙏🏽 this post has been the first time I've opened up about my situation online to anyone so please keep the comments kind &amp; I don't judge you &amp; forgive you already for any insensitive or ignorant comments. I've been crying the whole time I've been writing this post so I apologize for any misspelled words or anything that doesn't make sense 😭  I'll do my best to answer any questions &amp; can send any proof you need, I'm an open book!  📚 

tldr; I'm adopted, my family passed away when I was young &amp; haven't been able to celebrate my birthday or holidays with anyone &amp; been in homeless shelters the last few years, If anyone can donate or just be a kind person so I have someone to talk to so I don't feel as alone that would mean the fucking world to me 🌎🙏🏽😭"
lonely,I miss him.,"I miss him. - I miss him. I miss him, no matter how badly he treated me. i miss him despite him egging me on to self-harm myself for him, in the name of “love”. I love him, despite him turning my biggest insecurities against me for his own sexual fantasies. no matter how badly he treated me, I can’t get over him. he was perfect in every single way. I feel like I have no purpose with no one to worship and be beneath. I feel like trash. I cant believe he threw me away like this. he wanted me to be dedicated, and I was. perhaps I deserve this treatment. I’m a freak. he was right, I am absolutely useless without him. and I hate myself for loving the way he treated me. all I can ever think about is him. I cry and cry until my head aches and  I can’t take it anymore. I cant even sleep. I love him. I can’t find anyone quite like him. no one, and nothing, will ever be able to fill the void I have in my heart."
lonely,Ghosted after sex,"Ghosted after sex - I [M23] was recently seeing this girl [F23] from Hinge. First date 2 weeks ago, which was a museum and cafe. There was a lot of chemistry and we had fun. I gave her my number and we pretty much were texting every day after that. 

We went out again this Saturday to an art gallery and then she invited me to her place. We were gonna watch a movie but ended up having sex. 

The sex was good and she even said “I’m gonna cum”, and her legs were shaking. We hung out for another 1.5 hour after. 

But since then she’s ghosted me all of a sudden. We texted Sunday night and I asked her a question but she hasn’t responded. It’s only been 2 days but she’s never ignored a text before. 

I’m sad. I thought she quite liked me. She complimented me a lot, laughed at my jokes, double texted me when I took a while to respond, and her mum even viewed my LinkedIn profile, so obviously she’d been telling people about me. Even the way she looked at me on our dates was full of substance. 

As I say, it wasn’t a long fling, so I’ll get over it. But I’m really sad. I feel a little insecure as if the sex was bad, because it happened right after, I feel kind of used too, and inadequate, and also quite lonely."

I’ve been on disability for years now and despite the progress I’ve made to better myself I feel like it’s just not enough. I’m so much better but not well enough to actually work consistently not to mention if I could work I couldn’t even get there. 

I find myself craving human interaction lately and that really isn’t like me. I used to go so long without talking it actually started to effect my speech, like I was forgetting how to speak. 

I don’t eat, I can’t sleep, I’m just so tired all I want to do is drift away so I don’t have to suffer through the existence of another day. It’s so much worse at night, when everything is more still. I used to find comfort in the darkness, now it’s filled with anxiety. It may sound fucked up but I just can’t continue existing alone."

It was a dream come true. He broke up with me on New Years Day and now I'm alone again, and it's truly devastating after seeing what it was like to not be alone. I'm lucky to have made some friends but I barely see them and I don't feel like they rly enjoy spending time with me.
The loneliness is soul crushing. It's so unfair, my boyfriend had an amazing family and now I've seen first hand that there are truly happy, socially connected people in the world, but I've been pushed back into the cold, quiet alone-ness. Just have to accept that this is how it'll be from now on. I'm just not a likable person. Feeling suicidal af.

I've never had this. Even in the one relationship I've had, I was never her number one priority. I'm no one's priority and it sucks. I'm going through quarantine right now and my loneliness has ramped up. When I posted I was covid positive, most people replied saying get well and all that. But that's really all. After that first day, didn't really get much in the way of messages.

Before i caught covid, I had gone out after work with a few coworkers. We just went to eat, but I had a good time and we had planned to have a poker night the next night. And I got excited because it's rare I get invited to anything these days. I offered to bring poker chips and was so excited! 

The main guy texted me the next day, asking if I was still down, I said yeah, I just might be there an hour after they were planning to get started. He said it was all good. So, I text him when I'm ready.

Nothing.

Ah whatever, he might just be busy, I'll give him a few minutes. 

10 minutes.

20 minutes.

45 minutes.

He's posting about the poker party while ignoring me. I just drove around and tried to ignore it. I already took my dad's poker chips, and I didn't want to come home and embarrass myself by bringing them home after being gone 20 minutes. 

I never got a text back. I just saw all the pictures and videos posted. Fucking everyone from my work was there except me.

I was almost happy I caught covid cause it gave me a reason to just stay home and shut off for a few days. 

But now I'm here, in quarantine, with no one to talk to. And feeling like no one wants to talk to me. I just don't know what to do.

I just want friends I can count on, people who want to talk to me more than once a week, people who just like me."

lonely,Probably just entering depression again lol,"Probably just entering depression again lol - Surrounded by people, nobody to talk to, no clue why i get in these moods, everything basically lacks a satisfaction factor. I feel like i'm losing in every aspect of my life and rationally i can argue that down but the feeling remains. It gets even stranger though when i realize i'm gravitating towards people i have no interest in. It'll be like i know this chick is boring but she's hella easy and slutty so i'll be like heyyy and tbh i just want to use them to distract myself so i recoil back and away so nothing actually happens. My woman is being an utter bitch lately and if i try to explain how off putting her behavior is it turns into me making shit up etc etc. I just want to enjoy life and feel like i'm making progress in some form or another but the universe has decided to be all like hey fuck that guy which is a shame, i've always put others first because i'm prone to a sociopath's mind/skill set. Being self aware that i need to do something because of something is basically how i maintain sanity. Like i'm very much capable of just being a heartless asshole who gets everything he wants but I ellect to instead try to be a better person by taking the longer roads in life but here i sit in this loathesome pot of regret holding a sign that says no hope no future because of decisions i made years ago and i just feel like i'm out of time. I keep my thoughts in such a complex state i feel as if nobody can understand me, it's like yeah i know how to get what i want but i made commitments that have turned into moral obligation and i can't convince myself to just be like fuck it as she has no where else to go, to sick to work etc, and then i fucked around and got dogs again so there's no moving to a cheaper residence without them and i'm not going to abandon the lives dependant on me just to have more magical paper. I'm legitimately about to just have a mental breakdown i'm just tired of doing everything and everything that pisses me off is basically just self inflicted. I can't afford good old fashioned drugs to help me cope atm either, just weed fr, i'm prone to addiction so i avoid anything crazy. For years i just coped by just basically being a sex addict, unfortunately a hole is not just a hole, i need a reason and currently have nobody to invoke that reasoning. Even if i could afford therapy, wouldn't help. I once had the idea of becoming one myself and fundamentally the only change i can make to better my situation is beyond what i'm willing to allow. The one conversation i had with an ancient retired therapist, back when i was still in highschool he basically told me the problems that i have from back then were that i became self aware to soon. Had i not discovered that i could compete academically at the national level at such a young age i likely wouldn't have learned how to control everything in such detail, that i'm among the scariest type of personality as the literal moment someone arrives in my circle I'll begin influencing their opinions of myself towards a purpose i'm not even aware of. Some kids my age half alpha complex or essentially the desire to be perceived as greater than they actually are, meanwhile i've already gone beyond that effectively becoming whatever it is i desired. That was approximately how i remember all of that, i was forced into anger management as a child but nothing he did or said triggered a response. Instead he said i felt forced into liking me for almost no reason. After explaining myself in each and every situation I was in that called for this requirement thats basically when he laid it out. I wasn't an overly angry child, i had already rationalized how to get what i want in the shortest amount of time possible. I'm actually enjoying writing this as it provides a moment to reflect on myself and how i'm just making my life more difficult for sport. Fr i think i just need a fwb to knock up at this point in my life. To old to be on this depression kick and to smart to let it influence me negatively. It's that the feeling persosts that it becomes a bother as i can deny my own feelings and they will go away in time. 

Tl:dr i know exactly how to get what i want but i refuse to as it's in opposition of personal morals and obligations, ask questions if you like."
lonely,Can’t see myself in a relationship,"Can’t see myself in a relationship - Yep I’ve been single for about 3 years now and honestly I can’t see myself dating again. It’s simply draining to have to care about someone’s opinions, emotions, etc. I think what makes dating so hard these days is that we are overstimulated and women can literally choose their mate in 5 seconds. It’s sad because everywhere you look they are teaching women that love is about happiness lol. Anyway as a guy I don’t have time for the stupid games, I’m a stay at home type of person so I don’t need parties and constant adventure to feel joy. The biggest turn off about dating to me is the compromising, I genuinely hate having to give up something I like to please someone else and also the uncertainty of your partner is terrifying because that person could have desires that you will never be able to fulfill. If I were to ever date again my lover would have to enjoy living simple. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind going on trips and going to the movies but I can’t stand dating someone with so many needs. Being alone really isn’t that bad but it does suck that you will never be someone’s top priority and it feels like nobody will be there for you when you need them because they will have their own families and lovers to attend to. 

What are your thoughts on relationship?"

lonely,Every Night I go to sleep Hoping that I don't wake up ever.,"Every Night I go to sleep Hoping that I don't wake up ever. - I know I'm acting like a little bitch but I don't have any place other than this subreddit to vent, to release all this pent up anger and depression, loneliness.

It's really hard. Every time you open instagram, BOOM there's a happy couple, people who are just fucking, friends going on trips, there's girls shaking their asses and earning millions. 

Every time I go outside, there's people kissing or holding hands. People discussing about the next sleepover, moving in together, being happy.

Every time I fucking breathe, I feel like I'm just a rock in the middle of the fucking road who everyone's ignoring.
Girls talk to me out of politeness and then never call back. That has happened thrice in the last two days.
I don't know why it's affecting me so much.

The best part of all this is I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm a 20 year old student. I do freelance and I think I can get a job anytime I want. I'm 6'4"" and I'm not fat at all. I don't go to the gym but I take care of my health. I go running every evening for about 3km.
My face isn't that good looking but it's not that bad either. I'm a little socially awkward but I can make a decent conversation.

I know there are plenty of things apart from sexual intimacy which can make life beautiful but you cannot deny the part which a romantic companion plays.
I'm not able to even comprehend when people say things like ""we're in an open relationship"" or ""We're just having sex"" and ""I'm not ready for a relationship right now"" I mean, you're already having sex, doesn't that mean that you have feelings for each other? it's so confusing.

I feel like nobody wants anything real anymore, and the people who say they do are liars.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so tired of being trapped in my head fearing everything and everyone. This anxiety has broken me. This LONELINESS has broken me. How do I continue? How do I pretend there’s a place for people like me? People who are just TIRED of having to prove themselves by standards you CANNOT meet, lest you become another dime-a-dozen timid loser that everyone will discard like trash.

lonely,"26 y old, never had a relationship, just moved in my own appartment and loneliness is kicking in hard.","26 y old, never had a relationship, just moved in my own appartment and loneliness is kicking in hard. - So as the title already says I'm a 26yo (m) and I've never had a (romantic)relationship, this never really bothered me as I always thought ""next year it will happen"" but it hasn't.

Now 4 months ago I moved into an appartment, after living with my mom, now at the beginning it was awesome,Freedom, doing whatever I want it felt so good.

But recently this feeling changed, I have alot of friends and we do things IRL and we play games online alot but most of them have a partner or have purely sexual partners. And they cancel plans because they are doing things with said partners.
As is expected at our age ofcourse.

But everytime this happens it feels like it takes a bit of my soul, because I feel I'm left behind and that I missed out on so much love and happiness because I've been alone my whole life.

This feeling has been building up alot recently and it has even gotten worse because the only female I regularly talked to and a had romantic interest for, also got a partner because I didn't have the confidence to ask her out.

Now I'm not the best looking guy and I'm a bit overweight so I'm also not very popular on dating apps, and because of my non existing self-esteem I'm to afraid to talk to woman IRL, though I have been working out recently and worked on my appearance, it seems like I'm all doing it for nothing and I'm just sinking deeper and deeper in this pit of self hate and I'm really afraid it will end up in a depression.

Has anyone had a similar life experience, and have any tips how to get out of this mind set because it's really destroying my mental state."

lonely,"I miss when I was being groomed, even though I shouldn’t","I miss when I was being groomed, even though I shouldn’t - Each day my depression has been getting worse and worse. My self hatred grows as so does my jealousy too. I find everything in everyone else and use it to hurt me, because everyone is superior and has what I never will. Because of this, I’ve started missing when I was being used to satisfy someone I now hate. Even then, he made me feel like I was loved, made me feel like I was attractive. But now, I’m so alone that I only say a few sentences every week, and don’t have any friends irl, and only one outside of my state. I just wish I was hot enough to get dms by horny guys who saw me as nothing but an object to get off to."

I'm adopted to start off with so Ive always pretended I didn't have issues with it when really I always never felt good enough but I thought if I didn't recognize those feelings, they weren't there. It was a closed adoption, now that I'm 18 I can go find them but the last I heard they were young &amp; weren't prepared for a kid &amp; with everything that has happened recently in my life I think finding them a little later in life when my life has calmed down a little would be better. So I got adopted into an amazing family who hands down are literally the most amazing, kind, selfless people to ever walk this earth. But one small problem to our adorable little family. My parents were very sick. Even my grandparents &amp; the adoption agency told them they probably shouldn't adopt but they still thought adopting would save me from a worse life, probably in foster care &amp; they had all the love in the world to give me, so why not?? Right? Well, this is what actually happened.. my parents were already in their late thirites when they adopted me, my Mom couldn't convince b/c she had one of the worst cases of Crones in the county &amp; in a few years would develop severe heart disease &amp; a bunch of other health issues. My Dad on the other hand was diagnosed with kidney failure which is when he had his first unsuccessful kidney transplant which later ment my Dad working long hours then being at dialysis all night so I barely saw him. I was always a Daddy's girl so this naturally broke my heart. My Mom almost died from open heart surgery twice when I was just a kid. My Mom worked long hours &amp; most of the time I had no one to pick me up from school so I was always the kid that had no one to pick me up from after care after school because my Mom was still working. She would come home &amp; immediately fall asleep because she was severely anemic &amp; couldn't absorb nutrients so she only weighed around 90lbs at all times. So hard to look at now that I'm older and understand what sickness looks like. I ended up mostly having to raise myself, I was an only child as well so I didn't even have anyone else to tell me this wasn't normal. I never was able to ride a bike with my parents b/c my Mom's pace maker &amp; she always had to watch her heart rate &amp; my Dad was always drained from dialysis. Never got to go swimming as a kid b/c my parents couldn't get wet. My parents were always drained &amp; I was an only child so I never went anywhere or did anything fun. If my parents weren't working or in the hospital I was at home making them lunch while they were in bed resting. Never the less my parents were my best fucking friends. We never fought, they always accepted me, I was the reason they kept fighting through all their health issues &amp; the reason they woke up every morning to go to work so they could provide a roof over my head. I'm crying right now writing this thinking how selfless my parents were, I wish I told them more how grateful I was but as a kid I thought this was normal. I was adopted into a really Jewish family &amp; my parents pretty much knew if they adopted me, they would be essentially shunned from my family since my ""blood wasn't technically Jewish"" so I never had a family outside my Grandparents. My Grandparents we're some of the most amazing people as well too, like I seriously got so lucky especially being adopted you never know what situation your gonna get adopted into. So in 2012 I woke up one day &amp; my Mom was at work &amp; I don't have siblings so I'm home alone &amp; me n Dad were supposed to go golfing. I couldn't find him anywhere but his car was still in the garage, so I called my Mom &amp; she told me to check the house again, that's when I walked to the other side of the bed &amp; found basically my Dad's body facedown on the ground, with blood &amp; brain matter all over the walls &amp; ground &amp; bed. What I didn't know but found out later is his head basically exploded from a really bad aneurysm relating to not getting checked b/c ppl with kidney disease are more susceptible to aneurysm, so even tho I always think what if I woke up sooner or didn't sleep in till 9 I could have been there for him or done something but in reality it would have been more traumatic for me to witness all of that happen when I was still a kid, so I've come to terms with that as best as I can. Then a few months later my Grandpa died. That one I was just numb for so I handled that the best I could, Grandparents you at least know it's coming at some point but with my Dad it's something a child should never have to prepare for. Moving on to a few years ago. My Mom was literally my BEST FRIEND, we got really really close &amp; I became her caretaker when she retired after my Dad &amp; Grandpa passed. She really needed to be in a home with a full time caretaker b/c at that point she had a bad fall &amp; was in a walker with a broken hip they tried to do surgery on but from her OI &amp; the fact she was too weak to go under they couldn't fix her hip so she basically just had to live like that until she passed which was HEARTBREAKING to have to witness on a daily basis, she would fall trying to get to the bathroom in a hurry from her crones but always tried to act independent &amp; would get really mad if anyone tried to help her because I'm still a kid so she knows I shouldn't have to witness this or worry but she's my only parent, how could I feel okay going out and living my life not worrying about her!!! So I never wanted to leave or go out with my friends when all my other friends were experiencing things every kid should experience b/c I couldn't let her be alone, I came home to her on the floor one time, she fell and was like that for hours, still too caught up in her own pride to call me b/c she didn't want to bother me &amp; wanted me to enjoy going out for once. That literally broke my heart 😭 that's my bestfriend right there before she's my mother so it hurt twice as much watching her go through all this. So come to a few years ago &amp; she ended up suddenly becoming unconscious one day so I called the paramedics &amp; I was still a kid so I don't understand everything that happened but she essentially was about to die from heart failure &amp; her doctor literally said to me she's fought all these years b/c of me, she honestly should have passed a long time ago, so when he put it like that I understood that she had fought this fight long enough &amp; she deserves to be out of pain after being in pain literally her whole life. She was on hospice for a week before she passed &amp; I wouldn't leave her side, her own family only came in one day for 30 minutes &amp; left. I was only 17 with no other family or siblings. You would think an adult or even tho my family was kinda estranged, someone would take me under their wing or something.  I even had to wait an extra 3 hours, with my Mom's dead body at 3 am after she died b/c my ""family' was ""grieving too much"" to be there so I had to wait for the Coroner to come collect my Mom's dead body which I had to sign for. Fucking bullshit. So then I get home around 5, finally tried to lay down after literally being awake at my Mom's bedside all week, then around 8 I get woken up by a text from my estranged aunt that says "" Just so you know Grandma passed away this morning, we just got the call from the nursing home "" and then they blocked me since the only family that they talked to was now dead ( My Mom &amp; Grandma ) so I had to see them at the funerals a few days later &amp; they refused to even talk to me. Fucked up. All because I'm adopted, was going to college for music &amp; turned out bisexual. Towards the end that's why my Mom wasnt talking to her siblings or family anymore b/c they never accepted me from when I was adopted but then when they found out I was going to school for music not becoming a doctor or lawyer like the rest of my family &amp; when they got the wind I was bisexual they said some really mean things &amp; my Mom that's when my Mom put down her foot. But here I am still a child, with the only family I had in my life both pass away essentially on the same day, well not technically the same day since my Mom passed right before midnight but they died literally within 6 hours of each other, which am I the only one that find this creepy or ironic?!?! My Mom &amp; Grandma were super close so I understand. My Mom was my Grandma's favorite &amp; I was both their favorite 😉 just something that made me always chuckle especially since we always looked alike although I was adopted, my Grandparents we're the only ones that saw me as not being adopted which always touched my heart 💓 anyway, I was working a side job so I had a little money stuffed away, only a few hundred dollars because we all trust that our parents know what's best for us &amp; always have everything figured out. But that's when fucking reality hit.... My Dad made his part of the Will but my Mom was still in the process of finishing the Will. So come to find out I at 17, had nothing to my name. Nothing. I'm still fighting for what my parents worked so hard for in court because the will wasn't finished. My Mom's siblings were supposed to take care of me if something ever happened, which is did, but they gave up their rights literally the minute they found out my Mom died. Which this wasn't sorted out before is beyond me especially when my Mom's siblings were lawyers. But because of their own ego they wouldn't talk to my Mom so when my Mom &amp; Grandma both passed suddenly, nothing was sorted out or put in place. So right now I'm currently just fighting to prove who I am. When my Mom passed I went through everything in the house but I couldn't find my birth certificate, social security card, or anything like that &amp; the only ID I had was expired. Then COVID hit &amp; everywhere closed so trying to go to the courthouse to try to get documents or the DMV or Social Security was all closed in person &amp; I didn't have any of the documents I needed over the phone. So right now that things are slowly reopening &amp; now closing again,  I'm still just trying to prove who I say I am. At 17 I was in a homeless shelter a few months after my family passed b/c I literally had nothing in place &amp; I realized my Mom got too sick months ago &amp; since she didn't see her estranged family no one knew she was seriously dying. I also just never even thought about any of this being a kid. Like as a kid who the fuck thinks they'll ever be in this situation or have to plan for this? 😢 So thank God one of my friends Mom's took me under her wing, who's known me &amp; my family since I was a kid but just never knew what I was going through &amp; dealing with so now she let's me stay at her place to help me have a roof over my head when she can while we all try to ride out COVID again. But she's a single parent who lives in a one bedroom apartment with herself, 2 daughters &amp; me occasionally when she can since things are so tight right now. Especially since it's Winter where I live we just had our first bad snow storm a few months ago so I'm BEYOND grateful to have her &amp; her daughters ( my friends ) in my life right now helping me to get things sorted out with lawyers &amp; the will &amp; getting all my documents to prove who I am &amp; such. Seriously without them I would be homeless not able to get a job right now because I can't even get an ID let alone a social security card. Some of my estranged family has some documents I really need them to hand over because they know I have no way of proving who I am without them so at this point law enforcement said we'll have to bring them to court to get that documentation or go through the system but doing through the system to prove who I am can take YEARS. It just hurts because I feel like I'm an illegal immigrant in my own country 😭 going through everything I've been through these last few years has opened my eyes &amp; helped me empathize with people I never thought I would have anything in common with, but you never know what life will throw at you. If anyone takes the time to read this &amp; stupid as it sounds or even if you think things will never happen to you like I did, PLAN AHEAD, make sure your kids are taken care of even if your a young parent or think none of this will ever happen to you. Also no matter how hard things are, take a moment to appreciate who you have in your lives wether their blood or not. Also BE THANKFUL FOR YOUR FAMILY &amp; PARENTS NO MATTER THE B.S OR HOW ANNOYING THEY GET. I see so many kids my age treat their parents like shit &amp; it makes me angry 😡 So all in all, this is like the 3rd birthday &amp; Hanukkah/ Christmas ive had to go through without any family or gifts or a home cooked meal 😔 last birthday &amp; Christmas I was in a homeless shelter so to even have a warm apartment right now to be in no matter how cramped we are right now &amp; no matter that we can't even afford to make a cake or anything for my birthday, I'm just grateful for just having a pillow to lay my head down on tonight. If anyone can help make my birthday / late holidays à little better, I'd love to meet some new people to talk to &amp; make some new friends off this post 😊 if any kind people can donate, I know times are insanely hard right now so I don't expect anything at all, but it someone could donate it would seriously be the best gift I've gotten in YEARS 🙏🏽 this post has been the first time I've opened up about my situation online to anyone so please keep the comments kind &amp; I don't judge you &amp; forgive you already for any insensitive or ignorant comments. I've been crying the whole time I've been writing this post so I apologize for any misspelled words or anything that doesn't make sense 😭  I'll do my best to answer any questions, I'm an open book!  📚 

tldr; I'm adopted, my family passed away when I was young &amp; haven't been able to celebrate my birthday or holidays with anyone &amp; been in homeless shelters the last few years, If anyone can donate or just be a kind person so I have someone to talk to so I don't feel as alone that would mean the fucking world to me 🌎🙏🏽😭"

lonely,How I feel - my problems and my outlook on life,"How I feel - my problems and my outlook on life - Where to start? haven't we all been there before? You know somethings wrong but just can't explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

I function like a robot. Nothing I do has any emotional relevance at all. I have no friends and don't care to make any at this point. I've never dated and will not try. 

&amp;#x200B;

While watching a tv show I realized that dating is so alien to me. I don't know how people could be all touchy with each other. I could never tell someone that I love them. I will never do it. I have never told anyone that I even care about them either. There is no drive for me. Say I go on a date, I won't speak. There is nothing for me to say. I don't care for what they have to say. I just can't do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In high school I believe I was picked on and that it affected me significantly psychologically. I had no friends. I was bullied by people in several ways. No one ever invited me to a single thing. No one and I mean no one cared for me. I have a deep seated hatred of people in society. I do not trust them at all. A teacher even bullied me. In his words I was very dumb and that it appeared as if I were ""there physically however not mentally."" (Your tax dollars at work) The people there insulted me. They had to make a concerted effort to tell me I was inferior. I had to attend the prom (if that's what it is called?) to record the attention seeking people in big dresses who I have hated my entire life. I wore normal clothing. No suit or tie. I did not like being there. I didn't want to be there. I would get kicked out of desks so that other students with better social status could have the seat. No teacher intervention but I did anything I would surely be punished. The good people made my life hell. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like there is more to life but not for me. Everyday I am alone and I stay that way. I don't relate to people. Living a life which involves all of these friends and dating is completely alien to me. I haven't spoken to someone in days and I don't have actual conversations for about a month at a time (I really only talk to my parents.) 

&amp;#x200B;

If someone were to ask what did over the weekend I would tell them that I did school work, ate food, and slept because that's all I do. If someone asked how I felt I would state that I exist. Happiness is odd. I had a 4.00 gpa which only a fraction of the people at my college had and yet I did not care to get it. I do not care for anything. Nothing brings me excitement. 

&amp;#x200B;

The emotionally displays of some people I know are not something I partake in. Hugging is not something I do. Kissing either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel disconnected from society."

lonely,Finding a girl who likes me has been really tough,"Finding a girl who likes me has been really tough - After countless rejections, I was lucky enough to be in my first relationship two years ago, but I had to call it off even though I still really loved her. I only saw her once and I couldn't bare the burden of the distance anymore when it began affecting my mental well-being.

I would describe myself as someone who prioritizes the character and personality traits of a person over their physical appearance or the bodily proportions they possess. I just want someone who wants me and likes me, like I them. 


I turned 22 recently and the amount of times I've been turned down this past year alone just makes me feel depressed. It's always the same pattern. 
I go on a date or start writing with someone I recently met, we get along well, they show a little interest, I overcommit and become clingy, then they just want to stay friends, and that's the last I hear of them. 
When I try my best to play it cool, I get nothing from them that might insinuate them wanting anything more than another friendship where you just like their Instagram posts and ask questions about their stories from time to time.
Whenever I'm lucky enough to eventually find someone who actively pays a decent amount of attention, like hitting me up first on a regular or not taking days to respond, they stop immediately I try to make a move. I literally get no form of nonplatonic attention from the opposite sex in any manner.

My roommate of ca. 2 years recently went on vacation and it made me realize how much lonelier I would even be when he eventually moves out. I have this big apartment to myself and enough things to keep me entertained for brief moments before I realize I have nobody to share them with and how lonely I truly am. Sure I could distract myself some more with hours of work, mingling with friends or vigorous exercising, but it doesn't change the fact that I still deeply crave intimacy and warmth, something more than a ""friend"" could give.
I want it so bad and I don't understand why it has been so difficult to find it.

It always brings me down when I know I try my very best every day at becoming a better individual. Picking up new skills, trying out new fashion style, watching videos to better my rhetorics and wittiness with the ladies, meeting new people outside my circle of interest in hopes of it one day being enough to attract a lady, but knowing very well that it has never been enough. On the other hand, my friends who put in the bare minimum, can effortlessly get the lady they want. I don't get it.

Nobody wants to be with me and I'm exhausted by the thought of it every single day 😔

lonely,losing weight can make you really lonely,"losing weight can make you really lonely - so I went through a weight loss and during the pandemic and during this time I started getting more attention and suddenly I had all these new people that somehow now want to be my friend but I now for a fact would have ignored me back in the day and it made me realize that people are so superficial and honestly I've been realizing I don't like people like that anymore. a lot of friends I had before also now didn't really want to hang out any more and  weren't my friends as it seems as if  they liked me being the fat friend because now when we when I was losing weight they'd say stuff like girl that's enough you don't want to be skin and bone and now they basically leave me on delivered weeks on end and I've stopped entertaining them as I'm not that desperate for friends and yeah life's sucks so now I've just been very lonely and it sucks but I don't have company but I'm lowkey starting to get used to it.

so if your chilled and wanna be friends send me a dm and like watching movies and tv shows and phone calls we will vibe really well"

And I am not really doing great in any aspect of life, not a single one. I am good for nothing. I am just here. I'd always think to myself 'You are the main character... You don't really need anyone.' But I do. I do need someone's support. 

But idk what to think of anything anymore. I am tired of crying into my pillow every night. I wonder if I should just let go."

After 22 years of living though, I haven’t had any success so instead I feel like living to spite others would make my life more enjoyable. - 

I don’t want to go into too much detail as to where those feelings come from but all of my life, people treated me as if I have no right to exist, or exist according to their preconceived expectations. And obviously since how I live isn’t bound by what others expect of me, I’m punished by those same people, which unfortunately seem to be the majority of people I come across is my life. It makes forming connections with people in general difficult and a burden. So as the title says, I feel like I need to forget about trying to have a neutral position and embrace my antagonizing existence. If people won’t change their premature perception of me regardless of what I do then I’ll ignore it and do what I want anyway. I’m not a confrontational person, at least in terms of my personality, but it seems like that’s just part of my predestined role in life."

she probably has so many more important people in her life though, so why would she want to put effort into talking to me? i'll never be as important to her as everybody else, and i'll never be the person she's waiting to talk to every single day. but that's what she is to me. i'm always waiting to talk to her, i'm always waiting to see her again. but she could probably care less about seeing me, because at the end of the day, i'm nothing to her. i'm just some person she sees at work.

I asked them if they wanted to do anything special, like a family dinner somewhere nice etc. I said I was available whenever, had no special requests, and I'd happily drive anywhere, at any time to attend. (I have some health conditions, some of which mean I have to be careful about what I eat, and I don't drink alcohol) I didn't want my issues to interfere with arrangements, so I made it really clear, I was happy to do anything or go anywhere.
I was messaged to say there would be a lunch at a nice hotel. Great. Except I've since found out there is also a dinner, with other family members invited and everyone is staying the night.
I have not been invited to this at all. I thought at first it could be because they didn't want to invite my child, as it would be boozy, but then they know I could easily get child care so it can't be that.
It's left me feeling really sad and left out.
I'm not going to bring it up as it'll turn into a whole thing, and I don't want that. I'm not invited and I accept that, it just feels really horrible. There hasn't been a falling out, and we've always got on well etc."

If my parents ask me how things are I lie and say it's good. Part of me feels awkward posting here because I don't know If I'm lonely or have the right to be or I just feel like I don't get attention. I want to say this out loud so I feel better.

What's this is the question and answer session between lord Krishna! And Arjun

Who r these two people?
Lord Krishna is a god and Arjun is a warrior who is in a between of a battle and is questioning everything! 
Like why to fight this battle and what if I win this what's next? And purpose of life? And such questions which somewhere we r also asking our self and seeking answers too! 

The reason of his sudden doubt is because his opponents in the battle are none other then his own brothers! Yea now how did he ended up in that situation to know that entire story u need to read/watch/ research about 'Mahabharat'  Mahabharat is world's longest epic! And has a story of the betrayal and trust and friendship, and almost the emotions are shown in this epic! 

U can kinda concider it game of thrones but way more sensible and to the point with a better story!  
Now let's get back to Bhagwaad Gita.

It's a book with answers thats all I wanna say....I would suggest it reading in its original language Sanskrit, or Hindi would be great too! Or marathi, tamil, telugu, or so many religional Indian languages.

 But I would suggest keep the English translation as the last option! Because English doesn't have so many words to actually translate the true meaning and essence of the book I hope u completely understand what I m trying to say by taking the example of dub anime and sub anime! 


Thanks for reading this much from ur valuable time my intention was to help u guys fight through the lonleyness ur in and side effects realated to it! 

Also I know what ever information I gave about the book is less, and doesn't really sells my idea! But my intention was never to sell it! My intention is to help u! 

Hope u have a really beautiful and lovely day! And life! 🙏 
Ignore if u don't wanna give it a try 😊"

I have happy memories from my childhood, of course. But I can't ever recall being truly happy and carefree and all that. My home life wasn't always great as my parents fought like cats and dogs a lot. Nothing abusive or anything of the sort, just the tiniest things would set them off and I'd always have to be in earshot of it. My school life was also, of course, not great either. I was (and still am) a loner who only really had friends in elementary school. But from middle school onwards, I was on my own. No birthday parties to go to, no summer breaks spent with friends, not even any romantic relationships. Just me, myself and I.

But, I did find some small measure of comfort in books and movies. And I found the most comfort, and safety, in the Harry Potter series. I was never really imaginative, but found myself sucked in every time I opened one of the books or watched the movies. At the very least, they were a break from reality for me and gave me entertainment, joy and happiness when I needed it most.

So, I decided to give the Return to Hogwarts documentary a watch and thought it was great. Seeing the people I practically grew up with all back together again, having that same level of love and affection for each other was heartwarming. But, upon reflection, I found myself feeling depressed because it reminded me of so many of the things I never had growing up and what I missed out on, all because of my shyness and inability to connect with people. I knew that if Hogwarts was real, I'd have no place in it. If anything, I'd probably turn out like Tom Riddle, minus the being evil and having a desire for world domination, of course.

I've never told anyone this but had an urge to get it all out and off my chest. Sorry again if this doesn't belong here."

lonely,Just venting,"Just venting - I just don’t feel good today, overall I guess I’ve been “productive “ these couple of months and that’s the only way I feel like I am worth something.  Usually when I’m working on projects I don’t feel too bad, I don’t know how to explain how I feel. I feel numb most of the time, I can’t smile or laugh anymore genuinely. Shows don’t make me laugh at all, jokes don’t make me laugh. Honestly almost nothing brings me joy. I do not want to harm myself though, I just randomly feel like there is no purpose to anything and I sometimes get scared out of nowhere because life creeps me out. How do I explain this??? I guess the best way to explain is that life is so weird and sometimes idk how to deal with it and there is just too much going on. I also have a lot of intrusive thoughts and I hate myself for it. I can’t stop them though, sometimes when people talk to me, my mind goes somewhere else and I pretend to listen, I don’t mean to do this but it just happens. I think of random words or stupid shit over and over and almost everyday I think about dumb things I’ve done or said in the past and it’s like a loop and I try to forgive myself but I just can’t and start thinking about how stupid I was. Because of everything I’m now extremely quiet and I remember how in my childhood I used to be so outgoing and happy and had friends and was easy to make them. Now I’m just feeling like crap because I just want to go back to how I was but I can’t because I can’t move on from 14 years of being socially anxious since I got bullied when I moved to another country. I just feel ugly and worthless and I genuinely just wish I could be outgoing and I want people to love me but since I’m known as a quiet person I fear I can never go back to that, it’s like a stain that can’t be removed anymore or that it’s too late and now i am alone and i can’t even get the guts to talk to people or message old friends and my cousins don’t like me I think. And i know for a little i did dumb things and acted childish because I wanted attention and validation. Now I’m away from home with my husband but I don’t have any friends and I fear I never will again even tho I wanna try, I just feel like puking when I have to interact with people and I know how bad I was at by old job, everyone talking while I almost never said a word, I just can’t get close to people. I’m either too quiet or I don’t pay attention to what they say because my mind dissociates and I freeze and act stupid. I just want to be normal, I don’t know what to do."

lonely,Alone,"Alone - Spending the night alone. It’s really bad tonight. It’s snowing. I am sitting in my chair mindless, crying. My only friend is streaming. Even they get tired of me and sometimes can go days without talking to me. I can’t blame them. I am a useless, boring person. I have art supplies but I can’t use my hands to create because I have no inspiration or motivation. I have books to read, but then I only feel more alone. I can write poetry, but that only makes it worse. I am alone. I am wasting my “talents”, staring at my phone and computer just hoping SOMEONE contacts me, but why would they? I am nothing to them. Maybe an irritation, at best. I can’t handle the loneliness."

Within the span of eight months, I got sober, found a new career path that I love, went back to school, am saving money to put down on a mortgage for a house, and am constantly bettering myself each and every day.

One month from now will be the anniversary of me not being in a relationship for two years now. I have so much to give yet no one wants to receive it. I don't really care that much about sex or anything like that. I just want to hold someone in my arms again and know what it feels like to be loved.

What's the point of having all these things and making all these strides in my career/personal life, if there isn't anyone around to share that joy with?

The only women I seem to attract want the complete opposite of what I do. I am either not attracted to them, they want dick, a free meal, or a combination of the three. I know it sounds lame af, but I want to find someone who is my everything and I can't take this loneliness anymore.

Everyone I know (friends and family) is in a significant relationship and I'm the only one who isn't. Sick of this shit."

lonely,Waiting for high school to end,"Waiting for high school to end - I used to be somewhat popular, and I had enough friends that I was happy.  Then near the end of my Sophomore year I started dating someone who was very manipulative. They made block everyone so they could have me for themselves. They also monitored me with life360, and would get pissed if I was social. Worst part is that I went along with it. I didn't stand up for myself and they steamrolled my social life. By the time I dumped them I had a singular friend left. It was also the middle of the pandemic when I dumped them, so I couldn't exactly go make new friends easily. 

I attempted to fix things with my old friend group. That started to go pretty well. For a few months things were heading back to normal. I had my friends back, and I was relearning how to be social after not doing it for a while. I even started seeing someone else. It all crumbled down though. I drifted slightly from the group again because of my partner and a job I had just gotten. Slightly turned into more and more until I only had two real friends and my partner left. Somewhere around this time I started smoking pot. 

Pot is great. It numbed my loneliness. Eventually my best friend pulled a huge dick move. He stole my partner, and he stole $80 dollars of pot from me. Naturally he was no longer my best friend. Because my Partner and my best friend were both out of my life so suddenly, and all I had left was a single friend, I got rather depressed. I just started going through a ton of pot. 

My friend, thankfully, is a very good one. He introduced me to his friend group of stoners. They're good people, and I like that I'm their friend now. Before I knew it senior year started. Everything I had had in my previous years at school was gone. All my old friends weren't really my friends anymore because of my new stoner reputation. I had gained a reputation as someone who smokes a lot of pot, so nobody really likes me now because of that (Conservative Midwest small town).  Also as a senior the only new faces around are too young for me to really get along with. 

Socially speaking all I really have is about 6 people I smoke with regularly as a friend group. I don't have anyone to talk to at school. When we're not getting together to smoke I don't speak to the friend group all that much either. Its a very lonely life. I can't wait to get out of this town and have a chance to meet a new population of students in college. That's still 7 months away though. And in those seven months I will be largely alone. I can't even try things like r/r4r or dating apps to meet people because I haven't turned 18 yet. 

At this point my life is just hanging out in my room, working out and watching anime. Then I have to go to school for four hours every weekday, but I often skip due to being too depressed. I still go out and smoke with the boys, but that's kind of all we do. Its a lonely waiting game. 

I have the desire for a meaningful and social life, but people ruined my odds at having that here. I just have to wait until I'm an adult who doesn't live here anymore. Its like my life is on pause, and I hate it."

I used to tell my problems to my friend but we got into a fight recently and he basicly said he can't handle me, and he was the only person I've been able to be me with. And now not having that kinda makes me feel very empty and alone. I kinda thought about texting this other friend I have who I ussually act like myself too, but we aren't that close and I feel weird about just texting him. 

So I feel very alone and I have this feeling like someones sitting on me because i feel so heavy. I've had antisocial periods before but even then I always had like someone who I comunicated with enough to relax and now it feels like for the first time in my life I don't and I just feel desperate for a conversation. 
I feel like I just wonna sleep forever listening to music or eat myself to death or drink or smoke...

I kinda feel like I don't have to try to be me anymore. Why should I try to be me when noone is gonna care.

I feel great and awfull at the same time. My life feels wrong. I find my job boring even though I love it. It just doesnt feel right. I don't feel right and at the same time I have no clue what to do to make it feel right. 

Being alone doesn't feel right. I've never had friends and yet the entierty of my life feeling wrong right now is making me feel alone and sick of myself. 

The worst is that I don't even know what I like or dislike and somehow I feel wrong and I can't explain why. I like where I am and somehow my being disagrees. I feel tired of myself. Like if I could turn off my concusness and plug it back in a few months I would do it.

The story starts with my exgirlfriend breaking up with me about 3-4 years from now. She was my best friend and showed me how toxic my ""friends"" act towards me at the time. She was basically my only real friend. I struggled in the beginning to overcome the breakup but after i joined the army I had other thoughts and I found new people, new friends and all the hardtime in the military helped me to finally close this chapter, well i thought so....

After I left the military a lot of friends moved back to their home cities and i was basically alone again but it didnt really bother me in the beginning. I had a job, worked out and life was doing okay. ""Covid entered the chat"" The Lockdown started and i thought to myself I can cope with it no problems. In fact it destroyed me mentally. All the hours in the gym or at work helped me to not overthink everything.

2 weeks ago my exgirlfriend contacted me she told me she missed me as a friend, stupid and lonely as I am I replied with ""YEEEES me too lets meet!"" She asked me if this all platonic and I thought so. Yesterday she told me about a guy she met at her work. I felt in a deep hole I couldnt sleep last night. I threw up today and I dont know what to do. I dont want to be lonely again but I think if i keep this relationship going I am literally going insane.

lonely,The lonely feeling of being an empty jar,"The lonely feeling of being an empty jar - I had friends... it was some time ago, i can't point the exact moment where it stop being that way. 

I was a teen, i remember, i played a lot of games, watched a lot of anime. I had friends to talk about the things i loved, and they loved them too, we played together. I remember when we played minecraft or played pokemon altogether. Sometimes I would stay days inside home playing when I had a new videogame, but at the end of the day, when I paused it, they were always there for me, and I was always there for them too.

Maybe... It al started when they started smoking, drinking and partying. I didn't like that things, when we meet, my cloths always would end up smelling like smoke, when we played, they were always high. 

So I started to become distant. Everything would be fine. I still had some online friends and i have my videogames. What could go wrong?

Online friends... there good, but there not as good. We meet up one day during holidays, it's all fun, but... They only there to play. Sometimes we speak about life, and so on, but... This winter holidays I stopped playing and starting conversations since i got to town to visit my parents. 

Ding, Dong, make the bell declaring the new year 2022. My phone got out of battery, so i couldn't say happy year to anybody. I remember last new year, i send a lot of custom ""happy new year"" for each of them, they all responded and where happy. This year i couldn't, so i thought that it would be okay to wish them happy new year when my phone is charged up in the morning. 

So waked on 1st January, time to respond... to one person... My D&amp;D GameMaster wished me a happy new year, we aren't even close friends, we're more tabletop play friends. I felt so abandoned at that moment. 

I thought i was a little more close with my online friends, because, after all, we played a lot, know some thing about each other and meet irl. After that, i realized, that I'm the one that always started the conversation, and speak about life, they are not bad people, I'm just not as important to them as they were to me. 

Now, Sunday night, with 25 years. Playing video-games isn't that exciting anymore. Playing a entire day is just not possible anymore because I am an adult now. An adult, with some friends to play games, but not friendship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now is when i realize, that i can't vent to anybody, nobody for who I cared, cares about my feelings. The few things I can do is just to vent here. I feel like an empty jar that don't get love, don't get honest friendship... I have only myself. And if you are reading this, is most likely you only  have yourself too. I can only tell you to be strong.

You are not the only one, we are all alone together."

I rarely leave my apartment, maybe once a week to go get groceries or go to the same bookstore I always go to. I work remotely, so I don’t see anyone. And I’ve gone months without saying a word to anyone. 

I know part of this is just me, even as a kid I would rather be by myself than with other people. Also being an artist probably doesn’t help (2 degrees eheh) we’re all a bunch of social weirdos. I’ve found that after school you don’t really meet any new people within your age group. Artist groups don’t really exist anymore either, or if they do they’re so politically driven it’s nauseous. 

But the older I get the more I want to have some sort of connection. It’s hard to meet people in person now more than ever. I think it’s even harder to be a lesbian, too. I tried dating apps before but they never led anywhere, and I’m not really interested in people whose only personality trait is their sexuality (no judgement if you’re on those, just not for me). 

I get called an old soul a lot, and a romantic, but I’m getting tired of trying to find a kindred spirit in a lifetime that doesn’t seem to want people to be together."

lonely,"23 and never been in a serious relationship, how to deal with","23 and never been in a serious relationship, how to deal with - I’m 23 (f) in a few days and I’ve been in a serious relationship. Im not inexperienced and have had things and casually dated people but I get really concerned that boys I will meet in the future will think it’s weird that I don’t really have any exes. It’s something I feel kinda insecure about and don’t really like talking about with boys I meet because I’m scared of what they might think - I know this sounds kinda dumb but I can’t stop feeling this way and feeling insecure that I’ve never been in a relationship. I don’t think meeting me you would pick this and when people ask me why I often don’t know what to say, it’s just never really happened for me and I don’t think I’ve ever really really liked someone. I find it really hard to be attracted to boys who I’m compatible with and like me and I’ve only really slept or sorta seen people that I’m attracted to but don’t really have any emotional attachment to. I hope this doesn’t sounds too confusing and I just would really love some advise from people who have been in a similar position to me. From a male perspective is that something that comes across as a red flag or am I being ridiculous?"

lonely,I can’t get over it,"I can’t get over it - I’ve been broken up with for over a year but I still hope to get together. This hope is kind of the only thing that stops me from completely breaking apart.
It doesn’t make any sense that we’ll get together. We aren’t in contact, they’ve dated multiple people ever since. I haven’t seen them ever since as they moved away. They didn’t text me on my birthday although I texted on theirs. They didn’t text on the holidays.

But we’re still on each other’s socials. But don’t interact other than viewing each other’s snap stories/ig stories.

There was a time when I was happy and thought to get over it. I was seeing someone else in that time. But then they broke it off. And I’ve gone back to miss the ex.

I really try to meet new people, but I haven’t met anyone I’m slightly interested in. Nobody left that spark in me again. I’ve seen hot people, people that are share common interests and those who are entirely different. But I just don’t feel anyone anymore. The person I’ve seen in the meantime was kind of cool but I wasn’t feeling them either so i was glad they broke it off.


And I wonder if this feeling will ever end?"

I tried to make friends at college but all the people i talked had atleast best childhood friends and friend groups from highschool. They openly told me that new people aren't really welcome in this groups naturally, because you know, they knew everything about eachother since they grew up together and why would they want to let in any strangers who they did not know anything about right ? Than i graduated from uni with only one friend who i am close with but since he has his close friends from highschool, he basicly spends all his time with them. We didn't hangout like 2 years now.

lonely,Everything you love will probably be lost...,"Everything you love will probably be lost... - At 40, Franz Kafka (1883-1924), who never married and had no children, walked through the park in Berlin when he met a girl who was crying because she had lost her favourite doll. She and Kafka searched for the doll unsuccessfully.
Kafka told her to meet him there the next day and they would come back to look for her.
The next day, when they had not yet found the doll, Kafka gave the girl a letter ""written"" by the doll saying ""please don't cry. I took a trip to see the world. I will write to you about my adventures.""
Thus began a story which continued until the end of Kafka's life.
During their meetings, Kafka read the letters of the doll carefully written with adventures and conversations that the girl found adorable.
Finally, Kafka brought back the doll (he bought one) that had returned to Berlin.
""It doesn't look like my doll at all,"" said the girl.
Kafka handed her another letter in which the doll wrote: ""my travels have changed me."" the little girl hugged the new doll and brought her happy home.
A year later Kafka died.
Many years later, the now-adult girl found a letter inside the doll. In the tiny letter signed by Kafka it was written:
""Everything you love will probably be lost, but in the end, love will return in another way."""

lonely,32[M4F] Nebraska/Anywhere A friend for the humdrum blues,"32[M4F] Nebraska/Anywhere A friend for the humdrum blues - Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for developing friendships these days. But I'm finished with the semester and officially on break from both work and school until the 26th!  ( Just one semester left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the new year! I'm also open to voice chat as well but there's certainly no expectation. 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. It would be great to find some good company. 


Hope to hear from you!"

Due to me being open wit everyone I could say everyone knows me. I’ve become the therapist “friend” and in reality every single person I’ve tried so hard and put in time for a friendship just vents to me when they need to, then just leaves until the next time they need to get something off their chest. For days and weeks and months I be without contact without anyone but people think I having all this “experiences” wit friends cuz everyone knows me. It’s been a full year of this. If I went MIA people wouldn’t notice. If I died they wouldn’t understand cuz “he had so many friends why would he lull himself”. Honestly it’s like life is teasing me wit loneliness wit how close I am to having friends yet how far I actually am."
lonely,"Healing Alone...thoughts, feelings, goals, dreams, everything internalized","Healing Alone...thoughts, feelings, goals, dreams, everything internalized - First time ever posting on here let alone posting my feelings that are so personal out to the universe. Super nervous but here goes nothing...I'm going to be 40 next month and by far the most alone I have felt in my life. A little over a year ago I fled a very toxic relationship and moved 400 miles away from the life I was building. It's been a very hard year. I've been mainly focused on self love and becoming the best version of myself. However, it's has been the loneliest journey. All of my so called friends from back home, maybe less then a handful will check in periodically. A lot of people I had to remove from my life because it was a toxic friendship or self serving on their part. My best friend of ten years suddenly stopped speaking to me without any explanation. My own family has yet to ask how I'm managing after such a traumatic experience with the ex. Went through the hardest year seemingly alone. I literally process all of my thoughts and feelings internally because I have no one to share them with. No one that cares at least. Family doesn't ask how I'm doing. I don't have a safe space to vent. If I do open my mouth I'm dismissed or told to move on. Even the simplest things that have no relation to the hell I went through, literally no one cares. I just feel like I care so much about my family and the few people I occasionally speak to back home but no one takes the time to truly give that same energy in return. I'm not ready to date and I certainly won't date because I'm lonely. It's difficult to have male friendships because everything becomes something I don't want it too so then I have to avoid that. I work at home which I love but I literally have one coworker with minimal interaction, weeks go by before we speak. I live in a town where I only know my mom. Legit nothing to do nearby, everything close to an hour away and then the pandemic on top of it. Most importantly I'm scared to invest time and energy into building another friendship for them to just vanish for no good reason. Not one single person active in my life has any idea how I am feeling. If I say how I feel I'm being dramatic. So why say how I feel to them. Internalizing everything to the point when I respond to others it's in my own head.  My dad doesn't participate in my day to day life and is very selfish. If I bring up anything relating to any emotions to my mom it's just dismissed. Especially if I'm not handling them how she sees fit. Majority of what I say goes in one ear or out the other or is judged. My brother only cares about himself and not once has he asked me how I am doing in a whole year. And the only friends I thought I had turned out just to be people I knew in passing or share the same hobbies with. Not anyone has even wondered where the hell I am and I would see them 2-3x a week. The few who check in to say hi, I can't really speak to them about how I really am doing.  It's just me and my furbabies. Whom I love with all of my soul. They are great listeners at least. They love me and support me through it all. I just wish I had someone I could talk to about the ins and outs of life. Sharing the simpler things and all the complexities of being an adult. Paint colors and world bullshit. Someone to actually ask how I am and really genuinely care about the answer.  I know I'm not alone in the fact that so many other people feel how I do in this given moment but in my imagination it feels like no one sees me or even knows I exist. To top it off the more I grow and heal, the more I love myself and set healthier boundaries, the farther away my family becomes emotionally. It's even harder to make friendships when healing. To make matters worse I just feel anxious and down and don't feel like trying to rebuild my hobbies here so then it is counterproductive to meeting people and not being lonely. Sigh. I protect my peace at all costs but does that really mean complete and utter loneliness all time? I know everything will be okay, I'm grateful for my life, it's just so hard sometimes. I know the healing journey is worth it but no one talks about how hard, painful, and lonely it can be."

lonely,23 with absolutely no friends,"23 with absolutely no friends - Hi everyone. I’m not sure if anyone will read this, but it’s worth a try right? This post is going to be pretty long. Thank you in advance if you read till the end. Basically, I have to friends, I have no best friend, no one who I can go to. Weirdly, my whole life I never was able to hold on to friends and make lasting friendships. I really tried middle school, high school, college, etc. I’ve had friends each stage of my life, but they all ended up becoming acquaintances or I’ve lost all contact with them.

That happened to my last friend in high school. My HS friend let’s call her L. I met L senior yr HS and we clicked so fast and got along pretty well. We called each other our ride or die. We also said we’d be friends till the day we die. That’s how close we were. Eventually, we went to different colleges. We still kept in touch and hit each other up when we both came back to our hometown for breaks. However, txting became more of me hitting L up first. Eventually, L ghosted on me and blocked me on social media?... which I don’t even know y. 

I graduated college back in May 2021 and I had probably 2 people I became close with when I lived around there. We’ve had deep convos and told each other we’d stay in touch. Long story short it’s months after, we found jobs and we messaged each other every now and then. But now, again, I won’t get messages unless I text first. They also live at least 1.5 hrs away from me. I asked them if we can meet up and usually it would go like “I’ll let u know when I’m free” and I never get a reply or a “I’m busy” but I see them going out on weekends. Now, I’m 23 my day consists of working M-F 40 hrs a week, goes to gym after work, eat dinner, get ready for the next day/bed, watch TikTok and sleep. That cycle repeats everyday. I have no one to talk to, no one to go to when I feel lonely. I’m actually an extrovert, subtle introvert. Most of my friends have been introverts though and it’s hard, but I make sure to make accommodations because they’re meaningful to me. Also, I live with my parents, which we all know is already hell itself, but hey I’m saving money, right? 

I joined Reddit to find a community and not feel alone. Embarrassingly, I’ve even tried that friend option on bumble, but no match around me. I miss going out so much. I stopped going on my social media because it’s hard watching people have fun even if it’s just chilling with their friends. I long for that and I’m jealous. 

Thank you for reading again. I could go on and on about this, but Ik it’s already too long. I don’t need any questions answered, but starting a conversation or telling me suggestions or others having similar issues would be nice. :)"

lonely,I recently dumped my close friend circle and feel more alone than ever,"I recently dumped my close friend circle and feel more alone than ever - I'm a bi male in my early 20s and I'm feeling alone as shit.

3 or 4 months ago I dumped my IRL friends because i felt extremely detached from the social group as a whole. I met most of them back in school and for the most part I really enjoyed hanging out with them. However some of my friends' friends didn't like me. 

I explicitly remember one time where they were all gathered in one dude's house who didn't get along with me, I asked if I could come over too, but they all said ""oh, it's too crowded and the flat was small"" I've seen the flat since I had helped them move new year's groceries in to the apartment and while it wasn't the biggest 5-6 people could easily fit a 7th in there. I just said ""that's cool, but do you guys wanna come outside real quick to smoke up before I head home?"" trying not to let it get to me, but they declined. So i just smoked alone and went on home. 

I tried not to think too much of it, but it really hurt me even recalling it gets me a little teary eyed.

Several months after that I still hung around with them, but always felt like I didn't fit anymore. When we were walking around the sidewalks or through parks or whatever I was always the one to be walking right behind everyone else. The group didn't like the music I like to listen to, so I never got to play any and had to just listen to what everyone else wanted.

I once invited them all to come over to my house and smoke up, chill and laugh at random shit or whatever but literally only 1 girl showed up. (We still had a great time though, nothing sexual or anything).

But what really made me break up with my friend group was playing PC games together: I had asked them to come play Terraria with me, but instead they thought it was boring so Don't Starve was suggested instead, I agreed if they would play Terraria with me after that sometime, and they agreed.
So we played that for a bit even though I didn't like it that much. Everytime Terraria was on sale i would literally beg them to come play even offering them to buy the 4 player bundle just so that we can play together. And got rejected every time...

All these little things culminated in me dumping all of them from my social circle. 

Some time after that i saw them on steam playing Terraria and they even messaged me there saying ""you were right this game is awesome, we should play it sometime"" I joined the discord when they invited me to play, but lo and behold they were playing League and didn't want to go play Terraria with me even though they knew I hated League. I left the discord and have been ignoring them ever since.


Right now I feel lonely as shit, I shave 2-3 times a month, havent had a haircut in several months, I get up at 14:00-15:00, stay up all night, eat 2 times a day on a good day, I shower once every 3 days and I haven't done any excercise in months. Im underweight, groom myself infrequently and don't even have the willpower to do much of anything all day.

Right now the only friends I have are from my guild in WoW and even that is putting it generously since we haven't met and only talk about the game and only when we are playing it.

I'm kinda introverted and don't even have the willpower to chat up my matches on Tinder/Badoo.

I guess no friends are better than bad friends, but fuck me If I don't feel sad as shit.


TL DR: I dumped my friend circle cause I felt like I didn't belong and constantly felt hurt from interacting with them. The only friends I have now are from my WoW guild and even that is putting it generously. I feel extremely alone and sad, I'm underweight, I don't eat properly, don't groom frequently, almost never excercise, stay up and get up late and I can't motivate myself to pick myself up and do anything about it.

I'm lonely, sad and had to vent for a while. Thanks for coming to my vent talk."

He was everything I wanted, he was everything I needed. He was everything to me. I don't need or want anyone or anything else. I was the happiest with him. Even the worst moments with him are better than the best moments with anyone else. It's been so long since we've been in contact and I still feel this way. I've accepted that I'm always going to miss him. He will always be in my heart. My only hope is that I can meet someone special soon and build a life with that person, something that I could never do with him. I'm getting impatient, I don't want to keep feeling this way. Any little mishap in my life can trigger this feeling of mourning the loss of him. I'm tired of grieving. I've tried everything I could to get over him. Focused on myself, tried new hobbies, made new friends, travelled to new places. I did all of the self reflecting and self help BS that everyone advises one to move on from a past relationship, yet here I am. These were all wasted attempts. I look back and realize what a waste my life has been. It doesn't matter what I do, my life is still empty, lonely, boring, and unfulfilling because I don't have this person in my life. I'm sorry if I sound codependent or like I am making an idol of this person but I can't help how I feel. Believe me, I've tried. I don't have a meaningful connection with anyone. He was the first and seemingly the last. I just wish I spent more time with him to have more memories and know more about his life. I couldn't even have that, the love affair was too short lived. It's hard for me to accept because I am a hopeless romantic, but it is clear I am unlucky in love and every other type of relationship there is. I will just have to continue this lonely lifestyle until the day I die. I am not afraid of death because it will be a release from this painful sorrowful existence. My only hope is that I ascend to heaven when I die. That's the only reason I'm holding on to this life, reluctantly so."

lonely,haha Idk why I’m posting,"haha Idk why I’m posting - I haven’t talked to anyone in what feels like forever. This is my first post on Reddit like this I feel like I hit a different level of loneliness. I got a new job and have nobody to talk to. I also just lost every picture I had ever taken of the most important moments of my life a few days ago and I mean every. My fault for not backing them up. Thanks Snapchat also lost all my friends contacts cause I’m too stupid to get phone numbers went from like 5 friends to 1 if that. I don’t know why I care. Not like I ever talked to them but it was nice knowing someone was there. My cat hasn’t sleep with me in a few nights too. 
I feel like I need to move across the country and start again with everything but I don’t wanna hurt anybodys feelings. Who am I kidding would they even notice. It would be months
I still don’t know why I posted. I just don’t have anywhere else to go. I’m sorry 
I feel like before I woudlve posted in suicide watch but I already lost 1 friend to a murder and my other good friend overdosed a little over a month ago. Idk. I don’t wanna leave anyone.Sometimes it doesn’t feel real. Not just that but any of this. I’m still recovering myself and having to deal with pissing every 5 minutes I can’t retain any fluids my kidneys and bladder are fucked and honestly I be sad most of the time I’m not with anyone anymore. Idk. Maybe there’s other people out there. I hope things get better. I don’t have any right to complain because I’m not dead but I haven’t watched any shows for myself in months or read anything. I come home from 10-12 hour days outside to look at my computer for an hour or 2 on some random screen or to load up a game and than close it. Spent thousands building it and I don’t use it barley. eh it looks cool. I’m grateful I had the funds to get it saved up for months. At least I’m not dead. I’ll probably delete this post if that ain’t against the rules I just didn’t know where else to go 
I hope everyone is okay and if you read thank you
I’ll probably end up deleting this"

lonely,I didn’t know a relationship could be so lonely,"I didn’t know a relationship could be so lonely - I feel so alone despite living with my boyfriend of 4yrs.He’s gone all day and when he is home all he wants to do is game and talk to his friends. We only really chat for a while before he turns over and tries going to bed or when he’s feeling “frisky” and then I’m back to being tossed to the side I’m fairly awkward and don’t have many friends of my own (most of them are my bf’s friends we only really talk if I happen to be around when they’re all together) along with no family so I tend to spend most of my time either sleeping or browsing the internet. Days pass and I’ve just been slipping into a hole that I can’t dig myself out of and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried talking to my boyfriend but nothing has really changed and I don’t want to come off as clingy or annoying I just want someone to talk to, sitting home all day doing nothing all alone with my thoughts it’s driving my crazy. I feel so alone to the point were it’s eating me up and the realization that I have no one has really been hitting me hard (especially since covid). I mean of course he’s here physically but emotionally it’s like I don’t even exist to him. I just want to be seen and for the loneliness to go away before it completely eats me up."
lonely,I’d just rather be alone,"I’d just rather be alone - So I am a university student with pretty good grades and some friends. The big catch is this: I constantly fall for people and the feelings are never reciprocated. The most recent rejection destroyed any self-confidence I had. The rough part has passed, but now I’m just in this solemn state of loneliness. Many of my close friends are dating now, so I feel more lonely when I’m around them than when I’m by myself. So, most of my nights consist of sitting in my dorm room with my thoughts. My friends no longer have the appeal they once did. I’d just rather be alone."

I now work from home so I don’t even have the work friends like before.  My friends no longer seem to be around.  Kids are almost out of the house and they have their own lives.  This type of loneliness is making me so unhappy.  I try to tell him but I’m told It’s my imagination.  Does your partner make you feel lonely?"

lonely,I just need to vent,"I just need to vent - I had a close group of friends that I talked with often. We would talk to each other about things going on in our lives. We called this our ""rant sessions"" or ""story time"". I was in a relationship with one of those friends so I always had someone to talk to everyday. We broke up about 10 months ago, but we remained friends. We would still talk every now and then, but my friend group began to feel distant. My friends would often ignore anything I had to say. There was another time where they made plans to go out in front of me without inviting me. They added some people they met online to our group chat; at this point my voice felt more drowned out than ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

At some point I stopped trying to talk to them. Eventually I ended up leaving the group chat we were in. Things seemed okay for me at the time. There was this friend that I met at the Target I used to work at. She became the person that I talked to the most. Things fizzled out with her, but that was okay for me. I just kept myself busy with school work. Things changed when I graduated this last Fall (2021). I realized I didn't have anyone to talk to. I had no work to keep me busy. I was struggling to apply to jobs in my field. To make matters worse, I stopped working at Target a few months ago to focus on school. I felt stuck at home.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured I would try online dating at this point. Probably the worst idea I've had. I'm an introvert by nature so I don't really have any pictures of myself in social settings. It doesn't help that my self esteem isn't the greatest. I took some pictures of myself and made my profile. A week went by. I didn't get a single match. I tried a different platform (Tinder this time as opposed to Bumble). Still nothing. After, a few days I finally got a like. I felt so validated at the time. I sent her a message, but she never replied. I figured she accidentally swiped right on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the days went by I kept checking daily to see whether I missed any notifications on my dating profiles, but nothing. It was pure silence. I used to think of myself as average looking, but this made me look down on myself even more. In a way, it was funny that I couldn't attract bots either let alone a real person. I figured this would make for a funny story. Of course, I would change the wording to not make it seem as self-deprecating as this post. So I reached out to my ex. The following was our conversation (M = Me, E= Ex):

M: ""Hey do you have time for vc later tonight? I want to rant about something"" 12:54 PM

E: ""A 'hello' would have been nice. Would have responded earlier but was on a date.

Kinda busy with work to have a rant session, ever."" 7:57 PM

M: ""No worries then"" 7:58 PM

&amp;#x200B;

This broke me. We both had to move on eventually, and I know that. That's not what made me sad.  We were good friends before we started dating. I wanted to talk to her as a friend, not a potential romantic interest. Perhaps I was in the wrong to reach out to her. Our friend group would be busy at times, but we would always make time to talk to each other or play some games. Hearing a friend, I was close to tell me that they don't have time for me was very heartbreaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

The rant I wanted to talk to her about was a version of this post. I know that this post is long so to anyone that took the time to read it, thank you. Even if no one reads this, getting this out in the open feels liberating. I'll be okay. I may stumble from time to time, but I know I will always pick myself back up again."

I’m not okay. All the people I see, the teenage kids that I’m supposed to be some sort of role model for, don’t know what I deal with on the inside.

I felt compelled to do it since she was friendly and cute. There was something about her that just seemed... I dunno, different I guess. What's the worst that could happen - she doesn't call? 




... Shit she probably won't anyway but at least now people can't say I never try 




I work at a gun shop and her grandmother came in to buy something with her. After talking back and forth for a while I figured it was worth a shot, pun intended. I gave her my business card with my phone number on the back and said ""if you ever need help learning how to shoot that gun, gimme a call sometime. I'm an instructor"" and she seemed like she was happy enough to hear that. I didn't get any real ""she's interested"" vibes but then again I'm kind of terrible at reading subtext anyway

These issues have delivered me to a bleak world of truly incapacitating loneliness and desolation.  My health dilemma by extension has prevented me from attaining a meaningful and lucrative career, I only work two days a week so as a 40 year old the depression adn my current perception of myself not achieving the existence that i seek generates a very feeble self esteem that only exacerbates my loneliness further. 6 months ago i met this incredible individual 31 (F) and we had an idyllic relationship that actually alleviated some of my loneliness. But because i was self-conscious about my situation because of perpetual intermittent seizures my life had been in stasis for years  , where i couldnt work or even function so i lied about my age and told her i was 36. Silly and trivial but i was so consumed with how i was perceived, she discovered my dishonesty and promptly broke up with me. She ceased all communications which was devastating as she was my regular confidant and source of conversations. All my other friends seem to be occupied with families or involved in a particular ecosystem (different cities, towns) away from me. I constantly ponder about her and ruminate about my deception which i am truly repentant. It just solidifies my disconnect from other people. I rarely find people to interact with that i find engaging, so it makes even more tragic. I just feel trapped in my pocket nightmare dimension unable to reach out and craft a rapport with others. Honestly i dont want to lament about my hardships or what not i just wanna discuss pop culture and bust jokes. But instead im just trapped with myself. if anyone reads this thank you for your time."

I decided to spend the night in… staying out of everyone’s way in this crazy pandemic. I’d love to catch up someone mature, intelligent, well educated, classy and fun to talk to. 
It seems like 90% of the ppl on here are from TX somehow, not that I mind but anyone from Cali for a change, or the east coast….? At this point, for where ever. 

Please don’t ask me to follow your inssstta, or joking your discccord group, cause I won’t. And; yeah, I don’t need any weekly alllllowances…. Super over these darn scams! 
Probably best if you are more on the mature, older side of the age range. I can careless if you’re married, single, divorced, with a 100 kids, I just want to a decent chat and possibly a friend, at some point. Who knows! 
Not that it matters, I’m 6’1 tall, black hair, greenish eyes, natural tan/olive skin, and been told handsome. Also, I still think GOT is one of the best shows ever made, regardless of the season finale lol 

At any rate, I hope you’re luck @ making friends is much better than mine cause so far it’s been crazy."

I’m soon to be 19 and have been noticing more than ever this looming presence of loneliness. I have a loving family and great friends to be thankful for but I still find myself at times being lonely. I’m on a gap year right now and leaving for college in August; most of my friends have already started. I’ve never had a long term relationship; and the two women I’ve been with have only been for a night, nothing more. Sometimes I wish I had someone that I could be intimate with and express my feelings. I lay awake at night thinking about all the things I don’t share with anyone because I don’t believe myself to have anyone like that. I guess I’m wondering what you guys did to stop feeling lonely. Or perhaps what helped you guys with it?"

lonely,[F23] I haven't had affection/intimacy for so long that I'm now terrified of it,"[F23] I haven't had affection/intimacy for so long that I'm now terrified of it - Trigger warning for mentions of abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost 2 years ago, I finally escaped an abusive relationship. He had me trapped for almost 3 years, and I sustained a lot of trauma. My view on relationships/intimacy has been warped since then. 

Before he came along, I was fine with others. I could get into relationships, have one night stands, friends with benefits, etc. I used to have fun, sleep around, enjoy myself (safely.) 

But his abuse has totally damaged all of that. 

I hate talking to people. I hate intimacy. I hate affection. I can count the amount of times I've had sex in the last 2 years on one hand. 

On the rare occasion, I do enjoy a kiss and a cuddle here and there, and I do enjoy sex when I receive it, but I've stopped searching for it. I can't do one night stands, I can't have friends with benefits. I turn down everybody who approaches me, even if they're attractive. I just don't like being around people.

Yet I still crave it. I'll have moments, like now, when I'm dying to be in the arms of another, but I can't bring myself to actually do it.

All of this damage because some guy decided to lock me away for a few years. And to think, he's out there with no issues. He's out there with a girlfriend, having fun, enjoying himself, acting as if he's not a piece of shit who abused somebody for years on end.

It sucks. I'm lonely, but I don't want to be around others."
lonely,I am missing my vent buddy,"I am missing my vent buddy - So about an year ago, I was in a fragile mental and emotional state because I felt lost and unguided for my med school entrance exam, somehow I got to know my distant relative who topped this exam just a year earlier. She was such supportive and would help me in whatever way she could, rarely that didt work for me. We spoke weekly about my studies but I think I benefitted emotionally more by venting out.

But after my exam is done and now when Im about to begin college, she is ghosting me. I am not not a fan of such professionalism. How can I just forget her. And I didnt even do anything, that is very unexplainable.

This made me realise how bad it must feel to be ghosted. So then I apologised to my other forgotten friend. And wrote another email to my cousin about how I feel. I told her that I wont call now and that I will write emails like these, to which she is free not to reply.

I dont have close friends now,because of my gap year:(
I just hope college begins soon and I can get over these thoughts. I wrote this just see if this kind of venting works for me. idk"

Im in my 30s and I don’t do hookup or dating apps or sleeping with strangers. It just seems more fascinating to me that people have that wide of a social circle to be able to hook up with multiple people and to bounce from relationship to relationship.

I have maybe two friends and never see them due to covid. And I don’t even know any males.

It just seems like I see so many posts about sex or birth control or hookups. I genuinely wonder who has the time or energy to do all of that. Idk maybe I’m just shy and isolated but I meet maybe one potential male partner every five years or so, and I haven’t had sex in three years.

I guess I just don’t know where people are finding each other."

The girl I used to love and now just sort of want to fuck (we slept together once when we were 18) told me about a dating app just for meeting someone to bang and we talked about it and I asked why she wouldn't just bang me if all she wants is sex, and she said she doesn't think we would fit together well. 

And now im sat at home alone on a Saturday like every Saturday, but now I'm just thinking she's out getting banged by some randomer off this app.

Anyone got a trick to help me feel less shit right now?"

I’m a really useless and difficult person, not like it’s necessary or that anyone cares but I’m 16 and both of my parents and my older brother work.
My mom just recently started working a few months ago, and I encouraged her to take the job so we’d have more money 

But now I’m exhausted and stressed out because I have to school myself and my younger sister and take care of a 5 person household (plus many, many animals)

It’s not like I do everything myself, my dad normally cooks and helps with house work on his days off, and so does my mom

I wish I could have at least a break one day but then I feel guilty because if I take a day off whenever they(parents) are home it takes away from their day off

I’m not sure if my brothers done any work since he started working a few years ago, and my mom is normally tired when she gets home and does nothing except her own personal work(she had and has a part time, stay-at-home job) while my dad cooks and does stuff once he gets home

Me and my mom seem to have ahead a rough relationship, I hate it but I’ve always held a little bit of hurt towards her, I could talk about our history and ways she’s hurt me but that would just sound dumb and pointless

I feel like no one in my family “cares” about my mental health, my brother has adhd and that’s all that’s ever mentioned with the topic of mental health, if I ever brought up the fact I probably have depression and possibly an Ed, despite the fact thereare multiple signs of it I think it would be laughed at and dismissed

I don’t know anymore, I could probably talk about my issues and stuff for hours but it’s too difficult to gather my thoughts to type it out and typing it out makes me realizes how trivial and dumb these things are :/"

Im 24 but feel like I socialize worse then when I was a teenager. At least when I was younger it’s was easier because all teens are kinda lame and stupid so it was easier to talk. But as I get older I see how much more smart and wise and far ahead in life everyone is around me and it makes me embarrassed to talk.

lonely,The fall of the iron wall,"The fall of the iron wall - 24M, healthy guy, introvert.

I have been trying to hit on girls since a long time, they don't like me, in simple words. I somehow turn into a cringe warlord, my anxiety and my memory like, turns against me thats why. 

The last girl i tried to hit on was a major failed attempt. The day she entered the classroom in my uni, i fell in love, a girl with beautiful eyes, like an ocean you can fall into and never come back. Always smiling, spreading good vibes, good hair, good accessories, just perfectttt. Somehow i replied to one of her comments in the class's snapchat group, the next day she sat behind me (she was late, that was the only empty seat). Somehow i managed to start a conversation and boom! I turned into a cringe warlord and blew my chance, she talked to me for the next day too but soon it turned out she knew this guy is an asshole. She didn't talk to me after that and found a better group with much better people than me. Soon she got a boyfriend and i was heartbroken.

After this incident, i decided that my self esteem is becoming a sacrifice in this procedure. I decided to make my mindset stronger, like creating an iron wall to stop this process on hitting on girls. I grew stronger with this mindset cuz i didn't give a fuck now, like about girls. Its been four years since this, and this mindset has ran flawless but now i am unable to maintain this mindset. I am becoming so desperate to even talk to a girl, like just chat etc. This is the fall of iron wall. I don't know if the society failed me or i failed society.

lonely,I dont want to feel lonely anymore,I dont want to feel lonely anymore - Recently I have been struggling mentally. I don't come from a happy family and I think that's where most of my issues stem from. I cant afford therapy either so it's like I'm stuck to fix my own mess but I just don't know what to do. Two of my closest friends have left me recently mostly because I was insecure. I felt left out when they would meet up without me which is fine but they would hide it from me. I feel sad when they do that so I stopped talking to them for a while. I couldn't physically bring myself to talk to them. But now after the silence from me they havent reached out to me either so just like that the friendship is over. Just like that. I don't make friends easily so this really stung. I've been friends with them for over 13 years. I want to go back but I'm afraid they will do the same thing again which will upset me again and the cycle will repeat. I don't want to be so insecure. I wish I could live without depending on anyone but I can't. I miss them and I don't want to be lonely anymore.
lonely,On a break from my relationship and slowly realizing I have no real friends.,"On a break from my relationship and slowly realizing I have no real friends. - I’ve been invited out a couple of times, but both people cancelled the day of. I haven’t heard anything back even though I’m trying to reach out to reschedule. I have people I can message, but no one to see in person. I’m in my late 20’s. I’m childfree and I’m pretty much alone every moment I’m not working. Most of my friends are married, have kids, or work multiple jobs, so I know it’s unfair to be tough on them… but I wish I had someone consistent in my life. I’ve been working on my hobbies, binge watching shows and pretending I’m friends with the characters, and I’ve been obsessing over videogames. 

I know my break from my ex is for the best (for now). I hope we can reconcile after a break… but I’m taking it day by day. No sense going back to a relationship with the same problems. 

I hate our modern society. Everyone is kept so busy every moment of the day. I don’t doubt that people care about me, but this isolation from society is driving me mad. Any suggestions on how to cope?"

But being put under such a light gave me so much pressure, I had alot of “friends” but no one I felt a connection to.

lonely,Too Weird To Live. Too Rare To Die.,"Too Weird To Live. Too Rare To Die. - I've spent a few lifetimes trying not to be weird. I did a good job. I worked so hard at it that I am normal, but deep down I will never fit in or have that special feeling of being akin to anyone else. I do not lack esteem. The thoughts, ideas, and feelings I have I share freely with anyone I might think be interested. I admire and respect all others and their ideas to the point that I do not compete with the world anymore. I play it safe very well. I do not have any friends so there is no one I may hurt unintentionally and there is no one who can use me or betray me to hurt me either. Anytime I try to reach out I realize I am more and more alien from a normal world. All that has happened to me in my life, all my past actions, all that I have witnessed, all I have endured... is who I am.  It didn't happen to anyone else and I should not expect anyone to understand, nor should expect that I should understand anyone else by that same logic. I have completely reconciled all those things in my life. I know exactly how they make me who I am. I put myself in a situation where I can help people, strangers, but not to make friends nor a situation where I am not responsible for too much for another in helping. I have even curated very specific experiences for others, just do not ask me how I do...it never ends normal. I tried letting my freak side show hoping to find someone who understands and that always ends in absolute disaster. I know that who I am and what I have learned in my life has huge import, has care, and answers many questions. I have a good memory for all of it and tend to forget anything that is not important or relevant to make room for all of it. I have met no one like me and I should be proud. Whenever I think I have met someone like me, or at least someone who understands...I find out the difference is still too great. I feel very lucky to have a good thought for every bad one and everything is always neutral, so I get to live on. I only feel sad that one day I will not exist and the thoughts, feelings and ideas I have that I have proven to myself no one has...will no longer exist either. I have a friend... its me. And thats ok."

Was very transparent that I am not looking for dating, swapping dick pics, or anything inappropriate, as I am in a LT relationship with someone but just feel like I’m lacking in the best friend department. I hit it off with another really awesome guy (I’m a gay guy so that makes it hard to find connections for wholesome genuine friendship on here in the first place) and pretty much were instant besties as we shared so much in common and got along great…like better then great. Then I go to message him tonight and realized I was suddenly blocked. Nothing had happened between then and the last convo we had where I wished him good night last night… we had gone to bed with things in a seemingly really fantastic place and I was super excited about the prospect of forming this new friendship with the type of guy I got along with sooooooo great and shared so many interests with. I don’t have many friends, none of them close these days, as I lost most of my friends after going through a really hard time in my life recently. Unfortunately, getting ghosted from the one friendship that meant something to me in a long time spiraled my depression out of control and has put me in a really bad head space and idk what to do. If I try to find a friend on here all over again there’s the possibility I’ll get ghosted again and I just don’t think I can go through this again. If I don’t try again, I’m guaranteed to be lonely forever.

Is there a better site than Reddit with a lower Ghosting rate (i.e. a site with less trashy people who have more class) to look for strictly a long term friendship? A gay guy looking for another gay guy for friendship limits the choices even more.

Hell… as long as I’m already on here venting about ghosting, if there’s any gay dudes age 18+ out there looking to develop a close platonic friendship with another gay dude (34m) then please DM or chat with me! I’m very kind (apparently too kind), open-minded, non-judgmental (only judge mental if you ghost me!), with a slightly off-color sense of humor. I have a big heart and empathy for others which unfortunately gets used against me often, especially on Reddit now so it seems. I’m highly educated with a Masters Degree and I enjoy the arts—theater, music, movies, and reading—of many various genres. I love being out in nature and love animals, especially have a soft spot for dogs. Location doesn’t matter, either online anywhere for chat or near me in the Midwes if you perhaps don’t live far and would be interested in eventually meeting. Looking for platonic long-term friendship with other gay men only. Looking for someone to share my interests and talk about my life with, but NOT to share dick pics LOL. 

Thanks for reading.
Moral of the story: Ghosting sucks and shows no class.

lonely,I've given up on myself and I don't know what to do...,"I've given up on myself and I don't know what to do... - I'm in my early twenties, and haven't had friends in over eight years. The only friend that I have is my mom, and we do almost everything together to the point that I get super anxious when she's not around. I've been in therapy for years, but despite this I've never been able to hold a friendship. I tried making friends online, but I stop talking to them for months and then they've moved on. I tried getting into relationships, but then i get bored texting them and end up unmatching them. It doesn't help that I'm obese and can hardly take care of myself. My doctor suggested weight loss surgery, and I've been looking into it but I don't know how much I'd change afterwards. I don't have a job because I've been put on disability due to my uncontrolled bipolar disorder (though I was going to the wrong psychiatrist and he had taken me off of all my necessary medications), and obesity. 

Every time I try to make friends I think ""Who would want to hang out with someone who looks like me?"" or ""Who would want to be friends with a fat person? Who would want to date someone my size?"" My therapist has been helping me work on my confidence issues, but I still fall into that same trap. I've tried every single diet in the world (keto, 1200 calories, calorie restriction, vegan, etc), and those didn't work and now I can barely walk without it feeling like my back is going to snap in half. 

The only things I do every day is eat, play the Sims, or scroll through social media or watch youtube videos. I live in a small town with nothing to do besides eat fast food, go grocery shopping, or go to Walmart. I was in college but after gaining weight I couldn't walk across campus and my anxiety was at an all time high. 

I've just given up on myself, and I don't know what to do. I want to be happier, healthier, and have friends who I can spend time with and talk to, but I think I've ruined my life. Do you guys have any advice?"

Video games where my only escape from those times, playing so much that I sometimes forgot that I had high school classes to assist, and it was so much that I simply didn’t helped my old man when he needed the most. I’m always trying to look things the positive way but many of the bad memories I have are tattooed deep inside my brain, tattoos that have no shape or color.
From a toxic relationship that led me to almost kill myself, to be separated from all my friends by constantly moving out from city to city or by my own ex telling lies and stories of our relationship that benefited her side only. Or even to not being able to get a single date for a lot of time because “I have extra weight” or something of my physical appearance that makes me feel like I’m never going to be able to love someone the way I want to love nor to feel the love that I so much wish to experience.
Living by my own hasn’t helped either since I often wander on my memories overthinking of what I did wrong even if I try to get my attention on other things. 
I know I have a life in front of me, and I know I have to keep my head up but I can’t help to find myself feeling a hopeless, hollow heart and keep staring to the ceiling like if I were watching the stars as I ask “why can’t I cry no more?”."

I don't know if it's just society today or if it's my depression. Everyone is playing these little games to make it through life and I don't know the rules anymore. I'm 31 year old male and I'll probably die alone. I don't have anyone but my dad and my dog. All of my family has moved on selfishly and focused on themselves just as I have. I realized pretty quickly that everyone around me was fake so I pushed everyone out. One day I woke up and realized that all of it is a game. Society, people, corporate standards, employment logistics, all of it. It's this big sappy game that we have to play and I just feel tired at 31 years old."

I sometimes think that maybe I’m just not attractive enough for a woman to want to be with me, and this is very very upsetting to me."

lonely,Kinda tired,"Kinda tired - Hi, this is my first post after quite a while of just reading posts and comments. 

Like the title says, I'm just kind of tired. 
Tired of always feeling like a third wheel. 
Tired of always feeling like a backup friend. 
Tired of always just listening to others talk, and not really being part of the conversation. 
And I'm tired of never having anyone 

Now, I'm not hopeless or bitter. I'm constantly trying to better myself. See myself how others might see me and understand where my flaws are. 
Not for the sake of others to change myself, but just to be a better person overall. 
And I do still believe there is someone out there for me. And friends who will feel as close to me as I feel to them. 
But it's been 20 years, 21 by April, and I don't see a change happening any time soon. 

But idk. It just feels like today's society isn't meant for people like me. I'm not outgoing. I'm not into hookup culture. I'm not into drinking or smoking or any of those things people do when hanging out. 
I was raised in a Christian family, and I guess I'm just more traditional. Not just because of my religious beliefs, but just because it suits my introverted nature. 
I want to meet someone and get to know them. Talk to them, and make a connection. Become friends while falling in love. Making sure to always talk things out and put each other first. 

And I want to make friends that I can listen to, and who'll listen to me too. Friends who can just enjoy our own company. Friends who don't need to go drink or smoke to hang out. Friends who can be friends for the sake of being friends, who care about each other and genuinely just enjoy being around each other without strings attached. Just friendship. 

But it's so hard to find people right now who want the same thing romanticslly, or who grt along like that naturally. Or at least it's hard to find people who are like minded.
Especially when I already find it hard to meet new people. 

But oh well. 
I don't know what the future has in store for me. 
I don't know if I'll ever find what I'm looking for. 
But at least I can hope. 
Until then, I'm fine with just listening and watching from a distance. Observing, until life let's me join in too"

His name is Mark Davis and he works as a prison warden at a large jail -  Hes in his forties and he was born in December. He has brown eyes circular yellow tinted glasses, purple suit with a yellow blouise under the suit. His pants are the same color as his blazer. He wears a pink bowtie and also a purple top hat with a pink ribbon. Under his hat is short spiky black hair. He has a small button nose.. rounded face, pale skin and a noticable gap between his two front teeth. He may have some disorder that causes bendy joints. If anyone has had any sightings of him please tell me when and where you had the sighting. Also if anyone knows his number or where about he lives or perhaps his social media stuff I'd appreciate it very much. His surname is sometimes spelled Davies. I tried looking on various sites but I can't seem to find anything, just stuff about the show that he was in but no photographs of him or any contact details. I've been a fan of him for years and watching his show would always cheer me up and he seems like an awesome person to be around I'd love to just be his friend but it's making me sad I can't find anything on him after all these years."
lonely,Need to put this into words,"Need to put this into words - I’ve felt alone pretty much my entire adult life. People have always kinda been drawn to me and I’ve always had friends and relationships but I would never allow myself to be truly intimate with the person I was seeing or lovers and I would watch them break themselves against me seeming that in me and when they failed and they started blaming themselves they would leave so people is leaving is something I got used to and it further boldened my inability to make myself available to people that had gone through great lengths just to make themselves available to me and I’ve always been toxic in that sense, I’ll always be toxic in that sense. Even now laying next to my lover I feel completely alone because now my reputation proceeds me. She has no interest in emotionally intimacy because it’s rumored it always ends poorly with me. Im never alone but Im always completely fucking alone the one thing I never wanted to be but had been building towards my entire life because alone was safe. Alone doesn’t offer the retreat I had always convinced myself it would, Alone isn’t safe for me, it doesn’t offer calm alone an internal frenzy."

It has been a persistent feeling since I got home. I had a good day at work, but I think these (relatively consistent) suicide thoughts stem from loneliness and disappointment. The pandemic fucked me up for sure, and permanently. I'm sad that I lost friends (they became crabby and rude) and now I don't know how to put myself out there to make new friends. I also don't feel like getting disappointed by people all over again. I don't have the courage to search for a relationship either because during covid I got a std and my self-worth has gone down the drain and my (already high) anxiety has skyrocketed. Other traumatic shit has happened to me since 2020 and I constantly feel like my life is a dark blur. It's really hard to feel this way for 2 straight years. And technically I've had depression/anxiety for a lot longer than that. Today I just couldn't help but feel so sorry for myself. Guess I just needed to let that out."

Im a rape survivor. Im sex repulsed and highly mistrusting of others, which has made me build very high walls. Going out with people and making friends or trying to invest feelings in people fills me with dread. I don’t go on dates because they’ll want to have sex and I refuse to. 

I’ve been hurt a lot along the way by friends and partners, so I’ve kind of settled with solitude. But I feel this internal and external pressure to date and have a big circle of friends since that seems to be what’s socially acceptable.

And then I start thinking I should have kids or something so I don’t regret it, but I don’t want to date either or try to be something I’m not.

-  Do not DM me please or try to get in a relationship with me, this post is meant to vent about my own frustrations and see if anyone else has or had the same problem. Thank you!-




Yes I said it, I want the attention of men on a daily basis or else I don’t feel worthy enough.  The reason why I want this validation so much is because I’m seeing a lot of other girls getting it without trying while I actually have to try multiple times to get one guy that I like to respond.  It’s really annoying, and this really started kicking in after I started dating someone.  What worse is that I’m trying to restrain myself from saying anything to my date because of family issues and I don’t want to be an asshole.  I am also considering suicide again because of this and the lack of attention makes me feel insecure about myself about what went wrong.  What’s even worse is that I’m seeing my friends in happy relationships while I am struggling to make one.  This thing overall just increased my depression, anxiety, and insecurity. Thank you for listening!"

I'm a 25 year lazy sack of fucking shit. Jack of all trades, master of none. 

Haven't had a girlfriend in over 6 years. Had 1 or 2 actual friends in high-school &amp; university, but with covid and living overseas obviously they have fizzled out.

No friends where I currently live. No motivation. Tried online dating. Tried going to meetups to make friends. No luck. I'm just tired. I have an internet addiction I've identified for years and I can't shake it. Anxious, depressed. Poor health. I want to have friends, an intimate partner. That's like, one of the few things keeping me going.

But I don't have them. I'm only getting older, and likely more depressed. I'm a sad, cynical, lazy individual. Pathetic, really. Too tired these days.

I feel like i'm in solitary confinement. I feel locked away from my best friends. I feel like im being more alone than ever. I have a lonely lonely heart and im being mentally in pain and a punish myself. Everyday i feel horrible. Im in a house where i dont feel like family anymore. I DONT TRUST MY PARENTS ANYMORE they always ummage through my stuff they dont believe me anymore.** 

**please im in desperate need of help i need someone who i can talk to.**

I have 0% love for my parents. I dont love them theyre a bunch of dictators, a bunch of ruthless authority figures with zero heart and im not a close to them as i was before. I dont remeber the last time i hugged them. Their actions are completley unforgiveable and i dont give a smidgen of love or regard them as parents. They made my mental health go to nothing. Im so miserable everyday. 

In December of 2021 like early 20s I was angry at my dad cause i was failing chemistry i asked for a tutor; couldnt afford a tutor. The next day that morning, i was still angry cause instead of studying chemistry i was told to go clean my room and i called my sisters bitches and he got angry at me and my mom was shocked. 

Then he demanded my phone he wanted my phone to take it away from me and he said i was never gonna get it back. I refused and he kept fist hitting me grabbing me by my wrists, demanding it like a madman and i still refused and he kept beating me and my wrists started hurting me. I hid my phone somewhere secret and he stopped and the bastard had to go to work. 

So that evening i slept with my phone and he took it from me. I was angry.

So on december 23, he told me to clean my room for christmas eve and i started swearing at him calling him insults calling him slurs and he got angry at me under this facade of happiness. Then when he said i was never gonna get my phone back which means i was never gonna talk to my best friend let call her Melana. Melana i wont talk to her ever again and she was my best friend since 6 grade. \]

the last time he took my phone from me was 5 months in the beginnign of the decade i was locked away i couldnt talk to Melana for 5 months April-end of august. 

I got very angry i grabbed the candlesticks throw them down the stairwell, i went to the kitchen and broke glass like about 5 glasses cups. And i got the worst beating out of 2021 which ruined my christmas eve, my christmas new years, rest of winter break.

The physical punishment was brutal on a scale 1-10 a 6 and a half. He sneaked me from the back when i was walking out of the kitchen he made a fist and started hammering me, he started to twists my arms making them swore he started betaing me hitting my arms legs and back. The worst part was he hit me on my ear in a fist multiple of times so many times i started to hear ringing my ears started to ring i couldnt hear in my left hear for a while like up to 30 seconds. He pulled down my pants and started to spank me with his hand 15 times  on my bare ass and my thighs. I was in a pool of tears i pool of misery, shock, i felt like nobody loves my anymore. I couldnt breathe i was in shock i ran to my room and started crying and balling. 

I missed out christmas eve, christmas, new years i couldnt say merry christmas or happy new years to my irl friends and it bothers me. No family members i couldnt say merry christmas. 

I am suffering mentally in depression or close to. I feel violated them going through my personal belongings in my room and device. My parents do a room search they dont trust me i dont trust them. Thats how i feel right now."

lonely,I don't think I'll ever know how it feels to be in a true relationship,"I don't think I'll ever know how it feels to be in a true relationship - I've been with about 3 different women in my life. I know that may not seem like a lot but there has been a large gap between each of them. Believe it or not, each of these 3 women just used me for sex, or at least that's how I see it. At most, they were only ever situationships. Maybe some guys think that's the life and envy me, just having casual sex with no strings attached but I don't think it's for me. 

The absolute worst part about it, each and every time, is that usually right after we're done they quickly move onto to someone else like I never meant anything to them. And I likely didn't. All 3 of them quickly got into committed relationships with other people and 2 of them are engaged/married to that same guy. 

I can't help but wonder what it is about me that women find so repulsive that they can't imagine being serious with me. I've fucked up in the past, but I learned from my mistakes. I thought I was doing so well this last time. I showed obvious interest in her, didn't just talk about sex, gave her space, and didn't lovebomb her. Yet, just like every time before, it ended the exact same way: Her moving on and being madly in love with someone, while I'm stuck in the past, tired and alone from another heartbreak."

I’ve tried some of those online friend meeting apps but half of the time it’s just people wanting to hook up, and I really just want some long lasting friendships that won’t turn s3xual or weird like that…


I find it just so hard to find anyone near my age to be genuine friends, and I don’t know where to look.

lonely,“You’ll meet someone when you least expect it” is a lie.,"“You’ll meet someone when you least expect it” is a lie. - I (48F) am currently sitting in my car and realized that after 20 years of trying to live my best life, that I have not been able to meet anyone new. My last relationship was 20 years ago, and when I’ve shared my frustration, I was told to stop stressing about it and “you’ll meet someone when you’re not looking!”

Bullsh*t.

There have been so many times where I wasn’t “looking”, where someone could of came along. Naturally I don’t feel entitled to having someone but come on! Not a nice conversation? No digit exchange? Just something to let me know I’m not a pathetic troll of a person. I’ve seen people on “My 600 Pound Life” in relationships. I’ve seen people with physical/mental afflictions with dates-and I’m not saying they don’t deserve happiness, but it’s like, “Where’s mine?” I would like to have one meaningful relationship before I die-and maybe get my back blown out properly with someone I actually like and who likes me back. 

I’m starting to think that it’s too much to ask."

He admitted he lied about who he dated after me and didn't tell me who it was so he could continue to see her behind my back without my knowing it is his ex. I wouldn't really care but he made a point to alienate me from male friends if he thought they liked me. I'm so confused.. we we're trying to go forward and be honest and now he wants to spend time with his ex behind my back and lie about it while spewing about trust and loyalty. Am I being stupid rn. Is there any reason he needs to spend time with his ex without me and go to such extremes to lie about it? Like what do ya'll think they'll be getting up to. And do I really want a relationship with a man who has a second woman in his life that he goes to the effort to deceive me over

After they left I did all sort of things to be someone to them, to be something to them, to seem interesting. Like going to the gym, learning musical instruments, Art, doing something related to their hobbies. No , they didn't tell me to do those things, we had really fun when the last time we saw each other, I just want to be someone or something in their eyes. They didn't say or show signs that they hate me or that they didn't like me, I just felt like Im not enough for them. Now Im just afraid that maybe they have forgotten about me. That Im doing all those things for them and turns out that thet forgot about me or just don't care about me. They rarely reply to messages, but they like my Instagram and Facebook posts. I understand that they have their own lives and other things to do, it just makes me really sad. I also don't want to annoy them, I don't want them to think im annoying.

What if they did really forget about me. I don't know what to do. I don't want them to forget about me, but I feel like Im not enough for them. I feel like "" Who am I to be part of their lives? Am I enough to be their friend, cousin, or anything?"" I don't know what to do."

I do still live with my mom. We have a healthy relationship but she works until Evening. So our time together is very limited. I am looking for a Job and already have a few promising offers. The problem is they're all starting at the end of Summer 2022. so basically I will be alone without much to do, for another 2/3 of a year. Im already feeling like im at my limit. I had serious Depressions over 5 Years. Now im kind of scared. I dont feel depressed, just lonely all the time. I think its because I have nothing to do, and just think all the time. I wanna have a GF but just can't even get in a situation where I can meet other people.

I really have no idea what im supposed to do about this feeling. Its in the back of my head all the time. 

I started to cook more complex things. I started to play with my cats a lot more. I started to clean the whole house. Still I feel miserable all the time. 

If anyone has any recomendations. I would be glad to hear them.

lonely,Sometimes the empty loneliness doesn’t go away,"Sometimes the empty loneliness doesn’t go away - It’s been so long and I was sure I’d have recovered by now. I was sure after so long I’d forget that the only person with whom I’ve ever been in love, the only person to whom I felt a sense of belonging, my home and comfort. But it never got easier. Maybe it’s because of my lack of enthusiasm about life, but after that ended all my other relationships suffered. One by one I isolated myself from other friends, other people who I previously considered my casual friends, those who I didn’t appreciate and never truly respected because I’d felt they didn’t deserve my time and attention as much as my one and only person did. But where did that take me? To be honest, I’m grateful for everything that happened, every sweet moment of lovely embrace will forever remain locked in my memory. But I’ve lost it now, without any warnings I’ve lost it. I never anticipated this day. When I’d say, my addiction, my carelessness and my passivity have cost me my only real meaning in this life. And it doesn’t matter what I do, I can’t accept it. I have tried to better myself, but it my every attempt proves futile, as I no longer have a reason to improve, to do anything, really. I gained everything I’d ever wanted, I saw the gates of paradise, but I was in the end despite my every attempt not good enough for it. And maybe, someday, I can remember our talks, our hugs, her comforting and warm words, the secure feeling of belonging and being unconditionally loved, without tearing up every time my mind pictures her figure again, every times slightly more distorted until someday her memory becomes so old that the only true source of meaning that’s ever presented itself to me in my life - Her - will turn into nothing more than blurred associations to a warmth that will I will for the rest of eternity seek again, and never received, for only that sacred source was capable of providing the light of purpose for me, and her lighthouse has abandon my begging and turned dark forever. May  peace and tranquility come in future at last to ease my torment."

I can't help be afraid of getting sick right now. I just feel scared and I trap myself out of my room. I just want to be inside all the time but I always have the urge to just want to talk to someone. To skip the small talk and be close to someone. I now its normal to want to be normal but I can't help feel like I am creepy for wanting that all the time. I talk to a person online the one time and I am left wanting to talk more even if I am a stranger to them. I don't know I just want to feel close to someone. But in a way even when I was in school I feel my personality is just so shit and I just am not good enough to form and maintain meaningful relationships. It feels hard to accept it as I just never properly developed the social skills and now its even harder to form them. I feel I will never stop feeing lonely and it will just more me more depressed and miserable until I can't take it anymore.

I mean yes, I'm pretty below average and tbh an odd combination of assets but hey if you think about it for a bit what were the chances I'd be this odd? Really it's so random, and sure people don't generally like me because of these elements, and I'll probably never get in a relationship romantic or otherwise but at the same time it makes me and you unique. 

We're still surviving, it's just we don't have company. Again it's kinda cool if you accept you're the loser.

For various reasons I'd not been able to join in on the previous 3, but today I left the cake in the meeting room where they were setting up. The time comes, they enter said room and grab the glasses and such, leave my cake there, and go to an upstairs meeting room instead. Not a word to me, just chatting amongst themselves. My supervisor who hadn't gone up yet asked me if they'd ordered me lunch, I explained they hadn't but I brought a cake to share. She seemed disappointed that no one asked me for a lunch order and went upstairs to the room. She then didn't appear again until lunch was over, and sent me to have mine alone when she came back.

Had a cry in the bathroom before I did. I thought things were ok this week but clearly they're pissed off I'm leaving and now just want me gone. I was looking forward to one final chat with everyone too. Guess I'm just waiting out the clock now..."

Thought it would be a brand new start and it is but I am crying everyday because I’m so lonely. I want to meet people and new friends and have a friend group so badly I just don’t know how.  I knew it was going to be hard not knowing anyone here but damn I didn’t know it would be this difficult. 
 
I’m a very extroverted person and if I’m alone for too long get super depressed. That’s why when I looked for housing I looked for people I thought I’d get along with well because I knew I’d anchor on them for social interaction and to branch while I’m adjusting to all of this. We live in this student housing apartment off of campus. One goes to my college and the other 2 do not and I don’t see them as often cause they work a lot. My 4 other roommates are incredibly sweet but I am afraid I might be annoying them with my need to always be with someone. I’m always chilling in the common room like either on my phone or on my laptop just to talk to someone and they always talk to me if they are out of their rooms but they mostly stay in their rooms if they aren’t out. I just feel so pathetic.

I just want to go out once in awhile and have fun on the weekends but feel like it’s really difficult for me cause I don’t have anyone or a means of transportation. One of my roommates like to go out a lot and I kind of want to ask her if I could come with sometime so I can meet new people. Im just scared that it would sound weird or I’ll come off as needy. I just really want to meet people and have fun.

I have really really bad anxiety that I am medicated for but it is still a daily struggle. I feel like my social anxiety is covering up my real bubbly charming and making me awkward because I don’t know any of these people and I’m just so scared and it shows. I just wish people could see and like the real me. I have just had a hard time connecting people. 

There is a bus that takes me to and from school but it only runs on constrictive hours so I admittedly haven’t been to campus much (hybrid classes). I want to go more because I’ve just been chilling at my apartment most of the time. Which is fine it’s a lovely place I just want to have friends and be with people and have fun like everyone else seems to be. I really want to try and join clubs but I’m having trouble finding them because they never had any sort of activities fair at the beginning of the semester and orientation was moved online. I’m even thinking about rushing a sorority maybe but I’m not sure if I’d have the finances to or if they would even accept me in.

I’m also incredibly homesick. I miss my friends, family, and boyfriend ALOT. I feel horrible for being upset because this is what I’ve wanted for forever and They have all made sacrifices to help me get here. I feel like if I let them know how down I’m feeling they would be really let down and upset. I’m trying to fake a smile when I call them but it’s getting harder. I feel awful for being in such a nice place and just being depressed as fuck all because I feel lonely.  I just don’t know what to do…
 
Thanks for listening if you got this far. I apologize for the huge rant, I just needed to let this all off my chest. My ADHD brain is also all over the place. I am trying to put myself out there more and I want to try and bring my car if I can though so I can hopefully go to campus more. Any advice would be highly appreciated."

lonely,Any other guy here gets asked out by women but still get ghosted?,"Any other guy here gets asked out by women but still get ghosted? - It has happened to me couple of times where a woman would strike up a conversation and ask for my number. Most of the time, nothing comes out of it. And even if they do ask me out, they usually ghost me after a few dates. 

I have stopped approaching women because women constantly complain about getting hit on in public, and I do not want to add to the statistic of men being a nuisance to women. But even when they are the ones who ask me out first, I still get ghosted."

lonely,"Confused, alone and overwhelmed","Confused, alone and overwhelmed - Hi guys. I just need general advice.

I'm a bit of a noob to reddit, I'm not sure where to put but I just need you guys to help.

I'm a male, 19, never kissed a girl, never had sex, never had a girlfriend. People say I'm reasonably attractive, but I know that's not true, it's just for my confidence. I'm 5'6, getting teased by women at work is not exactly confidence-boosting, actually sucks anything left out of my confidence. 

I workout a lot (as does every other 5'6 male on Earth), but it doesn't interrupt my daily routine or anything. I just wanna list a couple of my conflicts my brain goes through on a constant basis. 

Wanna start by saying I fucking hate my own personality. I will be screaming at myself in my head 'DONT BE FUCKING NERVOUS SAY SOMETHING' in almost all scenarios. But then obviously, it comes out that way because its just not natural. In pub situations I am confident but in serious situations or where I am intimidated in some way (hot girl, smart people etc.) I overthink what I'm saying. But what happens? Stoic/serious? People tease me for being moody or miserable, and take the piss saying I look 'cute' and actually laugh at me when they think I visibly look unhappy. Joking having a laugh? What are you laughing at you dope? I try to stay as healthy as I can diet-wise, get perfect sleep every night, yet I can be standing there and my brain and my mind will be in such a way where I can't bring or force myself to speak normally despite me screaming at my own mind to do so. Just feel out of it. Its horrible. People obviously tease me for that but its my own brain it just won't let me function. 

Insecurities. I'm massively insecure, about a few things. I'm short, and it never stops getting mentioned to me, first thing people usually ask me is 'how short are you?!'. Any time I'm outside walking, inside talking, I'm always hyper-aware of how short I am next to whoevers next to me. This makes nightlife terrible as well. I can't enjoy it because I am towered over by most women there. Let alone men. I have no chance. My teeth, which I clean twice a day, are persistently yellow. So I never open my mouth, leading me to mumble a lot. This obviously affects the way people perceive me. I have a 'large head' or whatever, people mock me about that a lot (nicknames galore). All this obviously leads to me disliking my exterior appearance too. It's horrible to be honest. I've had moderate acne for 9 years, no treatment has actually permanently got rid of it. Add onto that I WILL NEVER take off my t-shirt to anyone, let alone my shorts (lol), I'm white as anything and am extremely anxious of any future sexual encounter from how inexperienced I am now because of all this shit. My own family haven't seen me with my shirt off for years. I have an outie bellybutton which is probably the worst I've seen of anyone ever. But surgery costs 1.5k-2.5k. How tf am I gonna get this money? I'm a student. BUT I'LL NEVER EVER TRY AND GET IN BED WITH A GIRL UNTIL ITS FIXED. EVER. I just can't, don't say to 'get over it' 'don't complain' 'take pride in what you've got'. It'll freak any girl out, period. 

Then its the conflict. Maybe I should just 'man up and be confident'. Doesn't that shit drain you? I try I try and I try but the amount of times I get shot down. No one will accept me like this but I can't do anything about it. Girls don't take a fucking single look at me. And I know 'don't put your self-worth on other people or women'. No, I definitely will, I want to get a girl. But yet I see everywhere people who are my height, worst looking who get girls. Yet clearly I've never had romantic interest off any girl, never been taken seriously by any girl. So it must be my personality. I see girls sometimes call me weird, or whatever, but the way I respond to shit comes out this way because I'm overthinking so much and I'm not natural. But I don't know the alternative way I'd act even if I wasn't...

People call me funny, call me nice, I try as much as I can to be humble. I'm reasonably stoic, so not like in my opinion it's a problem with seriousness, people say they prefer me when I'm not...but then why can't I be taken seriously by any girls? I try to never be corny, I'd never chase after a girl, I play the game right...

And I'm likable to guys. I'm somewhere probably 'leaning right from centre' if furthest right is macho and left is pure feminine, and I get along with the most macho guys and can also get along with the most feminine guys, flexible in that regard. But my personality just seems to repel women. 

Should I act more macho? Or more empathetic? Women say men should be more open and empathetic etc. but love masculine men. Want a 'protector' bollocks. They'll cry about mens mental health on instagram but put you down for not be masculine enough (realistically, women go after tall, dark, big blokes, try and deny it you know its true). You try and be confident when every girl you speak to immediately mentions your height. Its hard dude. 

Am I a sociopath or something? Wtf? Surely I'm ill...but realistically a lad like me can't say shit like that to people....because what happens in your head and how people treat you in real life is completely different. People ignore shit thats going on with you because you can't go round acting like a walking mental illness all the time, although, pretty much, thats what I am. Constantly not concentrating as a result. But people won't speak to me as if I have because its uncomfortable. But half the time I'm so bummed out I don't wanna speak to anyone, just let me get on with my day if I'm having a bad one. But no, I gotta interact socially and come off weird or impolite.  

I'm always thinking in my head all day, that I gotta be a warrior. I've got to battle. I'm naturally lazy asf because most of the time I don't have a reason to even wanna get out of bed in the morning and have a shower, clean my room or anything. And if I do have the displeasure of being awake, I'd rather numb myself out and play a game or something. But nah dude, *be productive bro, keep up the grindset.* So with me having no confidence in physical appearance or my own personality and subconscious actions, I also gotta put in the work so I survive and *Bro, Healthy body healthy mind, have a cold shower bro*, *make your bed first thing to instil discipline.* 

This is my riddle. So, I can't change my physical appearance, which is objectively average if not below (despite me doing everything fashion and lookswise to change that), I can't change my personality or behaviour (which I have tried desperately hard to do, both consciously for 5+ years through exposure therapy methods and just meditation etc. to think about how to change and then acting on that throughout the day, as well as asking people), I can't change my horrible voice. 

THIS SHIT ISN'T OPINION ITS FACT AND HARD TO CHANGE. The only thing I can do is accept it. This shits objectively true, so any advice to 'own your flaws' isn't worth saying. When people give you deliberate negative reinforcement to your own normal traits and physical appearance why would I be happy with that? I know myself its not good so theres no point pretending and suppressing this shit acting as if I can change the world with my own outlook. 

yet even with the most open-minded, healthy body, and every other form of ATTEMPTED REINFORCEMENT TO MAKE MY LIFE OVERALL BETTER doesn't help me in the slightest. And with all that mentioned above on my shoulders I am meant to try and focus on the discipline of my life? I haven't got a rhyme or reason to even get up in the morning. I can't help myself, no one else wants to help me, and I got no one else to want to live for anyway. On top of that I study law at a good Uni. Why am I doing this? I'd rather be in the ground than getting up. If you want to know my resolve, the fact I still get to the gym 5 times a week and attend all my lectures/seminars can show you. Despite the fact I hate every part of myself and my life I manage to do some shit. But going to the gym isn't going to change all this shit that I burden myself with everyday. I know I'm not suitable or good enough for nar enough anyone, based on past experience with the high high majority of everyone I know. 

I drink every now and then, less than the average person, I smoke about 4 times a year, managed to keep myself on the straight and narrow for the most part even with my stupid dumbass brain trying to tell me otherwise. I do everything I can that is good for myself. That Dr Jekyll part inside of me tells me not to do anything bad. The same 'nah' in my head that tells me to not do drugs is the only thing left stopping me from taking my own life. I've got no one, and nothing, not even myself, to live for anymore. 

Any advice apart from 'seek help now'?"

The one time I finally have that energy of confidence to talk with someone I’m always just stared at and ignored 
Not only that but most of the time whenever I meet people the first few days, weeks or months is fine until they just don’t talk with me anymore

lonely,I only have to my dog.,"I only have to my dog. - My mother is a asshole, and my father is influenced for she. she yells at me for stupid things, and it's not just because she's pregnant,  she has always been like this. The other day, she yell me because I I chose a pair of shorts before taking a shower (to take my dog ​​outside) and almost hit me. It seems to me that at home they didn't teach him manners, from what my grandmother tells me, my grandfather was a fucking good man, he never raised his hand to them, as is common here in Colombia. I'm already sick of her, I'm only 13 years old. I'm waiting for my sister to be born next month, so I can teach her everything myself, because I like the idea of ​​taking care of a baby and also teaching her not to be an asshole with others.

My mother always answers me in a condescending way, the other day she told me that I was ""slow"" because the dog had escaped me, and we were going to bathe him. Every time I say something that she doesn't like, she always says I'm a bad person because I do it to contradict her and annoy her. Yesterday I didn't want to eat pizza, I wanted to eat bread with a fried egg, and it almost ate me alive. The only thing I have is my dog, he is not an asshole with me. I hope to have a job that allows me to live alone, even in a single room, when  or 18 years old, because she claims me for everything. It's bullshit"

lonely,29 M I’m truly alone,"29 M I’m truly alone - Circumstances have led me to being alone for most of my life. I can’t drive and I live in a rural part of Tennessee. 

Im fully capable of making friends when I have the opportunity but I struggle with bpd and depression so I tend to just isolate myself because actually having anyone around is so draining to me. People genuinely seem to like me but I feel obligated to hang out or talk to them and it’s a major stress.

I’ve done a lot to better myself over the years but I still feel like I’m not worthy of being a human. I have no friends, no family, no pets. I don’t eat, can’t sleep, I’m just so sick of this shit. I wish I could just move to the city so I could be around people but I hate the whole city environment so that would probably be unhealthy for me.

I also feel like I tend to attract emotionally immature narcissists. They get what they want from me and poof. Like my last relationship was going so well and then out of the blue it’s over because she had anxiety so bad she’d rather end the relationship because she was worried we wouldn’t be happy together. We haven’t even fought yet. She was even worried I’d cheat for some reason, it’s like she psyched herself out."

I'm 75 years old and feel alone. -  

We were in an Air Force rescue raft bound for a sunken ship a few miles off the coast. Midway out, we were caught in a storm and dragged out to sea. When the storm cleared, we were in a dense fog. We began to hear strange noises, rather like the splashing of a porpoise.. also a sickening odor like that of a dead fish. The noise got closer to the raft and it was then we heard a loud hissing sound.

Out of the fog we saw what looked like a long pole, about ten feet high, sticking straight up out of the water. On top was a bulb like structure. It appeared several more times, getting closer to the raft. The silence was broken once again by something out of the fog. I can only describe it as a high-pitched whine. We panicked. All five of us put on our fins and went into the water.. 'Keep together and try for the ship!' I yelled.

After we were in the water, we became split up in the fog. From behind I could hear the screams of my comrades one by one. I got a closer look at the thing just before my last friend went under. The neck was about 12 feet long, brownish-green and smooth looking. The head was like that of a sea-turtle, except more elongated with teeth. There appeared to be what looked like a dorsal fin when it dove under for the last time. Also, as best I am able to recall, the eyes were green with oval pupils.

I finally made it to the ship, the top of which protruded from the water, and stayed there for most of the night. Early that morning I swam to shore and was found by the rescue unit. I know that thing was real because my friends are dead. My comrades were Eric Ruyle, Warren Salley, Larry Bill, and Bradford Rice. I live in Jacksonville now, but this happened when I lived in Fort Walton Beach. The encounter took place a few miles off the Pensacola coast. I spent a great deal of time at the Mental Health Resource Centre which is in Jacksonville. I also dealt with drug addiction and alcoholism due to the depression I've endured from people not believing me. I've had so many nervous breakdowns because I'm desperate for anyone to believe me that I've lost count. The Beany and Cecil cartoon finished airing in June of the year my friends were killed. I had a long lasting nervous breakdown that lasted for three months, until that godforsaken show finally met its end.

The world has some terrible secrets, and I know how she likes to keep them.. I have not seen the entity again since what happened when I was a teenager."

lonely,Meet Rubie,"Meet Rubie - It's been eighteen winters since I was born. I will not go through another winter of cold and cold loneliness.

I have accepted myself as a loner for several years now. I thought it was the perfect lifestyle. I didn't choose to be a loner, though I accepted it nonetheless. It's not like I had a choice. Attention was absent whenever I spoke; a combination of low volume speech and stuttering wasn't exactly the most attractive; if anything, it probably was the most repulsive. Eye contact was impossible due to the enormous magnet my nose was; a big nose isn't attractive in most cases. I also want to mention that having social anxiety isn't the most helpful.

Still, being a loner was my fault. I always stood *there,* the truly neutral spot in any sort of relationship. I never had true friends. I was always afraid of getting too close, hurting myself and others in the process; I was always afraid of being too far, because if one lingers there for long, they are no longer relevant. I considered risks to be always stupid, so I played it safe as I always have. However, it is worth mentioning that a blade cannot be forged with insufficient heat. A smith would either bring hellish into his forge, or simply not bother with making it in the first place. Unlike my case, a smith would never forge his sword using a microwave.

Also, a true blade cannot be forged by an amateur regardless of the quality of the materials or the heat of the forge. That's when I decided to create Rubie.

Of course, I'm not a god. I cannot physically create *someone*. However, I could always lie down, close my eyes, and listen to nothing but nothing.

That's when she manifested in front of me.

""She."" I wondered why I'd chosen her to be female. Gender shouldn't matter, no? I merely wanted a friend, no? Perhaps I didn't just want a friend, I wanted a soulmate. What's up with the name, too? Why ""Rubie?"" Well, I don't know why; I had to pick a name. She had ruby-red hair and she smelled of lavender. Honestly, mental images don't have a scent; I don't even know what lavender smells like, I merely assumed she smelled nice.

I would talk to her *a lot*, though I would use telepathy to speak to her when there are others in the vicinity so they don't think I'm crazy (at this point, it's only fair.) One day, I was shopping and my eyes landed on a certain discount on pillows. I bought a pillow with a black-and-white checkered cover (the ruby ones were not on sale.) At night, I would pretend that Rubie is the pillow, and I would hug her so tightly. I would only have the best of dreams.

Rubie understands me. She knows and accepts all about me: my stuttering, the fact that I have social anxiety, my favorite books, my favorite videogames, my childhood crush, the betrayal of my former best friend, the fact that my heart aches whenever I see a group of friends laughing, and the fact that I'm trying my best. She knows that I am a very clever and interesting person; she always reminds me of my top grades and accomplishments and how it's everyone's loss for not being friends with me.

I wished she was real.

There was a thought I hated: What if she finally breaks free of my curse? I mean, I did create her only for my sake. What If she breaks free and materializes right in front of me; a human of flesh, bones, and free will? I would rather be always and always alone instead of receiving affection by someone who's forced into giving it. Silly me. She’s. Not. Real.

Goodbye, Rubie."

lonely,Can't help but feel down,"Can't help but feel down - Can't help but feel my crush is using me. Anytime I message them they either never respond or barely with just a one word answer of fun or great. I just don't feel any heart in our conversations anymore. The times they do message me it's usually to ask for something, vent, or to tease me about something I said in the past. Like showing off there score in LoL and saying they don't need my help I reply with a witty comment but no reply. I just feel done with them but what hurts more is just not knowing why they're acting this way with me. It just really makes me feel sad that I'll have to let them go."

It’s a lot more tame than other posts on this subreddit but I really just wanted to say it you know? I just feel awful, waves and waves of self doubt and worthlessness just keep hitting me, doesn’t matter if I’m at school, home, work or even out with my mates. I got bullied when I was younger and stayed quiet to avoid being a target and now I have close to no social skills with people I’m not familiar with. There’s so many things I want to do but I don’t have the confidence to do them alone and none of my friends are interested. For a moment this month I was messaging this girl from my class and I thought it was actually going well, she was liking my messages and laughing at my jokes and I actually felt happy for a bit, a lot more hopeful about myself and I already liked her. Then she suddenly just stopped adding to the conversation, she started completely ignoring me at school too, wouldn’t even look my way. I didn’t say anything off I’m sure of that so I’m guessing she just got bored of me. It really stings and I just feel so shit about it all now. Now that it’s over the more I think about it the worse I feel because I realise why she did it, I wouldn’t be able to be enough for her"

lonely,Not sure what to do and why I'm like this,"Not sure what to do and why I'm like this - I haven't had friends in years although honestly throughout my life I'm not sure if I've ever truly felt like I've had a friend. But I'm lucky, I have my family members I live with who I can talk to, and so I'm fully satisfied in that area. I don't talk much, I don't really need to, it's not a desire I have. Even when I'm alone for extended periods when my family is on vacation or something, I never feel psychologically lonely, maybe it's because I'm autistic but I feel like I don't really need human interaction that much on a psychological level.

However *physically* is completely different. I crave touch, I want to hold someone and to be held. I don't know why, it doesn't really make sense given that I have 0 desire to make friends. Also for some reason I feel uncomfortable hugging my family members, I think I'm afraid of being vulnerable to them due to some stuff that happened when I was younger.

Either way I'm not sure what the solution to this is, I honestly have no desire to make friends for the sake of social interaction,  only physical. I wish I could get rid of my body's desire for touch, that would be easier, I hope it's possible."

I don’t judge, ever. 

So this is where I’m at, tried making some friends on here and failed every time… what is they say about what doesn’t kill you, only make you stronger? Oh! No… that wasn’t it… it was some quote from the Karate 🥋 kid movie lol any how… hopefully you got my point. I thought, let’s give it another try! Un mass, as my Spanish mistress always said! Totallllllly kidding 😂 I don’t have one! 
After many attempts and failures, I was like, okay; fine, forget making friends, how about telework buddies, or anyone I can interact with through out the day beside my annoying and cringy work colleagues with their silly emojis in Teams all day! Again, not judging, I promise. 

So if you’ve read this far, and happened to be intelligent, smart, witty, some class won’t hurt, spontaneous, and don’t mind random yet consistent conversations, then I’m your guy! 

What do you get out of it you may ask..? Glad you did ask! Well, I can’t promise much beside love, attention, and care! Totally kidding lol I mean, an awesome and interactive chats, you get to vent, tell me about your day, and whatever, and …. I’ll stop here! Lol

I hate the fact I tend to rely on other people for happiness and fun. My boyfriend has hobbies: goes to gym, has an allotment, sees his friends all the time.

I cant eat enough, going through the wrong puberty was and is incredebly traumatic and although im on blockers im terrified to gain weight because im scared it will make my body change. Most days I eat less than 500 calories and they want me to eat more but I cant. Between the fear and the trauma and how addictive this is I just cant. Im loosing all hope in life. this dysphoria ruined my life and I've lost so much time and now im loosing more. I feel so tired and empty and sad and I dont know what to do. I have nobody to talk too, I dont have enough energy anyways. The therapist I go to is only once a month and I feel to scared to be honest about how bad this ed really is. Theres no point.

Today we went to our couples therapy and he said he wasn’t happy with me or the relationship and is being distant because he has to take a step back and work on himself and whatnot. While I understand, it’s still very painful for me.

I just want to feel secure. I want comfort. I want peace."
lonely,Feeling really lonely,"Feeling really lonely - Hey guys. I just wanted to try and get my feelings out there and see if anyone has felt the same because I feel like I’m the only one.

So, I’m a 20 year old guy whose love language is physical touch. That means I love cuddles and hugs and basically any sort of physical affection/touch from my partner. The thing is, I haven’t had any of that romantic physical touch from a girl/woman since I was 14 which even then was just my gf at the time laying her head on my chest for a bit. I have been constantly wanting any form of physical affection all these years but I just can’t seem to find women that want the same thing. 

My inability to get any physical touch from a woman in the past 6 almost 7 years has taken a very big emotional toll on me. I’ve been finding myself crying a lot more when I almost never cry, being less motivated to do stuff, and just all around lonely. It’s like I can physically feel the pain in my heart grow over the years because I just really want to find a woman who is looking for something serious instead of just having sex or smoking. Don’t get me wrong I want to have sex, because I’m a virgin, but it’s not the only thing I want to do. I want to build a relationship with a woman and love her as much as I can and she loves me as much as she can. It’s just women don’t really want that anymore.

For example, I recently met this girl through a mutual friend and we started hanging out as a group. As we all started talking I realized I had a LOT in common with her. She’s been feeling lonely and wanting physical affection from a man and I’ve been feeling lonely and wanting physical affection from a woman. She likes to stay home and watch movies or shows and cuddle and I love doing that as well. One of her favorite shows is Criminal Minds and that’s one of my favorites as well. We both aren’t too good at just randomly talking to people because we are worried about what they may think of us. Basically she’s me as a woman. 

So, I tried initiating things and asking if she wants to cuddle and watch Criminal Minds because I know she’s been saying she wants cuddles so badly and so have I, so I thought it would be perfect and a great way for us to get to know each other even more. However, I believe I just found out that shes trying to do something with my other roommate who wasn’t the one that introduced me to her in the first place. Mind you this other roommate, who is a virgin as well, has said that he just wants to fuck and they have almost nothing in common. Yet she’s choosing him over me as someone she wants to do something with. 

I just don’t get it. I know I’m not the best looking person in the world but you think someone would compromise a bit of looks to find someone who is very similar to you and is looking for the same things as well as looking to possibly build a really good relationship with you. I know I would absolutely compromise a girls looks if it meant that she was a really nice person and someone that I could see myself growing with and having an amazing relationship. 

I just find myself unable to get woman to see me romantically instead of seeing my kindness as a friends kindness and that really hurts my heart because I then see them go off with a guy who doesn’t give a fuck about them and is only there for their body and not to care for them and love them and I know I could provide that love and care that they have said they want but never actually act on it simply because I’m not the best looking guy.

If anyone can relate on any level to anything I just said, please tell me what you have done to change this."

I quit to pursue another job, a few years later i applied for a job there. Got rejected as they didnt think my personality fit in. 50% of them were my old co-workers.

What about girlfriends? First two dumped me once they realized what a piece of shit i am, no i didnt cheat. This last one however, i have never loved anyone that much in my entire life but because i'm such a piece of shit, when she was trying to tell me she loved me, i pushed her away and dumped her. I already loved her then but was too scared to show any emotions.

Few months later, we get together again, i try to be more open, but again when she tries to tell me she loves me, i do the same fucking thing. My head is fucked up. This is now 1.5 years ago, she still talks to me but i can tell she has zero trust for me but i badly want her back and i want to bash my head in for being this way. I dont want to hurt her. She's the only one in my entire life where it ever felt like someone actually loved me. And i loved and still love her. I actually sent her a letter apologizing and telling her so. She said it was nice, but i can tell she's not going to be interested in anything.

So here's my deal. I've walked around on this earth for roughly 35 years alone, noones ever really cared about me until this girl. And i killed it. Life is meaningless at this point.

I might just end it. Did i mention my parents abused me my entire childhood and neither give a shit today? No, not sexually.

Yeah i know, i'm a piece of shit. Well fuck you, all of you saying that have or had friends at some point or parents that gave a shit about you.

I'll flip you off when im hanging."

lonely,Lonely and worthless,"Lonely and worthless - I don't know what to do anymore. Now that at least my country (Sweden) moves towards further lockdowns, the chance for me to find anyone to hang out with deteriorates. I just feel that I'll never have the chance to hang out with people again. It's not like I was not already lonely before.

Also, I feel so totally worthless. I have not had a girlfriend for 12 years. In that time I've been on like two dates total. I know that I am the most uninteresting, boring, stupid person there is but I don't know why I had to be dealt this card. I am also very short (for a guy), quite overweight, and not ethnically Swedish, something that is not positive when it comes to the dating scene here.

It was also 12 years ago since I had sex. I know that it's a ridiculous thing to measure anything on. But for me it has more and more become something I value myself from. It feels so stupid to do that. But during those 12 years, I was active in my student union and in the student life for more than 5 years, and even though I tried getting dates, one night stands and what not, I was always the one who went home alone.

Now, a long time after I ended my studies and my engagement in the student life, I also have realised that a lot of people really really disliked me in general. I can now see many many reasons to why that would have been and I guess that it's a big part of my loneliness now. For example, one thing that I have heard a lot of times, but maybe not really realised, is that I'm way too self absorbed and egoistic, that I'm a bad listener and that I don't care about others. I never thought of myself like that but during the past years I have come to change my view. I'm trying to work on that but I know that I'm not going to succeed.

Another thing that I did very recently, a thing that I now regret, is that I created an ""online board game group"" on Facebook and invited those who still can stand me. I realised that it was a mistake. I don't want people to feel that they have to accept just to be nice when they don't want to. I know myself how hard it is to say no to someone, especially someone who is sad or depressed, even if you really don't have the time to be with that person. Now I just feel that I've forced people into hanging with me, and I know that all these people have their own life and families and don't have place for me in their lives.

I should really just remove myself from everyone's lives so that I don't affect anyone in such a negative way that I always do. It's just that it's so hard to do and I don't know how I can make myself go through with it. I also don't know how to begin? Should I start by removing all my social media accounts? Sometimes I just wish that I had the courage to just end everything, but having had a family member who took her own life I know that it's something that I will never do.

I do have a family (father and step-mother) that I am fairly close to. Many of you here probably have it much worse than me. I do realise that in the big picture I do have so much more than many others and I don't really have any reason to feel lonely. It makes me really feel like a failure to be like this.

I'm sorry for this really long and probably not very coherent or grammatically correct rant. I just had to write a bit somewhere and I didn't know where else to post this."

It may seem really insensitive to say this but the worst thing that ever happened to me was making a lot of money in my early 20's. A few good investments and technically I can now live without going to a job I so much hated. Now, almost 30, I've cut myself from the world and spend my days self-loathing and trying not to end my life. I know what most would say, ""just get a job"" or ""go meet people"" or think I'm just privileged with my problems but I have no idea how to interact with people and my personality disorder doesn't help. I'm currently living  in a city and on the rare occasion I have to go out I feel like an alien in a world of ""normal"" people. Recently, I've thought about buying land far far from people and just try to enjoy the beauty of nature and build a house or something meaningful but I know that the crippling feeling of waking up alone every morning will only be exasperated out there. I just don't see how I won't kill myself on that life path or the one I'm currently on.

Again, not sure why I'm posting this, I just wanted to vent I guess. And maybe just to remind someone to cherish even the smallest connections you have in your life. I hope you have a nice day."

I spend hours every day watching videos of people just hanging out in this weird disconnected, one-sided para-social relationship. It's more like a non-relationship because I don't even try to interact with the people I watch. I just think, ""who am I to just demand their attention as some random stranger on the internet?""

At all angles and through all lenses it seems to me that the easiest thing to do is to just be alone. But it's also not, because humans are social animals. I hate life. I want to be with people but there's also so much to dislike about people lol. There's also a lot to dislike about me too apparently, since I'm not the type of individual that fits the mold. My beliefs are skewed pretty far from what would be called ""the norm"".

The concept of relationships is so weird to me as well. They never make sense to me. There's always these subconscious social contracts and judgments passed and all kinds of things, it doesn't even feel like two conscious human beings are talking. Just animals wearing clothes pretending to be superior to other animals.

Maybe I should post this on r/misanthropy instead lmao."

As the title states, this is a different type of lonely. I [29m] get a lot of people here post about their depression, anxiety, and I guess potentially how sad they are. I completely understand why and I can’t say I’ve never been in that situation. 

My post is more to mention that yes, I’m lonely but not in a sad way. I have many hobbies and I feel very in control of my life. I would say it’s more of taking the word “lonely” at face value. I do fine being alone but I can’t say I enjoy the company of someone else just being there. Is anyone else like this? Where maybe you just want to be in the same room as someone you love and/or care for and just enjoy that company. Doesn’t have to be sexual or crazy affectionate. Just the warm presence there with you. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy being affectionate also but as I do things on my own like eat at a restaurant by myself, go on walks, go to events, go to movie theaters, etc, I can’t help but want that other presence around. Sharing those experiences.

Anywho, just curious if others face this type of loneliness as well. Take care everyone"

Like last year, it's a mess. So here I've stuck a foot out of the door. Wow little rock star. If you know that phrase we are instant best friends hahaha. So I should start introducing myself now.

My name is Ye Qian! I am 29 years old. You got a Scorpio girl here. Hawaii is where I live. I have a big stupid personality. Because I'm more comfortable with it. The age range I am looking for is 30+ men,

What do I look for in a friend you ask. Well, I will tell you below. I really want a friend who loves to text me every day. Vent and talk about life is for sure. We all go through something. We should be able to share. There's some amazing black humor. Can joke and laugh. have some of the same interests. without prejudice,

Things I like Travel, Invest, Diving, etc.

This is a new beginning for me. So please don't send me information about sex or want to get sex from me. You will be blocked. Please ignore the post if not in age group. If you don't make an effort to build your friendship with everything, or you're a ghostly person. So please don't waste my time. I'm tired of being exploited and feel like crap. When things don't work because I think I'm doing something wrong. So, if you don't work hard, or it will only hurt me in the end. Forget it. Now I'm done with outspoken hahahaha. Let's summarize.

Thanks for reading my post. Please introduce yourself when you message me. Please don't just say hi. Send something about yourself too. With this emoji thank you all for reading! ! ! !"

Well I finally asked for help, told my mom I need to see/talk to a doctor, and this girl I like pushed me to tell her, and I really appreciate her, 

She is absolutely amazing, im not trying to brag but I really feel like she's the ""one"" you know? Like the love of my life I feel 😊, she has been very supportive and helpful to me ever since we met, and I couldn't ask for someone better 😌, she has made me happy😊

to all the people on this subreddit, there is hope, and don't be afraid to ask for help, I know I was afraid to ask but I had that push and I asked and now im going to be getting the help I need, don't let it sit there and build up like I did, it is awful, just ask for help, it may be hard at first but It will be good for you, dont wait years like I did, it is tough I know, but if you need a push dont be afraid to ask a friend or S.O. or whoever you really trust


But anyways I hope everyone is having a good day/night 😊, I hope my advice helps you or someone you care about ❤💙💜"

lonely,“friends”,"“friends” - me and 2 other guys have been “friends” basically since birth. we always hung out but looking back, it was forced. our parents were all friends and since we met up a lot we basically were friends. we all moved to a new place after a while and then covid happened and we had to go online. one of my “best friends” is in the same grade and the other is one higher. when we went back to school i felt left out. im a shy loser and under any other circumstances i would not have been friends with them. in school my friend in the same grade basically ghosts me in a way. he talks to me somedays but is way more social than me. he has so many freinds in his friend group as well. i tried to join them and i sort of got let in. but the “friend” in my grade doesnt talk to me much and i feel so lonely all the time. i cant even talk to my freind in a grade above me. i also dont even have that much of an online life. he hardly tries to talk to me and i just thought he had my back. it makes me always feel empty. i just needed to take a small vent on how lonely i feel"
lonely,Fuck guys I fucked up,Fuck guys I fucked up - 23(M)So it’s been a while since I posted anything on here but yeah I did something incredibly stupid. I didn’t relapse on Stimulants but I slashed my wrists all the way up to my elbow and a little more behind. Idk why I fucking did this. Now I’m in pain and depressed and idk lately every day that passes by I get more and more sucked into a state of non existence almost. Nobody checks in on me. I literally have been sitting on my couch for days only going out for nicotine or Kratom and then I’ll stare at the tv or draw but not even that brings joy anymore idk what to do. I feel like I’m becoming suicidal but I’m hoping I can hold myself back from that. Luckily there’s this one wonderful girl I’m talking to but last night I dialed her drunk and might’ve spilled too much and I could tell she was uncomfortable so I told her I was sorry and I hung up and haven’t talked to her since :/ What the actual fuck am I doing? Why is my mind racing and pushing me down so much I can barely hold a conversation let alone someone to talk to. And ontop of it all my meds don’t even work anymore. I’m a fucking mess and I’m sorry if this sounds like an angry rant I’m just fed up with this. I’ve been depressed since I was 5 or so and become agoraphobic/panic disorder since 15 and my life just gets worse. If anyone can dm me that would be appreciated! Fr guys🖤 I know I’ve messaged and talked w some of y’all in the past so it’s fine if u reach out again I really need someone to talk to I’m shaking rn listening to Some Lofi and nothing seems to help these days

lonely,"Talking helps, I need someone to chat with","Talking helps, I need someone to chat with - I don’t really know what to talk about though. I’ll try not to vent about how awful I feel all the time. I like music mostly, artists like Thundercat, Flying Lotus, Kaytranada, and Earth, Wind and Fire. I like to learn about music theory and the craft of making it. [Here’s a mix of kinds of things I listen to usually](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/bub/pl.u-GgA5eozsZWpY7zg) 

I’ve been trying to get a larger appreciation of film lately as well, art-house and mainstream. Other than that I’m not sure, I’m not a super active person but I wish I wasn’t such a shut in, I’d like to do more stuff it just kind of scares me.

I can barely get out of bed somedays. It’s like I am in a tunnel but there is no light to figure out the way out. I just want a respectable group of friends and another man to hold my hand and tell me it’s going to be okay. I want to feel like I have someone other than myself. At this point I am starting to even hate myself because i am blaming myself for my loneliness even if logic says it wasn’t my fault."

He seemed nice and cute and charming so we talking for a bit. Then the red flags popped up. He would not answer any get to know you type questions, and he sent generic flirty, love snaps to at least 100 people at a time. I felt played. I ask what he was looking for and he just ignored me again, I know we didn’t really have something to begin with but it hurts like hell when I thought the person I had feelings before felt the same. Guess I am not that good."

lonely,I don't see the point of self improvement and life in general if I'll always be alone and lonely,"I don't see the point of self improvement and life in general if I'll always be alone and lonely - As the title says. My case may be unique since my general flaws make me undesirable to another level. I was born with a genetic condition that made my teeth brittle ever since I was a child. As a result, I had to get all my teeth extracted at 19 and start wearing removable dentures. By the time I was done with tech school add got my first decent paying job, I was able to afford mini implants but not actual full dental implants (I was quoted 60k) which means I still have to remove my teeth at night even though I can live without my teeth flying out my mouth now and can eat whatever I want.

Not only that, I'm generally short (5'9"") and have generally unattractive facial features despite not being fat. On top of that, I went to tech school and did not pursue a bachelor's degree and education is extremely important and touted as pivotal by all women. I actually have a decent paying job and live alone but at the same time, I only went to tech school. As you can imagine, these issues are some sort of lethal amalgamation that makes my dating pool non existent.

Just to be clear, I don't harbor any hatred or disdain towards women as it's only natural they would not want anything to do with me, romantically. As a result, however, I simply don't see the point of putting an effort into life or going on an endless self improvment journey if I'll always be alone. My life just now consists of me going to work, coming back, playing OSRS and watching anime to distract myself from my loneliness and depression"

My birthday is actually tomorrow, but I have been in a slumped depression for weeks now. I am going  through a tremendous heartbreak right now, as I was recently rejected by someone I was extremely in to.

 Self-esteem is just zero. I do not go to college or uni, so feel like it's impossible to meet someone that I am genuinely attracted to, and attracted to me as well. My words can not explain this pain I'm in currently. 
I have been contemplating suicide the pain is so surreal. I just need out of this pain immediately, I can't feel this way anymore."

lonely,A Beautiful Autumn Afternoon,"A Beautiful Autumn Afternoon - I hope this serves as a bit of solace for anyone who needs a break from their thoughts right now. Also please excuse the formatting if it is incorrect. This was created on mobile.

---

It's a beautiful autumn afternoon. The sun is shining, the leaves are a cascade of the usual fall colors, and there's that slight chill in the air that serves as a gentle reminder that winter is indeed coming. You're laying on the couch, having enjoyed a lazy day off from life's many obligations, but now you can't help but count the seconds on the clock as they tick away. It's agonizing and you know it, but still you can't help yourself as your anticipation builds. The time you're waiting for is getting closer… and closer… 

Then you hear the sound of a key in the front door and your ears prick up. The door is pushed open and your heart leaps just as your body does. The love of your life has finally returned after a day that was beginning to feel like it would never end. You crash into each other and both squeeze so hard, you wouldn't be surprised if you pop like one of those stress relief dummies. The hug has probably gone on long enough, but you refuse to let go partially afraid that they might disappear if you aren't holding them. You fight back tears of joy because even though you never thought it was possible, you just know they feel the same way about you.

Finally you pull back just enough in order to kiss them softly, conveying more thoughts and feelings and sheer love for them than words ever could. After a few seconds you let up, unable to fight it any longer. A single rogue tear finally escapes and rolls free down your face. Your heart soars as you see your partner smile, struggling to hold back tears of their own. They were just as enthusiastic to see you. Another tear threatens to escape your confines. ""Don't cry baby, you're gonna make me cry too,'' they say, wiping the tears that had escaped your defenses away. You hold hands and look lovingly into each other's eyes, baring your souls for one another. The two of you weren't normally this sappy, but it seemed to just be one of those days, and damn it, you were glad it was. 

""I couldn't wait for you to get home,"" you tell them, pulling them down to the couch. The two of you shift into your natural cuddling position as you have so many times before. You both sigh and lay there in silence for a while. Eventually, time would demand you get up and do things, but you knew if you had the option, you could lay there with your soul mate for eternity, and be in a state of bliss the entire time. 

""I'm so lucky to have you,"" you say softly, breaching the comfort of silence. ""If I had to do it all over, I'd gladly go through all the heartache again. Because it led me to you; and there's no one else I'd rather give my heart to in the whole wide world,"" they say lovingly. ""I love you,"" you say. ""I love you too,"" they respond. You both adjust and lightly kiss each other again. 

""I am getting hungry however, so how about we make something?"" They suggest. ""That sounds great,"" you reply, entirely on board with the idea. Regardless if you were good at it or not, making something together was a great way to spend time with each other, and that's the only thing you wanted to do after your time apart. ""What should we make, Chicken?"" They ask. ""Not feeling that, Pasta?"" You counter. ""We just had that last night. Oh, I know! How about we be naughty and have cookies for dinner,"" they say, eyebrows raised. You chuckle and boop them on the nose. Just another example of why you love them with all your heart. ""Alright, it's a plan, but I get to use the cookie cutter this time,"" you say as you both get up. ""Nah, first one there gets that honor loser!"" They say, laughing as they sprint into the kitchen. 

You smile and think back to all the days and nights where the loneliness seemed to be too much. You had some dark thoughts those days. Sometimes the darkest one of all. You never thought in a million years you'd find someone who would actually love you as you did them. You were glad you persevered even when you didn't know why you kept going. You thought back to what they had said earlier as you followed them into the kitchen. If you had to do it all again, you gladly would. Because it led you to them, and there was no one you'd rather share your heart with in the whole wide world.

---

Even though it doesn't seem like it will ever happen, it is possible. I'm in the same boat as you. Just keep going and keep trying new things, even if you don't know why you're still fighting. You never know when your life will change for the better."

lonely,Nothing shouts worthlessness like not being missed,"Nothing shouts worthlessness like not being missed - There is one constant in my life that is as sure as the advancements of time or the expansion of the univerise: Not being missed. I can be the most supportive person who always listens to everyone and tries to spread positivity and compassion like a beacon on whatever ground I walk on, attempt to enrich and improve people's lives, inspire them, cherish them and yet I can be sure that when I'm gone, nobody will bat an eye.

All these posts you can read in /r/relationships or /r/UnsentLetters of people being missed, you can be sure that person will not be me with absolute certainty. Some say life is like a train, and it feels like I'm only ever intended to be a temporary acquittance. It's not like I abaondon people and execpt them to miss me, no that would be very manipulative and desperate. People usually abandon me ""I need a break"" ""I need to focus on myself"" ""I need less online time"" ""I think we should talk less"" ""I'm gonna remove you"" and that's when it all crumbles like it always does. Things are never meant to turn out well for me ultimatively.

And yet there is this spark of hope, that fuel and fire in my heart that yearns to love and be loved back. But it is not to be, time and time again my time will come where I will be dropped, and never be looked at back. I will be fortunate enough to be asked for favours after months but that is it, I am only used for the bare minimum from that point onward.

I am unworthy of love. I do not deserve it. I had the highest hopes and it was my absolute dream to be in a romantic relationship, my biggest wish and desire. I am passionate about loving someone in and out, with all their values and flaws. But it is never meant to be, either destiny summons a global crisis or I just don't have it whatever that is. Do I even exist? Why am I not like the others? Why can't I be missed? Why can't I be valued? What am I missing that makes me not worth to reach out to besides favours?

I'm tired. I've already noticed how I don't love the way I used to. Everytime I'm getting my hopes up all to have them get crushed again, a part of me dies. This accumulation of decades of being cheated on, played with, deluded, being betrayed, not being good enough, being lied to has disillusioned me greatly. I can't do this anymore, it hurts too much please. I just want to rest and find my peace.

But I can't, every time I see you the memories come back and beat me down to my knees again. I pretend I'm fine but I'm really not, I've never have been. I can't find my peace, so I'm lonely. I can't even watch or do anything else, the severity of loneliness weighs down on my soul, leaving me as a soulless human corpse. I exist, I'm alive, my body is working as far as that's concenered. But my soul is dead, there is nothing to look forward to, nothing to be excited for, no one to care for, no one to love, no one to reach out to. Just an endless abyss into a darkness."

I don't want anybody any more, I just want to be left alone in my hollow life..

I’ve already been super lonely ever since the pandemic hit. Even had physical symptoms due to loneliness. All because I’m a super shy person and I have actual problems with social anxiety. It’s weird because I’m a really caring and decent person so idk why she would ditch. I guess I was just replaced. It was so out of the blue. I tried asking if I did something wrong but she just fucking says “lol” or says “I don’t like you.” Ok well u did like me two hours ago before sending that. It’s been three days now of me trying to text her so I just blocked. I’m not chasing some low life scumbag (or anyone for that matter) that ditches and treats their friends like shit. We were really good friends for two years and this sucks so much. Well now I’m on Reddit searching for friends so plz send a dm. I don’t care what gender you are or what country you live in. Just be around my age. I can tell you more about myself once we chat some more. I have discord. Im open minded and I’ll have a conversation about anything.

Anyway, it's been about 2 years that I'm looking for the best way to leave this world with the least amount of people affected. All my relationships, whether family or friends, are only temporary for me.

Every time I try to start a relationship, every time I try to pass an exam, everything, I screw up absolutely everything. And I know it's all my fault because I don't make any effort or I ask for too much, either way I'm just tired of stagnating in a meaningless and destructive routine for me, I'm just trying to die basically by doing as little harm as possible to the people who might be around me."

I'm looking for someone who resonates with me. Down to earth person, I like to be a little cautious. Once we really get to know each other, I'm open to an online relationship and maybe even meet in real life.

What do I want from you? Someone read my post first and was looking for the same thing! I hope this is a long term thing. Find a mature and steady man to communicate with each other, your age should be 36+, I like middle-aged men, older men, younger men may not be suitable for me

lonely,All hope is lost,"All hope is lost - Any other shut ins here? Posting here out of frustration I guess. I don’t know how to keep going. I’m a college dropout (multiple times) and can’t keep a job. Not because I don’t want to but because of mental health issues. People treat me bad because I’m s push over my last job my colleague was talking shit about me while she was sitting rows away kinda fucked me up and I quite my job the next day. I have been a shut and I know I can’t keep going like this I tried everything going to therapy where they only focus one thing and gave me several miss diagnoses before getting to this point.  Wasted almost a year trying to figure out what is wrong with me. I tried being realistic and seeing the consequences of living like this. I tried mindfulness, routines, plain forcing discipline. Literally nothing stuck I’m at a point where I just can’t be bothered. I don’t have friends and no support system. Family thinks I’m lazy and disregards my mental health issues pretending it’s not even there. They only let me live like this because I promised to go back to college. The only joy I get is consuming content. If I fail college once more I’m probably gonna …. Myself. It’s literally the only option I have I don’t have a boyfriend to live for or friends. My future is bleak, don’t have assets or anything. I’m not looking for advice and please don’t link the suicide hotline it’s useless in my country like going to the ER is where I got treated badly for wanting to …. Myself. There’s truly no hope for me. There is no place in society for people like me."

Have worked so hard for this and it is a brand new apartment, has no one but the family to say it to. just wanted to share it with someone, do not have many friends to share it with and those I call friends are not close to me as they have traveled to study.

the apartment is not finished until the end of the year, so even though I am looking forward, I also dread when I am afraid I will be more lonely than I already am. Living all alone without family is something I've been thinking about a lot lately and I feel like I really want to be lonely. hope i find myself someone to share life with soon.

does anyone live alone now? Have you experienced being more lonely than you were before you moved out?

thank you for everything and feel free to write to me if you want to talk about something or anything."

lonely,Lonelier Than Ever,"Lonelier Than Ever - Somehow I am surrounded by so many people but yet I still feel alone.

I had to make a reddit account to say this because there's nobody I can talk to about it. I know a lot of people, but they only speak to me when its convenient for them. I had a potential relationship with a girl, and she was  the only person I talked to everyday, multiple times a day. We stopped talking just before the new year and I realize now without her I really have nobody. I tried to reach out and contact her again last week and she hasn't replied. I've always been to myself but I had people around me to keep me occupied, now I'm still to myself and have no one around. I feel like I'm on an island, deserted, alone, and hopeless. I check my phone so often - and for no reason besides pure boredom - because there's no text or call waiting for me. Luckily, I've been through this enough in life to not really cry over it, but if I could I would. I'm physically at my peak in life - good job, getting in better shape than I was in previous years, good amount of ""friends"", financially stable. Mentally and emotionally, I am at my lowest and I just hope it turns around soon."

How did you handle being in this situation - Before I ask, I just wanted to tell my story. Its been rough, and I went through hell getting my i.d and social security card. I'm originally from California. Moved to a different state. After my grandmother passed I basically just gave up on myself. I didn't want to live, I didn't want to BE. Fast forward, now I have a job I started a couple days ago at Mc Donalds. Being that by the time I get off of work I miss the cut off on getting into a shelter and I end up sleeping behind an abandoned building. What advice for anyone that's been homeless with a job on washing, finding best areas to sleep at outside, etc? I would be so thankful if I could get a hotel room for one good day just to get myself in order. It may not mean nothing, but to me it would mean everything. I be so scared to ask for help mainly because others have ruined for the people who are actually trying."

Whereas it has been stagnant or negative for me. 

The thing is, I tried talking to her before, but she never responded well. I needed someone to talk to, but no one seemed to care, so I stopped contacting anyone. 

But today she called and said that she misses me, and it really irked me. I have mentally removed her from my life, and she is like a stranger, but still I talked like friends. It was a pretence. 

Like WTF? When I'm getting used to being alone, such people return and open my wounds. I know I cannot be alone, but I have no choice, and have made peace with it. But incidences like this really shake me up."

this woman was also married but that has been rocky almost since day one per her. maybe her dude said something and isnt letting her play anymore, idk. but after two years to break off all comm. without so much as a reason why is utterly devastating to me personally. we had a really really good vibe and our personalities matched almost perfect for playing live. so maybe that was it...? she stopped it because we got along a little too well.....? before and after each practice we of of curse would hug, i think because we both are huggers but absolutely nothing else ever happened, so is that part of it....? we'd talk on the phone about personal stuff and band stuff but thats because we're not robots - we're friends and bandmates. so idk.

ive already had issues trusting females, but this just takes it to a whole new level. not sure how i ever can again. to have someone you thought gave a shit about you just disappear after two years and apparently not give two shits about it. cant describe it. its unforgivable imo."

lonely,Overwhelmed by rejection/heartbreak.,"Overwhelmed by rejection/heartbreak. - I have no-one to blame but myself. She was right, and I was wrong. You know that feeling when you hurt a really good girl? Well, that's how I'm feeling now. She gave me so many chances because she was extremely sweet, and kind, and somehow I still managed to mess things up with her. 

It's all my fault. I just want to tell her that I'm sorry, and ask her from the bottom of my heart to forgive me. I was trying to push a relationship with this girl who kept telling me that she only wanted to be friends. It was stupid, I know. I just misunderstood her being nice and friendly as flirting and being interested. I misunderstood what she meant by being friends, as dumb as it sounds. I thought she meant she wanted a relationship, but, just wanted to wait until we transitioned into that stage, or put a label on it. 

I made myself come off as a total creep. I misunderstood her friendly nature as mixed signals and flirting. I think she was interested in me, but wanted to take things slower. But, I was stupid, and kept trying to escalate into relationship, because I just craved that intimacy of being something more. I was a total, complete, idiot. She kept telling me to take things slow, but I kept rushing things and trying to push for relationship. No, I never pushed for sex, it wasn't sex I wanted. I just wanted to lock her down, so to speak, exclusive, so she wasn't talking with other guys. So please don't make it about sex. I never wanted that, I never mentioned that. I just wanted exclusivity faster than she did, if she wanted it at all, ever. Lol.

TL;DR: I misunderstood this girl as being interested in me, she was physically my type, extremely pretty, so I fell extremely hard for her. My heart is bleeding, and I can't heal. She ghosted me on all social media btw, if that wasn't obvious yet, lol. It hurts so much to know what it feels like to get so much attention from a girl, just to have all of that attention turn into radio silence. I genuinely misunderstood her interest and thought she was into me. This was a co-worker that would initiate conversation with me and we would text a lot off work. I'm (22M) they ()"

lonely,Is it weird to become so numb?,"Is it weird to become so numb? - See TLDR at end.

So basically, I've got to the point now that I expect people to just leave or not to bother with me. If I try to start a new relationship and on the very rare occasion get noticed at all, in the back of my head I'm just wondering how long it will be until they leave me, ghost me, or grow distant. People will of course say don't be pessimistic, but I'm not. I just accept it as a fact and try to stay ceaselessly hopeful regardless, but I've not once been proven wrong. They all promised and said basically the same things, to the point that I'm starting to wonder if I keep meeting the same few people repeatedly.

But everytime a friend or ex left, I cared less and less. It still affected me of course, but I just feel completely numb and think to myself, ""Time for the next incredibly slow process of finding new people to fill the void."" I've got less picky too, but not desperate, so it's not a matter of standards either. It's more of a feeling that no one will ever keep their word unless saying goodbye. That all the good feelings are fake and merely temporary. It doesn't matter what I say or what I do, if anything at all, the end results are always the same. It doesn't matter how many people from different countries or backgrounds I meet, it doesn't matter what age, or gender they are, they all end up the same. This may get me hate for saying that, but at best, I can only seem to find the sane few groups of people. I don't intentionally categories people into groups, but to miss the patterns you'd have to be completely blind. I'm not claiming to be special or anything, but I simply don't fit. I take time to get to know people, but that makes no difference either. I knew several friends since I was 3 and 4 and they basically abandoned me the same as people I met, say, a week ago.

I ask them if it's me and they never answer. The common response is they are busy. Forevermore it seems, I try to reconnect. They react excitedly most of the time then the day after I'm ignored again. I've done this multiple times with the same people. It's like how it used to be for that 1 moment and then it's gone again, and won't come back for a long time. Then randomly I'll say hi months or even years later and they'll do the exact same thing again. I asked them what they are doing and will say nothing or they are free and bored, but then talk for a bit, and then take 10 mins between replies, then 30 mins, then just vanish for months again. I even have brought this up before to some. The reactions are usually ""Oh sorry mate, I didn't realise"" for most guys, then they do it again. For women it's normally ""I was busy"" i point out they said they weren't and what were they up to and they take an hour to reply with ""idk"" or similar. This started with friends and then relationships. But at least old friends will still rarely reply unlike the 40+ ghoster ex's from over the last decade or so.


TLDR:
Because of my experiences, of which I left out a hell of a lot, I've become completely numb to people leaving or becoming distant. I don't feel nothing at all, but i expect and accept it as a fact of life. It's not a matter of optimism or pessimism. It's been the same before and after I've focused on myself, it's been the same with people around the world of all types. Yet still I'm incredibly lonely. It's weird, because I often used to enjoy my own company.


In conclusion it truly feels like I am stuck in limbo.
Even by the words definition: ""An uncertain situation that you cannot control and in which there is no progress or improvement.""
I'm stuck in this cycle that shrinks each time. I could compare my relationships like the 50,000 year cycles of the Reapers in Mass Effect. By my count, that means I've wasted the equivalent of 2 million years and gotten no where.
Call it cringe, call me a loser, even if not to me directly. It just is what it is. Has anyone else felt the same? Or am I totally alone in this situation? I know literally nothing will change by sharing this or even get any replies, as it'spretty long. But I just wanted to vent, get a break from feeling the dread and despair that I might not even exist.
If you made it this far, thanks for listening to my rambles, I rarely say anything at all these days."

it sucks because i met her at my lowest and she helped me through eveything especially when most of my friends left me.  and now i cant do anything to help her because she deleted it permanently. i asked few times about her decision to make sure she's not making impulsive decision. and it hurts me that we become stranger again. 

i feel numb again just like before i met her. i miss her so much. i miss her jokes and laugh. i miss her kindness and warmth. i feel lonelier than ever. 

im still on my holiday and none of my family know about what ive been through rn. i try my best to smile or just act normal when im with my family, it just make the pain worse. i lose my apetite and cant get out of bed, i just stare at ceiling until i sleep again.

lonely,I’m willing to give 100% effort into making a friend. I’m so tired of being alone,I’m willing to give 100% effort into making a friend. I’m so tired of being alone - 17 year old male. Spent the last two years in my house. When Covid started I left behind my in-person school and went to online. Worst decision I’ve made. No friends in person at all. I don’t work. Numerous health problems. My main hobby is art. I want to dedicate time to making a friend. I’m so lonely it physically makes me feel sick to think about.
lonely,I'm tired,"I'm tired - Heya. Sorry to bother you all by talking about my feelings and all that jazz, I really hate to do it, but I just need to get my thoughts into words because it's really eating me up and I want to know that I've at least tried something - even if that is just venting to strangers on the internet.

So I don't really know how to do this, I'm just going to write as it comes to me, but my mental state has recently reached a point where it is actually starting to genuinely worry me; it has admittedly been quite poor for several years now, but over the past six months or so it has legitimately got to the point where I am almost constantly thinking about killing myself. 

I haven't had an especially bad life, not compared to some people, but I'm just so crushingly lonely and its fucking with me. I have tried joining clubs, I have tried talking to people at work, but they just brush me off. It also doesn't help that the idea of talking to people actively terrifies me, like I have tried joining discord servers and the like but I just freeze up and panic - I actually cannot bring myself to get involved and talk to people, and then I quickly leave them only to immediately hate myself for doing so. The one person in my life who I talk to is my older brother, and he's amazing, I love him to bits. But I also feel like I can't talk to him; I am bisexual and he is deeply homophobic. I just feel like if I can't even be open about this basic element of myself, I somehow still feel alone even when we chat, which hurts.

Every day I just wake up and lie in bed, but then I start to think and I have to distract myself or I just break down. I also spent Christmas and New Year's alone for the first time ever this year, which certainly hasn't helped. I tried talking to my family but they didn't respond. I just feel apathetic towards everything I do as well, I can't focus at work and I can't focus on my university studies because I just can't work up the motivation to actually do much, which then eats away at me; that I should have done better and that I should have tried harder, which is like a self perpetuating spiral all on its own. 

I know that they say suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems but these are problems which have existed and have been getting worse for what is now a quarter of my life, so they feel pretty goddamn permanent. I don't want to kill myself, but I almost feel like it is inevitable if that makes sense? Like at some point it will just get to a point where I am too caught up in emotion and just end it on a whim. I just want to stop feeling like this.

I'm really sorry to have just gone on about it, and I'm especially sorry if this was the wrong sub entirely for all this, but I needed to just put my thought to paper, so to speak."

(she’s dealing with a lot of personal things i won’t get into so i try my best to give her the space she needs.) i love her so much, but we’re just not clicking as much anymore. i literally have no one i can’t lose her:("

lonely,"When I want to kill myself, I know it’s because a new chapter in my life must come.","When I want to kill myself, I know it’s because a new chapter in my life must come. - I have to evolve, which means people and thoughts must die in this new shift of reality if I want to live. 

It happens every time. 

If it’s me that has been causing my hurt, I change my thoughts. I monitor what I tell myself and monitor the activities that consume me. 

If it’s a human who has hurt me, I must physically mourn their death and distance myself for as long as I need, even if it’s forever, in order to find peace with the past version of me that needed to die. 

I’m currently going through that shift with one of the people I love in my life. They opened a door we closed a while back and left it open without intention. It’s sad, really, because I thought they were ready to evolve to a new state of consciousness with me. Alas, I deserve the kind of love I’m willing to offer, and they deserve all the space they need to exist in the reality they are creating for themselves. 

For that, I leave my goodbye note to that person here, with all of you. I haven’t physically mourned them yet, but it’s coming. If there is someone you need to mourn as well for the sake of your sanity, know that I’m there with you spiritually. This is a chapter of growth. This is the chapter in which you find yourself. 

Feeling lonely is okay because there are so many adventures to be had! I know this. I know that when I start to love myself, I go to places alone. I connect more deeply with strangers. I welcome new chapters.

I hope this is useful to those who feel like me. 💚"

So anyways if you’re still reading….

Not to get too personal but I seemed to have always had issues forming relationships and even just talking I guess.
I was the kind of “undiagnosed anxiety but perceived as mature” kid

But yea, at this point I feel like no one pays attention to me anymore. That sounds really bad and self absorbed but I guess I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t grown to prefer it that way.
It’s not often people have tried to get me to open up or to be more active, but when anyone has I feel like I get kind of panicky and really embarrassed, I don’t like it.

And this has lead me to believe,
maybe I’m meant to be alone
I mean I don’t know, I don’t really want that to be the truth but maybe it is

I feel guilty for this. It feels like I'm exploiting someone for my personal wants, and I feel that I need to find that peace within myself. However, if a girl seems uninterested I take it very personally and get extremely hurt. This conflict is very difficult and I'm wondering whether I should see a therapist. Does anyone else feel like this? I'm just looking for some advice and different perspectives :)"

Or maybe we can work together to do something about our lives instead of wasting it behind the dillusion of everything will work it's self out?

lonely,Hello Reddit!,"Hello Reddit! - I just wanted to give out an open invitation to anybody who needs company.   


Just a brief introduction of myself:  
I'm an awkward guy from Denmark with a messed-up sleeping schedule(it's currently 3:54 AM and woke up around 8 PM, lol). I consider myself a gaming god(exaggerated a bit), with a track record in World of Warcraft and Hearthstone. I've also played a lot of other games, but those have been my go-to for years. I'm not playing much lately though, but I've been trying out a bit of FF14. I also follow the League of Legends scene, but I'm honestly too fragile emotionally for the toxicity, so I don't really dare to play it anymore myself, haha.   


Besides gaming, I'm really into anime. My favorite animes are probably Parasyte, Your Lie In April, Clannad, 3-gatsu no lion, but I've watched and liked a ton of other shows, it's just hard to select a few and rank them all.   

I'm also really into music and playing guitar. I'm primarily into metal and all its subgenres (really into metalcore and prog(Killswitch Engage, Erra, Periphery, Shrezzers, Intervals, etc.)), but I also enjoy some EDM like Porter Robinson and pop tunes(I'm really into 'Lukas Graham - Happy For You (feat. Hanin Dhiya' at the moment, such a beautiful song). I'm really not too narrowminded when it comes to music. If it does something to me, I don't really care what genre it is. Anyway, that's about it for my brief introduction. If we share interests or you find me intriguing, feel free to hit me up! if not, no offense taken, haha. Hope y'all have a great day/night."

lonely,I really feel like crap,"I really feel like crap - Hey, lately I've been feeling like crap, like I've been feeling very lonely, ive felt super sad and stressed about everything, and idk, im really trying to push through all of this but its super hard, recently I met someone that I really really like, and they know that I feel this way, they have helped me alot, but I guess all this sadness and stress just take back over and make me feel bad about myself, 

And I cant afford to get help, maybe that sounds like a excuse, but im still living with my mom, cause of online college and such which is all being paid for through aid and loans I could never pay for that, but its like I need alot of help and im afraid to ask for any, cause I dont want to upset people, and the person I like told me I probably have a chemical imbalance and that I need to see a doctor, but the thing is, I havent seen a doctor in 2 years, the last time I saw one was for the same reason im sitting here now, except at that time I was feeling suicidal, over someone I really liked at the time but then she mentally abused me over the course of us dating, maybe that also has something to do with how im feeling also, idk, sometimes I wish I could just shut off all my stuff like my phone, my iPad, xbox, etc and just disappear, I mean I have friends, and I have the one girl I really like, and my mom, but sometimes I dont want to tell them how I feel in fear of annoying them, even though I know that they care, 

I also wish I could shut off the parts of my brain that make me feel this way, cause it really sucks, I used to be the happy guy, everyone in high school liked me, I feel at least, but even then at that time I was in a abusive relationship, so that was dragging me down, I cried a few times in front of random people and I would tell them im fine, but really I wasn't, I was sad, and I was being manipulated into liking this girl cause she would bribe me with things like food or she would take me out somewhere cause she ""felt bad"" about making me upset, but she would do it again and again, and me being the scared one, I didnt drop it, cause I was afraid to, but then eventually she dropped me, and I guess it worked out in the end, even though I have some sort of trauma from it, and to add to all the BS she did to me, she then 6 months later told a girl I was talking to for a potential relationship, that I hit her when me and her were dating, I would never hurt anyone and the fact that she was throwing that around and her friend was adding to it, really messed me up, so I basically stopped talking with that person cause I couldn't deal with the stress, and to add to the thing about her saying I ""hit"" her she was supposedly sending pics around woth make up on to make it look like I hit her, we haven't spoke to each other in 6 months at the time, but even then too she didn't like it when anyone would try to touch her, no hugging, no kissing, nothing at all, the only times I ever ""laid a hand"" on her was when she wanted me to hug her during those rare times, after I heard all of that crap, I filed a police report on her, cause im not gonna let this person ruin my life,

Idk what else to really put here, but im just so tired of feeling like crap, any comments will be appreciated, sorry that its very long, but yeah.."

all i hear people conversations is about sex, when i open up social media, all you see is sex memes, or ppl post about sex. ppl always brag about it, i dont even want to listen to music no more, because its always about love and sex. and as a virgin im feel embarrassed and ashamed im 20 years old not having it. i cant relate to nobody posts, or conversations when they talk about sex. i have to always be quiet, and act like im interested, when my friends bring it up. one of my friends laugh at me for not getting girls, and i laugh with him because its a shame im still one. life is about relationships, and sex, and improving your life. 


i will never be one of those dudes who gets relationships back to back, or have a ex stuck on them. i will always be the single one out, and always overlooked. i improve my looks, i always had a good personality, ppl told me im funny, and im mature enough, that they can vent to me and i wouldn’t tell nobody, or listen. last time i had a relationship was in 7th-8th grade which is sad. i almost lost my virginity but she changed her mind at the last second, because she didn’t want to get my friend bed wet. i had one chance in the world to at least loose, and blew it. i’m not getting no more chances. yea"

I didn’t know him well, but from seeing him around the neighborhood, I could tell he was a lost soul. A nice enough kid, but lost. 

Looking back, I wish I would have gone out of my way to say hello when I encountered him on a walk.  I wish I could have asked him how he was doing. I wish I could have told him his life mattered. 

I just wanted to tell you, you reading this right now, that your life matters. You deserve more than just a mournful stranger  telling you this, but please take this as your sign to be strong. You are needed, you are loved, you are worthy. Your life matters.

Please be kind to those your come across today and everyday. Talk a walk outside and smell the fresh air. Above all else, know that you matter.

I know how to be a friend. I know what loyalty is. What listening is. Being there for people in need at when they are at their lowest. 

I am the person that people ""tell"" things to...

I think it's those last 2 sentences,  really, that get people. 

For some reason,  after people vent to me and I help pick them back up and their lives start to turn around again,  it's like they feel embarrassed that I know their dark times...or perhaps they associate me with their bad times? 

Idk? 

Whatever it is, I know that I don't fit in well with cliques...I don't tolerate them, and that could also be the problem? I don't conform well and have never tolerated the ""mean girl"" spirit? 

I guess I am having problems because the 2nd person in the last 6 months has gotten married and I found out through Facebook. It's so, so sad.  

I found out, through a former coworker that another person I used to think of as a good friend was fired (she cut me out of her life when I quit, I told her I thought she was going to get fired and to protect herself and try to get ahead of it...we were in a very toxic work environment...but she just thought I was lying. I thought she, too would reach out to me later, but she didn't. She blames me for getting fired, I guess.). 

I just feel so sad, heartbroken, and lonely. 

I do have a few friends. They are good ones. I guess I just thought I would have more? Idk. 

Thanks for reading my disjointed thoughts. 

Keep fighting the good fight. 

Wishing you all peace."
lonely,"Cut ties with a ""friend"" this afternoon and now I feel completely numb","Cut ties with a ""friend"" this afternoon and now I feel completely numb - I haven't felt this lonely in a long time. No matter how hard I try, I only seem to attract people who would pretend to be my friend cz they needed something from me or abandon me when they see that they can't get anything from me. I never really had a true friend who cared about me in any real way and there's a significant chance that I will never find anybody like that. I have always overextended myself to my ""friends"" when they needed emotional support and even financial support at times even though I was in need of it myself. And all I ever received in return was abandonment, deceit and lies about how they value our friendship even though they leave within months.

Idk why I have given myself a decade of lifespan from now. I will never find anybody who cares about me. Hell, people put there don't care about the people in this sub, I'm no exception. There is no version of future where I find people who genuinely care about me just like all the other people in the world that pass away without anybody caring. So why am I prolonging my suffering for another 10 years? I truly don't know... I'm lost af rn. Everything seems meaningless, because it is."

I have grown so accustomed to the isolation that I’m not sure if I enjoy it or if I’m just too anxious to try and make any kind of new connections. I haven’t been in a relationship for almost 2 years (I know this isn’t crazy, but still sucks) and I haven’t made any new friends or even acquaintances since then either. When will I feel normal? Does anyone have ideas for meeting people during Covid?"

22M. Virgin but throw sex out the window I just wanna be loved, everywhere I go I look for potential love (like “ah I’d date her” type shet) wether it be work, groceries, coffee, walking in the park, etc.. but the constant daydreaming of affection impedes on me focusing on myself to an extent.. as well as simple chores around my apartment and other priorities. I’ll sit and try to enjoy myself otherwise like video games, painting, getting out and walking, driving and taking photos but none of it is fulfilling. Maybe it’s the confidence and feeling of value it brings that I can’t manifest on my own- maybe that’s why I wish I weren’t alone? Talking to therapist this week and this will be in our conversations but if there’s anyone who can relate and give pointers on the situation, that’d be much appreciated

Peace to y’all"

lonely,(17F) stereotypical out of control teen lmao,"(17F) stereotypical out of control teen lmao - I've always been incredibly developmentally behind compared to my peers. My family tends to gawk at me like I am some sort of freakshow attraction. No one really knows what to do with me. Like, at all.

I don't drive, I don't have a job, I dropped out of high school, I never sleep, and I never eat. (My mother has to call me from work and remind me to eat so my anorexic ass doesn't ""forget"" again)

My father and I HATE each other and he hasn't talked to me since I dropped out. He literally told my mom ""She's your problem now."" I am an only child, so there was a fair amount of pressure on me to succeed and I understand that, but I just wish people would stop and think about how much guilt and shame I already feel. If I had a daughter like me, I think I'd hate her too.

I don't really know what to do with myself. I literally lock myself in my room for days at a time because I feel as if I don't deserve to exist."

We were planning a date but lockdown kept complicating things, but finally we had decided to make plans for this weekend.

We also talked pretty openly about sex and because I don't want to lie I told them that I'm a virgin, they were really sweet and reassuring about it but after a few days they asked if we could just be friends because they're not entirely comfortable being with someone as inexperienced as me.

I can't even blame them, they did nothing wrong here, I'm sure they're happy to be way past this stage of their life, but much like when searching for your first job; if I need experience to get experience...how am I ever going to get experience?

lonely,My relationship with fictional characters has destroyed any hope of a real social life for me.,"My relationship with fictional characters has destroyed any hope of a real social life for me. - Where to begin. I guess the basics right? Get all that info out of the way.

25 F
CPTSD, mixed bipolar, ADHD (relevant as to how I deal with my problems.)
Lonely AF (duh.)

Ever since I was in middle school, I would hyperfixate on certain characters of a book, movie, show (anime mostly), or video game (my main medium), and become utterly obsessed with them.
I would even print out tons of pictures and clip them out and stuff them into the fronts and backs on my school binders so I could admire them while I went to class.
I started having folders on my PC dedicated to certain shows and games that contain fan art and some official art if there was any. 

In college I was diagnosed with ADHD, which makes sense as to me being fully invested in some things, and then the next week dropping it for something completely new.
Eventually I got a CPTSD and mixed bipolar diagnosis, which you know, is so fun!
Makes relationships (friends and dating) even harder when you’re so all over the place and essentially unreliable and give everyone mental whiplash.

So I’ve always dipped away into a fantasy world, with my characters. I’d read fan fictions of “reader x (insert character here)”, I’d make up my own scenarios in my head, sometimes I’d draw them myself. I’d imagine what life would be like with them around.

I’ve dabbled in many fandoms.
In middle school it was Naruto and Hellsing (Alucard is…amazing)
High school was Attack on Titan (Levi was my muse)
And after was Undertale (Sans helped me through physical and emotional abuse.)
I even bought a jacket back then that was like Sans’ and would wear it as if he had let me borrow it for comfort.

I also have a lot of fictional lovers from League of legends, and I love Glaz from R6, and right now I’m hyper focused on William Afton from FNAF (I have no idea why, but he’s living rent free in my head. I especially love the graphic novel and Noisx’s fanart of him.)

I’m incredibly depressed and unsatisfied with my life, and I know that has a part to play in it for sure. But I’m so crestfallen that these characters will never be real.
I’ll never meet anyone that looks like them, or acts like them. 

I’ve been trying to get over my agoraphobia and work on eventually meeting new friends via bumble, but I hate it. 
I hate that I can’t even pretend to be interested in talking to any of these people.
Like random NPC’s that have no side quests for you. What’s the point in talking to them? I try to play League with them at first, hoping to get to know them, maybe they’ll be interesting!
No.
They’re not. 
Because they’re not them. They’re not Alucard, they’re not William Afton, they’re not Glaz, they’re not Heisenberg (RE8, not Breaking Bad), they’re not Levi, or Sephiroth, or Illidan.
It makes me so angry with myself.
How fucking pathetic that me, a 25 year old who has no issue hooking in guys, refuses relationships because they aren’t a fictional character.

I simultaneously want to break something and cry at how much of an issue this is for me.
I don’t know if anyone can relate, but if you can, you’re not alone. If you can’t, take some solace in knowing that at least you’re not as deluded as I am.

Rant over."

I’m thankful for them but I know they won’t stick around for long. I’m sick of myself and I only have one solution.

I’ve recently come across the attachment style test and the result was that I’m the fearful-avoidant type, which is the least common type. I also learned that these attachment styles are almost impossible to change since they’re developed at the age of 1-3(?), I believe. I saw the characteristics and every one of them define me. I feel uncomfortable when someones too distant, yet too close to me. I’m most satisfied when I’m in an ambiguous type of relationship, not too close and not too far.

I have become distant with all my friends because I have always felt like they’re not close to me but they acted like they were, which I’ve come to think of it, they were pretty close to me. I think I just wanted to deny that, I really don’t know. 

I’ve spent the past few years questioning my sanity everyday. I thought I was wise and being enlightened. But the truth was, I’m just as insane as my mother.

You know how some people are just NOT meant for something? Well, this is my one and only answer and solution. I’m just not meant for life. Living does not suit me. I guess maybe this is natural selection at work. I’m not compatible with human life and will be eliminated. And I have accepted that. I don’t expect to be remembered, this is how life works."

lonely,That feeling in my chest,"That feeling in my chest - It hurts and feels like my lifespan is being shaven off in real-time. All the crippling loneliness, the questions, the anxieties, the regrets, the emptiness... why is my human experience like this? Why do I wake up at all? What am I fighting for? Who am I? I feel like I've been in limbo for too long and lost my sense of self. My mind is my own echo chamber where I'm disconnected from reality and people. 

I highly want to connect and be in sync with another person. I want to feel good about myself and the world I'm in. I want to have the confidence to *exist*. But all I can do is shout in silence and hope someone hears my echos, and then die a little bit more when no one hears the things I've never said."
lonely,Nothing is going right,"Nothing is going right - When everything in your life snowballs out of control and nothing is going right...

When everything you're trying to do to get money so you can save up, divorce, and start over keeps getting cancelled or prevented and you feel trapped like you are in a form of hell...

And everything keeps getting reset. You keep finding yourself back at zero.

What do you do?
I've had thoughts of suicide many times and I don't want to leave my child behind without a parent. I don't want to hurt my child. I also know I feel like I can't go on anymore. I've been on this cycle for over a decade.

If you were in my situation, what would you do?"

I know it's impossible... But that doesn't stop me from wanting something that simply just **CAN'T** happen. I wrote a letter to someone that was really important to me and I think posting it here would be a catharsis... Or it'll do nothing and I'll just look like a dumbass for it.



""It's been years since you and I last spoke. You've moved on, and judging by the last few pictures I saw of you with someone new, it's clear you're happy. I hope you still are. At least one of us is in the end. 



I never intended for this to happen, y'know. I never wanted to move on -- and even when 'I did,' here I am... Still thinking of you. Still hoping one day you'll return and fall back in love. Wishful thinking, I know. When we knew each other, I don't think I was mature enough to understand what we had. I wasn't ready for that kind of responsibility, being with a girl that was... Well... You. You were **everything** to me. My best friend, my love... There are no words in the English language that can properly encapsulate the amount of passionate, intense love I had for you. We spent every waking minute 'together,' despite living states apart. I didn't mind. To me it was like you were always right beside me...



I never cried when you left. I wish I did. I wish I still had tears to cry. Nowadays people come in and leave my life like passing ships, gone in a season and never to be heard from again. You were my safe harbor where I could find sanctuary from the storm that is this wretched life. I had no idea what lonely, cold world I was being cast into after we stopped talking. You were safety. You were peace. It didn't matter what problems I had in the world, no matter how petty they were at the time. I could talk to you and everything would be okay. I could take on the fuckin world with nothing but bare knuckles and with you as the wind beneath my wings... I'd do it. I'd win with a big, toothless smile knowing I had you in my corner. I'd be toothless because, well, there are **A LOT** of people stronger than I am in this world. 


But with you, I was Samson... And all my problems were but ants at my feet. Thank you for giving me such a wonderful reprieve from the stresses of life. Thank you for making me feel like I meant something to someone.


I hope we can meet again, someday... """

lonely,(23M) Struggling with rejection.,"(23M) Struggling with rejection. - I have never felt feelings so intense before I met this girl. When she laughs I could feel electricity shoot through my entire body. When she would stand close to me I could feel my heart racing and burning within me. The way she smiles from ear to ear when she laughs. That hearty and genuine laugh. Those soul piercing, beautiful, blueish green eyes. Those perfectly straight teeth. 

The way she moves her body when she giggles. I could actually feel butterflies with this girl. Is that weird for a guy to have butterflies over a girl? Lol. I just felt such a strong connection to her, so intense. When she texted me and lit up my phone my heart literally did backflips inside my chest and my stomach would feel hot. I really liked her quite intensely. She has been in every single one of my thoughts since I met her. 

I can not get her out of my mind. It does not matter how much I try. I am constantly replaying interactions we've had, conversations we've had, analyzing and overthinking them over and over again in my head. What if? What could have been? I can not escape the what ifs or what could have beens.

She is an () co-worker that I fell for. She would initiate conversation with me from time to time. She has lots of guy friends; so I was worried and intimidated because I really liked this girl. I was basically scared of all the male attention she was getting, so I told her I had feelings her and wanted more than friends. I was hoping this would ease my fears of her guy friends and male attention. She said we didn't know each other that well, and basically gave me the cold shoulder. Which is understandable, it was too soon. I was just scared to lose her, and wanted to stick out amongst her guy friends. 

I am living in so much regret right now. The regret is unbearable. I am just burdened by thoughts of suicide. I brought this pain on myself, and lost what I wanted the most. Which was her. I just want the pain to go away. I don't know how much more of this regret and replaying these scenarios I can take. I really thought she was highly interested in me, so I opened up my heart nice and wide, and got hurt, and hurt bad. 

I left my heart completely and entirely unguarded and vulnerable to this girl, hoping that would make her like me, and it failed. I quite literally just want to die, honestly. I don't believe in love anymore. I will never experience it, if it does exist. I hate my body. I hate myself. I hate my childhood upbringing. I have terrible anxiety which makes it nearly impossible to make new friends. I guess you could say this girl was my only ever emotional support. She's blocked me on all social media now, because I was a total beta male, desperate, creep, weirdo. Instead of the confident alpha that makes her laugh, doesn't get intimidated by guy friends or male attention, and takes things slow and gradual, getting to know her as a person more. I will never experience love. I just want to take my mind completely off girls, love, and relationships, period. But it's hardwired in my fucking DNA to want intimacy with a beautiful girl. Ehh.

TL;DR: The one that got away..."
lonely,Loneliness,"Loneliness - I’ve been lonely for a while. But lately in the past month or so, especially the last couple of weeks, it has been hitting me hard. And I know the holidays/this time of year can be hard for a lot of people and they struggle with the same feelings of loneliness that I’m feeling now, but for me personally I’m really struggling. I don’t have many people that I can talk to, which is why I’m posting on here, yes under a throwaway account. I had a conversation recently with someone in my life about loneliness and it just didn’t have the outcome that I wanted it to have. I just wanted someone to be more empathetic to how I was feeling, to just listen. I didn’t go looking for advice or for them to change things, I just wanted comfort. And I didn’t get it. Not really. I mean I did feel better after we talked briefly but then other issues popped up and now they’re upset with me. And I get the reason they are upset, I honestly do, but I’m tired of being kicked when I’m already down. I know this is lacking context but I am just trying to vent. 

This just seems to happen a lot. I mean when I’ve had a bad day, they’ve had a worse one or they have more of a reason to be upset than I do. It is not only this person that does this, a few of my family members do as well when I finally open up to them because I am definitely more of a closed book. But that is from years of opening up and being told that people have it worse or that I’m upset over something that shouldn’t matter as much. The one person that would listen to my troubles without doing this isn’t in my life anymore. She passed away. And I miss her everyday. So much. 

It’s worth noting that I don’t have any friends near me that I can just take off and spend time with, everyone lives far away. I have a couple of people I talk to daily through text, scattered throughout the day but that’s getting where it is not enough anymore. It doesn’t help with the loneliness and they have their own lives to worry about and I just feel pathetic. 

The loneliness is crushing and I just want someone to help relieve the pressure.

He’s happy with her. I’ve dated other people after him. I just want my life to be a romance story. I live for love and companionship. Being alone doesn’t make me happy, I get depressed. I need someone to fixate on to be happy, yet I get horribly depressed as well. Honestly having someone by my side who I know likes me is just the thing I love. I have hobbies but I just don’t do them because they don’t bring me joy. I always find myself looking for someone after a break up after I swear I’ll be single for a while. Welp that never works out. None of my relationships ever work out. I feel like there is no point to life unless I “love” someone."
lonely,"I like a girl, which is also one of my few friends, but she likes someone else. What should I do?","I like a girl, which is also one of my few friends, but she likes someone else. What should I do? - So, there's a girl I like in my class and she's the first one I'm really comfortable with.

I've known her for almost 1.5 years now but, because of Covid, and because of my personality, I got to actually know her only in the past few months. Earlier, she was often the one to initiate conversation and, even though I like her, I still think I ""owe"" her something.

**I believe a strong friendship is the base to a genuine and durable relationship**, however, I've just learned from one of her friends that she likes another guy outside our class. Of course I respect her choices, but I know I will still have to spend a lot of time with her. We see each other almost every day, if not more. I don't really know what to do.

I don't know what to do because it seems impossible to like someone else as much as I like her; **big part of my mood used to depend on how well our friendship was going, and now I feel so hollow.**

Also, the fact that I didn't know about this until someone else told me has been disheartening, as I realized that I know very little about relationships. In fact, I don't think I have many friends left, other than her.

She probably doesn't know her friend told me; although I've seen some signs, I don't know if she likes me too. Actually, I don't even know if someone can like more people at the same time.

What am I supposed to do? 

* Should I let go everything and pretty much start developing a new mindset that distinguishes friendship from relationship, well knowing I will have to spend a lot of time with her, while also struggling to pass all my classes? 
* Should I do nothing and hope things get better? 
* Should I go all-in and ask her out more often? 

Thanks in advance."

lonely,Do not lose hope,"Do not lose hope - Hi everyone,Just got in the subreddit because i was in the ""bad Mood"" and i was scrolling through the posts Reading them.
To be honest i am not even sure jf i Will end up posting this post,if you are Reading It Means that i choose to do so :)
So i was Reading a post that asked what was the point of  writing your thoughts on the internet like on this subreddit,I think the point Is that you can use this as a diary,but instead of being private Is public,you write your thoughts and you have an external feedback of people that actually understand you because they are in the same situation,and sometimes that ""same here""  or ""feel you"" can be what makes the difference. Don't get me wrong Is pointless to Just complain everyday of how everything Is bad expecting some changes in your life without you actually ever try to change something;but what i see here Is a lot of different posts that pretty much all tell the same things and i can relate to a lot of them and this somehow gives me Hope.In the end we are all humans and we all go through the same highs and lows in Life and sometimes when you are on your lows It might seem like you are the only One in the world because maybe at that specific time in your life you have no one to talk to and/or It May seem like everyone else's Life Is Great except yours,well spoiler,it's not,think about celebrities,singers,actors whose Life look perfect and Amazing and then One day they Say they have depression or worse they kill themselfs.
The strongest weapon we have as humans Is communication, if you think Is pointless because no One Is going to reach for you,well you might be right,but if you don't try,you'll never know.

And recently just coming out of a relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Now today, I wanted to just play games have a lazy no mind day right?

Till I realized, after all the time i've spent with the relationship and work... I don't really have anyone to play with or anything really. It all hit me like a train, that I have no one in my life. Not a friend, not even a friend to log on to my pc and be like lets go play, - no one. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I am someone who growing up always had friends, best friends, and so on. Especially online, like I use to run guilds on wow, clans on runescape, competitive teams on csgo...even for a short time, till drama ruined it, a fortnite discord with nearly 50 people who were all active and friends of mine. Fast forward now, I don't really play any of those games, I been on warzone and csgo mostly, and warzone has been crap lately and with no one to play with - even worse. csgo is just over played for me atleast, played with randoms all day and the days been dull.

&amp;#x200B;

Tried going out yesturday as I had some time to my self, and I had no one to call or text.

&amp;#x200B;

and it all feels very scary, because I never use to be this person. I hadn't noticed that I focused so much on my relationship with this girl, that I've lost everyone else in the background...."

lonely,Because of the internet…My Online Suicide note,"Because of the internet…My Online Suicide note - Idk where I’m going with this but bear with me


Because of the internet, I’ve been exposed to all kinds of people from the darkest to the brightest. Some who’ve led me out of the darkness and into the light, and some who’ve pulled me back in.

Because of the internet, my views on the world have changed. This is a place where your true personality shows and you get to have a little peak at how most people think.

Because of the internet, I’ve met people that I’d never have without it but here those same people are in a revolving door where you’re either Ghosted or you eventually just stop talking.

Because of the internet, I understand that it has brought us as people tougher just to separate us even further. 

So many people complaining about things that they could change but won’t and so many people upset at each other based on beliefs that were set in stone long before you and I existed. 

Because of the internet, I lost myself and fell into a deep depression. So many people are just here looking for something they can’t find in real life. 

The internet is a place where women have too many options and men have too much time. Love and lust are drugs you should try in real life. The experience that comes with them shape you into better people. 

This place, is very difficult from our world. Where it doesn’t matter who you are, you are accepted somewhere for a little while.

It’s a place where at any moment in time you can hit “New Game” and just like that you’re an entirely different person with new goals and a chance to correct past mistakes. 

Because of the internet, I’ll be deleting my social medias and do some living for once in my life.

Internet addiction is real when it’s all you have to turn to. I pray I return a better person than when I left."

I cried and cried and I'm still crying inside. No one loves me anymore. i wanna be held and cuddled by someone. It is not fair. I can't trust anyone. I want to comforted. I thought they loved me, but I guess not. I loved them. I think they blocked me but idk, hopefully not. I am so depressed, I can't describe the amount of pain and hurt I have currently. I am trying to not cry while writing this. I cannot move on from this. I can't get my mind off of them. I have no clue nor idea what to do. Why did they leave me? They said it wasn't my fault. Idk. I am so lonely and miserable. I want to cry in someone's arms and be held/cuddled. Someone, please. I am so sad. Please come back. I am waiting for you. Please."

lonely,I finally have a friend group but I still feel alone.,"I finally have a friend group but I still feel alone. - I feel like I'm only allowed around because I'm the one who always plans everything, but they always seem to enjoy each others company more than mine. Not only that, but I have feelings for one of them, and ever since I told her she has not wanted a one on one friendship with me at all. I feel like I ruined the little closeness I had with everyone, and my confidence is at an all time low. I wish I just had someone who was excited to talk to me. I wish I was the kind of person where I could be in love with my best friend. I dont know who to talk to about this because none of them really want to hear it. Life has been hard for me. I just want this."
lonely,How do you know if you’re a bad or a good person?,"How do you know if you’re a bad or a good person? - I felt like I was a good person. I helped others, volunteered and went out of my way to help those around me even if I suffered. I have couple people close to me who say I’m good and I know for sure they are good because they do the same thing I do. They go out of their way to help but I’ve had people in the past and now saying that I’m a terrible person. That my personality is rotten. My husband tells me it isn’t my fault that people see me and blame me immediately for their downfall just because I’m there but I’ve been constantly pushed at saying that I’m the villain, that I’m even manipulating my husband. I’ve thought and thought about this. I stayed away from people because I was afraid. I would stay out others way and try to be less bothersome as I could. It worked for a little but I started to get really depressed. Even suicidal. I stood up for myself once because I was tired of it, saying only “no I did not” but that caused problems. Instead of me saying sorry and putting the blame on myself I stood up but now they are trying to talk to my husband saying I’m toxic. The thing is I would brush it off like the first time it happened but this happened before. And now I’m really contemplating if I really am just as evil as others say."
lonely,Poem by Charles Bukowski,"Poem by Charles Bukowski - there is a loneliness in this world so great
that you can see it in the slow movement of
the hands of a clock.

people so tired
mutilated
either by love or no love.

people just are not good to each other
one on one.

the rich are not good to the rich
the poor are not good to the poor.

we are afraid.

our educational system tells us
that we can all be
big-ass winners.

it hasn't told us
about the gutters
or the suicides.

or the terror of one person
aching in one place
alone

untouched
unspoken to

watering a plant."

This was definitely one of the causes for my depression. I try my best to find a group, but it hasn't worked so far. I have had friends (singular) here and there, and have no problem talking with others. But I am definitely not anyone's first priority. It's always me asking them out for hangouts and stuff. I feel like I missed my chance during my teenage years to make lifelong friends, back when everyone didn't have much responsibilities and were care free. Anyone else have a similar experience?"

Now won’t communicate at all. Kept giving me hope up until the last thing she texted me. 

Now I’m stuck in the pit deeper than I’ve ever been and it hurts, it hurts so bad, all the time. What do I do? I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety and abysmal self-worth and now I feel all of those more than ever."
lonely,My experiences as a lone wolf among people,"My experiences as a lone wolf among people - So I have something to share with everyone who is lonely and would like to meet new people and make new friends and just wish for to be a part of a tribe or a group. 

The thing is, when I lived in my home country I had those wishes because I was lonely AF. I remember the pain of feeling excluded, forgotten etc. And then I decided to move to another country for a gap year. I ended up in a collective with people around me all the time. I would go here and there and meet lots of new people and make a lot of new ""friends"". However, something struck me when I realized that all those interactions were in fact draining me. Why? Because I was constantly trying to be someone else and holding a facade. And you wanna know why? It's because I have a bad relationship with myself.

That hole you're feeling when you're lonely and forgotten comes from the fact that you don't really love yourself and search for that in others. But the thing is, that nobody can fulfill that hole. Nobody. We form connections when we're willing to take off our mask and show people who we really are. And when you accept yourself, people will accept you, and the connections will form naturally. 

TL;DR

If you feel lonely and wish for company, be in a good relationship with yourself first, or else those ""connections"" will be fake and draining, and will just be a waste of time."

I didn't have friends in high school, and after becoming ex-muslim I don't feel like I belong with my family either. After that I started college, which was all online, just stuck in my room doing all the work assigned to me. 

This feeling, it's like grown over the years; I don't know who I am, I don't have any hobbies, I don't have any interests, I try to make myself be something but realise I have no motivation. I have a dissatisfaction but I don't even know what I want. It just feels I have no identity.

 Standard as I knew teachers of my school way before , a new girl came to my school , she needed some help with her studies so we used to talk daily .I thought we were really good friends but she never called once after her course was finished.

Loneliness is so comfortable, it's familiar. I don't even know how to function around people anymore. I feel disconnected from people. 

I don't think I even want friends anymore. Just someone who understands me and who I can share a connection with. A soulmate, how childish that may sound. I'm ashamed of that, but it's thanks to these years of isolation ig. 

I wonder if any of you relate to this."

I've never ghosted anyone before, worst i ever did was reply late because i'm too depressed/busy, i do think ghosting anyone is among the worst thing you can do to a person in a conversation.

Even if you insult them, that means you're at least giving them some of your time, ghosting just means you don't even think they're worth a minute of saying ""hi"" back."

lonely,32[M4F] Nebraska/Anywhere A friend for the humdrum blues,"32[M4F] Nebraska/Anywhere A friend for the humdrum blues - Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for developing friendships these days. But I'm finished with the semester and officially on break from both work and school until the 26th!  ( Just one left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the new year! 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. I'm currently working on 4 papers for finals week. It would be great to find some good company. 


Hope to hear from you!"

lonely,I'll never know what's wrong with me,"I'll never know what's wrong with me - Anywhere I go, I'll always be an outsider.  No matter what I try to change about myself, it's never enough to really fix things.  Maybe I can pull things off well enough to have some semblance of a normal social life, but it will always just be a pale imitation of the real thing.  If I try to ask people what's wrong with me, I get a different answer every time.  Every time I think I fixed the problem, it turns out it was something else.  There's no trick or secret to being accepted, it's just something I'm not meant to understand."

I text friends here and there but they aren’t really friends. I hung out today with some old high school buddies and it really wasn’t a good time but I’m sure that’s mostly my own fault. 

If anyone is interested in an anonymous friend It would make me pretty happy, im 20 m and I would prefer to make some guy friends, but I’m pretty desperate and would love a message from anyone right now."

So yeah, anybody want to talk? Not looking for someone to vent to, for any romance, or for anything sexual. I just really need someone to talk to right now to lessen the loneliness."

lonely,Trading everything for pain of regret.,"Trading everything for pain of regret. - As a preface, this maybe a controversial post because I had an affair. I don’t want the discussion to be about how terrible of a person I am. I already know. 

I was married for five years and was surrounded by friends with deep connections. My marriage was failing the last two years. I am going to identify the pitfalls I was unaware I could fall into but I am not making any excuses for my actions. The blame is my own. 

My ex wife had no interest in me in any way. Not physically, emotionally, nor about anything I had a passion for. I wanted to be a part of the things she had passion for but would all have an excuse why I couldn’t be a part of it. I felt unwanted. It is a very lonely feeling to be with someone that doesn’t want to be with you. 

I didn’t know just how unwanted I felt until someone else showed interest in me. She was just a friend at first and it was a slow burn. I never intended it to become the affair it became. I remember it starting to cross the line from friends to more than friends and told her we should stop talking to eachother. That only lasted a month. I was intoxicated by that feeling being understood, of being myself and someone liking me for me. It was more than just that. I was in love with the woman she was. I admired so much about her. 

From there it went into the territory of an emotional affair for 3 months and then I asked my wife for a divorce. Immediately after the separation the affair became physical. This went on for a couple of months and as much as this conflicts me to say it, they were the best moments of my entire life. But the guilt of having an affair was building and it broke me. 

I ended that relationship out of guilt and confessed everything to my ex wife. I asked to work it out and for marriage counseling and she wanted the divorce. What followed was the darkest two years of my life. Right after I went through the divorce, I started a new career and moved 700 miles away. I was trying to run away from my guilt, my shame and myself. I lost all of my close friends because of the affair and rightfully so. Actions have consequences. I lost my support network. I moved away from my family. I was all alone in everything. 

I feel deep into depression and told myself I deserve nothing good in life. I couldn’t sleep because of the pain of regret. Selfishly, I went through one relationship after the other despite knowing I wasn’t in an emotionally stable place. I needed to know I could still be loved. That I was worthy of it. Almost all of those relationships ended in tears because I had an intensity that I wanted out of it early in the relationships. Over-committing too early. (Those that are in the dating world, this should be a red flag). Then I would leave the relationship because it wasn’t actually what I was looking for. I wanted what I had with my affair partner. Someone who knew me at an incredible level. Someone who loved me for me. I found a new reason to hate myself. I didn’t want to hurt anyone. There is just a massive void I was selfishly trying to fill in the wrong was. 

I knew I needed therapy when my thoughts started going dark. I would have these suicidal fantasies about my sacrificing my life to save a stranger. That way it would give my life meaning, stop the my pain, and lessen the pain of my family members that care about me. 

6 months of therapy brought me out of that hole and repaired my sense of self. It has been 3 years to the day since the affair started and I finally stopped hating myself. But the pain of this loneliness will not go away. 

The fucked part about all of this is I never stopped loving the woman of with I had an affair. I broke her heart when I left out of guilt and she moved on and is in a happy relationship. I never moved on. I had to delete her number from my phone to rid the temptations of reaching out and telling her I’m still in love with her. I don’t dare do an action that is akin to cheating. I want no part of that. It destroyed me. I feel like I’m frozen in time. Unable to move forward. Unable to move backwards and the only close relationship I have, is my loneliness."
lonely,Birthday,"Birthday - So today was my birthday. Last night I went out with my friends for drinks and today I hung out with my family. All and all it was good. But, I still feel lonely. To be more specific, I feel lonely because I don't have a girlfriend to share it with. Part of the reason why I don't look forward to my birthday is because it's just a reminder of another year of being alone again no matter what I do. I know I should be happy, and needing to be with someone shouldn't make you happy, but I can't help but feel this way."
lonely,18th birthday soon,"18th birthday soon - My 18th birthday is coming up next week and I have absolutely no plans whatsoever

I wish I could make friends but I can’t find anyone my age who shares the same hobbies or interests, I’ve tried to spend more time with certain cliques but when I’ve added all I can to the conversation it gets really awkward. 

The stress of exams plus the fear of leaving childhood behind plus not even knowing what I want from life has really been digging into me recently."

lonely,I’ve felt lonely lately but…,"I’ve felt lonely lately but… - When I go places and socialize with people I just don’t enjoy myself. 

I find everyone so boring. 

I want a social life and more friends and a woman.

I just don’t enjoy socializing at all. I don’t really like small talk and I don’t like sitting around chatting with a group of people. Maybe because I have nothing in common with most of them. 

It’s sad, I know I am lonely and I don’t wAnt to be, but the things people do when socializing just don’t interest me. I don’t like board games or talking about the weather, or drinking, or sports. 

I realize now I’m lonely not for lack of having social groups but for lack of being able to enjoy them. Or perhaps I just don’t know anyone else with the same interests. 

I just want to find a nice introverted lady to join me in my seclusion. But I need to be social to find her. 

Anyone relate to this? 

I think I’m doomed lol

lonely,What’s the point…,"What’s the point… - …of even posting in such subs? 

Is it to seek advice? 

Is it to seek help? 

You make a post explaining how lonely you are, how no one likes you, how hard you have it etc. And what do you get? Couple of upvotes, couple of comments giving you mediocre useless advice, couple of “same here” comments etc. And basically nothing changes, your life continues to remain the same way as it was before you made the post. Or at least this is maybe just my experience who knows…. 

I’ve come to such subreddits time and time again posting the same exact stories over and over again, got the same types of comments, a few upvotes and in the end nothing changed. It’s a vicious cycle.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s totally fine to vent out your frustrations or to try to find your way out of loneliness. I just feel sorry for all you folks here including myself, the fact that people even post here is sad in itself. I hope things get better for me and everybody else here… just wanted to share my thoughts about this as a whole that’s all."
lonely,I have social anxiety and i have 0 friends,"I have social anxiety and i have 0 friends - I finally could step over my shadow and this is what happened

I immigrated to Turkey when i was 14 , I’m 20 now but i have social anxiety and being in another country trying to talk in their language is hardest thing ever. 
Basically I didn’t have any friends in high school because i was bullied all the time and everyone was so racist to me .
Now as I started college i want to improve myself and step out of my comfort zone and actually make some friends.
Last week i was sitting in cafe and i saw some group of my classmates sitting and they were laughing together I thought to myself I really wanna be friends with them why should I always be alone 
And i went there and I started talking with them about school and classes and they couldn’t speak English really well so they said me they really need me to be their friends because they will move to the US and they can’t speak English 
And I promised them i will teach them 
So they made a WhatsApp group that we can practice english they told me that they are really happy that they meet me and everything they said that they will be always there for me 
And it was the first time in my life that I didn’t feel lonely 
They told me that we should hang out 
I was so exited about it like it was too good to be true , everyone else used to make fun of me and being racist to me

After our final exam was over they started to get abit cold like as i asked them how are they doing they didn’t even answer I thought they are busy 
I texted one of the girls in the group and she said I’m sorry i was out that’s why I couldn’t answer 
And then she posted a picture on Instagram as they were all together having fun without me 
I feel lonelier than ever :("

Like I'm the biggest hypocrite in the world. I flip flop between trying to live a right life and falling into sexual sin over and over. I feel like no one really understands me because of this. I Feel like if I do open up to someone, either they don't understand where I'm coming from, or they try to change me (one way or another). 

I'm sick of it, I Just want to be accepted, not have to hide my struggles, and be real with people. Apparently thats to much to ask."

lonely,Needed to share this somewhere,"Needed to share this somewhere - I’ve had some close friends before in my life. Not many, but a couple people I could be my unaltered, true self around. It wasn’t easy making friends growing up. Being a shy and introverted individual paired with a growing presence of depression and anxiety made it tough to meet new people and develop the necessary social skills in high school. I was able to meet a couple people who accepted me for who I was and eventually developed some very meaningful friendships. 

After I graduated, life took me in a different direction and those friendships grew distant. My friends move away to other states/countries and I lost touch with most of them. Now I’m here two years later at 20 years old with nobody I can talk to or spend time with. No one I can joke around and laugh with. I try to be content with it and focus on myself but loneliness tends to get the better of me. I don’t know how to meet new people. I worry that it won’t be possible again. I reside in my head, swimming in circles with my thoughts day after day. I feel trapped in this cycle that I desperately want to break. This feeling makes me doubt my own self worth. I can’t stand living in my head 24/7, lately it’s been driving me insane.

Does anyone start questioning themselves if no one really likes you? You're just too weird, unresponsive, etc etc. I know these thoughts can be a by product of depression too. The more isolated I get, with these thoughts  I'm becoming socially awkward when I go out by myself these days. I used to go to the pub for a meal, workout classes etc.

I get alot of positive feedback from friends/coworkers. But I've been feeling ignored as of late. Maybe with the holidays ppl are focused on their own stuff. But I am sick of asking how ppl are doing, what's new. And I don't get it return. I get updates to their life, and that's it. I get random txts from friends about whatever is going on with them, with no reciprocation, rinse and repeat. One of my closest friendships is failing due to opposite views on covid. Being single is a challenge, online dating is such a toxic place, filled with the horniest of ppl.

I just dont want to waste any more time or energy on people who don't seem to care. Friends or potential dates. But I can't help but question, maybe its me. I do my best not to unload my problems onto people, and be receptive."

I have a boyfriend who I love, but he has tons of friends and a great social life, it makes me feel like a burden. When he’s not with me, I feel like he hates me because he doesn’t want to be around me. I know it’s just in my head because I have no one to hang out with, but it’s hard to get out of that mindset in the moment. I recently cut ties with my toxic best friend, and before that, cut ties with another toxic best friend. I have a tendency to hold onto one person who isn’t good for me, but don’t detach myself due to fear of loneliness. I grew up moving around a lot and never had a solid foundation of childhood friends, so everyone I know from my younger years are kind of gone. I never had the chance to develop my personality with a group of people, making it feel like I won’t be able to get along with anybody because of my specified taste in humor/personality.  I don’t want to force friendships with people Im acquainted with because I’m so lonely. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I am getting a new job soon so hopefully that will open me up to the possibility of new friendships. I don’t know. I just don’t want to feel like the only people I have are my parents and boyfriend. It feels embarrassing and I’m emotionally drained. I also don’t really have a passion which bothers me. I always thought I knew what I wanted to do in life and I really don’t know. I’m so tired of this lost and lonely feeling. Does anyone have any advice?

lonely,Why do I always feel like I'm dying?,"Why do I always feel like I'm dying? - I don't know if it's something irrational or not, but I always feel like I'm dying (like physically or mentally hurting) or wanting to die. Whenever I go to bed, I feel like I'm falling into some abyss just waiting to hit the bottom. And I often randomly get light headed too. 

Loneliness could be the issue. But I'm never sure as to why I feel so lonely. I can't make irl friends, it seems like the most difficult, most daunting thing ever! And I don't even know the reason. I'm not the most introverted introvert, and my personality is (although nothing to marvel at) fine.

Sometimes I just feel like giving in to the suicidal thoughts. But at the same time, I feel like my life has just started (I'm just 14 years of age lol). I'm not sure if everybody that's my age has this kind of shit happening to them, but at the same time, I don't even want to know. 

What if this is normal? What if everyone goes through this? That means I'll have to deal with it and won't have a reason for giving up. 
What if it isn't? Then I'll feel guilty for what I've done to myself and I'll get even more unsure of my situations.

Now, I'll probably delete this post but if you have any advice, feel free to share it.

lonely,Paranoia interfering with my social life?,"Paranoia interfering with my social life? - First off I am a huge advocate for security and privacy especially in when on the internet or any terminal to be honest. I do my best to keep up with best practices and learn about how to properly manage burner accounts and ""disappear"". I'm not doing any illegal and frankly don't have anything to hide other than PII but I just don't like the idea of people I don't know taking a peek into my incredibly boring and mundane life. I also harbor a deep resentment of most people and just generally and genuinely distrust people as a whole. 

That aside I take many steps to ensure my privacy but in doing so I am starting to realize that I have a hard time making and maintaining  meaningful relationships. Not only romantic but also any sort of resemblance of friendships as well. I stay away from mainstream social media and when I do post online I use burner accounts. I do maintain a job but I also don't interact that much and really stay with the ""speak when spoken to"" mentality."" 

I just have no idea how to start making friends or even start a conversation. I'm nearing 30 years old and feel like I've isolated myself to the point of no return. I know I can't have it both ways in wanting to maintain my current level of anonymity and having a ""normal"" social life at the same time. I'm just not sure whats more important at this point.

lonely,All my friends are leaving me or leaving me out.,"All my friends are leaving me or leaving me out. - First time posting, apologies if this is not the correct sub.

I say friends, but in real life I don't have many. I have people who I talk to, I have people who I force a smile with, but the entire time I feel awkward and don't connect with them. I'm left out for a lot of group activities they do, not out of malice, but just because we're not that close. I get it and I don't fault them. But I'm sad because those are the closest friends I have. They're the only people I've managed to meet with even the slightest bit of connection. I always knew once I graduated highschool I'd probably never talk to them again save for our group chat. Out of the group the one I was closest with moved away, he was sort of like the middle man. Helped me feel connected to the group more. Now that he's gone what little connection I had is also gone. 

I made friends on discord last year, it was so awesome. I've felt closer to them then I did anyone else in my entire like (as in friends, obviously I'll always be connected to family!)... But then one of my friends got banned. They were kinda a weirdo and immature. I understand why they were banned. The energy of the server started to change after they were banned. But I enjoyed the change, I still made new friends. Now drama has happened, and it's left the server dead. All the people who kept the server alive are leaving because someone left before them ""Since X left the server I'm bored now so I'm leaving bye."" I became server owner, and I've been working hard to keep the server alive, but all for nothing. I truly worked hard and poured so many hours into making this the most welcoming and friendly community I could. I'm losing friends, and it's okay. I'm not angry at them, not trying to hold them hostage, but this was the first time I had made friends that felt real, even if it was a screen. Even when I tried to make online friends in the past, it didn't work out. 

I'm not one of those social media/internet addicts, I barely use social media as is. I'm fine with one day leaving the server if I need to. But then it'll just be the same way things always were. No friends in real life either. I try hard to make friends, but like I'm autistic. I can't talk to people, can't strike up a conversation. I have weird interests nobody my age likes, and I even feel like an alien in the autism community.

I just want a good friend. Why is it so hard?"

lonely,Nearly died 2 times now because of Nmom and I could say ANYTHING to her and her reaction doesn't change. at all and my N Dad wouldn't hesitate to backstab me for not being an underling,"Nearly died 2 times now because of Nmom and I could say ANYTHING to her and her reaction doesn't change. at all and my N Dad wouldn't hesitate to backstab me for not being an underling - basically as if it wasn't bad enough that I was suffering from several mental issues slowly killing me my mom has decided to make it her own personal duty to eliminate me as if the constant mental abuse and torture that i've been suffering from for 2 years now wasn't enough already.

Basically my mom's only good at one thing and it is to panic and start stressing out. No matter how little the situation she'll do that frightened face and start talking in that blood curling voice of extreme panic and make a small issue into something a LOT LOT WORSE.

yesterday I went out with her for a day out because I needed to get some things and here's what happened. 1 She basically stressed me out even before we got out of the house with her incessant whining. 2 over the course of the errand she was constantly talking about irrelevant things causing me to get severely distracted and hindering all my abilities, 3 She just kept asking me things or bringing up things I really don't want to hear basically she wanted to maximise the pressure applied on me. now she already made what could've been a fine day a stressfull nightmare but here's the cherry on the cake.

while we were in the metro I was completely exhausted from her and zoned out completely and paid no attention whatsoever as to where we were because I was trying to recollect my thoughts and just get a breather. When we reached the destination She knew we had reached the destinatiion but she was acting so uncertain and just caused a huge panic which basically caught me in a spin. Thanks to her I also got confused as shit and this ended in me getting slammed between the train doors. Thankfully the thing had a failsafe which basically saved me from extreme body harm but no thanks to her.

Now as if that wasn't  bad enough she's just asking ""are you okay?"" and unlike anyone with a slight respect for someone remaining silent she just kept pestering me all along the way about this and made this whole day a fucking nightmare.

Cherry on the cake though since that event all she's been thinking about is

""What would I have done

""I'm stressed from what happened

""what if something happened to you I would have died

""It made work harder

""i'm tired from work

&amp;#x200B;

ME ME ME ME URGHHHh!!!

After all this shit all she's been talking about is her and herself only today she nearly made me fall from a narrow stool because she was screaming and yelling about a bee because FUcK YEAH The bee is wayyyyy more dangerous than me falling from this height.

She started Whining and bla bla and I LITerALLY said everything I had to and it didn't even faze her she was just like yeah you suck and you're a bad kid because this this this, She just kept bringing up the past about how in her life AHHHHHHHH.

Fuck this shit.

Now it don't stop here. She mentioned about how in a previous incident where I yelled a slur at my N dad he IMMIDIATELY took opportunity of this to try and get my mother to do paperwork and get money on his name. 

because FUCK YEAH Your Kid is showing signs of deppresion and displaying a ton of red flags and just basically gave you a big sign that he needs help and the first thing you think of is let's fuck up his chance to get money.

I have nowhere and no one to run to  and i'm suffering.

someone please tell me some kind words rather than just ""I'm sorry that suck"""

I just want people I can talk to and hang out with. The older I get the harder it seems.

Nobody close understand me, and when I say that the loneliness is killing me little by little and I really need help they just block me... Even psychologist cancel my hours.. Three time before I give up... I just needed to write this"
lonely,Life Overseas,"Life Overseas - I (26F) moved to Melbourne in 2019 with my boyfriend back then as a healthy happy person. Thinking “yeeyy everything’s gonna be awesomme :3”. Then BAM you-know-what happened. Two and a half years passed, some days I couldn’t afford food cause I didn’t have work during lockdowns. Again in lockdown I couldn’t meet anyone, don’t have any friends. All I had was my boyfriend and the pretty little apartment that I lived with him. Lockdowns were finally over, I found a good job and I thought “everything’s gonna be awesome!!!!” Then BAM in only one week, I lost my job, my boyfriend and moved out of my apartment. I don’t have a single dollar in my pocket. I am so lonely it hurts to breathe. I don’t know how to cope with this. This is too much."

I finally decided to stop it and now I have nobody but myself.

I did enjoy making people laugh but now I’m much more reserved so I guess I’m gonna end up stuck by myself."

It’s more so that I really really want a relationship of some kind, a girlfriend would be ideal but I’d also be cool with something casual I think, I just never had any fun of that sorts. 

Problem is I feel really guilty about wanting that. I’m kinda used up, like a washed up has-bin. I let myself get used when I was a teenager in a way I can’t bring myself to describe but, well, I’m not really good enough for anyone normal or kind I reckon. 

I also hate that I end up having these, idk, depression episodes after using and failing at dating apps. Idk why I’m on there to begin with, I’m just wasting my own and others time."
lonely,Hey you! Mind taking a minute or so to read?,"Hey you! Mind taking a minute or so to read? - Cool, thanks. Well, allow me to introduce myself!

I'm Jo, from California; I’m a dad to a totally cute chonker cat named Junior. 

My time is usually divided between work, errands, and being home. I’m a bit of an ambivert, so while I do enjoy going out from time to time, I also very much cherish nights in (I can throw a mean shindig).

The purpose of this post is really just to find people to chat with. It’s a new year (i know some people like to bash on the idea of setting goals/aspirations just because its a new year), and I want to make some friends, maybe even something more.

However, I have little to no expectations here. Most Reddit conversations in the past have never really lasted more than a few days, or I run into total kooks. 

Here are some of my interests and other random factoids:

- tv shows &amp; movies (all kinds &amp; genres; actually just saw Alien vs. Predator tonight)
- listening to music &amp; curating playlists; I also very much enjoy singing/karaoke (not great at it, but singing is fun). I use both Spotify &amp; Apple Music. 
- playing video games on PC; I play all sorts of things but rn it's a rotation of: CoD Vanguard, Rocket League, Bloons TD6, Rage 2, Valorant, and Prince of Persia.
- streaming on Twitch (super small time but it's fun!)
- creating art; i dabble in sketching, painting, screen printing, and clay sculpting.
- weed; i understand people are torn on this one, so if you dislike people that smoke weed, or it's a deal breaker for you, then please feel free to move on, I wouldn’t want to waste your time.
- phone calls; i'm ok with texting when i can manage it, i use discord for the most part to communicate. i do enjoy phone calls if i feel you're cool enough, and it always beats having to physically text lol.

Anyway, idk if any of this tickles your fancy; feel free to message me if you'd like!"

No one really finds interest in me in the server I'm in. And I can't really get a group chat or a person to respond to my question or some post I sent them. - Not their fault, obviously. I mean I get it. M not tryn hard enough, I'm just expecting a little too much from people. Expecting people to just hover to me, have everyone come to me. 

But I dunno. Slightly upsetting. Not what I listed on particular, but just the fact that I'm not really living. Today my younger sibling went out with their boyfriend to the mall, and tomorrow they're going to meet them at the beach. Tomorrow my girlfriend is also gonna go to their friend's birthday party.

And I'm gonna stay home, again. With my mom. At 18 years old.

That's something that's okay for me to get kinda upset over right? Just, not really living? Or not being interesting enough? Not even really for my own girlfriend?

I mean no it's like completely understandable. I'm really not that interesting. I don't know what to talk about in conversations sometimes and I'm not all that fun. So I guess I get it."

lonely,I get jealous that my boyfriend has friends and I don't,"I get jealous that my boyfriend has friends and I don't - I spent most of my 20s having friendships with toxic people and last year I realized they were effecting my growth and cut ties. It's been peaceful and my mental health has improved greatly but I really miss having a friend. My boyfriend has multiple people he plays Xbox with and other friends he goes out and drinks with but I don't have anyone. I call my mom when I'm lonely but I just kinda feel like a loser. I'm self employed so I don't even have coworkers to talk to.

 I tried bumble BFF but it felt so cringy and I had no idea what to talk about. Most of the people on there talk about their businesses in their bio or how they love to travel and go clubbing or their kids and just overall stuff I can't really relate to. I'm a homebody. Sure I like to get out every once in a while but for the most part I'd rather just sit at home and drink a beer and watch TV. 

I don't want kids and that seems to be what every woman is about at my age which isolates me even more. I've been told to get a hobby but nothing really interests me. I don't really feel like I fit in at all with other people and my ADHD and BPD doesn't do me any favors in that regard. it just sucks. I wish I had atleast one close friend who I could hang out with."

lonely,It hurts that in US society people are so angry and judgmental of their own children.,"It hurts that in US society people are so angry and judgmental of their own children. - Over the last three months I have visited with my conservative father who lives alone, and my liberal mother who lives with her wife of 20 years. They got divorced 36 years ago.

Both wanted my company, but only on their terms. So long as I do what they want, the way they want, and discuss the things they believe in, they wanted me around.

They want me to be a carbon copy of them.

Both are also strong shutin introverts, while I am not, and they cannot grasp that. I am buying a sailboat to sail around the world, and both think that is lunacy. Neither is supportive of my choices.

This is part of why I'm leaving the USA, because this behavior isn't just unique to them, it's a level of judgmental dislike that pervades the entire nation."
lonely,I can't seem to relate to anybody in real life,"I can't seem to relate to anybody in real life - Finding people like me online is easy, especially since I can speak english and all (I'm french), it opens doors to new online friendships. But I wish I could find someone like me ***in real life***...

I've had many friends, and currently have just one, but barely any of them were really like me. I think the last time I had friends who really had things in common with me was like ten years ago. It's a bit depressing honestly.

I love my current friend but aside from our introversion and some surface-level stuff, we barely have anything in common. I had a (toxic) best friend a few years ago but even with her we didn't have much in common at all to the point that even our sense of humor was completely different.

Because of depression and other reasons I've been very isolated for the past few years, I haven't met/talked anyone new in real life since 2017, and even then it was a one-time conversation and we never saw each other again. I like being on my own most of the time so it's not too much of a problem most days, especially since I live with my family and have a good relationship with my parents - I'm not completely alone. But still, I wish I could talk to someone my age who really understands me and my hobbies and my taste in music (I love listening to music, it's practically my therapy lol).

Out of boredom earlier today, I looked up people I used to know in high school on Twitter, friends/acquaintances, even the ""mean girls"" because why not. Their sense of humor is so different, and the stuff they talk about, their music taste, their hobbies etc. it's all very mainstream. Nothing wrong with that at all, I like some mainstream stuff too but for the main part, what I like is - for a french person - kinda considered obscure or niche I guess. 

I don't like french music and couldn't care less about any french celebrity, influencer etc. as I'm more invested in american/british media. I like it that way but sometimes I realize that because I'm so detached from any french media (and have been since I was a preteen), it makes me also very ""detached"" from other people in real life especially those my age (early 20s). It doesn't help that I don't like alcohol... and that I'm LGBT. And I don't want to change myself, I just want to find someone with similar interests... maybe they're also hiding in their house like me and so we'll never meet. Lol.

It just gets so lonely, sometimes I daydream about leaving to a whole different place, but then again I think I'd still feel lonely and detached, just in a different way. Wish I could go out and at least try to meet new people in real life but because of Covid I can't (+ other complicated/boring reasons that I'm working on).

I'm just tired of it. I so wish I had a group of friends like I did in middle school, I was so happy then having them around. I felt like I belonged somewhere even if I was getting bullied at school, at least I had my friends. I keep hoping that someday I'll be able to have friends again, like friends who make me laugh back (I make others laugh easily but I haven't found someone who can legit make me laugh, it sucks), friends I can relate to and feel completely comfortable around... I know I'm capable of making friends, but then I have to not only wait until I can go out and meet people, but I also have to find someone who's genuine and shares some of the same interests I do. I feel like my chances to find someone like that are so slim and it makes me feel down.

I try to focus on my current goals, but still sometimes I just stop and feel the loneliness. I wish I had someone to tell about my successes, my failures, my deepest thoughts, someone I could share memes with, play cards with, watch TV with, cuddle with. I don't know, *something* that's more than just small talk, with someone I can actually relate to. Being alone is only fun for so long, you know? Even a depressed introvert like me needs to be social sometimes..."
lonely,Been quite loney lately. Another post inspired me to write my first poem,"Been quite loney lately. Another post inspired me to write my first poem - I'm not too creative but writing this made me feel a little better. Feel free to share if you've used writing to cope.

&amp;#x200B;

In a way unfulfilled, a spirit divide

Something the present does not provide

And so I muster, and stumble, and feel aside

But yet push on, and on, for a sliver of chance

That one day, a moment coming, rare as it be

Could manifest wholly and capture me

And an experience will pass, as they do

What's done is done, and again it's just you

Back to basics, as they say

So drop the expectations, and enjoy the stay"

Cos i have friends and i have family so shouldn't i be happy now? But yet i still get depressed and lonely. Im honestly just starting to feel like no amount of people surrounding me will ever actually make me happy or wanted. Its been hard this past year (2021) as i started uni and had to move out, away fromy friends and family. Though i was able to make some good new friends at university in the first couple weeks i just want more, like more friends, more people to talk to, more people who actually want to talk to me (since most of the time im the one who initially messages my friends). I also miss having online friends, its been a while since ive been able to make a good friend online, tho i think its probably my fault.

I might not be on the same level as everyone else here, but seeing as there's no real way to gauge how worse off someone else is compared to another person I'm gonna assume we're all in the same boat here and we're already well aware how this is all gonna go down in the end. If that's true, then uh.. I guess let's toast to... What do we toast to?



Last night I had a dream that I met someone. There was a whole backstory about her too, like she was British and I had to travel hours to see her. Needless to say it was a weird dream and I fuckin hate it when they happen... Why bait the hook if you can't even go fishing in the first place? 



I'm so sick of watching all these happy couples at work. I'm sick of being on reddit just to answer questions on /r/askreddit all day because that's all I can do with my spare time anymore. I just had to get rid of some toxic people in my life and now that I'm **officially** friendless, I don't know what to do with all this free time I have. What do normal people do? 



Shit I'd exercise all day if it wasn't for the sadness that ensues. It does a great job of killing your motivation, that's for damn sure 



I'd try to go back into the dating game but let's be honest, no girl wants a guy that's 5'3"" and is statically proven to be ugly time and time again. It would be an exercise in the most literal form of madness to keep trying for something when you already **know** what the outcome is"

lonely,32[M4F] Nebraska/Anywhere A friend for the humdrum blues,"32[M4F] Nebraska/Anywhere A friend for the humdrum blues - Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for developing friendships these days. But I'm finished with the semester and officially on break from both work and school until the 26th!  ( Just one left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the new year! 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. I'm currently working on 4 papers for finals week. It would be great to find some good company. 


Hope to hear from you!"

lonely,why did he do that to me?,"why did he do that to me? - when i(F18) was 16 i met a boy online. he was really nice to me and really easy to talk to. the longer we talked the more i thought he liked me. i thought he wanted to be my bf. after 7 months of talking i asked him why he kept leading me on and he gave me a plethora of excuses. “i want to be a better person for you”, “i’ve never really done this long distance thing”, etc. i blocked him after all of that but he contacted me again through a spam account i didn’t know about. i have him a chance to explain himself further and i believed him and unblocked him on everything and went back to this “talking stage”. i thought if i stayed, he would eventually be with me. 

He was constantly lying to me about everything. he always told me what i wanted to hear and gave me just the right amount of attention to string me along. he was so vulnerable around me that i thought he could never lie to me. recently i found out that almost the entire time he was stringing me along, he had a girlfriend. one he saw regularly. one he could be affectionate with. when i connected all of the dots i blocked him on everything. i’m not a confrontational person, so i haven’t had the guts to tell her. i want to really bad but i get filled with so much anxiety that i start to shake and cry.

I just want to know, after everything we’ve been through, after how much time we shared, after the things we told each other in confidence…why would he lie to me like that? i’ve never had anything close to a boyfriend. i went all my life without boys having crushes on me. i’ve never kissed anyone before. he was the closest thing i had to a relationship. what did i do to deserve being manipulated like that? how did he even know i was naïve or gullible enough to be lead on like that? what made me stand out? why did he think that i was the perfect victim? what did i do wrong that she did right? why did she get to be with him? why did i have to be “the other woman”? i have so many questions but i don’t have the courage to ask him for answers. all i wanted was to be a girl that a boy wanted to be with. why did he do that to me?"

I mainly stick to Reddit for porn because of my eye problems if anyone is wondering.

lonely,I don't understand what happened.,"I don't understand what happened. - I've been alone for years, not going out, not doing anything, just existing. I was totally fine with it. I have no clue what happened but the last 3-4 months have been extremely difficult with me. I miss connection. Incredibly touch-starved, I havent hugged another human being in god knows how long. I feel so, so, so, incredibly lonely, it makes me feel physically sick. I want to fucking die, jesus christ. It might be age, because my mental health is definitely deteriorating with age. I'm going to die alone and miserable.

I don't know why this has happened. It just fucking hurts so so much."

lonely,Who else is always feeling alone,"Who else is always feeling alone - 
 So lets start off by giving a summary of who I am.

\- I am 27 and graduated last month with my masters in chemistry

\- I have many interests, but my main hobby is gaming (video games, card game and looking to get into tabletop rpg games). Currently playing Destiny 2 a lot but open to suggestions (I may have the game and just don't know lol) and MTG commander is my go to for cards at the moment.

\- I am a kid at heart and still enjoys things like cartoons, animated movies and anime (although I haven't watch any new anime in a bit).

\- I am open to all genre of music although I find that rap and country are my least favorite and that 80-90 rock, alternative and metal are usually my go to's.

\- I am a hyper-sexual, demi-sexual who's love languages are quality time and physical touch.

\- I prefer open and honest communication in all aspects of a relationship rather than playing ""mind games"". I also do not party, drink alcohol or do drugs and will not participate in said activities (I have actually had people respond to my posts trying to convince me that everyone does these and that I can't find a partner if I don't).

\- Since this has come up a few times, I do eventually want to have biological children with my partner.

So with that covered, why am I here? I am looking to find a life partner. I always find that my ideal partner is also one of my closest friends, so starting as friends and seeing where it goes makes the most sense. So, if you are interested in getting to know each other and/or playing video games together then send me a message."

I couldn't develop any social skills for that reason and that's probably why I haven't felt the warmth of anyone so far in my life, apart from my family. I'm currently studying + working my ass of to become succesful and I frequently burn out. Especially in those times I wish so bad that I had someone to talk to. During my whole life, I was just a guy who is summoned when needed and I'm getting sick of it. Why I can't deserve the care of someone? Why in the fuck I'm still alone although I'm in a better situation than most of the people I know? Am I really supposed to live in the computer screen all day? I sometimes forget to even speak.

I don't want to think about these anymore. I see that a lot of people are in the same situation as I am but I can't move on from this. Even though sometimes I have very productive days, when it's night time, this shit drags me down. Why I don't have anyone to even hug?

So what is going to happen from now on? Nothing. I just shared my life/thoughts here and maybe some people might reply to it. But I'm so sick of it. I don't have anyone to talk about these..."

I maybe talk to them tops half an hour during the day as the work and go to bed almost as soon as they get home. Boyfriend is away  we have been together 9 years but this is the longest we have been apart. Because I not working I literally am speaking to no one during the day. I'm finding it really difficult being so alone and talking to no one. Doea anyone have any tips on how to function without any social interaction ? Even being so quiet all day is so unsettling. I dunno how long I am gonna be alone like this so I would really appreciate some advice.

lonely,Just need to speak a bit,"Just need to speak a bit - (Don't mind the grammar mistakes, my english isn't perfect) 

I just need to speak a bit. About 4 months ago, I joined high school, and of course with it came the stress of getting to a new place and having to meet new people. It was even harder since I really liked my old class, and none of them were in the same class as me. Now the thing is that, the new people in my class, they get along very well, and I, of course, don't (r/lonely what did you expect). I don't know why, but since summer holidays, I can't socialize, at all. Everytime everybody gathers up for doing something, I'm either not interested or just scared of something, yet probably nothing. It feels so wrong in this class, I feel like I'm the odd one out, and if it continues for 3 years, I might just drop off.

I'm on Holiday right now, and I just got home from a little party with the people of the older class, and just like I feared, I can't keep a conversation with them anymore. I knew I was an introvert, a big one for sure, but I can't even speak with the people I like? The only person I really talked to is my best friend (only friend) which was in the same class as me for the past 5 years, and he's about the same as me, expect that he never really liked the old class except for a few of them (not hating them, just being neutral). So I basically just sat on the stairs and looked at my phone while everybody was having fun.

I know that at my age, a lot will say it's a phase or something like that, but everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY I've known or know isn't as flawed as I am in socializing (except maybe for my friend).

TL;DR Got in a new class, can't speak to anybody, even to the people I like, and my one and only friend is as sad as me except he doesn't hide it. 

Does anybody know why can't I speak to people I like anymore? What can I do to fix it? Also, even if it may be useless to ask, any ideas of where I could potentially meet new people?"

lonely,I just want to share...,"I just want to share... - ... How lonely I feel.

I'm 30 years old man.

I look decent, I don't drink and I don't smoke.

I drive a taxi as a ""job"" even though I have other businesses so I'm well off financially.

The thing is I truly cannot experience love. I'm afraid to show emotions towards women, because every time I did that in the past with a girl I really liked... I was turned down.

The only girls that like me are the ones that I don't like back.

I look decent, I lost weight and all, I dress nice, I do all the ""improve yourself"" stuff,  but the results are absolutely the same as before.

Some girls in the taxi say I'm attractive, but I never push forward because I know in the times we live in I will probably get hurt. 

I feel so lonely at times that I think about ending it (even though I probably would never have the courage to do it). 

I'm afraid to be myself, because I have lots of flaws, I'm afraid to show them to other people. I always wear a mask, always wanting to be perceived as strong and so on. 

Deep down I hurt though... and I don't know what's the point anymore. Loneliness is killing me at times.

I did a lot in my life, I ""improved"" as much as I can at this point.

I don't know if I'm looking for advice, probably not. I just wanted to vent it, and to write it down."

lonely,"Openend up to my crush, yay ghosting","Openend up to my crush, yay ghosting - So we were in this semi-work situation for a  few months, we had great conversations, teasing, playfulness, we told each other a lot of very painful events of our lives, our fears, hopes and dreams. Her body language was very open towards me always. I escalated a bit as in I didn't completely fail to make it a bit flirty.

Wednesday was my last day in this ""job"" and I decided to ask her out. She rejected me, said she didn't have the time for a relationship, even though I know it to be BS. She was just too polite to tell me I'm too ugly for her I think. So I half expected it, I didn't come with any expectations other than maybe to get a bit more experience with opening up and developing the necessary trust in humanity to do so again for the future. I told her it was fine, that I thought there was a spark and that I was just wrong about it. Nothing crazy, this happens a few million times on this planet each day.

I would need to distance myself a bit to kill the unwanted feelings, but would really like to salvage the friendship after that. We agreed, she hugged me and told me I'm a great guy that will make a lucky gal really happy some day blah blah blah jaddah jaddah jaddah.

So now a few days later I shot her a message, explaining myself a bit better, that I suffer from a few mental health issues and that she was my inspiration to try and conquer them again and try trusting people again. I also apologized, not for what I said but because I felt like I was ambushing her a bit. Also that her friendship meant really a lot to me, and that she wasn't judgmental about me and my issues.

So, I notice she is online on the app but seems to be ignoring the 2 messages I sent to her directly completely, hasn't even opened them yet. I also saw she checked one of my status messages. So she must be consciously ignoring me.

Ok a few things about me. I am 35, no relationship since I was 21 (does that go into forever alone territory again?)

Burned myself out badly trying to improve from my dead end job at age 27 because I always felt inadequate thanks to my parents. Been struggling with several lovely mental health ailments since, such as burnout into chronical depression, anxiety, emotional detachment and avoidant personality disorder...

I have surface level friends and know how to talk to people. But basically I can't let anyone in truly due to fear of being found inadequate if I do. This was supposed to be different. I wasn't expecting a relationship but for once I hoped to see my trust rewarded, at least gaining a true, understanding, friend. In 14 years I truly opened myself up once, and all my fears regarding other people were confirmed in the process. If you open up you are screwed, thanks to you, Tam, it's now completely ingrained into my soul.

I honestly don't think I can recover, as in ever open myself up again, relegating me to a life of complete and utter ALONE. We are such a vile species, and I am so tired."

I want someone that can hold accountability with me.  


Unconventional - I don't want to meet you. I don't want to see you. I don't want to date you or marry you.

Codependent - I'm clingy. I'm beyond clingy. I try to attach myself to anyone who shows me any sort of affection or ""love"". I'm going to do this to you and I will attach myself and become overly dependent on you to validate my feelings. I want someone who can handle this emotionally. It's hard, incredibly hard to do this. It's hard to be understanding and accepting, but I've met a handful that are able to do this.  


The reason why I want to do it this way is because I want mindfulness and the present to matter more than anything else. I want to be able to support each other. Not tied down by our past, not tied down by a ""bright"" future. I want there to be no judgement, no pressure, no expectations. Patience and acceptance are the key values that we hold.

Like Doomguy first lost his family and then his bunny 

Master chief losing cortana in halo 4 

Guts trying to be happy or have a life he can be content but just can't cuz he's branded

Like happiness or something which they loved the most got stripped away from them, taken away as the fate saying ""you can't have it, because you don't deserve it"" a black and white movie of yours in which no one tried to bring colors"
lonely,Less than 2 months left for my birthday.,"Less than 2 months left for my birthday. - And i hate it😭. Birthdays used to be the most awaited days during my childhood. But now i just wish it never existed. The last time i celebrated birthday with my friends was back in 2013. Ever since then I've been alone during my birthday. Yes, It's been 8 years without birthday party. After 2014 (which was last year of my school) I started losing contact with most of my friends. I still  got birthday text messages for another 1-2 years, But that was the end. 
I couldn't make any new friends at college. Mainly because I got bullied by few of my classmates during the last year of my school bc of which I developed social anxiety. So i was too scared to connect with new people. bc of which i ended up being alone (Had only about 4-5 friends, Tho we use  to go to college together and all..But we never went for hangout. they were just class buddies)
for 5 years at my college. 


Lol, Now I barely get any text messages from my friends on my birthdays or new years or any other festivals. it's just my family members and my cousins who wish me on my birthday. And my siblings and relatives always ask me 
""what are your plans for your birthday?"" 
I HATE THIS QUESTION ALOT. BECAUSE I'VE GOT NO ANSWER. it makes me feel embarassed that I've zero friends to hangout with.

God, I just wish I encounter some sort of health issue on my birthday so I dont have to go through all of this shit. I'm planning to take some sleeping pills this year so i dont have to deal with all of these embarassing moments.

Also, would like to hear from you guys. What do y'all do on your birthdays?"

Yet I know I need to talk to some people who understand the lonely feeling that they have inside, I feel so lost and alone but at the same time I’m not sure what I need to fill that void. I was married now separated with a daughter I only see on weekends because I work all week. I’m so stressed and tired of everything because I’m a 21 year old male who is going through a big change so quickly. I am at heart a very social person but it all seems so fake, I interact with people and then I go home and sulk around in my room and contemplate thinks I know I should not be thinking of, but if anyone has any advice to help with this that would be greatly appreciated."
lonely,Alone and confused,"Alone and confused - I’ve been feeling alone for a while now.

lonely,I don't even know,"I don't even know - Why do I only fall in love with people who want to use me and discard me? I'm perpetually just the person people spend time with until they find someone better. The worst part is that ""someone better"" is usually one of my friends which makes the loneliness even worse. They never cared; nobody seems to anyway. If I'm so easily discarded and forgotten then why do I have to keep going? There's a handful of people in my life that say they would be really upset if I were to unalive myself but I only hear from them every few months. It's great I can be there for them when they need me but I spend the vast majority of my time alone and wishing something could fulfill me. All I feel is emptiness. I can only sleep so much to avoid getting lost in my brain. 

I wish I could stop feeling this way but I don't think it's going away. I've been trying to convince myself for over 20 years that tomorrow will be better but I think I have to concede this is it. This is my life. Nobody is excited to hear from me, except maybe my mom and her only advice to me is to suck it up and keep going. But why? Nobody else has to live in my head, nobody else has to feel this way every day all day for the rest of their lives. I'm so tired. I just wish there was one decent human being out there that wanted me in their lives and enjoyed spending time with me. I'm just a burden to everyone. 

Ugh, I annoy even myself. It's really not a surprise I'm alone but it still hurts anyway. Back to trying to distract myself from reality I guess. :/"

lonely,Chose me. Please. Vent.,"Chose me. Please. Vent. - I am only deserving of love it I’m what that person wants me to be. Having my own emotions or feelings that cause action is wrong and I’m not acting on facts. Gaslit and manipulated constantly. Only valid when it’s someone else. My emotions, feelings, past experiences are not valid and make me delusional. I’m tired of people trying to tell me they love me and are here for me when they just aren’t. Only when I’m useful. Only when I’m exactly what everyone needs. They just love how capable I am of getting things done. Of doing housework. Of cooking. Of restocking the cabinets. WHY DONT I DESERVE IT. No calls, fighting for a text back from EVERYONE. My friends only respond when they have something they want to talk about and completely ignore my previous message. My family will cut me off mid sentence to talk about some Facebook post despite not talking for weeks at a time. Ridiculed every time i show an emotion. Ridiculed for being closed off and not showing emotion. WHAT AM I EXPECTED TO DO. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO BE. WHERE DO I FIND PEOPLE THAT WILL CARE AND WANT ME AND LOVE ME AND WANT ME TO BE HAPPY. 
I’ve been alive almost 25 years, and I’ve yet to find friends. A family. A community. A group. At this point I’d settle for a homeless person to wave at me semi-consistently. I’m in therapy. I take my meds. I need a journal so I don’t overshare to people. WHY ISNT IT GETTING BETTER. I’m doing everything I’m told to do and nothing is getting better. I’m not getting better. If anything I’m more isolated because I’m holding so much in that all my relationship are becoming shallow because I can’t talk about anything without fear. I know I’m far from perfect. So far it’s not even funny. Not to be cliche but, when you hold so much in. You really are alone in a crowded room. I will never be what I want to be. I’m just not the person people are dying to be around or the person that lights up the room. I guess if I just accept that not everyone wants the connection I want with them, with me…I don’t know. I’m just all alone out here."
lonely,"Just venting, this is just for me so scroll past lmao","Just venting, this is just for me so scroll past lmao - I’m (20m) feeling great, but thinking sad thoughts. But I’m chillin.

I was really stressed about my short term classes and how I need to find a new psychiatrist and therapist (if I decide to go back into therapy) and also need to get represcribed my adhd meds! Everything has been super annoying, but I’m feeling great bc I’m on here sharing it with y’all. And I’m eating cinnamon rolls while the rest of my family that I hate talking to sleeps all around my house and outside my door bc we’re all sick (so far negative Covid tests so that’s nice I guess). I want to move out, but I don’t make that kinda money. I wanna drop out, but there’s so much pressure and expectations on me to do decent (not great bc I’ve lowered everyone’s expectations of me lmao). And it sucks even more bc my family doesn’t even acknowledge adhd and my mom fronts like she supports me and my dad is homophobic so I’m not even really out (since I’m 💅). Like, I don’t have friends bc I’m just incapable of making deep connections bc I’m neurodivergent, and the people I’m surrounded by are draining. When they’re annoyed by my adhd, I can’t tell them that it’s my adhd bc then they’re gonna tell me to try harder so I just take whatever they’re saying. I’m only gay when I like gay memes online bc it’s not like I can be gay in my house when my dad works from home. My social life is just me constantly trying to build it back up to when I was forced to be around people in high school, but it just won’t stay together lmao. There’s just nothing going for me, and I need my family to understand that so I can take a break from my brain shitting on me all the time and get it figured out bc I keep falling and then I get to a point where I think I might be happy for like a few weeks and then I fall again. And I’m at that point where I’m falling again. Oh well. Hopefully, I’ll get more weed to smoke to make me feel better faster. Gnight y’all! ♥️"

lonely,Venting here. Take it or leave it,"Venting here. Take it or leave it - Hm. My first Reddit post….. and it’s in 
r/lonely 😂🤦‍♂️ well anyway I kinda just came here to vent. Look; I can’t sit here and say that I’m depressed and lonely and give you all a rundown on how bad my life is. Because I live a life that is so far beyond average. I really love everything I do and I would definitely consider myself moderately successful. Maybe a little below “moderately”, but either way. My life is pretty damn awesome. 

The depressed part.. I’m just not so sure of. Every day I go back and forth with myself if I am depressed or not, and honestly.. Overall I really don’t think I am. But I sure as shit get these terrible feelings. If I am depressed, I subconsciously know what the problem is but simply cannot fix it. Not because I don’t know how to.. which I don’t, but because if i tried to fix it.. I’m not sure if I would have the (moderately) successful abnormal life that I live right now 

Lonely. That I am. Can’t deny that. It’s so easily hidden in plain sight, and I guarantee anyone that I know would never know or even think I am or ever was. 
I don’t know if there’s many people like me out there, but I am so far beyond loyal. Mainly with family but also with friends. And when you have a best friend; That’s family. 

I’ve had disloyal friends, and they’re gone. but when your best friends are disloyal that’s a different animal I believe my “friends” are the reason for either my loneliness or depressed feelings. Or both. But again. If I distance myself from them, I think I’ll be even more lonely and depressed.  

I’ve never wanted a relationship until these feelings came along. Well.. not never, but I just always eventually cut things off between me and whoever I’m with at the time. But that’s because I seriously never wanted a relationship with the person I was with at the time. That’s because I know that whoever I get in a relationship with, I am sticking with them. That’s that loyalty. Anyway.  The last person I cut things off with I actually ended up regretting that and still regret that. It was probably about 2 years ago more or less. I tried to express my feelings about a year ago but those feelings didn’t get reciprocated. That hurt. But it was most definitely my fault. 

Anyway. All in all. I really don’t have anybody to talk to. And can’t seem to find anybody who is genuine. And when it comes to girls Sometimes It’s almost like I’ve forgotten how to socialize. It’s funny. I give and share so much love. Why does it feel disingenuous to ask for some in return?"

lonely,To be honest I’m dreading returning to college in the spring,"To be honest I’m dreading returning to college in the spring - I’m a freshman and I did academically well fall semester, but I more or less failed to make friends too. My college is on the smaller side but the grind culture is kinda crazy (think a typical Ivy League rejects school). I’m not on bad terms with my roommate exactly but I can also physically feel every time he brings people over how conversations don’t really include me, and sometimes when I do interject and make a comment about the topic at hand I can kinda feel with every awkward conversation that people on my floor think I’m strange. I really did put in an effort, especially the first month, this was the chance to start over that I’d waited for my entire life. But with each failed conversation with the people who visited my roommate and others on our floor I started avoiding campus/my dorm more and more and staying at home and then driving to school (even though the commute kinda sucks). I grew tired of feeling like the odd one out that I just decided to give my roommate the dorm. For finals it was completely my roommates, I commuted to classes and stopped by later on to pick up some of my stuff and I was gone. I’m somewhat outgoing I guess, I don’t shut up if you get me talking, but what I say seems to have no weight or meaning. I don’t want to go back to that dorm or feeling like the strange roommate, especially since I was gone so much towards the later part of the semester. I don’t want to feel like that again"

I could write about this forever but i will try not to. We were only close for about 2 years but we hung out every day and she made me looks at the world with a new perspective, made me feel rlly excited about life. The funniest and coolest person i have ever met and i still cant think of one bad thing abt her. I miss her so much i cry about it all the time. I wish we were frjends again so bad, it feels like im living in a nightmare.

She kind of slowly stopped talking to me and being weird, saying she was busy all the time. and then when i finally really asked her about it she said it was bc i had eating problems and it was too hard to be around (she struggled w eating disorders as well). I do believe that was partof it but ahe was like my beat friend and jt fekt like she tried to ghost me. i fel like she wouldnt do that if i was just aick. also abt a year after that at her sisters birthday party, who im atill friends with, she said ahe wanted to be best friends again and i think she was drunk and i got so excited and when i reached out to make plans ahe was jusy busy again and didnt try to sctually meet up w me. like it just feels like she doesnt even llike me anymore ans a person anymore and it hurts so bad becausee ive always looked up to her and admired her as a person, i always will. its hard to like myself when someone i look up to so much doesnt like me, you know? 

Anyways ive been wanting to text her and just be like hey you can be really mean about think but like why did u never want to be friends again or like what rlly happened? obviously i would make it more eloquent i just dont know if this is rude to do. i loretally cant move on. i got so insecure of myself as a person and frjnd after and i havent made many close frinds since. i used to be really cinfident in my personality. this has honestly made me question mysekf so much and hate myself. pleas e let me know and thanks to anyone who reaponds"

I don’t really know anyone in my course (first year was online, this year I was late getting vaccinated so I missed out on those first nights out) and they’ve all already got their social groups established. I don’t even have anywhere or any reason to go outside so i haven’t left my house since I got back.

My lack of a social life at home came up in a conversation with one of those friends last week and they said “That’s kinda sad” which was embarrassing cos they’re right."

lonely,I’m used to it,"I’m used to it - A year ago, I met someone who I really had strong feelings for . He was an introvert and loved the outdoors. The day came when he had to move for a job . I knew deep in my heart that I was counting the days before he leaves . Remembering every detail of him before so that I would have really good memories . I remember sitting at his apartment and asking him “ well, what if you’ll feel lonely? “ He simply replied “ I’m used to it.” I suddenly found myself crying. I just felt deep sadness about everything .

Here I am, a year after … he made us both lonely people."

However some advice after reading all these posts, force yourself out of your comfort zone. It will feel horrible and you won't want to do it but it works. 

Join a club, doesn't matter if you don't like chess/hockey/cooking, etc... you're not there for the hobby. Or don't join a club, you can go up to strangers and just become friends. That's how I met my wife and one of my best friends, it's scary and difficult to do but you won't regret it."

lonely,i wish i had real friends,"i wish i had real friends - Im in high school, i have exactly 3 people i would call my ""friends""? i think. i dont know. one of them i have known since i was 4 years old. the other one i used to be really good friends up until 2 years ago, when she started talking to my 3rd ""friend"", and basically abandoned me. 
all 3 of them have said so much hurtful stuff me, and i often want to just stop talking to them, i think i hate them. but i cant stop talking to them, because then i will be completely alone.
at the start of 2021, i was so excited. i was determined to hang out more with one of my friends, and use her to meet other people. and then the summer came. i spent time with my friend, but, i never really got to meet other people. of course, she offered me if i wanted to hang out with some other people, but my mum is very strict, so i always had to end up saying no, because im not allowed to go out that late.
the highlight of my summer was going to a local festival with that friend, because we accidentally met a bunch of her friends. that was really the only time of the summer, where i felt like i might have a chance of having friends. guess what? i've never seen any of those people again.
on november 27, she asked me if i wanted to hang out with her, another girl i know and then a girl, whos name i had only heard.
omg. thats was literally the best day of 2021.
i was literally crying from happiness when walking home.
on ig i follow a lot of people from my city, im obsessive. i have stalked all of them, i purposefully walk past the places in the city, where they might be. i did it a lot in the summer. i was walking through the skatepark like 10 times a day at one point. 
and i see al those people posting about how they spend their time, and they all have friends and friend groups, and im just so jealous.
i wish i had friends. i want people i can talk to about whats bothering me. i want to have a fun summer for once in my life."

 it's funny or maybe it's a serious question to ask that the things we do just to feel a little bit of connection from a stranger either in the form of physical or emotional.
Advertise ourselves like Age and gender(22M,24F), Stating our so called needs, and waiting for any single person to DM, or getting overwhelmed with so many Dm's. 
I want to know why? Why do seek such intimate connection from other? I feel the answer is because we all are different from each other and that makes us lonely deep inside
What if the whole world was same and equal with same physical appearance, also having same thought process  like twins,
Will we be still lonely? Or we are connected like some fucking AI? Or we will be bored out of our fucking mind?

lonely,Are these things that I learned online true about men and women (in general) and should I believe them?:,"Are these things that I learned online true about men and women (in general) and should I believe them?: - Female genitalia will never be appreciated as much as male genitalia, breasts and asses are, 

Oral will never be as commonly performed on women as it is on men, 

Transgender men with female genitalia will never be sexualised nor popular in pornography with heterosexual women and homosexual men as much as transgender women with male genitalia are sexualised and popular in pornography with heterosexual men 

Following from that heterosexual women and homosexual men will never like female genitalia as much as heterosexual men like male genitalia, 

And older women will never be appreciated as much as older men are 

It seems there is nothing really positive sexually and attraction wise about being a woman, just many things you have to accept that men do not have to accept. 

Is it understandable for me to come to these conclusions about a majority of people/a common enough pattern/most people/a lot of people? 

I wouldn't care if it wasn't all so one sided. I don't care about hetero men being this way if hetero women and gay men were also that way. It's the imbalance that speaks volumes on how one part is viewed vs how the other is."

It was like the culmination of a decade of work all summed up in one sentence and I almost started crying because it's been a real struggle.

Last year I cut off two of my best friends because of how they didn't have any care for my feelings and didn't understand boundaries plus some other stuff. This was a huge step for me as one of them has been my best friend for 9 years. Now I don't really have anyone I can talk to comfortably. I miss times where I could hang out with my ex best friend in silence. Or just really talk about anything.

It's so hard for me to make new friends because I think that people find me annoying or boring... which I'm aware is not normal at all. I'm planning to see a therapist about this. I can't help but be awkward at work and I really hate how I can't make conversation anymore.

She cut it off for good a few days ago and shes going to move on soon. Sad part is she lives 30 seconds away from me at college and 5 minutes from both our houses in our hometown. If I saw her with a new guy it would break me. I really cannot fathom being with someone ever again and especially someone of that high of a quality.

I used to be okay with being “alone” But as a guy who’s been single my whole life, honestly what’s it like being in a relationship? I’ve always had my little fairy tale of someone who can be there for me, and I can do the same for, just to be happier in one another’s presence, to have an intimate connection deeper than just a friend or another aquatinance or coworker or something. What’s it like to have someone wants to spend all their time all cuddled up and stuff, or actually going out on cute dates? What’s it like having a best friend who’s mutually romantically interested? What’s it’s like to know someone’s so exited to see you, and genuinely cares for you? Someone who’s trust it 100% undeniable and someone who confides in me just the same? I hate that it makes me second guess almost every choice I’ve made. I’ve been out on dates and stuff so its not a lack of trying, and I’ve grown more confident with my outside image the past few years. I know I’ve got my fair share of baggage, but who doesn’t. I know a little of what I want in a partner, even with little to no experience, so I don’t understand. I ought to be good at this kinda thing by now, love and sex and the whole nine yards. Surprise I’ve got my v card too, always waiting on that special someone to come along, who just hasn’t yet. And that’s fine, thats not the part I’m too worried about, I know that will come in due time when she does, I’m worried about hugs and kisses and the cute wholesome bs that I’ve been missing out on. No affectionate intimate feelings recieved from another human like ever? It makes me feel like there’s kinda something wrong with me too, all these people I know are just out hooking up and stuff, and I can’t even get any love 🙃 it’s disgusted me quite frankly too how sex driven the world really is bleh. Don’t get me wrong I was a teenage horndog who definitely had my fantasies too but damn. Tbh I want a lil lady I can give some of my attention to, who will snuggle up and comfort me as I want to her, just an extra backbone an extra motivation in someone to feel safe in and to keep things going good, I just want someone to sleep with, again though not the sex, someone who will literally fall asleep on my arm making it go numb, someone who hogs the blankets, and snores a little lol, waking up to the most adorable bedhead, no matter how funky. So i guess really is it worth all what I’ve been putting myself through? My biggest goals in life are to have a home and a family of my own and it’s become so difficult to even know where begin my life’s such a wreck and even if I did find the right one I’m nowhere near financially ready to take the next step towards anything, or even to have a gf rn if I’m honest. It’s been affecting all aspects of my life recently, my family relationships, work, my friends, my sleep, and my spirit itself. the unbearable wight of loneliness is just keeping me so fn stuck. This post doesn’t even begin to do it justice, why has this curse been brought upon me?"

lonely,Being a lonely baker sucks!,Being a lonely baker sucks! - I love baking breads and desserts all the time! Especially breads like sourdough and focaccia. But I have almost no one to give any of it too. So I have to eat it all which either means I gain weight and get sad or I'm limited on the amount that I can have fun in my hobby. I thought of donating to homeless shelters but they don't accept homemade goods!!!!

lonely,Anyone else get unreasonably bothered that they missed out on cliches?,Anyone else get unreasonably bothered that they missed out on cliches? - I know this won’t apply to everyone in this sub but i’m hoping it rings a bell with some of you. I am someone who has never really had any type of close relationship. I have never had a really close friend or a partner of any kind. Usually I am fine and used to it by now but sometimes I look back on my life and I really regret not doing things differently. For example I will never have the opportunity to have a high school girlfriend where we both are inexperienced and discover how a relationship works. Or I will never get to experience dorm life and make friends with the people who live on my floor. I’m sure a lot of people might say that experiences like that are overrated but it still makes me sad that I will never have the opportunity to decide for myself. Anyone else feel this way?

lonely,Am I good enough to have someone truly care about me?,"Am I good enough to have someone truly care about me? - I wanna start off by saying that I’m not talking about familial love; as grateful as I am that it exists.

But the thing about family is, if they’re a good family they probably already care about you.

I’m talking about people who used to be complete strangers, but grew to be best friends, perhaps lovers, soulmates if I may go this far. I just don’t know if I as a person am good enough to have a stranger grow closer to me, to be the first person they think of, to have them perhaps like me, maybe even love me, all around just genuinely want to be around me and spend time with me, and care about me first.

As childish as it sounds, I just want to be special to someone, their favorite, their whole world, instead of basically just being an extra in their life.

I honestly don’t blame anyone for me not being able to have that; after all I’m really not an interesting, unique person and I don’t think I’m too fun to be around. I just wish someone would get me to believe differently about myself; I wanna someone to grow to love and care about me, to feel like I’m family to them… perhaps then I could feel like I’m actually worth something, worth another person’s investment."

lonely,Kinda Lost,"Kinda Lost - I’m 21 and been living on my own since 17 just kinda doing my own thing, enjoying some days and down on my luck on others but the sense of accomplishment was there knowing everything I had I worked hard for and earned. 
     My mom hit me up a couple months ago and offered for me to move in with her after all these years to take some college class or something to “advance my life” and I really didn’t want to but my grandma convinced me that this is my chance to save and try to level up so I did it. Bad choice for a lot a reasons.
     I didn’t want to take college classes but that was a stipulation for me stay there so I bit the bullet. Taking these classes is the easiest part even though they add nothing to my life. I moved to another state and I’ve never had such a hard time building relationships, I have nothing to do and nowhere to be. I get in my car and drive around the city, get food, watch movies in a parking garage because if i stayed home all the time I’d look like I had no life. I talk to myself enough question my sanity. 
     Living with my parents is the most isolating feeling ever it’s like I can never be alone even if I’m in my room, the privacy doesn’t compare to my own apartment. I sneak around the house so I don’t have to awkwardly bump into them and say “how you doing “  and walk off. But yet still feel so by myself
     I used to be the life of the party now being here I feel like a shell of my former self and it’s like even my communication has deteriorated. I became so adjusted to this isolation that social anxiety takes over my body in public. 

Whether or not anybody reads this it’s been heavy on my chest. Drive safe bois😎"

lonely,Just want someone to hear me,"Just want someone to hear me - I’m a 28 year old guy that as of lately have started to have panic attacks just from the thought of feeling like I have no worth to those around me. I’ve truly lost a lot of who I used to be. I’ve overall become more and more emotionless and I can tell it’s hard for others to hold a conversation with me because I’ve started to avoid conversations because I have no commonalities with them or no input for them. I don’t feel like the provider I’m supposed to be. Life’s been weird the past couple of years and I’ve not really made goals for myself because I honestly see no light. I’m not suicidal; I do think about dying but not killing myself, I don’t want to die but it’s hard to think about going on like this."
lonely,I cant do this anymore,"I cant do this anymore - Trigger warning for self harm, suicide and some drug use. 

I just need to vent. I’m so sick of just being alive. I know all my problems are my fault, I tell myself I may have underlying issues but deep down I’m just an asshole. I have horrible anger issues, and I throw temper tantrums over the tiniest things. It’s like one minute I’m perfectly fine, then I’m hyper aware of everything and freak out. Nothing helps either , every time I have an outbreak I start cutting again. I’ve already relapsed twice this year and I can’t look in the mirror with wear short sleeves without crying. It pisses me off that this is the coping method i’ve settled with but I just can’t feel bad for myself because I know I deserve it. I bring everyone down all the time and get surprised when people don’t want to be around me. I stopped cutting for a few months, and got high every day instead. I ran out, though, of weed and money, and i’m not of age so I can’t really get more to calm down again. I know I have a problem and I can’t rely on drugs or self harm forever but I feel so helpless it’s like i’m losing control of my actions more and more every day. All i do is cry and yell at my loved ones and cry some more. I haven’t seriously considered killing myself this much but lately i’m realizing I have nothing to lose. I wish my parents would’ve listened to me years ago when I told them I wanted therapy. I feel so bad for the people close to me, I’m just such an angry person. I hate when things don’t go my way, I hate the people around me for no reason, and I hate myself the most. Sorry if this was long, I figured venting anomalously was better than bothering my friends."

I think it’s starting to get to me , no one ever checks on me I’ve kinda just been thrown away by everyone I know. I’ve always helped everyone I could , I use to have a really good job for numerous years , I helped everyone I saw that needed it, I would buy groceries every week and take em to single moms , families just anyone that was struggling , I never passed by any homeless person without giving money or food or something , I used too bbq almost everyday for my ex and make so much for anyone to come eat. I’d give blankets and clothes , shoes anything someone needed at anytime. I don’t know why now no one even cares if I’m okay or alive even. My ex and I broke up I think it messed me up , I lift my job , my son who I raised by myself his whole life has turned 18 and he stayed in that town with his gf so it’s even more empty without him. He messages every now and then but I don’t let him know I’m lost and hurt so much. He needs to live his life not worry about me. I don’t wanna let him see me this weak. My family threw me away when I was young , snd it seems like everyone else ive cared about and loved has thrown me away too. All my friends and people that worked with me dissapesred as soon as the money did. I don’t wanna be in this house no more. I’m exhausted from being by myself."
lonely,Realizing I haven't had close friends for years now.,"Realizing I haven't had close friends for years now. - I've been able to make a decent number of acquaintances, people who I get along with and will hang out with but I haven't had a best friend in a long time. I feel like I don't rank very high in anyone else's priorities, like I'm an afterthought. I know they have genuine problems, and that they really do have a lot to deal with, but when me sending messages ends in getting no response 9/10 times eventually I start to feel like it doesn't matter. Hanging out in person feels like a rush until you're bored and we say bye. Always being the one to initiate whatever we're doing sucks. I just want a friend who doesn't make me feel like a younger sibling who mom said you have to hang out with. I feel selfish about being upset about some of the stuff. I know that they genuinely have some really heavy shit that they're going through but I still feel forgotten."

i will always be someone option, or some last. im not enough to be a main. my personality is funny. i always make ppl laugh, and ppl told me im cool to talk to, or vent to. i will never meet someone who is single. i will always be someone option, never someone priority.

i feel like that “focus on yourself” shit is bs. my friend have no car,still live with his mom, working shitty job at 27, and he still manage to get girls or a relationship. my other friend introvert, he shy to approach women in public, but he gets all types of girls on instagram. im starting to think its luck. im tired of hearing this pseudo advice."

'' get a girl '' , '' get friends '' , '' socialize '' ... Ok... but how ? I have had some friends as youngster... even I recently got in touch with one , but I did ghost him... I had to ghost him... hes somewhat married and all hes doing is talking about himself and his wife... the conversation is as one sided as it gets... he didnt bothered once to ask me... '' hey you cool ? you're about to die ? waddap ? '' nothing , Nada... I had to ghost him , my cell phone been ringing for the past days and I cant be fucked to answer... Screw it... In the love department... here comes the death blow... i never had any serious connection with another woman, never had a girlfriend... fuck... i dont think i even been friends with a girl, no woman was bothered to gave me the time of a day despite me trying quite a lot when  i was 19-24 yrs old.... Im getting old , in a couple of years I will be 30... 30 friggin' years old, i have no enthusiasm towards nothing anymore... meeting ladies ? making friends ? why and how ? my example will be over dramatic on this one but... is like being in prison for 29 years and all of a sudden they throw you back in society... how are you suppose to handle that ? i have no idea... someone once told me , the love game is for the young man , and fuck me they were soo right , took me 16 years to find out... when i was young i use to see all my friends getting attention from women, always... acting towards them way more polite than me... i was always the one you throw shit at... was not cool at first but i grew into it so to say.... it just became normal for women to be rude, it just became normal to be aware that , if you live or die no one cares regardless.... i use to think once that being super rich will solve it all , in reality it wont , they all will use you anyway and you will be back square 1.... death on the other hand excites me... i be walking the street thinking that if my heart bursts or a car slides on the sidewalk and makes me a pile of grinded meat ( i am a sack of walking flesh anyway )... it will be totally fine... wont even bother to ask why... i dont know what else should I say... maybe close this vent on a positive note ?  i dont know what nice thing i should say... cheers maybe ? !"
lonely,“Love yourself in order to be loved by others”,"“Love yourself in order to be loved by others” - Could someone explain this statement to me, please.

Almost every conversation about my loneliness leads to this sentence. And that’s the end of the conversation, like it’s a cure or something, without any explanation.

For an unknown reason I built a stereotype right in my head stating that happiness is a lie, is a sign of not thinking deeply about things that happen around you and to you. So, the only people I can trust are the ones who struggle, not the opposite ones.

With this in mind, thinking about the statement makes me confused, because I would preferably love the ones who doesn’t love themselves, because I know that they are real.

Additionally, I think that overcoming the odds together is highly powerful for true relationship.

Thank you."

lonely,What kind of activities / job can I do to be surrounded by people ?,"What kind of activities / job can I do to be surrounded by people ? - I'm going through really really tough times. I'm crying right now just writing this and I never cry. 

I've just been out of a 4.5 year relationship and it's getting increasingly unbearable. I've noticed that when I'm hanging out with my friend (he's the only friend I have where I am), I feel so much better and so different than when I'm home alone with my thoughts, but I can't ask him to see me everyday because unlike me he's got a life. I'm currently unemployed, dropped out of my school, so I live with my parents for now. So I spend most of my days doing nothing and trying to stay busy either by watching stupid stuff on TV or sometimes actually being productive to 'ot think about it but it isn't enough... I've seen how my ex is already doing much better and barely thinks of me now just because she gets to see her friends every day in her school and I wish I had that, I wish I could be surrounded by people I like every day, I'm convinced it would help me get over her and get better overall much faster, being with people makes me forget about how ugly my life is and it's so refreshing. 

The thing is I can't go back to school right now because I left where I used to live temporarily to live with my parents as I said for now, to move back (probably not even in the same town) when I feel ready and better. I'm only here for about 4-6 months I think. 

So I was wondering if any of you guys know if there's anything I can do to be around people and have real human interactions every day... The only thing I could think of was working at my gym but I'm not looking for customer/employee type of interactions. I just want to talk to people and maybe have fun with them. I know it sounds like pure fantasy but I still wanted to try. 

Sorry if my English isn't perfect and sounds weird at times."

My brother took his own life, he was my best friend and one day he was just gone and a funny thing happened afterwards while I was grieving. All the people in my life I relied on and trusted, my friends, family and girlfriend, they abandoned me, they moved on with their lives and left me stuck in a hole of despair and self loathing and it took me 3 long years but I managed to pull myself out of it. I'm still working on myself but I still have no one, no friends and no girlfriend. I've tried but nothing ever changes. My entire life came apart when I lost my brother and though I've pieced it back together the best I could I just haven't been able to fix the social side of my life and perhaps I never will."

lonely,I'd just like a bit of encouragement,"I'd just like a bit of encouragement - I've never posted anything on Reddit or really any social media before so I apologize if I end up rambling and even go off topic.

I'm just needing a bit of encouragement or something like that cause I guess as you can expect I feel alone, probably not nearly as lonely as those who are truly suffering from what I've seen and I do hope you all get what you desire. But I have friends, family and all that which I interact with pretty regularly but I just play videogames and crack jokes with my friends and I hardly ever talk with my family about anything besides school and just little jobs I may do around the house and I don't have someone to talk to about what I'm always thinking and have bottled up in my head and it's just getting a bit too much for me now. I'm struggling to find any reason to continue trying in school, I have fuck all social skills with girls as I have been in all boys schools my whole life so a girlfriend isn't an option right now and like hell I would be able to talk with my family about these things and I wouldn't tell my friends cause their one of the few good things I got and I'm not risking putting it in jeopardy of some kind. Also I'm hoping this doesn't count as personal information for the rules.

Sorry if I rambled on a bit but I just finally had to say at least something at least to whoever may see this and I apologize if perhaps I'm not in the right subreddit for what I'm saying, I am still a bit new to all this and being anonymous on the internet with all these people to chat to so thank you if you have read this just give me some advice if you have any to spare.

tldr ; I'm just feeling a bit alone emotionally and I would perhaps like some encouragement or advice or whatever you may have."

Dealing with suicidal thoughts, i just don't have the courage to act on em else it would have been long ago when I would have killed myself. It's getting so difficult to do the smallest of tasks and I just hope to die in my sleep everyday. I am too done with all this. I don't have friends coz they just used me as a therapist and started ghosting when they felt better and they didnt even care when I switched off my phone for 3 days. Idk how to deal with all this it's so fucking exhausting. I can't even express myself because no body gives a fuck about my emotions. I am just so done 😭🥺"

I'm looking for someone who is open, understanding and actually has time for me. I've met some fantastic people in my life but the majority of them are too busy with their career or education, which is where my introduction begins. I am currently out of both work and education due to how severe my anxiety and depression have became. I was studying Health and Social Care at college in hopes to be a nurse but I can't help but feel this isn't the path for me as it is my parents dream, not my own - this is something I am still figuring out on top of everything else. I'm an empathetic, creative and kind individual who wears her heart on their sleeve. I have a love for the Arts such as creative writing, journaling, photography, drawing and listening to music (folk, jazz, classical, indie rock, classic rock, 50s cheesy love songs etc), as you might've guessed making friends is no speciality of mine hence why I am putting myself out there on the internet i.e. the only way I know how.

lonely,emotionally drained,"emotionally drained - . i don’t really know what i think will happen from writing this. i’m sure many of you are dealing with your own struggles right now, alone or with the support of others. my problems are just an addition to the plenty that are already here in this world but i don’t have anyone to talk to and i need to write down what i’m feeling for someone to see even if they don’t choose to respond. i am so emotionally drained and lonely. i have no friends and no one who i feel emotionally connected to or who i can mutually relate to and understand deeply. looking back at things, i don’t think i’ve ever had real friends. being surrounded with people that i feel i have no connection to has left me feeling empty. i have a caring family and i understand how fortunate i am to have such a family. or maybe i don’t understand, maybe people will just tell me i’ll never understand BECAUSE i was born into such a family. maybe i’ll just be made to feel like my problems shouldn’t be thought of as problems, rather they should be thought of a result of my own pathetic self or something. 

i really just want a friend. nothing more than that. no materialistic things, no social verification, nothing like that. i just want a friend who i can have an actual deep bond with that isn’t superficial or corrupted with high levels of selfishness. i have always tried to be unconditionally kind to others and include others who did not have anyone into fun activities to have someone and in the end, i’ve only been insulted, humiliated, and made to feel like i don’t belong here in return.

i’m tired and i feel hopeless. i’m not suicidal or self harm, however, painlessly disappearing forever would be nice if it were possible. i’m not sure how older people have lived for so long. i can’t even imagine myself being any much older. not even 22. i mean like 50 years old? i would be so bored and dead inside. i hope i don’t seem like a pessimist or a cynical person. i believe in kindness and can see it in those who have been raised in ways that have led them to become ill-intentioned and hurtful without feeling remorse or shame. i’m just not happy right now.

again, just needed to say how i’m feeling at the moment. to anyone struggling, i truly hope something works out for you and if you have no one for help, don’t feel afraid to pm. to those who are happy, i’m happy for you. please appreciate what you have with the most sincerest gratitude and don’t lose sight of it or yourself. there are many who wish they could have what you have. many people have gone through the same efforts, struggles, and setbacks as you but things did not turn out the same for them.

that’s all. to you, whoever is reading, hope you have a good day."

Coming to the point, I don't know how many of you guys watch hololive, or Vtubers for that matter. But I recently watched Houshou Marine's last video, one where the viewer POV rests on her lap as she strokes the viewer's hair. This video made me think about how many lonely peeps might have replayed that video over and over again, just for the feeling of being loved. How many people might be waiting everyday for her (and the other hologirls) to upload their videos or streams, as their only pleasure in an otherwise lonely and monotonous life. This is further evidenced by just how many people donate to the hologirls, some peeps even donating fairly large sums, just to have the girls call out their names. 

This made me think, do the hologirls inadvertently cause more harm than good by being the metaphorical light of their viewer's day? Many people are obsessed with them,  many watch their streams religiously, ignoring their own health. And many might be doing so out of sheer loneliness.

 I just want to hear your takes on this issue. And how the hologirls or the community could help these people."

How do people even talk so confidently? My voice is just plain awful, whenever I’m excited it’s just scratchy and high pitched and whenever I try to talk in a normal conversation my voice ends up monotone and boring. How do people control their voice? 

Sometimes I laugh and it sounds weird. All these things make me insecure when I talk, so I just end up not talking at all. Im trying to  not end up mute completely, but sometimes I end up thinking about what I just said and how I could’ve said it better. Anybody else feel the same way?"

I was at Walmart with my two kids picking up a few things and she was there with her kids, we ran across each other while shopping and did the polite head-nod acknowledgment we all do. 
Then we ended up at subway together.
It was fun to notice our differences and similarities.
Then when she and her family went to leave, she smiled waved and said goodbye to us.

It was the friendliest interaction I’ve had in years. I think I might have been rude because at first I was surprised she spoke to me. 
For context, I was raised in an abusive family and when I cut them out of my life, I also cut out my friend group. Because when you have been raised in an abusive family, you typically don’t make good friend choices and when you wake up, you wake up to all of it. I haven’t made other friends yet, I’m a stay at home mom. The only social interaction I get is from men who try to sleep with me and my partner isn’t much of a conversationalist.

Clearly I am in dire need of friendships and social interaction.

Ill figure it out.
But, to that sweet wonderful woman who took the time to see me, I love her. 
If you see people today, be kind to them. It might mean so much more than you realize."

lonely,Cold Empty Spot,"Cold Empty Spot - Throughout my entire life I've felt pretty neglected and overlooked, I don't get along well with my family, I had no friends in school, or at work, I wake up next to a cold empty spot on my bed and I go to sleep next to it.
I'm scared, I don't want to be alone anymore, I often have dreams of being in terrible situations and I'm all alone, no one to help me. I'm not sure what else to say, I'm just hoping someone will reach out and say, you don't have to be scared anymore, you don't have to be afraid.
I had a dream about a month or so ago, and it's stuck with me ever since. It was a terrifying experience, I woke up soaked in piss and sweat, to this day I still can't get more than a few hours of sleep.
I was walking through a park on a bright sunny day, there was no one else there, except for the occasional squirrel or bird chirping, eventually after seeing some ominous signs like a woman in a clown costume following me and burning holes in the back of my head with those big, empty, black eyes, and passing by the same old beggar preaching about the end, I made my way home. I sat down of the couch, with two men I didn't recognize, one was pale with slicked back hair, sunglasses and a business suit, the other was old with long dirty hair and beard and his clothes were dirty and tattered. For the longest time we all sat there, saying nothing staring out the window at the steadily increasing number of people in clown costumes and jester outfits. Eventually I tried to get up, but they both held me down. I tried to speak, ""Am I in hell?"" But it felt like I was trying to speak under water and nothing came out. Neither replied, the continued to hold me down to the couch. I started to panic, eventually the beggar and the clown woman from earlier came in from the back door and the stood in front of me, shouting and screaming, but nothing came out of their mouths, I heard nothing, but the deafening silence, I thought I had gone deaf. I tried screaming for help, but no sound came out. For what felt like ages they tortured me with their silent screams, the the two men let me go and dragged me to the dinner table, where the proceeded to slice me open as if I was a Thanksgiving turkey. The pain was excruciating and I couldn't turn away, I felt every second of it. And all the while, the beggar and the clown were silently shouting and screaming. Then all the clowns from outside flooded in and strated ripping out shreds of my flesh, then I woke up.
That dream scared the fear of God into me, it made me feel helpless, scared and alone. I don't ever want to feel that again, but every time I lay down next to that cold empty spot, I just see those big, empty black eyes."

I love my family, but i don't want to tell them things like ""I'm lonely at school and it's making me upset everyday."" otherwise they'll treat me like i'm a baby, i don't want that, can someone please tell me what do to?"
lonely,Bruhh my teenage years are getting wasted,Bruhh my teenage years are getting wasted - Hi I'm 15 and a girl my name is crystal.So my life is very boring and sad.I have anxiety so I can't talk to people very calmly .I can't be around a lot of people are I will start panicking.I only had  two real friends but I messed it up because of how I am. I am very awkward I can only talk to people if they talk to me first.  I'm  also not very good at keeping the conversation going. So I just stopped trying I stay in my room and only come out when I have to go to the bathroom. I cry a lot ngl lmao because I don't have any friends and that is all I ever wanted for some reason I can't keep friends and I hate that because when I did have friends I was very happy but now I just stay in my room and never come out and I know that's not good but there is nothing else to do when you don't have friends and I don't want to go anywhere by myself because my when I try to my heart starts beating very fast like I'm scared so I asked my dad to go with me I love my dad very much it is like he is my only friend but I want true friends like real ones but it's so hard to make them and keep them and I really fucking wish I was normal and I can do normal things like fucking talk to people I'm shy asf and I hate it because I had a lot of chances to be friends are too get in come up to me I just don't know how to act normal are take compliments because they always comment on my eyes because so if anyone have anything that could make this better please help out because I don't want to keep years of my life because it's going to get worse now that I'm home so I don't have to leave the house at all I just want real friends that are ok with who I am and the thing is I am still trying to find who that is myself that's why it's probably so hard ohh yeah I know that this is a on going sentence I just didn't want to put any periods because I'm ranting and I kinda forgot since I was rushing

I guess I should also note that this doesn’t just happen with those closest to me, but with many. It’s just the most surprising and disheartening when it happens with the folks I cherish most.

I often stop watching. - During such scenes, all my brain can do then is tell me I'll never experience this. I'm just not good enough. I've been rejected and ignored for the good part of a decade now so I can't even fantasize about me finding a match now.

I'm watching The Matrix Reloaded and all it's at the orgy scene in Zion. I was super immersed in the lore by the this point. But when the scene hit, I could see myself being in that same orgy and just standing in a corner by myself feeling like shit.

It's kinda funny tbh. I mean there surely couldn't have been a 1:1 ratio of guys and girls willing to orgy consensually. I wonder what it felt like to be alone in Zion in the last party before (what seemed like) the end of the world. I can almost imagine that last-minute panic. ""What if I never kiss a girl before I die?"" sort of vibe.

I stopped watching though. I turned this film on to escape from this world. Romantic scenes drag me back to it and to my own low self worth."

lonely,I’ve never dated anybody and I’m about to turn 27. Is it too late to fix my intimacy issues?,"I’ve never dated anybody and I’m about to turn 27. Is it too late to fix my intimacy issues? - I grew up in a really strict household where dating and sex were forbidden, even talking to the opposite sex was something discouraged, so I never dated or even talked to a boy as a teenager. I was also bullied a lot because of being from a different sort of background so I never felt any guys would be that interested in me anyway so I never bothered to be into that. I never learnt about any of those things either even though I was already a teenager. In college I slowly started talking a little bit, but I was still heavily under my family’s control. Only when I graduated then I finally had the guts to break free and rebel against my family that I want love and romance and to fit in and don’t want to live this way. Well I fell in love twice, both with guys who never dated me and only wanted to bang and then quit, and I obsessed in my mind over them for so long even though they were both terrible because they charmed me at first and made me feel something I never felt before. But I anticipated for so long for either one of them to want me and go out with me and nothing ever happened and they were very demeaning of me. I did a lot of online dating and went on a few dates, but kept attracting either weird guys or guys who didn’t seem to care, much like my dad I suppose, who emotionally neglected me my whole life and continues to. I’ve also been SAd a few times, which has left me with really bad PTSD.

After a broken heart and disappointing date after date, I’ve sort of given up on love, even though I still crave it, and getting older and realizing how messed up I am and how bad patterns and loneliness usually gets worse with age, things look bleak. I have no close enduring relationships other than a couple friends I made in a support group. No family contact, don’t really get invited to anything, and any although I’m told I’m charming and attractive, I cannot find those stable close loving connections I crave with anyone because I think they know secretly there’s something wrong with me and if they find out I’ll be humiliated. I’m living alone too and my health especially mental health is not good but I have literally no idea how to get out of my isolation.

I’m very kind, romantic, creative, passionate and strong under all the darkness, but that is slowly going away and I feel like a shell of a person. Because I can’t use any of that, pourit into anyone or anything. 

I guess I just want to know if it’s too late to fix my really bad attachment issues"

lonely,"16, high school junior","16, high school junior - 
Hey guys, I’m 16 and junior in high school. Just moved to NC from Jersey, and moving in the middle of high school obviously isn’t ideal. I know absolutely no one and have been at this school since August. I’m not an introverted person, nor do I have social anxiety. I always try to talk to people and spark up conversations with anyone close by. In my old friend group, I was always the one who organized the plans and also usually asked if anyone wanted to hop on cod. But now I’m just burnt out. I drift from class to class with my AirPods in. I probably don’t speak to more than 5 people in a given day, 4 of which being my teachers. Lunch is the most stressful though. The way our seats work is there are a bunch of tables with like 5 built in seats, so you can’t pull any chairs over. Everyday I walk in and all the chairs are instantly full, and one time I tried sitting down at one, but they asked me to leave because I was taking someone’s spot. Now I usually fake a headache so I can sit in the nurses office, do random things on my computer in the library to kill the time, or sit outside on the patio with my head down. I never used to kind school, actually enjoyed it. I had a lot of friends so I would talk to kids in the hall, and in all of my classes I had a lot of friends to talk too. Now, my days are repetitive and boring, with the same thing to expect each and every day. I still talk to my friends though, If I didn’t I wouldn’t know how to manage. It is really sad though when all of them call me on a Friday night at the mall, or movies, and I’m just here. Lying on my bed and listening to mac miller. Every night, it’s the same deal. Some times I cry, sometimes i sleep, and other times I watch Netflix. I’m lost. I joined my local soccer team to attempt to meet people, but still haven’t. I played soccer for about 14 years and looking to play in college. I never labeled myself as depressed because everytime I hear that word I associate it with middle schoolers who want attention. I know it’s not true, but it’s how I look at it. But I do think I am at this point. In addition to all of this, we moved down with my grandma. She was everything to me and had the brightest personality. She was my rock. She always laughed at my jokes, no matter how inappropriate they were. On September 10th, she was walking early in the morning and got hit by a car. She died. This made everything worse. I know it’s a horrible thought, but I put some of the blame on my parents for moving us here. It sucks. I hate it. My aunt told me her biggest worry was me, and how she didn’t know how I would acclimate here. She said that’s all she ever wanted for me, was to be happy, but I don’t know how. I know I’m getting off track, sorry. I don’t know why I’m here. I never usually post on Reddit. Just felt like telling someone. If you’re still here, thank you. Cheers."

I wish people would stop giving false hope messages like ""aww you'll find someone"" or ""it gets better"" because you don't know that. People have been saying that for years and the only thing it has done was give me false hope.

Then you have people give generic ""love yourself first"" when they don't realize some of us never had the tools or grew up in an environment where we were taught proper self love. Some of us are too mentally ill to love ourselves the way some of you guys do. Then you have people say, ""you have to search for love"" while at the same time people will tell you how they found love when they stopped searching. To me it just sounds like people who got lucky and found love just by existing. I simply exist and get ignored. I try to put myself out there, I get rejected.

Just don't lie to me and give me false hope to make me feel better. It's better to accept that no matter how badly I want something in my life, even if it's one of my main lifelong dreams, it won't happen for me. It's better than chasing a carrot on a stick and deluding myself for the rest of my life. 

It hasn't happened and I hate getting hopeful about it to the point that when I get any sense of optimism or hope that it may happen, I have to remind myself to shut it down because of how my optimism and hope never worked for me in the past.

Even when people say, ""there is no such thing as 'the one', you can find love with many people"", to someone that has never felt love and never even had guys talk to them let alone look at them, you might as well say, ""some people are just more loved. Some of us get into multiple relationships (or relationships with multiple people if you're poly) because we're lucky enough to be loved multiple times... 


People say the dumbest things when it comes to love or “finding someone”. I agree with you on that 100%. Nobody really knows what’s going on and when people are married or in a relationship, all of the sudden they consider themselves to be experts on the topic and proceed to feed you corny lines like that."

Im so shattered and heart broken, I spent all my savings on him for Christmas and he didn’t get me a damn thing. He was suppose to come over to day to maybe talking things though but he never showed up and is leaving me on read. When school is back in session where am I suppose to sit at lunch? Who will I be able to talk to? With our her and him I am completely alone. If anyone can send me cute animal pictures or funny memes to help distract me or just talk to me for a little while I would be forever grateful for the company. I’m having some pretty dark thoughts.."
lonely,Am I bad at making friends or do people not like me? Endless cycle.,"Am I bad at making friends or do people not like me? Endless cycle. - I'm about to turn 26 and my mom asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday this year. I've never been ecstatic about my birthday and I probably jinx it every year, but honestly this year I just want to hang out by myself. This way I can't be disappointed by the numbers. I'll go work out, take myself to a movie and eat at a fancy restaurant (probably with mom). 

I've been an introvert all my life and I try to make an effort to connect with people. At least I think I do. I just can't cross that barrier into friendship. Old friends have either ghosted me or betrayed me in some way, and it feels like I'm alone now. 

I see a lot of birthday posts here for people that feel the same. Do you ever just give in and be alone? I am so sick of being lonely and having no one to even send a meme to that I want to give up on socializing. Probably turning into a true loner at this point, but does anyone think they'd be happy as a loner? I feel like I'm being forced to accept my fate here. Covid stole my youth so might as well wallow in my age."

We were seven people split into smaller groups of 3/3 and me. Since I didn't like the fact that I was falling out, I went ahead to not disturb any of the conversations and settled with the idea of going home early. Omw I got called by one of the Others, asking me where I was. In my stupidity I answered and waited for them, knowing I wouldn't really blend in anyways. When they arrived it stayed more or less the same, but suddenly I found myself involved in a conversation about the geography of the place we were at, which was close to my home, meaning I knew where shit was. Then a discussion started, regarding the question if there was a trainline in sight or not. Since I was sure there wasn't I went into the discussion with the ambition to win. I don't know how or why, but the debate got heated and I started raising my voice, ending up yelling at the other guy. After that they decided to move on and I left the group. I am now sitting at the point where the railway is supposed to be and wish I was wrong. I might've lost the best friend I ever had, together with basically my entire social environment, because I was to sure of myself and am generally a fuck-up"

lonely,Different type of lonely. Trying to figure how to fill up my free time.,"Different type of lonely. Trying to figure how to fill up my free time. - Hello to everyone

Different type of lonely. That's what I am. Kind of. Most of people here are sad that they are lonely. I am quite too, but I already made peace with it. I am almost 31, not good in relationships with girls. I am not able to express my feelings properly and when I do, other half does not feel it the same way. Also I don't speak when I don't need to. That's life. 

As I am getting older, even though I am still young, I can feel that most people of my age already started having family, weddings and all that weird stuff. Which is allright and I am happy for them. Everybody deserves to be happy. Or everybody can taste the other side of it. I don't mind it but I can feel my circle is getting smaller and smaller. 

I like being lonely. For some time. I can even or would like to live in a small cabin, somewhere in the nature for a few months of a year. Maybe one day

Right now, I have well paid job (in my country), have my own flat (mortgage), some money on my accounts and 25-30 paid days free of work. I am not a career chaser. I want to do my job properly, the best I can and that's it. Some management bullshit can suck my balls.

People here. Who are like to be themselves, who like to be alone even they know that future can be rough. What would you or what have you done to fill up your time? Travel? Gave 100% to some hobby? 

This year, when corona shit will go away slightly, I would love to travel with my car and my bike and connect free time, traveling and my hobby to one single experience package. But still, I am bit afraid I'll do it alone. In a different way.

Thanks"

lonely,Why everything became so monotone ?,"Why everything became so monotone ? - For the context, I am a 19yo french man currently in college. I always had up and down in my life, my father died when I was 11, I have been bullied during secondary school but in the last year of highschool, I thought I was over with all this negativity. I wasn't the popular type but I had friends, even a best friend who was like a brother to me. I had ambition, hopes and dreams, even had some romantic relationships during summer. 

But when the pandemic started I began college, everything changed so fast. As you may know we had a bunch of lockdown and since I studied economy in highschool, learning info and electronic in online classes wasn't an easy task. I tried my best but I failed and now I'm still in first year, working hella hard to pass. So I don't go out a lot and when I do, I'm always worried about college. The reason I'm not going out a lot is also because I lost most of my friends from highschool.
When I moved for the college, I tried to stay in touch with everyone. But I most of them already had a new group of friends and the relationships quickly faded. I also made friend in college but since I failed and they passed, we don't talk to each other much. I know they may have more work, but I feel abandoned, since they still see each other everyday.
Now everything would have been fine if I still had my best friend by my side. But we argued over something stupid and now I'm alone.

This is why now more than ever, I feel crushed and empty. I lost all interest in my hobbies. I used to play basketball and videogames but it's not the same anymore. I have been diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety but I know that this may be nothing compared to other people in this sub. So I feel more and more shit. Everyday. I tried to get new friend in my classroom, but I don't  have this connection I had with my other friends. So I put my earpods and come back home as the classes are over. Everyday looks the same and I don't think I will hold it any longer. But I'm also worried about my future and what will I become if I drop out. My family will probably reign me and I will never be able to recover I guess. So I live like a nobody, faking the same emotions and having the same days. 


I just wanted to write. Maybe it helped, maybe not. Maybe I tried to get attention but I will probably never see this post again."
lonely,Idk if it counts as a vent but I felt like saying it,"Idk if it counts as a vent but I felt like saying it - First of all. I apologise sincerely if this will be seeming more like a child's whining. I do not do that on purpose. I just let out my frustrations not much and they come out like this when I do. I do not intend to behave like ""I'm the worst victim"" and blah blah blah since that is not true and I don't want to make anyone feel like their sufferings are not valid/not as valid as what I may have now. 

So again. I apologise and thank everyone who will read this in advance. Even if not all of this.

So. Argued with my mom cause my roommate (4 in total including me) in the house I rented for university did not understand that I asked her (E) and another roommate of ours (F) to use the shower of the bathroom I use since I will have to work in the hospital for traineeship. My mom wanted me to take care of it. But I hate to do things like these. Every time I say something to get respected I cause a mess and end up misunderstood. Like this time. Since she took it as ""an oppression"" since she thought I could not allow them to bring friends over... one question. WHEN DID I SAY IT? I JUST ASKED ""Please not use the shower I use because it's a personal hygiene local"". In a POLITE WAY. I never said you couldn't go out and/or bring friends over. So there goes the argue

Then I had unease again because I have been experiencing much unease with myself (AMAB) and I want to be a girl (not gonna expand this too much. And it is *not* to create drama. Just saying it to... I guess put everything here).

And remembered that my family is absolutely unsupportive. That the only time my mother barely talked to a specialist about this sensations he said ""It is not about gender, it is more probable than he has autism"". So great. (Again. I sincerely apologise if I am being too childish. I do not want to create drama. I just need to let out some stress😞)

And also remembered that I can't really differentiate friendships from ""Something more"" and have fear that I'll never have a person for me since I can't understand if I have romantic attraction or not. I know it is not a priority or anything... I just feel so alone cause no one in my physical life understands me and the only people I can be sincere with are from other countries and I only talk to them online.

And now I've been closed in the bathroom for more than 30 minutes. Sat down. Talking with people on the phone trying to kill the time. Feeling like I want to die. Love these days😞

And... yeah I guess if you red everything of this I will gift you a virtual hug if you need and most importantly my most sincere THANK YOU for using your time to read my vent. Not a problem if you cannot/do not want to answer❤"
lonely,What do I do?,"What do I do? - I don't know what to do. Being feeling like depressed and extremely lonely. It has been like this for the past 2 years but more prominent for the past month or so.  I don't want to do this anymore. I got no one to talk to. I envy people who have people close to them to hangout during christmas, new years, for their birthday or even just daily. I been alone my whole life. Just being me and my family. But not anymore. My family is just a piece of shit. Never felt connected and so now I am just left with myself.

 I have been socializing... but it is always me initiating. I keep making plan, keep texting people, being active in servers/group chats but all that effort gets ignored. The moment I stop texting.. the moment I stop reaching out. They all stop talking/hanging out with me. 
Being talking to this person pretty much every day for a good month and a half. Thought things were going good and that I finally found someone who connects with me... but just to test (this might sound horrible) , I stopped texting for a few days. And nothing. Absolutely nothing. And now...heck, I would be glad if I get a reply in a day's time. 

It has always been like this since I was a kid. I pretty much spend summers texting/hanging out with no one. Just me and only me in my room. I had people to talk to in school. But that's it. I just want somebody to be by my side. Somebody to rely on. Somebody who actually puts in the effort and listens. Of course, people say positive shit like "" things will be better,"" "" u will fine somebody,"" "" go to a therapist,"" "" start doing stuff on your own. Try to enjoy the time by yourself,"" but why can't they understand it is not that easy. I have been doing stuff on my own for pretty much my whole life. I don't wanna spend another second by myself. The more I live,  the more I realize that I will be alone. That spending time by myself is twisting what's wrong and what's right. And so when I actually interact with people, I only realize how abnormal I am. The only thing I can say is loneliness makes u cold, stoic, and eventually u start living in your own world to cope with it.

This might be messy, jumping from spot to spot. But bare with it pls."

It’s 2 AM and I can’t sleep thinking about the guy who ghosted me almost a year ago. I knew him since high school yet I still remember a lot of the things we talked about because I enjoyed talking to him very much. We stopped talking during college and reconnected last year. 

Then one day, he just never responded. I didn’t want to double text him because I have been humiliated by double texting a couple of times before. So I let it be. 

One thing I can say is that he is an amazing guy. The woman who has his heart is sure to be lucky. Too bad he thinks of himself so negatively. He often told me about his self-esteem issues and I did my best to tell him he’s a good-looking guy and an even kinder person. 

Little does he know that he was perfect in my eyes. But what good does it do when I was just another person to him. 

He’s passionate and smart. He loves his family very much. He has so many dreams. He loves seeing the best in everyone except himself. He’s caring. He’s funny and adorable in his own way. And he was the only guy to ever understand me in every way possible; he made me feel seen. Of course, there were disagreements here and there but we often laugh it off.

I just hope he’s happy. I hope life is treating him well and that he fulfills his dreams because he deserves it. I pray for his safety every time I can. 

I hope one day I’ll wake up one and finally forget everything about him because I have felt empty ever since he left."

lonely,Virtual Social Anxiety Anonymous; open again to new members,"Virtual Social Anxiety Anonymous; open again to new members - Hi everyone, and happy new year!

Because social anxiety can trigger loneliness and isolation, and as someone who is lonely because of my own social anxiety as well, I wanted to share my post with this community.

About a month ago, I had announced that some fellow redditors and I would be starting a Social Anxiety Anonymous virtual support group; and we’ve done it! After a couple of months of hard work, we’ve managed to bring together a supportive community dedicated to helping one another overcome social anxiety.

To do so, my group and I meet virtually, once weekly, for an hour, over Zoom, where we discuss helpful tools to manage the stress and symptoms of social anxiety and our own experiences and struggles with it. Personally, I’ve felt that listening to my fellow group members describe their experiences has been incredibly beneficial; it helped me realize that I’m not alone in my struggles. Others have found that the materials we share are beneficial to them; saying that utilizing these tools daily has made a significant impact on their social anxiety. Whatever it is that’s working, it’s working! That is why I’m excited to share that we are re-opening the group to new members.

Originally, when the group started, there were about 20 people interested in joining. So, we made the discord server and voted on a weekly time and day that works best for most people to host our virtual meetings. We found that Saturdays at 9am (EST) worked for a very small majority of the group, but it was the best option we had. Unfortunately, because everyone’s schedules vary greatly, a lot of people couldn’t make these Saturday meetings work and we ended up losing a good chunk of members. That is why we’re re-opening the group. 

We believe that the more active members we have, the more support we can give to each other. So, right now we have \~4 active members who attend our weekly meetings and we’re looking to bump up that number. 

There is a limit to the number of people who can join, unfortunately. Because a large portion of the weekly meeting is spent asking questions and sharing our experiences, we can’t have too many active members or the meetings would run wayyyy too long. So, we’ve agreed to cap the group at 15 active members total. So, if you’re interested, I’ve included a link to our discord server below where you can come and check us out. 

It’s important to know that there is no pressure to talk whatsoever during weekly meetings; some people benefit simply from taking in what others have to say. Also, to protect our member's privacy, when you first join the discord, you won’t be able to see any of the channels until I change your status to “Member” which I will do in 24hrs or less. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

Cheers!"

I kinda wanna make myself happy on my own, because I have no one to celebrate with, and because I wanna embrace this exponentially growing solitude. Thanks :)"
lonely,It’s complicated.,"It’s complicated. - So, to start I randomly meet a guy about eight years ago at a concert. Gave me his number but I lost it. I was so mad at myself. We had such a great time. Cliché as it is, I knew I wanted to be close to him as soon as I met him. My friend had hung out with his friend that night and also exchanged numbers. I was totally bummed about losing his number. I felt some strong connection. Turns out he got mine from his friend so it all worked out!

We chatted, fucked, hung out many times for years. It was always so easy and flawless. Everything was like a dream. Granted we never established a relationship so it was always just mutual. Due to distance I never got to try and have a relationship with him, but my heart aches for his company. I always felt that we belonged together. I was always afraid he was too good for me, due to my lack of self esteem. 

I had spent some time in the hospital unexpectedly and lost all his information and no way to contact him. Unintentionally ghosting. (I was in a coma.) Once I got well again, I was longing for his company and then there he was again. Always there whenever I needed or wanted him. Always showing up at the right times. We both saw other people (obviously) over the years. I always had a feeling we would be together eventually. 

Now for the fun part. Even though we both are seeing other people, we talk everyday. The connection made my heart race (amongst other things.) I was looking at his social media and there it was. His name tagged. My heart shattered as I saw it. A million perfect memories, perfectly ruined. A baby announcement. 

Today, I found out that he is having a baby. 

I don’t really know what I am wanting from this post. Maybe just to vent, say it to myself, try to not feel the insane heart wrenching emptiness that I’m feeling. 

I’m a 33 year old female that knows much better. He never wanted me or else why wouldn’t he have said so. This is the end of something I’ve been holding onto with hope for years. 

So empty."

I won with anxiety and shyness - came back. My financial situation was pretty good - now I’m in debt, because he works, but doesn’t make money. I lived I big city - now I live in small, boring city, because I had to rent bigger apartment. I wanted to stay in one settle down already - he decided, we will move to the other side of the country, because he likes it more in there and I can’t stay here alone, because he pissed some people off and now they are angry with me as well (he slept with couple of married woman and took some jobs without finishing them. He didn’t take money for part that he he has done.). I had to leave good job to get one with better  money, but now I’m not sure how long will I be able work here. My skin condition came back from stress, I have to resign from voice rehabilitation, because we will move out from only city in my country where I can do it( my larynx doesn’t work properly and by throat is bloodied so I have trouble speaking and my voice sounds really bad).  I can no longer afford therapist. I couldn’t find friends in new city and now I have to move out. On top of that he wasn’t able to earn anything in best part of the country for his job and he wants us to move out without money. I had to drop out of university because I couldn’t afford tuition fees.

But events always happen. I broke up with my SO and now I've lost all connection I've had with those two people. (They're best friends with eachother)

I'm just on the sidelines. I've tried making friends but I always have the tendency to end up disliking them or end up ghosting them. I can't stop myself from thinking humans are more trouble than they're worth.

But it all makes me very lonely. I crave friendship.. but at the same time I loath it. I cannot achieve it."

The problem here is that because I’m extremely introverted, my chances of making any friends at all are very slim. I feel lonely but kind of enjoy? Along with that, I feel so weird, like really weird. Everything is so new but at the same time I just, I don’t know, I’m very confused right now with my life. I feel like I had way too high expectations when moving here. I though a fresh start would help me become less introverted and start to use my time doing productive stuff.

lonely,[Vent] Why can't I fit in anywhere,"[Vent] Why can't I fit in anywhere - I don't fit in anywhere, even on the internet. It's like no matter where I go, no matter who I talk to or do, I get rejected. I'm not talking about romantic relationships. Even in regular conversations, friends, family, etc. I always never fit in. I get called weird and annoying all the time and I never understand why.

I have several reddit accounts where I just pretend to be asking questions in specific subs just to pretend to be part of the community. I always end up getting 0 attention or even downvoted whenever I say literally anything in a post or comment. I never say anything rude, so I just don't get it. I just want to fit in and feel like I'm a human being but right now I feel like a mistake, and I'm not going to lie I've started getting suicidal thoughts. 

I have no friends. I lost my  ""friends"" I had last year because I found out the whole group secretly hated me. I can't make new friends due to the reasons I mentioned in the beginning of the post. And I try so hard. I go on subs specifically made for meeting people and I always end up tailoring my personality to be compatible with theirs just so they can like me, or tolerate me. I'm tired of it, I just want to be myself and have someone like me for it.

At the moment I only have a couple of aquantinces. I decided to remove all my ""friends"" in my contacts because they only even burn me out.

I put in effort in my past friendships. If someone forgot their lunch I will pay for them. If it's their birthday I will wish them a happy birthday and buy a decent gift. If they're down I'd listen and give my advice, I check up on them. I haven't done this to get something in return but can't they put in some effort into the friendship too? 
I feel unwanted, I just want a friend who understands me but I can't find anyone. I am not pushing all the blame to my old friends but they really burnt me out.

I just don't have hope that I'll find anyone who cares about me.

I'm tired of the throwaway advice. People are so quick to say the same old things when they just want to free themselves from guilt. I can't find any link minded people. I've had an awful last year and I don't want to ruin then new year with depressing thoughts at least not so soon."

lonely,What’s less than trash?,"What’s less than trash? - At this point, I’m fairly certain that I will be alone forever. I hate myself with a passion and that seems to really get in the way whenever I try to interact with a person who I want to be friends with or maybe something more. I just don’t know what to say beyond, “How’s your day been.” They’ll say some stuff and then my anxiety’ll kick in and be like, “You know you’re disgusting, right? This person definitely thinks your hideous. They would rather do anything else than talk to you. Get out of this, NOW! You can’t know this person because then they’ll know you and then they’ll hate you because you’re a horrible person. You would add absolutely nothing to this person’s life and guess what, they definitely know it, too. Their life would be so much better if you just left them alone. Notice how no one ever approaches you and asks you how your day was unless they felt obligated to?” I try to block these thoughts, but they make their way through any sort of mental firewall. I have probably one good friend and even they don’t reach out to me unless they need something. I’m not even 20 yet, but at this rate, it doesn’t look too good. How could I have gotten this far in life and not once has someone besides a relative reached out to me just to talk or check in or even just say “hi”? I don’t deserve friends or love because I know I’m trash, but even trash is another person’s treasure. I’m whatever is less than trash, the thing that nobody wants anything to do with."

The only problem is, I tend to self sabotage. 

They have had a difficult past, experienced loss and many devastating things that really break my heart. Sometimes my habits, like drinking or smoking, trigger them. It’s not an addiction, I don’t do it excessively, but I still do because of my depression (they don’t know about it). I feel so selfish for being in a relationship, because I feel like I’m going to be the cause of us breaking up. 

I’ve had suicidal thoughts for almost two years and recently started to self harm again, I don’t have anyone to talk to about this because I don’t want to trigger, upset and honestly bother anyone. I feel like my depression is not relevant, since they (my partner) and many more have had it way worse than me. Who am I to feel like this. 

I just need someone to talk to about this that feels the same way.

I wish I was normal enough or if things in life where just different to try to go out with someone. It doesn't help that I barely have much experience with the opposite gender much at all. I wish there was a way to truly not be attracted to anyone and spare feeling so alone and needy for affection. I feel even if I do things like try to distract myself from this feeling it is always there its all I think about the majority of the time and it makes me feel worse.

I saw my former crush in the mall after two years of zero interaction (pandemic, locked at home). Guess I still get those giddy feelings around him till now. He said I looked good, we talked a little, and I stuttered and probably sounded awkward af. He apparently told my friend that we bumped into each other too. I don’t know if he still has a girlfriend right now and I don’t really need to know. I just feel sad instead of happy after seeing him, and it’s not even because of his relationship. It’s just knowing that my best friend is practically besties with him too that hurts, especially since I was only close friends with him briefly in the past. To add to that, everyone I know is getting into relationships and here I am still lonely af, with my self-esteem debilitating more and more each day."
lonely,I only feel lonely when there's other people in my life,"I only feel lonely when there's other people in my life - Hey, life long loner here. I'm in my early 20s, moved around a lot ever since I was a kid so ever maintained any actual friendships. 2 years is about the longest I've known someone and could consider them a friend (thought that person and I no longer speak and even then there was a period where we didn't talk for an extended period of time before reconnecting, due to issues). 

I've tried making friends online several times, but I've sadly noticed that most people cannot maintain a proper flowing conversation and they seem to lack the drive required to put in effort. Therefore, most the time it felt like I was doing all of the work when it came to communicating. Either that, or I was always the one reaching out first to begin with. It was like this for damn near everyone I've been acquainted with. If I don't reach out first, they'll never check on me (save for a select few), and we'll essentially never be talking. I got tired of seeing my ""friends"" online, wondering when they'll message me to see what's up or have a nice chat. They rarely did. I got tired of feeling like no one gave a rats dick about my existence. I got tired of keeping around these ""friends"" that I never speak to. Friends that essentially, reinforce my feelings of loneliness x100. 

So I deleted all social media. All I have is Reddit now. I don't have anyone that I talk to irl nor online. I'm not close to anyone. I do my own things, keep myself company, enjoy my hobbies, eat whatever I want whenever I want, sleep whenever I want for as long as I want, and just generally live my life the way I want to without being worried about other people's opinions or what other people are doing, or wondering why they never reach out to speak to me. 

Point being, I don't feel lonely when I'm completely alone. In fact, I feel like I've been able to grow more as a person this way."

lonely,Officially lost all of my friends to their relationships,"Officially lost all of my friends to their relationships - I have officially lost all of my friends to their relationships. 

I'm the last single friend of all 3 of my main friend groups and although I am absolutely ecstatic that my friends are happy, it's hard. We all used to hangout almost daily but as they got into relationships, their priorities shifted (understandably so) and their lives began to surround their boyfriends and they completely forgot about me.

Hanging out with them is either them going on a double date with me 5th wheeling, and if we decide to have a girls night out all they do is talk about their boyfriends or call them. We still have normal conversations, but there is no escaping the fact that I feel lonely in every crowded room. I recently went to a new years eve party and I must admit that the countdown was a reminder of how lonely I am.

I don't have the best luck with guys and they approach everyone in my group except me- it just hurts.

I've talked to them about it, and they are sympathetic and try to make me feel better, but the truth still remains: there's no way I'm getting them back unless I, myself, get a boyfriend OR keep agreeing to being an unwanted tag along while everyone sucks each others faces off.

I crave the intimacy that a relationship could bring, and my heart yearns for someone to love and to love me, but this whole experience makes me feel extremely undesirable."
lonely,Emotional Crash,"Emotional Crash - I don't know how long its been since I've last cried. Tonight has been one hell of an emotional rollercoaster and I just couldn't help myself. I had many thoughts go through my head some about who I actually am, what I want, and all I know is I don't want to be lonely. Yes, I have friend and family but I still end up feeling lonely at times. Its not just someone being there that makes you not feel lonely, its more than that. Its the emotional aspect. Being there, listening, connecting, and caring for each other. I might need to just get out of my shell and do what I want for a while. Maybe I need to travel and live somewhere different. Maybe I just need a change of pace is all. I just want to feel like I'm needed and wanted on a deep emotional level with someone. I've been lonely this way far too long and it's just recently getting to me. I hate crying and It just keeps happening over and over tonight. Maybe I needed this much of an emotional crash to realize what I'm missing. Hopefully it passes with time and I realize what I need and want.

I'm sorry if this got you emotional it wasn't meant for that. It was a way to help myself and others realize that things will eventually get better. Good things will come for those who open up to themselves and be truthful and comfortable with who they are. Truthfully I'm not entirely sure who I am, or what I want at the moment, but I'm going to try and push forward.

lonely,Very lonely as of late,"Very lonely as of late - The last two years have been very rough.  


My personal life consists of going to work every day and then coming home, doing fuck all until I sleep and go to work the next day.  


I don't really take enjoyment from my old hobbies anymore. I used to love to fish, do other stuff outdoors, things like that.  


The only thing I take real pleasure from anymore is roleplaying on tabletop and discord. The high adventure stuff is fun, but lately I've just been craving the slice of life kind of stuff, because I can play someone who has value, is in a relationship, has stuff going in their life, someone who is loved and is able to give it without being a socially awkward weirdo. It's something I crave so, so much that even this form of getting it by proxy is just satisfying. Up until I take a moment to realize that it's all ficitonal, and then I just end up feeling empty inside again.  


I have friends and family, and they are supportive, but I feel like a burden. They are all moving forward and getting all of the good things in life. I don't really like parties or the bar scene like they do, so the only time I get real social interaction is on game night. They treat it as a hobby, but it's become essential to me for the reasons above, and it's the only time I get social interaction too.  


When I'm not being a nerd and wasting countless hours on the internet, I watch romance movies now too, because I want that so much.  


I just hope there is either something after this life, maybe someway to experience some of the stories I've created first hand, or some sort of reincarnation. I hate my life, I want to get off this ride, but I don't want to be even more of a burden and cause the few people I do care about pain if I leave early.  


At least typing all of this out helps, if only a little."

* The US had one MILLION COVID-19 cases today. We gotta get our shit together.
* Babe Ruth hit most of his home runs AFTER Betty White (RIP) was born.
* Brown Butter Chocolate Chip cookies look REALLY good, and not that hard to make.

They haven't for so long. I have people that hit me up but no real close friendships and it depresses me. My life is so bland. Also, I should be modeling a healthy social life for my children. That's another layer of sadness on top. I've been to therapy. I have a daily mindfulness and journal habit going for a while now. I take meds. I need action. I also need answers. Why am I like this?

lonely,"Extreme, crippling, isolation (22M)","Extreme, crippling, isolation (22M) - Got bullied growing up in school. I have never had any friends. The bullying was so bad I dropped out of public school to become homeschooled. I was bullied because of a birthmark I had as a young child, I had a birthmark on the neck that was large in size and made me an easy target for the other children. I grew up hating myself and what I looked like, so I was forced to leave public schools.   
My family was always very poor growing up, so I never had money to go out and meet people. My parents were also naturally homebodies, always using money or health reasons as an excuse to never leave the house. I have just been isolated from social circles for my entire life. I will be turning 23 next month, and I have barely ever had a girlfriend. I kissed a girl when I was 16, we dated for like a month, and then she broke up with me shortly thereafter. The relationship was not great anyways, I was clearly the more invested one, she didn't like me that much, or, at least, wasn't mature enough to know how to communicate that interest. It should probably be noted or mentioned, as I got older, this birthmark faded away, and is no longer even visible. It just vanished with time. So this is no longer any issue, whatsoever.  


I do not have any social skills. None, period. I would not consider myself an introvert, I am very, highly, extroverted. I love meeting new people, and I love going out. It's just the environment that I have been raised in and been brought up, has made it difficult to meet new people and going out. I have lived an extremely sheltered life; talk about having no life experiences or memories. Honestly, I just want a girlfriend. I have been wanting a girlfriend for quite some time now. Of course, I have no idea how to interact with girls I like, as I have never talked or interacted with girls before. I met this girl at work recently that I REALLY liked, I mean, REALLY, REALLY, liked. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever met before in my life. I was extremely stupid, and idiotic, and pretty much had some sort of love at first sight infatuation with this girl, where I was just awestruck by her beauty and her outgoing persona. She was everything I was not, good social skills, charming, able to hold a conversation.  
I ended up telling this girl how I felt about her too quickly, too soon, which resulted in her telling me that she was creeped out by me. But I did feel like she sent me a lot of mixed signals; she told me I was a very intelligent guy, that I was sweet, and handsome, etc. She would always joke and play with me, playful, teasing banter, and, I would, of course, take this as flirting, on top of all the other things that she said, I did ask her if she was interested in a relationship, to which she said no. I was really stupid, and had this no really means try again ideology. I would always mistake her just being nice to me as her flirting with me, or being romantically interested. I felt like the mixed signals were very present, or perhaps, I just misinterpreted her being nice and friendly as being romantically interested.  
This resulted in her blocking me and causing me A LOT of problems at work, where she had spread through the workplace that I was a creep, desperate, weirdo, and didn't take ""no"" for an answer.  


It was never my intention to harass her, I just genuinely misunderstood her mixed fucking signals.  
Calling me sweet, handsome, and intelligent? And it was her idea to add me on snapchat, and instagram, so we could exchange photos to each other and get to know each other more. Mind you, this was her fucking idea. Talk about some goddamned mixed signals. Shit pisses me off. Makes me so damn angry when people can't just give you a simple yes or fucking no, it's like they are halfway yes, and halfway no. Just give me a simple fucking answer, and I will be at rest. Shit. Then she proceeds to tell everyone at work that I am the problem, that I was some stalker crazed weirdo that wouldn't take no for an answer. Like, no, it was your mixed fucking signals driving me up a fucking wall. Like, can you really not see that?  


I am isolated from social groups, and being made into a total fucking outcast at my workplace now, because of this whole shitty situation. I am extremely alone, no friends, no social groups, haven't had a girlfriend in seven fucking years, still a virgin, obviously. I try so fucking hard to be a good guy to this girl and she goes and treats me like this. I'm probably going to lose my job over this shit as well on top of it. That is really what makes me the most angry. You can reject me, FINE. But don't cause me problems at my fucking workplace of all places and cause me to get fired, just because I was interested in you, and misinterpreted a few of your mixed goddamned signals."

lonely,Tis that fucking time of the year again - A new year rant,"Tis that fucking time of the year again - A new year rant - Hello reddit! Hope y'all are having a much better time than me, either in action or in thoughts; and a big hug to all of you (for those who don't like hugs, I hope fist bumps will suffice), and I ultimately hope you all a fantastic new year.

This is a venting exercise that I hope will at least unload some feelings I have that has been eating at me for quite some time, and in doing so, I believe should make me feel slightly better. Selfish reasons, I know. 🤷🏼‍♂️

I will try to keep this as short as possible (update: I failed 😔).

I am a 35 year-old human male, with almost no friends, no relationships (or dating) history, no past sexual/intimate experiences at all, almost zero outdoor experiences (started hiking last year with a total of two hikes), and with a severe crippling depression, which lately started to turn into a soul crushing beast that tries to suffocate the living shit out of me, which can be a little bit inconvenient.

I find it difficult to connect to people; which led me to currently having 4 close friends, three of them I share nothing with. They are still good friends and everything, but apart from sharing similar sense of humor, we don't really connect in almost anything and we don't really understand what the other goes through when we vent to each other. But we make do, and we manage to come up with enough understanding and distraction to serve the purpose.

Also the people I seem to connect with fade away in the long term, and as such I didn't manage to maintain a friendship with people I connected with for more than a year, which is also a little bit inconvenient and feeds my overthinking and insecurities in a strongly negative way.

In addition to all of this, my life was greatly affected by a religious transformation I had to go through on my own over the past five years, something that had held me back in life, have kept me away from my friends and family^((\*)) and was the main reason why I struggled to find people to connect with or have relationships in general. This transformation reshaped my character in many different ways, and changed so much of my views about life.

It has also led me to an important fact: that life is full of possibilities \*gasps\*, and these possibilities include meeting someone you connect with, fulfilling a lifelong dream, continuously live life one day at a time, or be alone. I have also come to terms with the fact that there is nothing wrong with any of these possibilities, as long as you know what you want out of life and learn to make the most out of it on your own terms. Except that the one where I could end up alone would suck a little bit because I am inherently a social person. 🤷🏼‍♂️

So I have made the life changing decision to not change anything about my life at all, just do the things I enjoy doing, pursue the dreams I want to pursue, meet people and interact with them; if I connect with some of them, that's a fantastic bonus; if that connection leads to something more than a friendship, even better. The only difference is that I won't hold back**^((\*\*))** when it comes to making the most out of my time on this earth, or other planetary bodies^((\*\*\*)).

I am also learning how to live with disappointments, how to overcome them, and how to limit their influence on my enjoyment of life. That bit is quite difficult especially with overthinking and with that soul crushing monster squeezing my heart out, but I am slowly controlling these aspects of my life, and also I am not giving up to that prick that easily.

Well, that's that. Thank you for reading this article, I very much appreciate it; and sorry for the long rant.

Have the best year yet!

lonely,I hate who i am.,"I hate who i am. - I’m currently laying in bed just replaying moments in my life and i realize that i have always been the person everyone hated, everyone picked on, targeted, bullied, controlled and so on. I’ve never been anyones favourite person or someones first choice. I’ve always been a joke or a last option. I’ve always been awkward and shy and always molded into what others may like, they never ended up liking that version of me so i tried to go back to the quiet shy me but that never worked. I spent my whole life living a lie because i was so ashamed of who i really was. I didn’t have the nicest things, the best home life, the prettiest face. I didn’t have a good start in life and i grew up always searching for acceptance from anyone who would give it to me. I never had a solid group of friends. I was always alone. No one ever wanted to talk to me. I always had to make the first move. And when i did make a friend they turned put to be so unbelievably toxic and controlled me and i acted accordingly because i was scared of being alone and rejected. I was scared no one would like me for me because whenever i act like myself I’m weird, annoying, awkward. Yea. I really truly hate who i am."

lonely,So lonely...,"So lonely... - 25F, I'm so so lonley...let me explain. 

I have a loving partner who's great, and I appriciate him so much. However, I want friends...I have 2 ""best friends"" who never speak to me unless I make conversation first. 

Im just reflecting back to Last week, I found they both went out together, 3 times in the week, for meals and drinks. Understandably, one of them has just broke from a long term relationship, but she didn't even tell me, I found out through social media. The other day, they both asked could they come to my house to ""get her out the house and keep her mind occupied"" obviously being the person I am, I said yes. They said to me ""should we get a takeaway"" and again, I said yes, thinking we would all chip in but I ended up paying for it all, over £40 and I'm the one on the lowest wage out of us all. They said if I sent my bank details over they'd send me money when they got home, so I did....no money even went in my bank, i wouldn't mind...but I ordered the least expensive thing, their food was so expensive. I did ask (shouldn't ask for my own money back) and completely got ignored. I wouldn't mind usually, but it's just been Christmas and I've been left with £12.43 in my bank until February. I had no thank you for letting them come over, no thank you or nothing. 

It's been over a week now, but it's been on my mind since I found out they went out together without an invite, I'm 25 and I've been friends with one of them for 20 years, the other (who just invited herself into our friendship) around 10 years. They've made me feel like this lots of times, but I don't want to let them go as friends as its all I've known. They're shitty friends, I know this, but if I don't have them, I literally don't have ANYONE apart from my boyfriend. I know I should be thankful, but there's just times i want to go out with friends, shopping, drinks, for food...but I can't, because when I ask, I get ignored, or I don't don't gey invited. 

I don't know what to do, I say that if I don't have these 2 I won't have nobody, but it already feels like I have nobody 😞"

I worked since the night, and for what? I've got advanced so little that i actually fear they accuse me to didn't have anything and fire me...i'm not even sure it'd bother me at this point.

So, i finished just to start my school project, which will have to be surrender in 1 month and about what nobody progressed. In the final i didn't even starting it cause i was paralysed by tireness and anxiety. So i'm pretty sure i'll be even more stressed tomorrow.

And all that for what? Living in my mother basement, save coin and maybe, maybe have odd one day to buy an appart?

I laid myself bare at your feet,
Peeling back the walls inch by inch
Until there was nothing but flesh and blood
Pumping viciously 
To the rhythm of your tune
A tune that has now faded into oblivion
Gone as you are
I thought you beautiful
The only light in my black room
Now only black remains
As you flip the switch
And yet I sit in darkness' blanket, waiting for you"

I haven’t really had a proper friend since leaving school. Even then, no one Ive ever considered a friend has been real with me.

I’m desperate, I need friends. I’m nearly ready to give up on life. I literally don’t care if you genuinely like me, or if you just try and get to know me out of pity. It’s near the end for me I think. I just want to be able to say I have at least one friend— even if I know I’m lying to myself.

I thought I could write a little list of struggles I have and see if anyone felt they could relate to me... if I get more than one person I’ll make a group chat, and maybe we could have a nice supportive online friendship circle. First thing out of the way— please do NOT contact me if you are under the age of 18. I am F20.


STRUGGLES: 


— I struggle with a lot of mental health issues— including, anxiety, depression, psychosis, bouts of agoraphobia, PTSD and possibly borderline though I have not yet been diagnosed with that last one. Mental health issues run deep in my family, and I like to think I’m an understanding person/ good shoulder to cry on. If you aren’t an emotional person I might be unpalatable for you.

— I am neurodivergent, specifically autistic.

— My anxiety, essentially,  makes it hard to leave my house. Recently, every time I’ve left my house and had to interact with anyone— when I get back home I feel legitimately suicidal because all I can think about is how awkward and accidentally horrible I am— no wonder everyone hates me. I feel helpless... like there’s nothing I can do to make myself likeable or even just not hateable. Growing up, my mum was schizophrenic and illogical thinking specifically paranoid thinking was introduced to me as normal. I saw this incredible kind woman (although she was definitely not a perfect mother) get treated badly even though she deserved the world and it still fucks with my head when I really think about it.

- My PTSD stems from childhood bullying. I get really uncomfortable when talking negatively about people aka gossip, which I’ve been told is a normal part of friendship and I need to get used to.

— you’ve probably already figured this out that because of the way I feel about myself I don’t work. I want to, really, but I’m just so scared and incompetent that I just don’t know what to do. I’m currently doing an online course in animal care— it’s the first stepping stone on my trying to get a job and I’m so fucking scared.

— it frustrates me when people consider themselves lonely purely based on the fact they don’t have a relationship. Makes me want to cry and scream to myself— trust me, having a partner and no friends is millions and millions of times worse than having friends but not having a partner.

THINGS I ENJOY:

— Recreational use of marijuana. I also tried cocaine for the first time for NYE. I haven’t tried any other drugs but would be willing to experiment with some. I like drinking too!

— Psychology.

— Cooking/Baking.

— Creating stories.

— Spirituality. Specifically zodiacs and tarot.

— Animals. Especially small ones. I have two pet rats and a hamster and they are the lights of my life. (As is my boyfriend!)

- The TV show Bojack Horseman.

Thank you so much if you got this far. Please give me a chance, I’ll try my hardest to be the best friend I can be."

lonely,"31 year old, I don't even know what it's like to cuddle with someone","31 year old, I don't even know what it's like to cuddle with someone - How sad is that 🙃

short backstory: bullied as a child and teen which has left me with very low self confidence, I've been on occasional dates and some of them even go well with the guy wanting to meet me again but I can never seem to make a connection or feel attracted to them and it never goes anywhere. I wonder if my low self confidence contributes to that somehow and if I should seek some sort of help, like with a therapist? I'm so tired of everyone around me, both friends and family, having someone while the last time I kissed a guy was 10 years ago. Don't get me wrong, I *have* been in love before so I doubt that I'm asexual or aromantic, it's just been years since it happened for me and with every passing year it really feels like it gets increasingly harder. Of course, the number of men I dare to meet from dating apps aren't many and sometimes my confidence has been so low that I would cancel dates or end up ""ghosting"" them simply from being afraid that they wouldn't like me (or even that I wouldnt like them and be disappointed yet again). And the few times I have liked someone (as in from guys I met casually, through work or whatnot, were either taken or just weren't interested back). 

I just... don't know what to do anymore. I have a decent life otherwise but sometimes the loneliness and feeling of being so different from ""everybody else"" that comes crawling every single time I see a couple can be crushing (sometimes I cant even bare to hang out with my friends if they bring their boyfriends due to feeling envy). I have wondered several times if I really should seek some sort of therapist about my self-image and loneliness and was wondering if anyone else here has done the same? Or just in general feel stuck in a similar situation to mine? Anyway if you read all this, thank you for the time &lt;3 I just needed to vent and it looked like this would be a good place to do so 🙂 (also I had to write all this on my phone as my pc is fucked, so I apologize for any errors or the compressed writing)"

lonely,Just need a place to vent,"Just need a place to vent - I don’t know how to gather my thoughts or anything so I’m just gonna write. I’m 17 years old and for the past year and a half I’ve been consumed by loneliness. I always try to attribute my sadness to other sources or find solutions around it due to my social anxiety and severe lack of social skills, but I’m just tricking myself. I no longer have full good days. The best I get are bipolar days where I where I have really high highs followed by depression. That or I manage to get high on marijuana without it making me severely depressed and lonely, a rare occasion these days. There’s just always this void. Sometimes it’s anxiety, sometimes it’s depression, sometimes it’s a deep emptiness. Even when I have these bipolar type highs there’s this underlying feeling that something’s wrong. I don’t know why is humans are so cursed. I think everyone deserves love but relationships are just so convoluted and even when people do decide to form friendships and romance there’s abuse and complications and all sorts of stuff. Sometimes I wish sex didn’t exist, to me it just feels like the source of so much evil. And it’s like I’m not even in control of my own body. Even though I feel this way, I’m still biologically programmed to lust because we’re just a bunch of highly evolved apes that reproduce forever for no discernible reason. And it’s skewed my view of people too. I can no longer see them as the sort of conscious, almost divine in a way beings that I once did, and only see monkeys whose actions are informed by a core of indulgence and lust. It’s almost like an obsessive form of thinking and I hope I don’t have OCD. 

I often wish I was enough for myself. Like a monk or Nietzsche’s Ubermensch. But I’m a fallible, weak minded being and therefore a slave to my hedonistic desires. I don’t know. I can talk about philosophy and core meanings of my loneliness and justify for the rest of time, but at the root of it all I just feel like shit. Loveless and alone. Fuck the Ubermensch I just want to be held and cared about. 

Here’s a little anecdote. It’s about me 🤗. At one point in time I was so fucked in the head that I became infatuated with the edited girl version of myself. So much so that I planned to lose weight, start wearing makeup, grow my hair, and become her. I just wanted to be a pretty girl. Maybe then I’d get some attention and love. I never went through with it, and it’s probably for the best, I don’t think I’m actually trans, I just wanted to escape myself. But I still find myself infatuated with transgender women in general. Obsessed with one girl in particular. And then I just feel gross again that I’ve allowed myself to become a creature of lust and fetish. 

I have to go and stop writing now, but I hope one day all of our mental health will be stable and we’ll find some truth and meaning in our life, either without other people. I really hope everyone here can find their happiness. Love y’all :)"
lonely,"You're wrong, they're right","You're wrong, they're right - Thinking of the previous post about martyrdom

You know what stoic books and therapists would say, maybe it's you, in the sense that changing your ways is more feasible than trying to change the ways of everyone else.

Then what if it's you and you embraced it fully

Me: ""as far as back as I can see noone really loved me, even parents""
Therapist: ""maybe it's you?""
Me: it's me

Because

I am the Earthly Manifestation of Pure Evil
I am the Lord of Darkness
I am the The One Who Knocks
I am He Who Walks Behind the Rows
I bathe in the tears of the suffering
I swim in the blood of the innocent
I am the Eater of Dreams
I am the Devourer of Souls
I am the pebble in your shoe
I am the black hole at galactic central point
I am Entropy
I shall eat all Energy
I am the Light of millions of Suns exploding
all at once
I am the ringing millions of bells
all at once
millions of bells made of skulls,
I am the Millions of souls screaming in inconsolable anguish
all at once
Throughout space and time
All is pain and suffering
And overall it is all My Doing
I surf on the waves of the Sea of Despair
I command the Armies of Hell at the snap of a finger
I ride with the Apocalypse
I leave behind only the crushed skulls of those who were foolish enough to oppose Me
They shall all burn in Hell

I am Hell

Cursed to roam aimlessly through time and space
Screaming in sorrow and pain

I am the bad guy, and everyone else just collateral damage of me existing

I won't be apologizing for existing any time soon

Deal with it.


N.B. by no way this should be regarded as picking on the post I was referring to, it just made me think."
lonely,Does anybody martyr themselves as a form of coping?,"Does anybody martyr themselves as a form of coping? - Sometimes the pain that comes from lonliness becomes so overbearing that I start to martyr myself. I know it sounds somewhat narciscistic but it kinda helps. When I declare myself a martyr..for myself, I feel stoic. Harder, more sturdy. I get so sick of the turmoil that comes from feeling sorry for myself that I think ""fuck it, I'll be my own martyr if I'm gonna be inevidably lonely. Fine!"". I know.. its rather silly and vain, but i'd rather feel that than the pain and torture of lonileness."

Most people don't like my vibe and other times I don't like theirs. I've had good friends, few. Few means like 2 or 3 who could be honest to me at all times. But times have gone by. After grad, in college I still maintained a straight face being a terrible loner and hiding my vulnerability. I met many people who were at different paths of their own. Some were yeah hi hello bye. Some were good enough to ask. Some are still in contact after 2 years of graduation. But in reality, there's no one. It's wake up, do your work, back to bed and sleep. Life's been fair to me, most times. Now I have enough maturity to embrace myself. I go out by myself. My parents do accompany me most times. They know I don't have anyone to hang out to. Why so lonely? You might ask. You see, I've had friends who stabbed my back. Lying to me in my face and telling me that I'm soft, weak and just another happy go lucky person. I've met many people in these years most people find me naive, stubborn, narcissist and a highly witty and over sarcastic person. I'm not narcissist. But I've chosen to be a hermit,if that supports my answer. I feel I would be better if I'm alone. But I still feel lonely and bored all the time. New to this. Hope atleast someone can tell me something which will be helpful. Cheers. Happy New Year folks."

Can you picture me being a part of that? - You can call me Mallie, though I’m open to a good nickname you’ll invent down the road. I’m a 23 year old male from the United States. Making meaningful friendships with other adults (18+) is what I’m about.

If you’re looking for someone physically attractive, successful or wealthy, you’ll have to look elsewhere because that’s not who I am. To say I’m far from perfect is an understatement. I’ve got my fair share of challenges and then some. 

I value empathy, honesty and maturity, so you can expect me to deliver on that. Authenticity goes a long way - I’d rather us be upfront with intentions and expectations rather than mislead one another. I always appreciate someone with a good sense of humor - sometimes I’m too serious for my own good. 

I can be found volunteering as an emotional support listener online, taking care of my family at home and going for long walks outside. I’ve got a wide variety of interests, so we’re bound to have something to bond over. Let me know what you’re passionate about. 

What was the highlight of your day and what would have made it better? Will the answer to that question involve me someday?"

And I just seem to be stuck, it’s been incredibly hard to make new friends and it hurts when I see others around me being able to make and keep friends easily. 
I’m living away from home, and I feel like, even in a completely new place with new people, I’m still stuck with no friends.

lonely,Lost my entire support structure and am so very lost (rant / advice),"Lost my entire support structure and am so very lost (rant / advice) - The week before Christmas, the woman who had told me that she was with me for the rest of our lives very suddenly decided that she no longer wanted any of those things. On a Fri I was asked to move out, on a Sat I was told we were no longer getting married, and on Sun I was told she wished to be single. This after a relationship that was the most solid thing I personally had ever had in my life, leaving my entire world shattered. Via texts. 

to say I was hit hard, would be a criminal understatement. Completely blindsided by all this (I was actually in the process of planning family activities for that weekend that *she* suggested for our children (separate relationships) and ourselves. I spiraled. Hard. I have CPTSD, so finding ""love"" and a healthy partnership/relationship where I feel safe is so very difficult for me. This has made me feel that I'll never be able to trust again. 

After the split, I reached out to my entire support structure. I raised the alarm, so to speak. The response that I got back was so awfully disheartening. 

I'll admit that the timing was terrible. It was the week of the biggest holiday in the US, and I was asking my peer support group to help me instead of taking that time with their families. But then the holidays ended. I've reached out to them all several times since then, and I've just basically been ghosted by those I considered my friends and chosen family (I don't have any bio fam anymore since I came out as trans many years ago). 

This has left me feeling absolutely terrible. My SI has never been higher, but I've also accepted that I'm ""not allowed to die"" so long as I have a child that depends on me so I just idealize it daily knowing that someday all this pain will end. I've come to realize that I truly cannot rely on anyone when things get hard, and that absolutely terrifies me. Worst, before this, I thought I had a small, but mighty group of people in my corner. Now, I've come to learn that there's literally no one there with me, and I'm just so very tired. 

I'm struggling folks. Usually when I create posts asking for help like this on various subs, I get no response, but I wanted to try one more time, because I'm just that bad. Life carries no meaning to me in this solitary existence. I am wholly unlovable, and I don't know how to move forward alone. Again."

I don't know if i'm crazy posting it on the internet, maybe it's a cry for help or maybe it's an attempt at communication, hoping that perhaps someone would look and say something, it's nothing too.

I'm not a very interesting person in general, i just get the need to tell the people i care about my updates, and well, since i'm lacking in that department at the moment (they don't want to care back), nobody is interested, that's fine i guess.

I guess i prefer to be alone, sometimes i wish these people would be my friends but they don't want to and at the moment, i don't give a shit, i am a little tired of being there for people and the moment i need someone to be there for me, they're nowhere to be found.

I'm already in a really bad state, having them just, turn off their ears at these moments or ghosting me really drove me to stop talking to them as well.

I don't know, i just thought of sharing this, i have nobody else to talk to so i'm posting my stuff to reddit, perhaps someone actually will care other than my therapist during therapy sessions."

life? such a short word. such endless possibilities. but the ending.. well its unknown until it happens.  progress? is something you make over time. even the tiniest things are progress.

(unless thats the current style) something to be happy about. now think of life this way.  a book. every single book has an ending. whether bad or good. its still an ending. some endings happen with no explanation and some have every detail. now dont think to hard about that. because its not really that important. just a thought. now i would love to explain the meaning of life to you: everything in life has some meaning to be put there. trees = filters the air we breathe. coal = fuel. you = a person on earth who may be struggling with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts. sounds familiar huh. well you have a purpose… and it may seem very incorrect (because of the dark place you might be in) but i think the word purpose has a meaning.. just like you. purpose = the reason something was said, done, or created. so you have a purpose. and that purpose is to progress in life and enjoy it while you can. treat everyday like it might be your last. that doesn’t mean become reckless, but to slowly make progress over the years. find put more about yourself, enjoy hobbies and find new ones, and most importantly learn to love who YOU truly are. 
with that being said, never end things over i silly mistake. don’t overthink life. enjoy small things and praise the big. stay safe my love, and whatever you do, never think suicide is an option.

lonely,Solitude,"Solitude - Here's the good news: It really is okay to be alone-- being comfortable in your own skin and in your own beautiful company. When we're out of balance being alone can make us feel lonely and sorry for ourselves, ans we might still feel like this even when we're in company. Sometimes when we think of being alone it can bring a fear of feeling lonely or melancholy, as we often associate being alone with these feelings.

Counterbalance this by observing your blessings and it won't be long before you are in a state of gratitude for your own divine company. This is a message from the Fairies Oracle for whoever needs it. It is time to get more creative or resourceful if you feel you are spending too much time alone."

I take paths meant for many, and face it with nothing but my own wit. 

I travel the streams of life in a boat meant for many, and yet row ever so slowly as I’m without my fellow man. 

I journey through treacherous heights, knowing there is no hand or rope to remedy even the slightest mistake.

I push through the fog of confusion, knowing I have no lantern of clarity in which the flame of companionship burns ever so bright.

I brave the blizzards of heartbreak knowing there is no shoulder in which to warm myself upon.

I embark on quests that I know I’ll never be prepared for, and wonder why I fail. I find problems in life that I know must include another, and yet I am shocked when I bear witness to the results. 

I know the troubles of my life are quite literally in my head, and while I dare to say these wages are unjust for my actions, I know deep within my soul…

lonely,"people who say having no friends is a ""red flags"" are so insufferable","people who say having no friends is a ""red flags"" are so insufferable - it's so annoying to hear *again and again and again*. apart from the fact we're literally in the *middle of pandemic* where we basically can't go anywhere and can't do anything at the places we're allowed to go without masks on and social distancing which makes it literally impossible to make connections irl. there's millions of reasons for people to find themselves alone or isolated or unable to maintain friendships aside from the very narrow mindset of ""they're clearly a terrible person because they have no friends."" i literally dropped out of college at the very start of last year and spent basically a whole year stuck in my room literally alone trying to figure out what to do without anyone to talk apart from just venting to the void on twitter and now bitches are really on that fucking app saying having no friends is a ""red flag"" like what? 😭"

I feel like a loner who is lonely for the first time. I feel like I've wasted the past 30 years of my life. I feel like being gay can be a curse. I feel like I have no right to complain.

I’ve been on vacation from work and school, and just existing in bed or the couch without doing anything, even playing video games just bores me, even social media. 

I don’t know if anyone is or has felt this way, but, I would really like any type of advice. 

Thanks :)"
lonely,Wondering how I’m supposed to go on/fix myself?,"Wondering how I’m supposed to go on/fix myself? - Made this account to protect my anonymity. I’m a 23 year old guy and recently my social life kinda fell apart after I moved back home from graduating college and I lost all my college friends and my girlfriend and I mutually broke up. That was 6 months ago, I work full time with genuinely great people and my ex and I still talk occasionally, trying to remain friends. 

I’m just wondering how it gets better from here? I’ve made work friends but that’s it, they’re just work friends. I’ve made attempts at hanging out with them but I don’t seem to fit in/they already have a circle that I’m not really a part of. I have one work friend in particular who I really get a long with when we work together but I think I’m misreading what that relationship actually is, he doesn’t seem to like me as much as I like him, he’s nice on the job but if I try to reach out when we’re not working he kind of treats me like a distant coworker, doesn’t respond or gives 2 word answers or responds kind of rudely/curtly. The same thing has happened to me with other coworkers, I see snap stories of them at bars together or hanging out at one persons house and Im never invited. My ex girlfriend only talks to me when she needs me, often not responding for several days whereas I respond within the hour 90% of the time. she has a bunch of new work friends that she loves, I feel like everyone is moving on and living their lives and I’m just not a part of any of it. I don’t hold any negativity towards any of them, I know I’m not owed their friendship and they’re not obligated to talk to me, but I feel like I’m a nice guy, I care about people, I try to do the right thing, I’m pretty charismatic, but everyone seems to not need me in their life where I need them. I can’t help but feel kind of lied to when one of my close work friends doesn’t have the same energy when I’m not working with them, it’s like they’re only talking to me because they’re stuck with me there.

What do I do? Is this going to last forever? I’m trying to not fall into a pit of despair like in highschool where i convinced myself that everyone hated me, but I don’t see how it isn’t that way right now. I make efforts to check in on people, but nobody checks in on me or asks me how i’m doing. I just feel crushing loneliness all of the time."

Eating clean, working out 2-3 hours daily. I physically feel great. I don't think I'm unattractive. I'm actually married. Lately I just feel so unwanted, unneeded even. I have this bad habit of getting my hopes up with people and when things end up not going how I thought they would I just can't help but get angry at myself. And to be clear, I in no way blame anybody else, I know it's me. I just yearn to feel wanted again. To feel attracted and sought after. Maybe it's just too late for me and I'm having a hard time accepting that."

lonely,Spirits of Rejection and Spirits of Loneliness,"Spirits of Rejection and Spirits of Loneliness - Were you always the last person picked to be on your baseball, kickball, or football team during lunch in high school? Were you always rejected for Homecoming and Prom? Are your Job Applications being rejected, or denied? Do you feel that even some of your family distrusts you? That even God dislikes you? You may have a Spirit of Rejection. It often teams up with the Spirit of Loneliness, and Orphan Spirits too.

Being denied love and attention by your father growing up can cause you to feel unwanted and unloved. Being denied love and attention from your mother also can cause you to have trust issues. Being bullied as a kid in school can also effect you psychologically. Not having sexual satisfaction, and being sexually frustrated and being rejected by opposite sex, and poor social skills are also symptoms that can manifest.

You are loved. You are loved by God. You are loved by me. You are loved by Angels. And you are loved by each other on this sub. Let us destroy the Spirit of Loneliness, and Spirits of Rejection together. &lt;3"

lonely,"Waves of extreme loneliness [TW; alcohol abuse, suicidal ideation, stalking]","Waves of extreme loneliness [TW; alcohol abuse, suicidal ideation, stalking] - I have very recently been experiencing waves of loneliness that wash over me so totally that all I can do is sob. 

I desperately want to talk to someone but I’m in the UK and it’s 3am and no-one is awake or would even care to help me. 

I don’t know why this is happening. 2021 was the absolute worst year of my life. It marked the 10 year anniversary of my stalker literally trying to ruin my life, of her trying to set my house on fire in 2020, of me losing my job, of me developing excoriation disorder so badly that I’m permanently scarred on about 60% of my skin, of getting clinical depression (again), of falling headfirst into full-on alcohol dependency, of losing a 7 year relationship, of my ex taking my dog, of having to spend over £115,000 to keep my home, of dealing with my mum’s bowel cancer scare, of becoming agoraphobic, of having to go into alcohol detox. It’s just too much. 

I’m trying to be positive, I’m trying to help myself. 

I’m 74 days sober today. I own my own home outright. I’m recovering my liver and digestive function so that they’re better than 7 years ago. I managed to travel to see my dad for the first time in over a year. I’ve started therapy. I’ve been exercising and cleaning and meal prepping and *functioning*. I’m doing better. 

Or…I *was* doing better. 

I want to throw myself into the sea right now, like the piece of rubbish that I am. I can’t get away from these intrusive thoughts - that my ex is painting me like the psycho alcoholic ex-girlfriend, that I’m worthless and won’t ever be able to find and keep a job, that people don’t want to spend time with me or even be seen with me, that I’m so utterly ugly to my core, that I’m broken and just need to be thrown away. 

And that all just makes me so very lonely. How do I deal with this?"

I'm quite active on reddit &amp; post almost daily but mainly because most people (more than likely) don't read my posts &amp; some people don't ask me any questions.Not everything you see is what It seems to be.If my post is too long to read for you - just simply ignore it instead of sending me another super short message

I’m on reddit only because I want to find a friend – life can be tough and we don’t always get what we want.

I used to have so called „friends” but..they’re no longer in my life.Why? I don’t know but let me tell you one thing – A true friend would never just give up on you for no solid reason.What kind of friend would I like to meet on reddit? What are my expectations?

I would like to meet someone in a similar situation – why? Because I honestly feel like only a person with the same expectations and a similar outlook on life would get along with me. I want to talk to other people on a daily basis mainly because..I want to see someone’s effort and because I don’t want to feel like someone’s last option! Not again.Just to make things clear – I’m NOT forcing anyone to talk to me and I’m fully aware that not everyone has enough time to talk to others often and I know one more thing – not everyone wants to talk to other people on a daily basis which I completely do – UNDERSTAND.I often feel misunderstood by people who read my posts.People always giving me unwanted advice and criticising me are just wrong..I’m not a needy person! What I’m simply suggesting is that It’s always possible to find someone to have a random conversation with – someone willing to send you one message once or twice a week..but..It’s almost impossible to find people willing to make time for you.I’m not asking a busy person to make time for me by changing some plans! Absolutely! I’m here to find someone who wants to talk daily (throughout the day or maybe even night) of one’s own will.Someone looking for the same kind of connection.

&amp;#x200B;

Strong friendships are based on mutual support. One of the best things you can do for a friend in need, is just to be there for them when they want to talk.I often see posts from people who always say how friendless they are because they don't feel loved or appreciated by their ""friends"" remember! A true friend - someone who truly likes you or someone who wants to get to know you - will always find time for you. I have a lot of free time (I don't want anyone to send me a message only out of sympathy or boredom though - friendships shouldn't be forced) so..send me a message only If you want to talk often and If you're a talkative person) I'm not really interested in small talk/short messages - I love long and meaningful messages. It's so easy to find someone who loves abbreviations and questions like ""How are you?"" How was your day? Or what are you interested in? But so hard/almost impossible to find a person who knows how to keep a conversation going &amp; show others some effort.

• I do NOT respond to any „Hey,hmu” or „u want to talk” type of messages (super short messages or messages full of abbreviations – I literally can’t stand abbreviations and acronyms in text messages)

&amp;#x200B;

• I don’t talk to people underage and people way older than me (If you want to know why I just don’t feel comfortable talking to kids and people old enough to be my parents – especially online) 18-35 age range (I'm 26)

&amp;#x200B;

• I’m not on reddit to get something off my chest or to find someone to talk to from time to time so If you’re too busy to talk to me or don’t want to talk often..just don’t contact me - I'm not trying to be rude - I just don't want to feel like someone's last option again - I've had enough of ""busy friends"" which is why now I'm looking for something different

&amp;#x200B;

• I’m not looking for a relationship or someone to flirt with so If you want to be „more than friends” find someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

• I don’t respond to messages I don’t find interesting which is why I DON’T mind being ghosted by people who think I’m not „for them” being ghosted after exchanging one or two messages doesn’t bother me.What bothers me is being ghosted by someone I like.Being ignored by someone after days or weeks of daily conversations.

&amp;#x200B;

• I want to talk on reddit first just to make sure If we’re a good match.I’m also not interested in group chats

&amp;#x200B;

• I would rather talk to someone from Europe because Europe is my continent (similar timezones) but even If you’re from the US (for example) but have enough time to talk often –you can send me a message.I just don’t want to wait any longer than 6 or 7 hours to receive a single message that can be typed in a few seconds – max minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Why can’t you see any of my interests listed down below? Because what really matters to me is..who you are (If you’re honest,talkative,understanding,caring and trustworthy – for example) just simply – It matters to me what you’re like! not what you like.Don’t get me wrong – you can tell me what you like or dislike but in my personal opinion common interests are important mainly when you want to find a gaming buddy on reddit (for example) or If you want to meet someone to hang out with in real life and..go bowling for example.What most redditors seem to care about are common interests – I don’t. I get along with other people despite having completely different hobbies but I absolutely don’t get along with people way different than me (different exceptations and outlook on life – some aspects of life – way different sense of humor or personality traits – It’s just an example)

Let me tell you one more thing „why does she have more/different expectations than other people?” Dear people – We ALL can choose what kind of people we’d like to talk to and maybe even become really good friends with and I? I don’t want anyone to be disappointed.We all have some expectations after all.(there are people out there looking for someone to play games with – for example – and I’m not one of them)I’ve met a lot of people forcing themselves to talk to me or talking to me out of boredom and I don’t want to experience anything of that nature ever again.Friendships should be natural – not forced.Both people wanting to be friends should feel comfortable and have something in common.

I'd rather talk to someone in a similar situation.Someone friendless..Don't get me wrong - most people deserve to be happy and It's good to have friends but people who have friends in real life are usually more focused on them &amp; have less time for others.Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on.Sometimes I feel like the only friendless &amp; rejected person in the world.I love warm-hearted people.Sensitive people who always try to understand others.Empathy is everything but please don’t send me a message if you’re another person in a different situation just willing to „help” me.

Imagine never getting any messages from others..always waiting for someone to text you..waiting &amp; waiting..spending most of your time at home (not by choice) I really wish I had at least one person in my life.One person who would make me feel important.If you really need someone to talk to due to loneliness and If you have time to talk to me daily (throughout the day and even night)I always make time for others.I'm literally always available.I could even stay up all night long only to talk to someone  I’m ready to commit but only If there’s some chemistry between me and someone else.I don’t do anything forcefully.

If you want to talk to me tell me your story - tell me why you're on reddit,what kind of friend would you like to meet :)et cetera

One more thing.I’m not looking for any advice – If you don’t want to talk just ignore my post or even block me but don't judge me and don't suggest me to change only because of you disagreeing with me.I'm not hurting anyone by being who I am and I'd never change for someone who doesn't even know me. I don't need more criticsm in my life or..sadness."

One or two likes, barely any comments. Any time I leave comments, I get nothing back. I feel just as lonely on social media as I do in real life and it's disheartening. 

I realized the other night, when I was up late and thinking to myself about my life and I realized that the reason why I don't try to do anything with myself is because I'm afraid of trying and getting the same results as I would if I weren't trying. Social media is a prime example. 

I'm at the point where I don't know if I should give up or try harder."

lonely,Making friends as an adult is hard,"Making friends as an adult is hard - I never really had friends as a kid but trying to make new friends as an adult almost seems impossible, especially during the covid times. I recently started studying at an university and almost all of our classes are online and hence I haven't had the opportunity to really acquaintance myself with anyone. I also moved to a small studio apartment away from my parents and it just sucks living here in a city and having no friends to go out with. I'm too socially anxious to visit a bar by myself and yet I have no one to invite out. I've tried looking up some hobbies and meet ups at my city but there seems to be none that would be aimed for my age group, which is early 20s.

I also feel that I'm way too different from everyone else. I'm very much into classic rock and music in general but my classmates really don't care about music more than on surface level. I've always been interested in more masculine things despite being a woman and I just can't seem to strike up any interesting conversation with other people despite my attempts at being interesting and listening to them. I like reading and writing and nerdy stuff.

It just sucks not talking to anyone for days sometimes. I only talk to my parents. I feel like I'm going crazy over here. Music is pretty much the only thing bringing me comfort at the moment. I guess I wanted to just rant a little but I'd be up for conversation if anyone wanted to just chat."

Anyway we followed each other 3 days pass he didn't dm or anything, cool fine i texted him he replied he remembered me, we talked his responses were delayed at least 10-30 min each time, but he was responsive he seemed to be engaged with the convo so i kept texting, anyway i ended the convo with me saying good night, didn't say it back cool its fine maybe he doesn't wanna be friends, next day he liked the gn message....didn't send a message or talk to me, 4 days later still nothing.

I'm really lonely i have the motivation to talk but I'm afraid he isn't interested, i don't wanna do anything that would come off as desperate if he is.

*Context*
I'm a freshman, first semester is almost over and i've met no one, no one is interested in me and i'm rarely interested in people but when i am i just can't approach them or even let 1 word out, that's why I'm kinda fixated on this dude cuz I'm interested and he initiated the convo"
lonely,I just feel like dissapearing into thin air pike I have never existed.,"I just feel like dissapearing into thin air pike I have never existed. - I had recently turned 17 and i feel so that i am here in the world for no good. I have let down everybody, my parents, my friends, my teachers and anyone that has expected anything from me. I have not achieved anything that based upon I could call myself exceptional in any field. I fell like atleast everyone has achieved something to show off, every close friend in my circle seem to have done something atleast. I feel like i am the most normal person. I am also very ugly looking and it just makes me feel down everytime. Today I was writing diary on my past 2 years and i feel more down now, just 2 years have passed and I could not do a single thing worthy or productive, i have just fallen behind in my studies when I should have focussed more as this year is very crucial for my life. I use to talk to a girl and even had crush on her but yesterday she told me indirectly that she kind of doesn't like talking with me often and i think so all this time I was just irritating her so I have just decided not to talk to her as I just don't want to add to her problems as she has allready many but she did tell me that I am a real help in her troubling times, so I just let her know that i will always be available to her whenever she needs me. But now I miss her a lot. I feel like I am only and only sorrounded by problems and trying to come out just pushes me deeper into more problems and depression. 
Today whole day I have spent thinking about all my life that I have lived and I just feel like I have existed for no good. I feel like crying my heart out and dissapearing out in thin air like i have never existed. The only thing that seems to be helping me out are songs, books and reddit and that's why I am posting my thing here. 
So if possible maybe just share your positive thoughts and if you are also a introvert like me going through problems and need help, just DM me and maybe we could help each other out by listening and understanding to each other. 



TL;DR - Just going through a hard times, feel like I am and have let everyone down. Need some positive thoughts and advices."
lonely,Missing My Mum.,"Missing My Mum. - I'm new to this subreddit so ... hi!

This holiday season has been pretty tough for me, as I imagine it has been for many of you. I usually feel quite down and lonely around Christmas and stuff, but this time was particularly difficult for me.
Last September my mum passed away, and things have been so much different ever since. Despite her faults, I really miss her and I wish she was still here.
It sucks to admit that I don't have much of a social life so I pretty much dealt with it and the fallout on my own. That only added to the loneliness I felt. Still, I'm thankful for the people who were there for me.

I hope you're all doing okay out there, and I hope 2022 will be a great year for you!"

lonely,im going to be homeless on my 21st birthday,"im going to be homeless on my 21st birthday - My significant other (22) and myself (20) got kicked out of her parents house almost 3 weeks ago due to us being lgbt+ alongside other reasons (her family is very conservative). I had already been living there for for about 2.5 years bc I don’t really have anyone besides my mom and she comes with a long list of toxic behaviors as well so one day I just packed my things and left.. 2021 was the year my girlfriend and I were finally starting to settle into adult life and figure out our wants/needs in the world when this happened. We were kicked out so abruptly without notice so we were very unprepared and neither one of us has ever been homeless before.. 😞 Her family simply said “we can’t stand to see yalls relationship and watch you be affectionate, we do not support it” . My birthday is on the 10th and i’ve never felt more depressed, unworthy, and suicidal in my life… For the past few months i’ve been so excited about turning 21 and now everytime I think about it I cry uncontrollably and go into a whole breakdown. I suffer from bipolar 1, severe anxiety and severe depression with psychosis… So the stress of being homeless has really been taking a toll on me both physically and emotionally. I never really had birthday parties or close friends to celebrate with growing up and for the last few months i’ve been planning and saving up so I could make my day special for ME and treat myself and now I can’t 😞 Im so heartbroken.. We spent our last $100 this week on a storage unit so we would have more space to sleep in our car but i can’t even sleep. i can’t think straight. all that is on my mind is death. 2021 was the year I became a lash tech and started my own business and now because we are homeless I had to put a pause to all my hard work which means no money on my end… I have no one to talk to, no family, no friends, my girlfriend is under so much stress with this and STILL finding the strength to go to work everyday and I feel like such a burden to her. I feel so worthless. so lonely. so depressed. I don’t want to burden her anymore with my problems but i don’t feel like I can go on any longer.. I feel so alone and im so so sad I won’t get to celebrate my birthday 😞 It may not mean a lot to some people but when you come from a family that doesn’t care to make you feel special on your big day, it means a lot when you grow up and can do for yourself… I feel so lost and confused.. I don’t know how to go on. We’ve been surviving off of lunchables and we’re on our last $10 and we still have to make sure we have gas in our car😞 Not to mention we haven’t showered in days.. which just feeds more into my depression. I don’t want to be here anymore, i don’t want to feel i don’t want to breathe and I don’t even want to think about my birthday i just want it to go by quick…"

lonely,Post College Loneliness ?,"Post College Loneliness ? - Hey y’all,

I’m here to ask for some help, as I’m not sure if I should get to the point where I am bringing this up with my friends/family.

For short background, I do not have a history of a bad or lonely life for the most part. Not a great childhood but many people have had it much worse for sure. I am a recent college graduate from and a former D1 track athlete who ended college on a good note career wise. I still run and am in the process of trying to compete in higher levels. This is not to brag or anything, but I’m starting to realize that my lifestyle has kind of masked symptoms anxiety and depression. This is not to say that I am depressed (I try to be very careful when using that term), but I’ve felt very lonely and sad for the past 6months or so. Luckily I have not been impacted from a physical standpoint. Because I still train,I know I need to continue eating well, and practicing good habits. It has been harder though.

I do not think I’m depressed. But I’m unsure because I truly do feel terrible. Running track is probably one of the only things that keep me at peace, even if it is going out in the freezing rain to run. 

It’s hard to really chat to anyone about this or anything in general. I feel like I just don’t connect well with people my age. I keep asking myself what must be wrong with me for people to not answer or care to have conversations about anything but… I don’t know. I’m quite lost at this point.

Any words of advice would help a ton, thank you"

lonely,I feel like a complete mess.,"I feel like a complete mess. - It's hard for me to know what all to say aside from how lonely I've felt the last few years. This recent holiday season really hit me hard. I've been recovering from being in a mentally/verbally abusive relationship for over 3 years. During that time I lost the majority of my friends due to how controlling my ex was and the few I have now are more like acquaintances. The one person I was close with had the same struggle as myself and we'd always lean on each other for support when we were having hard times. Sadly her depression got the best of her and I lost my best friend a few years ago. 

I miss having someone close to talk to, someone who relates and understands how I'm feeling and what I've been through. I miss traveling and sharing moments with someone. I've tried meeting new people but they've all been more concerned about superficial shit or wanting to sleep around. I'm not into those types of people. 

With how society is today and how rude, shallow, and greedy most people are, I just want to live in a calm and peaceful place and be around good genuine people.

There's more to my story. I just miss having a close friend I can trust because I don't just open up to anyone. I don't allow anyone to touch me unless I'm fully comfortable with that person. I long to find a woman that relates and is a kind, sweet soul that can help me feel at peace."

lonely,Always the same,"Always the same - It's... Rough
It's always been the same with me, I'm surrounded by people that love me that's true for sure, but they all have someone as well.
I don't complain and I feel deeply lucky that I have the people in my life, I tell them that everyday and they say it back to me, I know there's a deep love there...
But I still don't ever feel *that* type of connection, everyone around me seems to find those connections, even my one friend that always used to be in the same boat as me found someone that completes them but I've never felt that, or if I have (which I don't know anymore), it's never reciprocated.

I've been in relationships, but I always tend to be the giver as I believe vulnerability to be one amazing quality in people and I adore people that do it, but it's so hard... To never find someone to... Click.

I just... Want what I see my parents having, what I see my siblings sharing with their partners, what all my friends have found for years already. I just want a partner, someone to be myself, to show myself and feel accepted at full, someone I can accept as well.

Every year that goes by I grow a little bit colder, a little bit more cynical and sour, I don't want to but it happens, and I'm afraid I'll get to 30 without ever feeling that complicity, that sincronicity with someone, that inexplicable connection that only we understand... But every year I believe it a little less and I'm afraid I will someday just stop believing altogether.

I just want to be looked at by the same eyes I look through."

lonely,Lonely everyday,"Lonely everyday - When I come at school I feel lonely, even when surrounded by people. I just cant relate to anyone and anything and I generally dislike people, including myself. It's the break and my family just overall sucks and we have no bonds whatsoever, so as usual, I've been sitting in my room doing nothing for the whole break. Including Christmas and new years where nothing really happened. I feel abandoned by everyone, not a single person cares or loves me, or pays attention to me, I don't have friends nor any relationships. I'm not good at anything, I'm boring my only hobbies are p o r n and videogames but its a just a temporary setback of me feeling shitty and lonely. I really don't have anything left as a reason for me to remain  alive. I honestly wanna kill myself at this point because I can't stand living like this."

It is natural for friends to come and go but since I was about 11 at the time, it hurt. nowadays I have no friends, I have found other ways to be happy without having friends but it’s only temporary happiness."

Its not like I can make new friends either, I have no opportunities to and nobody gives me the chance and even when they do they just fuck me off. I don't know what to do other than vent on fucking reddit cause its the only place I can cause I deleted my snap cause what's the point of having a Snapchat if nobody texts me on it.

I’m not important to you, I’m only important when I’m helping you move, or when you need physical help, or when no one else is around. You don’t miss me, you only miss having someone around, if you missed me you’d call or text or ask to see me. 

I don’t mind being alone, loneliness i can abide. What i can’t handle is when people lie to me and, momentarily, let me think i matter. I don’t matter. I’m a passerby in your life. I’m a fuckin backup quarterback, there when you need me then as soon as someone better comes along, you kick me to the curb.

pure bullshit, if u are 18 and still haven't kissed thats a red alarm, that's like doctors telling you that you have cancer or sth, and you should hurry and do whatever it takes to stop this abomination.

like if ur parents notice ur virgin and kissless at 18, they should panic and cry and quit their job and gather for emergency meeting and do something about it.

like if you tell your friends about it, they have to start laughing and not believing you thinking you're joking, because this shit should seems to be impossible.

One step at a time, a tumultuous mountain we climb to venture into the unknown.

lonely,Anything else: Local foods that shouldn't be local,"Anything else: Local foods that shouldn't be local - TLDR: What is a local food, doesn't have to be where you are from, that doesn't appear to be popular else where but should? Whether that's because it's easy to make or just that good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did not find any rules saying I couldn't try this so I'm going to give it a go. After browsing this sub quite often, it seems to me this is mostly a place where people vent into the void (I've done this) about being lonely but continue to isolate themselves (also me). 

I think usually a shared sense of loneliness is not enough to start meaningful interactions as you don't really get a feel for what that person is actually like. Equally, while cathartic, it's can be a bit depressing and you guys are more than this horrible feeling. 

The idea? Talk about anything else. Something dumb and unimportant but somehow interesting or controversial. Best biscuit, best type of bread, whether/when you should butter your sandwiches, etc. Essentially something you don't realise you care about or differ from others on until you think about it. 

I hope that this can break the ice and maybe make someone feel a little less lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

The question: What is a food that you have locally, or if you know another place's local food, that doesn't appear to be popular else where but should? Whether that's because it's easy to make or just that good. 

&amp;#x200B;

My food is flapjacks. My understanding is, while Americans sometimes call pancakes flapjacks, only a couple other countries have what the British consider to be a flapjack. The closest thing if you don't have them is probably an oat bar.

Essentially it's butter, golden syrup and sugar melted and then mixed with oats. It's pressed down into a cake tin, baked and then cut into squares like a brownie. Again like brownies it often is a bit squishy before it cools however in general it does crumble a bit more. 

It's buttery and sweet but with that oaty edge. You can make them yourself but you often get them packaged here individually like biscuit and cake bars - it's the kind of thing you find in vending machine. Flapjacks aren't the best but it's very simple, cheap and quick so I'm honestly very surprised that it's not more widespread. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear more examples of these."

Not wanting other people get close to me was one the things that I’ve been doing.When depression takes over completely I don’t want to be close to any human being.Also with having friends etc I felt a bit sorry for disappearing for months etc.
So after 18 I’ve decided to not make any friends plus I was severely depressed so it’s wasn’t even on my list to make any

But now I’m 23 and I feel like I would’ve liked to have at least one real friend irl.I’m not interested in people romantically much.So that doesn’t bother me that much but having friends does.

I feel like over the years I’ve developed this thing where I don’t like when a person starts to depend on me or get close to me.I feel like that’s a result of my depression because my mind feels like what If my depression starts going crazy some time later and I won’t be able to keep up with that person,so in my mind it was better to be all by myself and not let anyone in.
I truly enjoy being all by myself but after a few years of complete isolation I feel like I should at least have one friend"

Ultimately none of this ever works, because the reason I'm doing this is for basic validation, which is unfair on everyone else anyway. It usually goes is cycles where I'll be fine, until something just starts my crawling around for conversations again because I need *something*

What’s so bad about me that nobody likes? Is it my nose, is it my eyebrows, is it my hair, is my body not good enough? When will girls stop treating me like shit? Will I ever feel loved? The only little bit of something other than the never ending loneliness and numbness I ever feel comes from alcohol or the ethylchloride I sniff just to get even a taste of what the anaesthetised pain is like."

lonely,"here to add to the array of sad new years posts,,","here to add to the array of sad new years posts,, - , i spent my new years watching my aunt and her bf love and adore each other all night and sitting there feeling absolutely disgusting at the thought that i'll never have that. i'll never have someone look at me like i mean the absolute universe to them, like im the beat in their heart and the love in their soul, i'll never be wanted like that and it hurt. i assumed drowning the loneliness in glass after glass of wine and adverted attention would make the feeling leave but they have the ""us against the world"" dynamic i have always dreamed of, i'm not jealous or upset at them for loving, i actually adore love and seeing it thrive but lately the lonely has burrowed deep and the only thing i can get from seeing it is knowing it's a love i will NEVER receive. no matter how much i yearn or hope, change, love myself, or love others i don't think i will ever see the end of this loneliness. i don't think i will ever be the light in someone's life, the thought is someones mind that lulls them to sleep at night, or any of those other seemingly alien concepts. i am doomed to this loneliness and it's killing me"

lonely,I Hate Being Lonely - It's Killing Me Inside,"I Hate Being Lonely - It's Killing Me Inside - Hi all.  I'm new to Reddit so if you can reply that'd be great, even just to let me know I've posted in the right place.

So, as I'm posting here you'll be able to guess that I'm extremely lonely and looking for advice.  A bit about me though to start with:

So I'm currently 34, from the UK.  I served 12 years in the Royal Air Force and am now a teacher.  I'm an only child and, growing up, I didn't really have any truly close friends.  Even now, I only have 3 or 4 true close friends, but still only see them very rarely due to work and life getting in the way. 

As for relationships, in the past I have had a few, none particularly serious or long-lasting.  That was until I got married.  All seemed to be going well.  We even had a child together.  But, like with previous relationships, the marriage ended too.  That was 7 years ago now, and I've been single and lonely ever since. 

I know what love feels like, I've experienced it.  I want nothing more than to experience it again.  I've tried dating apps; two matches in 5 years, one said nothing, the other only messaged to apologise for swiping the wrong way.  I've tried meeting people on nights out, at parties, events, activities, etc too.  No one is interested.  I've had women call me alsorts; weirdo, freak, ugly, probably more insults than you can think up.

Anyway, I know I've got some things going against me.  I'm not exactly attractive, I'm somewhat of an introvert, and I struggle with social interactions like flirting, body language, facial expressions, etc.

I do have some good things going for me though.  Being that I'm not good looking I've spent most of my life becoming a good person.  

Unfortunately, no one seems to care about good people any more.  The world all seems so superficial to me.  

Any thoughts or ideas out there on how or where I might have some luck meeting people?"
lonely,Tired.,"Tired. - I'm tired of everything. I'm now trying to fix a hole left by someone I loved. Trying to heal, and doing the shit I did when I was in my 20s. I'm alive that. I'm over it. I'm in my 30s. I thought I was able to go about my business, taking to others and trying to move on. I can't. Not because of him. I need to work on getting back to my old self. Before all of this. Being true to who I am. I'm not using my body to appease others. I'm not inherently sexual. I'm too smart, too talented. It's back to basics. I've got healing to do. Alone."

I feel like i can't talk to anyone about it because people get so offended but where are they when i need them? nowhere to be seen. it just sucks. 

My anxiety Leads me to push people away, which is my provlem I'm aware. I've changed my medication and this new medication is making me feel a lot less anxious. but i hate it so much. I feel like no one Wants to be around me, I'm no ones favourite. No one gives a flying Crap about me. it just sucks so bad."

lonely,"I made the decision to leave a lot of people behind, but was it the right choice..","I made the decision to leave a lot of people behind, but was it the right choice.. - I'm missing the good morning text from friends. But in reality they were never really my friends, I found out the hard way.. They were just happy to hear that I'm suffering. My ex tried to get back with me to that I said no, and after she confirmed that it wasn't going to happen the updated bio with a tag to her new boyfriend got posted up. I wasn't shocked whatsoever I mean that's why I said no. But she was still my best friend, so it does hurt in one way.

I'm trying to get over it all, but it's kind of hard at the moment. I've been trying a lot of these friend subreddits, but for the most part it's a one day conversation. Of course I made some friends that lasted, but they're off being happy and I'm not sure I want to bother them with all this.

In the end I should've just OD the other day, it would've been better for all of you.

Thanks for reading, I give my little bit of happiness to you. Use it well 😔"

lonely,"I feel burning, overwhelming, furious rage at everyone in my life","I feel burning, overwhelming, furious rage at everyone in my life - Granted, there’s only 3 people in my life at this point and one of them I’m pissed at because she doesn’t talk to me anymore. Point is it’s not massively exceptional to be angry at 3 people at once but I can’t fucking put into words how deep the rage for them is.

Two most prominent right now are my mum and her fucking pathetic husband. I was forced to move back in with her at the start of the year when my depression lost me my job, and I’ve fucking regretted not just accepting homelessness ever since. Those two people people got together, they became a fucking cancer. A fucking black tar pit of all humanity’s most repulsive traits. 

Had a massive fight with my mum about an hour ago cause she apparently had absolutely no choice but to make some totally unnecessary anti-Semitic comment that was based on literally nothing (they both have increasingly white-supremacist ideals that have only increased since they met). She knows full well shit like that makes me uncomfortable and that I won’t ever agree, so I can’t think of any reason to say it other than to start a fight. Then I do lash back, and she turns into the fucking shocked Pikachu meme, and acts like she’s a victim. Then they both go into the kitchen and whisper about me when they think I’m outta earshot cause they’re the most pathetic cowards I can imagine. Fucking Peter Pettigrew looks like Steve Rogers compared to these fucking wastes of oxygen.

And then I’m stuck with a slow-burning, boiling under the surface kinda fucking rage towards my ‘friend’. Don’t think I can even use that term in inverted commas anymore. She was the only ‘friend’ I’ve ever actually had, but I guess I’m also realising that it was never really a friendship and that fucking pisses me off too. 

I get that I’m not easy to be friends with. No one ever really tried until she did, for good reason. But I told her over and fucking over the reality of who I was and what I’m actually like. And she was adamant that she “wouldn’t ever leave”. But if course, after the self-harm, the drinking, the suicide attempt and me getting feelings for her, I pushed her to her limit. That makes sense to me, those were the choices I made and I can live with that, her leaving was the expected outcome.

What I didn’t expect is for her to string me along for some fucking reason I can’t figure out. After I told her I had feelings for her, something every obviously changed. We only saw each other in person one time after that, when we’d text, I’d barely squeeze 5 replies outta her before she’d leave me on read for like a month. Again, thats what I expected, things get weird, we stop talking. 

But the part I really don’t fucking get is why the fuck she’d keep actually texting back after a month. I rarely initiated conversations, occasionally I did, but mostly I wanted the ball to be in her court. And she texted pretty much every month without fail, just outta the blue. But then she’d seem super uninterested in actually having a conversation, then leave me on read for another almost as soon as we start talking.

After she did that enough, I was confused enough to just ask her outright what the fuck was going on and she acted like things were the same as they’d always been. Said nothing was wrong at all. But it clearly fucking was, we used to text for hours. But if she didn’t wanna be friends at all, then why bother texting at all, especially if I’m not? It’s fucking infuriating, I don’t get it. And then the last time we spoke was after I asked if she wanted to hang out again cause I was in town, she “forgot” to reply, and then we had a short conversation where she left me on read again and that was the last I’ve fucking heard from her. That was 7 months ago.

She’s also sent me a “merry Christmas” text every year since we met and I didn’t get one this year, so I’d assume between that and the 7 month guess I’m just left to assume she’s finally let it die. It just fucking infuriates me that she wasn’t just honest when I asked her outright. Apparently I meant so little to her that she would rather make me constantly second guess for like a year whether I even still had a friend and lie to me, instead of making herself slightly uncomfortable for the duration of one fucking conversation where she just told me the truth to save me from having to go through that. That’s just fucking disrespectful, and I get that I’m fucked up, but I was pretty upfront about that from the beginning cause this was exactly the situation I was trying to avoid and she was the one who was too stubborn to listen at the time.

I just fucking hate people, and being this fucking angry at everyone in my life is making me wanna fucking cut myself all over but I can’t even do that anymore cause I can’t stand looking at the scars it leaves. Fucking hate being on this bullshit fucking planet."

Disclaimer: if you’re not in the mood for some unnecessary whining, I suggest you guys move on to the next post. Sorry for bothering.

I’ve kinda been struggling these last few weeks. There are multiple reasons for this all of which aren’t really serious issues but nevertheless it still does bother me. 
A) academic pressure and a new environment since I’ve recently joined college.
B) having all these thoughts about how lonely I am because I don’t have anyone by my side who I can share stuff with.
C) dealing with my insecurities about how I look, speak.

I decided to write this here hoping maybe one of you could help me out if you’ve ever been through similar struggles. I’m sorry if most of my words don’t make any sense. Thanks for reading anyway, really does mean a lot.
Once again, Happy new year to all of you guys!"

Need someone to listen to me get some things off my chest. - So this is the last day of a week long news years vacation with seven other people, 3 that I know and 4 new people. Now don't get me wrong I have basically 0 friends outside this group so it still so much better than nothing. But..felt like an outsider like always as I always feel bit intimidated when I see them in a group like tight knit one and feel hesitant to approach sometimes and end up standing in the corner and they just think that I'm the kind the person who doesn't interact as much is chill with himself too most times. And at this point this has become a personality trait. That are other things like me not knowing how to drive or not having good dressing sense or not knowing what drinks to get if you ask me to go buy some as I always have other people in the group do all the work basically making me feel like a child who can't do anything by himself. But more importantly I feel like I have killed every passion outside just recreation stuff and feel like a parasite completely reliant on the same 3-4 people who keep taking me on trip with them and like if they ask me to bring a friend at any point I wouldn't have any other friends. They are lovely people though. They are not in my work city or my hometown, so now when going back either of them all I can think about is be depressed about being able to return back to normal life. I wanna change though taking some steps, dont know when or if Ill see myself as the person who I wanna see myself as and not feel lacking about myself. Can only hope. Just needed to get this off my chest and if anyone else outside is going through anything similar I'll be very glad to just chat with them on genuine things knowing that I'm not alone in this. And lastly a happy new year to everyone."

lonely,"Feeling pathetic after being ghosted, again.","Feeling pathetic after being ghosted, again. - Hey everyone I hope a lot of people read this (I just wanna feel heard and maybe even understood) let’s begin 

It’s actually quite an impressive streak I’ve been shockingly able to keep up since high school and I’m 19 now. I consider myself a confident person very much in my looks at least, I have a lot of self love like a lot I care for myself, love and admire myself and really enjoy own passions and creativity and my own personality at times even. 

I have adhd, anxiety, and depression episodes and my mental illnesses are very visible at times and It’s funny because I’m suffering so much inside and outsiders see me as awkward, rude, lazy, stupid, slow, etc. and when this feeling follows you everywhere you go despite my confidence I can’t help to think if I actually am the problem? What if I’m actually flawed. 

In my relationships with boys I feel like they’re always left me and I say boys because I’ve never been with a man consider, I’m 19, the boys from my generation are actually fucking demons anyways. I don’t date but of course there’s times when I will find someone attractive/ cool and give it a chance and the last time I tried to date things were good, I thought he was really attractive, he thought I was too. We made each other laugh and smoked together and even we had a sleepover and went to the beach the next day and after dropping me back home a few days later he ghosted me (we did not sleep together ever).  It was summer time, I was fine or I thought I was. I felt close to nothing (honestly) I didn’t care, If anything I only cared about the fact that he could say that he “played“ me (my ego is speaking now)

Anyways the guy was Indian and really nice at first. This give me an OBSESSION with Indian guys and guys who are super sweet to me like super bad. And like I said I don’t date (and really because my standard be too high and I don’t meet individuals I find cool to date often) so I get desperate at times we’re all humans and we have needs and I especially crave the emotional part of it all. 

I’m lonely we’re all so lonely especially these days. I find myself on chating sites. Pathetic chating sites where it’s just horny old men anyways I always set the region to India. And like a week ago I met this boy he’s 18 and he was cute! Like so innocent cute and we started chating , sexting at first (that’s the vibe of the site) then I sent him a picture of my face and he was obsessed. I obviously loved the attention and I gave him my telegram and we were chating a few days, it was so nice like sooo nice I just loved having someone to text, say goodnight, tell good morning, tell him he’s handsome and ask how was their day, I asked him so many things about him and he asked about me. We’re two teenagers from across the world it’s pretty fucking cool to me asking questions. 

And it’s pathetic I know it’s a random human but he was sweet and I love sweet men but anyways He’s been trying to call me but I get very anxious like so crazy anxious and I didn’t want to. He told me so many times please just answer for a little and that bothered me because I felt he wasn’t respecting me saying no but he felt that I wasn’t being a good friend by answering even for a little he was saying even just 10 seconds. He called a few times and after me declining them, He texted Take care Laila I will remember you throughout my life, bye. 

How did yet another boy leave me dude it’s just fucking crazy man like i just must be so pathetic and worthless for this to keep happening I feel so empty and alone and I’m an only child. This feeling has existed for a WHILE now. He’s a random boy he doesn’t care for me or anything he just ghosted me like what the fuck. 

I cant get over it. I must be so insignificant to peoples lives that they find it so easy to discard me. I literally cried so much, I feel so alone. So incredibly alone just want someone even if it’s internet friends I just want someone to talk to so desperately."

lonely,32[M4F] Nebraska/Anywhere A friend for the humdrum blues,"32[M4F] Nebraska/Anywhere A friend for the humdrum blues - Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program admin at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has leaft little time for developing friendships these days. But I'm finished with the semester and officially on break from both work and school until the 3rd! ( Just one left to go before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the new year! 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. I'm currently working on 4 papers for finals week. It would be great to find some good company. 


Hope to hear from you!"

I was already sad because no one had messaged me a happy New Years (not even my brother or mother) after I’ve been reaching out these past few months and messaging friends and making plans with them. On top of that, my fiancé got upset at me for the stupidest reason. He kept calling me immature that I was being upset about it. I kept trying to tell him that it was not only because of that but because no one reached out to me to wish me a happy New Years. It seemed like he didn’t even listen to me and kept trying to argue with him. I am sleeping in the other bedroom tonight as I am so upset and am shutting down. However, reading through these posts, it has made me a little less upset as I see you are trying to cheer us up. I’m so grateful to you guys honestly, as it seems that my night is not completely ruined"

lonely,Pretty sure I get an award for having this shitty of a New Year’s Eve,"Pretty sure I get an award for having this shitty of a New Year’s Eve - I would say the worst but I can guarantee people have dealt with worse situations. I dated this guy for 1.5 years but we’ve talked for over 2. The past several months he just stopped caring and trying and I put up with the bs. He seriously never put time into us, maybe I’d see him once or twice a month but sometimes I just wouldn’t see him. We don’t live in the same city but we live less than 1.5 hours apart, so there really aren’t excuses. Anyway I hit my breaking point when he failed to come for Christmas (he never invited me to anything), I blew up and he got mad at me for being upset because he “had to finish a project”. He ended up saying later on a call that he wanted to break up with me/was trying to break up (at that moment) and all this other horrible stuff about me. We talked the next day and he completely backtracked and said he didn’t know what he wanted and I’m stupid so I dealt with it. This past week he built me up and then tore me down repeatedly as I told him to figure shit out (I know I should have just ended things). Well it’s New Year’s Eve and he hadn’t said anything so I text him saying I need to know, and so he just texts me back saying we’re done. I feel lonely but it’s weird because it wasn’t like he was around much anyway. He didn’t even bother to come to my graduation (he didn’t bother to come to almost anything I invited him to). I graduated summa cum laude a semester early and he told me it wasn’t important and that I didn’t work hard lol."

I have had tony slivers of hope for decades now, and I have a dream, and the money, to buy a sailboat and sail to somewhere less ageist, racist, and sexist than America. But it's such an incredibly difficult uphill slog.

I come from a family of shutin introverts. And they are still trying every day to drag me back. But I need more than that to live. 

I need people. I need to talk, to laugh, to have friends. I want to love, to be touched, to have a woman that has my back. 

But I feel like I'm reinventing the wheel because I'm always expected by America to be the man I have never been, and will never be.

I lay here crying because even tho I live in a van with enough money to drive anywhere in search of the right boat, the feeling that nothing will get better is like standing in cement shoes. 

And society never gives a shit. Nobody gives a shit.

lonely,I'm lonely,"I'm lonely - So, this'll be hard to word adequately because I'm tired. But, I'm lonely. I mean, yes, I have a few people in my life who I see as friends, and I do have family which cares about me. That's more than some can say they have, and I'm not looking for sympathy. This is just me venting. I broke up with the person I was seeing for a year a few weeks ago, and it's been very hard adjusting. I'll make it a short explanation but the relationship was toxic and it didn't work out due to it being long-distance and the fact that it all degraded to petty arguments every day.

&amp;#x200B;

I miss the companionship that relationship brought. They understood me 100%, and loved me to death, and I loved them too. but the circumstances were too much for me to handle, and not being able to actually see them was a dealbreaker for me.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to be honest, it feels like I snapped after plans for a visit on my birthday were canceled. A few itmes prior we'd try and schedule a date, only for it to not happen. Each time a bit more of my sanity went away. That one time was what put me over the edge. I haven't been the same. I acknowledge it 100% yet I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all. I'm just sad that I'm beginning the year without them, or just somebody in general who I love. and I'm worried about their wellbeing.

&amp;#x200B;

I don' think I'll ever find another person who'll love me like they did. I look awful, and fundamentally I'm screwed up. I know it though. i'm not unaware of my very real flaws and mental problems.

lonely,Loneliness is a product of your own self-defeating behavior,"Loneliness is a product of your own self-defeating behavior - It's NYE, and being that it's a holiday, that tends to exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness, whereas it may not have been so prevalent before.  And as such, there are many many posts in response to this stimulus...  And I, a human being, like each and every one of you similarly lonely people, have appeared, desiring to connect.  My desire is not entirely selfish.  I think that to be self-centered while wanting to connect to others will only defeat your purpose.  

There are hundreds of subscribers to this subreddit online right now, and there have been more in the past few hours.  I've reached out to some, with offers to listen, to be there, to connect, and to help.  That's the way I, personally, have felt was the best way that I could be of service and to not feel alone.  

Yeah... Let me tell you what I have experienced.  

I see some people get dismissed by others.  I see some people who are discriminative, or very selective in the kinds of connections they are willing to accept.  I see some people who are lonely but, for any one reason or another, insist that that is the reality that they deserve, or can only have.  

I wonder, do any of you hope for something better, to free yourself of this pain, inasmuch as is necessary to do something about it other than what you've done?  Do any of you want to make the year ahead, 2022, different, enough to do differently?  

I get it.  You're lonely.  I'm lonely too.  But it sucks.  And my loneliness is my fault.  I'm not so conceited as to believe that everyone else is to blame, and that my loneliness isn't a product of my own behavior in a way I don't understand.  And so I've tried reaching out, which is an action to which I am absolutely averse.  I've offered conversation and connection to some of the other OP's in this sub, and I've gotten nothing but silence, if not nasty retorts and rejections.  So I have to wonder... If some of you don't want to step outside of your lonely-ass selves... How do you hope to not be lonely?

I truly believe that some people cling to their misery.  

I'd love to hear some opinions.  I welcome the angry retorts.  You can tell me to go fuck myself.  Loneliness has me pretty-well fucked already, but I won't take your bitterness personally. 

Because you and I have no connection."

I'm 25 and I've been talking to a guy for about a month now and it's been going well.

I've made mistakes in my past where I neglected my friends for boyfriends and sadly I'm reaping the consequences. I want to be a better friend but it's so hard making new ones and repairing old friendships. I am too ashamed to even face them tbh. He has a close circle of friends he's known since childhood and his family life is super healthy too. I'm worried about the day when he eventually finds out I have no friends. It's a deep source of shame for me and something that's on my mind almost constantly regardless of whether or not a guy is in the picture.

I don't know what I'm looking for in the replies. Advice? Kind words? I have so many regrets about the way I've lived my life."

lonely,Happy new year,Happy new year - Let's see how I waste this one
lonely,I just kind of want to unload.,"I just kind of want to unload. - So being a good friend is something I've always tried my hardest to be. Maintaining relationships with those closest to you is something that I feel is very important. Despite being introverted I feel like without friendship, my life is heavily empty.

In September of this year my best friend, a friend who was as good a friend to me as I was to him. Someone I considered my brother. He very sadly took his own life and it broke me. On some level, I do kind  of feel like I failed him, the last 3 months have been the hardest months of my life.

New Years Night, tonight. New Years was always mine and my best friends night. For the last 8 years since we became friend we spent every New Years together except 1. Except the New Years that I travelled to New York to spend New Years there and he was unable come because of his new girlfriend. But other than that, New Years was our night so tonight has been exceptionally hard for me.

I thought I had friends in two other people, people I had known for over 10+ years now, and they both knew about how hard tonight was for me as I had told them this week and I asked if we could hang out on New Years Eve and they agreed that we'd all hang out online for the night since they don't really do much anyway, they said they'd join me on Discord to hang. So I waited patiently til they could join me, they both have families and were waiting til they went to bed, so I messaged one. Asking when he'd be on discord, he said he was having a few games with two other friends. I didn't overly want to impose but suggested I could come along, he said ok but also that he won't be long anyway cause they'll be off soon. I told him I didn't have access to the discord server and then I was just, I don't want to use the word ignored but he stopped replying to me on messenger. Anyway I waited for an hour and thought, ""surely they're done"". I was sat in my shared discord server alone since around 9pm-ish logging off briefly when I restarted my PC.

I logged into League of Legends and saw them all in the same game together, and thought, surely it won't be long. And left them to it. Anyway it got to 4am and I was sat there, still on the same game, still sat on discord, no invites, no messages, no company on discord and not even a happy New Years. I decided to go to bed and watch a film. I'm going to be honest, I broke down, I felt abandoned and I felt like they really don't consider me a friend. I was thinking about my friend who passed and about how I miss that close of a friendship and about how I'm now more alone than ever. It's horribly impacting my depression. A large deciding factor in going to bed when I did was because I felt myself starting to get really sad and my mind was going to a dark place where I was beginning to consider ending it again. But I really needed to unload and that's why am here.

Thanks for getting through it if you did."

This person loves me too, but they have a love for everyone, and they currently are getting to know another partner that they talk to, seemingly far more than they do with me. Due to extenuating circumstances, I'm stuck away from this person, so theyre going out on dates and the like while I'm stuck here.

So I think thats what I'll be doing for the rest of life. But in 2021 i accomplished a lot financially especially knowing I was homeless and had nothing in my name when i was 18. But after ever accomplishment lead to more depression because there's no one in my life to share them with or to notice my growth. I finally understand the meaning of ""money can't buy happiness"" I am far far from rich but i do notice I'm more financially stable than most people in my age group. But their lives seems to be filled with warmth from loving people. I really wish i had that. Anyways Jan 2nd i will be feeling like a God because i don't need anyone to survive🤣 but that will quickly change once the holidays come back around."

I'm at home venting on a reddit forum my senior year listening to Jeff Buckley. My entire high school experience has been this way. I don't even know the last time I hung out with someone. I follow so many private stories of random people also in high school, some local, etc, and it makes me feel bad. or seeing my old friend create a huge group for herself and I'm still alone. accepting my good days with her are over. good times with my dad- over. its all over.

First of all, the groomers would ask if you’re okay with their age, which shouldn’t matter, and if you say you’re okay with it they would then go on and pretend to be sad and say something along the lines of “It’s fine if you don’t want to talk to me anymore 😞” Like bro stfu. Master of manipulation. Even if the person is okay with your age you shouldn’t be okay with talking to someone as young as 15. They would call you cute names and be weird asf. Second of all, bots.

Why cross the new year alone when we can talk until we drop (figuratively). 
Anything about books, traveling, languages, good food, beautiful places, I’m always down!

lonely,"It doesn’t matter what I do, I always end up alone. I don’t.. I just can’t take this anymore","It doesn’t matter what I do, I always end up alone. I don’t.. I just can’t take this anymore - My last relationship ended after I got cheated on… a few times. The most pathetic part of it all is that even after all was more or less set and done, I still called her. I even called her today. She doesn’t ever pick up, sometimes she answers with a text.. she’s told me before that she does it for me, because our relationship was unhealthy. 

But, in these moments I don’t care, I would take an actual knife to the chest just to be embraced by someone. I’ve tried looking for someone, but nothing ever works. I used to not think I was that hard on the eyes, now I think I must be a monster. I’m probably just making excuses for my own social ineptitude.. but still. I’ve gone outside, I’ve touched the grass, but still the only thing on my mind is how cold I feel inside. 

I hate when people say that I’ll find someone eventually, I just don’t believe it. And even if was supposed to find someone sometime in the future, I don’t think I’ll make it that far. I’ve had too much happen in my life, but if I just had someone there I could get through it. Now all I can think about is how cold the nights are and how bleak the future is. 

I used to think that slitting your wrists must be really scary, and I still think it is, but the thought of fading away in a warm bath sounds more and more appealing. 

I hate myself."
lonely,Things will only change when I decide to,"Things will only change when I decide to - Visiting some parks today, reminiscing on some events I went to a couple months ago, at these parks. I was still alone and I remember how it felt recent but was months ago when I was volunteering and putting myself out there. I looked into the distance and understood a little more. 

I remember how I interviewed for jobs, some very good jobs, for over a year without results, and then suddenly as I neared graduation, I started to sit alone and make flash cards of my interview stories, and I'd tape myself and recite my response in the interview format. If it was bad I'd redo it. Then my head would hurt and it would be the last thing I wanted to do but I'd flip another flash card and have a go, as that's an interview. It already wasn't fun processing my undergrad experiences and to describe it professionally, in addition to tailoring it to the position. So I started interviewing again, and I said the answers, and I started getting through all of them. One of my last final round interviews the interviewer said, wow you got all of it. Because I had a response for all the questions. They offered and I took another position. 

It's the same with having friends. I know what to do to make people feel cared, comfortable. I've read books, I just don't fully do it because it's too uncomfortable to put that effort into it when my heart is dying not to do it. I'm not at the stage where I can say I really want to change instead of ""wanting to change"" and not seeing I can put more effort. Everybody wants me to be at that stage in my early 20s, but I'm not. I'll still put myself out there as (un)comfortable, but I'm not willing to really take that full step yet."

When you cultivate self-love, there's a light in you that other people could only DREAM of grasping/comprehending. It's intangible and elusive to them. - I attended my niece's birthday party the day after Christmas. Hadn't seen my extended family in a long time. I was able to wear a dress (that I hadn't worn in YEARS - tbh I didn't think I'd ever be able to wear it again). I got so many compliments that day.

My aunt - my mom's brother's wife (she's in her early 60s) noticed right away how much weight I lost. It was the first time someone has ever come to me for weight loss advice! She is significantly overweight and wanted to change her life. She said to me:

""What have you been doing? You look incredible. Also...there's something different about your face - it's glowing!""

My soul delighted upon hearing that. I shared with her my experience, emphasizing that it really is about diet and finding a type of exercise that you really enjoy. For me, I began walking over the summer and I never looked back. I hated the gym, doing pilates, any other floor exercise because nothing stuck for me. I never entertained the idea of specific diets (such as keto, etc.) because in my opinion, they are not sustainable. I wanted to establish a lifestyle change.

I started 2021 at just over 180 lbs (I'm 5', 28 years old) and ended this year at 147 lbs (I went from clinically obese to a normal BMI). I couldn't be any prouder of myself. I never thought I'd be able to lose my weight. For some reason, it seemed like a far off dream. I knew though that I deserved to look and feel my best. I was tired of declining social invitations, clothes not fitting me (my mom's clothes didn't fit me either), dreading the stores and having to try on clothes because I knew nothing would fit, walking up the stairs and feeling short of breath, feeling unattractive, etc.

And so...I got to work with these results to finish off this year! I'm still not at my goal weight yet. I'm aiming for 120 lbs (which hopefully I can accomplish in 2022). I've also been going to church a lot and focusing on my spirituality (to help with my self-esteem), thinking about hobbies I'd like to pursue this new year (I'll be tutoring for Kumon, and partaking in flower design - like making flower garlands/bouquets/flower crowns, etc. My dad's secretary does this for a hobby and is willing to teach me! I'm so excited!

Career is still being sorted out - but I know in due time I will have a job (a medical residency) at some stage in 2022. I finished medical school in 2019 and have been back home with my parents since. I've had great difficulty with my board licensing exams. This year I failed one of them and am studying to re-take it in Mid-January. Gonna make sure I kill it this time.

One of my best friends embarked on her self-love journey earlier on (you never really finish because it is for life). She told me that even people who were considered ""more successful"" - fancy titles, high-powered positions/social status, affluent, etc. noticed the glow she exuded. They wanted to know what she was doing. Isn't that interesting?

She even said something that really resonated with me: That most people/our society is very ""success""-oriented. Placing our worth and value on those external measures of success - Awards/accolades/honor/fame/power/prestige/high degrees, etc. but not enough on growth/personal development/self-love. The latter three (and other areas in this particular realm) are what people neglect. Either because they are not self-aware or any other reason. This is why MOST people are/remain dissatisfied with themselves/their lives because they haven't looked inward. This is the true, deep and soulful work that enriches our lives and gives us meaning.

One of the biggest lessons I learned in 2021:

Self-love/contentment/fulfillment is INDEPENDENT of your employment/relationship status (which society places so much emphasis on). It truly is an inside job and it's a daily work in progress. And remember, what really defines you? It's your heart and character. When you have true peace and contentment (no matter what stage you're in), NO ONE can take that away from you. I truly believe this peace comes from God above all else. Now that I'm rooting myself in Him, and holding on to God as my anchor...my life is transforming before my very own eyes."

lonely,"I was ok but suddenly anxiety came up, and felt really lonely.","I was ok but suddenly anxiety came up, and felt really lonely. - I was at dinner with my family (we are 3), but at the end of the countdown of new year, I watched on the tv that all the people had friends and big families, and I started to think if I should be somewhere else with other people, you know, having fun, or with a girlfriend, but no, I was here with my family. 

And I don't know if that triggered some abandonment trauma that I have, or that I eated a lot and triggered some anxiety; but I started walking a lot and thinking nobody loved me, nobody cared about me, I almost started crying, and I started to have a pain in my head... 

I don't know, I feel really disconnected from myself and from people, and that makes me feel really lonely because I'm already losing a lot of friends cause I'm kinda depressed...

Sorry guys I needed to get my feeling out. 

This year was a bad year for me, was really depressed, to the point I was in bed laying there, without wanting to do anything, I didn't care about life or die. But now I kinda feel better, I have some goals and do some exercise, and eat healthier...

But I don't want to let this little anxious moment take this year progress... I know I have a long way to be good, but it's ok, this is my owm path.

I don't know when, but I know I want to feel more connected to myself and other people... because living like this... sometimes... it's a burden. 

Maybe one year I would be with people or maybe not, but the thing is, I want to be able to know what I really want and make it possible.

Btw now I kinda feel better, I expressed how I felt and I'm listen to relaxing music."

lonely,"Coping with realizing I am nobody's 'favorite person.""","Coping with realizing I am nobody's 'favorite person."" - This realization has been a long time coming, and it just clicked on christmas, that the biggest thing that gets to me, is that to no one in my life, am I anybody's 'person.' My brother and his girl have each other, my parents have each other. My cousins and aunts and uncles and grandparents all have a person to whom they hold the most affection. My friends have wives and friends that have lasted since they were children.   


I've had people in my life who have been that for me frequently in the past, but it always fell apart for one reason or another, or time and life separated us, and they didn't feel the need to attempt to continue to be important in each other's. I have gone from group to group looking and being the best friend/partner I can be for however long life permits us to be together. Then my life got bad, things went sideways,  and then the pandemic hit. It's not as if I have no friends or family, I do, and for that I am incredibly thankful. It's just that all of them are each other's people, I am, once again, the odd one out.   


I just want closeness of thought and emotion that I see other people have. It's not that I don't offer or attempt, I send messages and well wishes, I post to our group chats and discords, I send them music and art I think they would like, and I attempt to organize hangouts, and I listen attentively to anything they need to talk about. It never becomes more than that with anyone though, and not one of them cares to listen when I have an issue I could use an ear for.  


All I want in life, is one person, that thinks of me like I think of them. Who thinks when they see something cool, 'I have to send this to HIM!' or 'ah I should ask HIM to lunch at the new noodle place he would love it.' I don't want sex, I don't want money, I don't want marriage or toys or vacations. In the words of Phoebe from friends. I just want my lobster."

lonely,NYE dont want to go on,NYE dont want to go on - I just keep having the worst time with life and the more I find out about things the more of a struggle it is to the point I dont enjoy anything anymore - and its been a very long time of that... many years. And I dont see the point in trying anymore or to make money to buy stuff because it doesnt make me feel good at all or any power as therapists have said it should. My family did a real number on me to make it that way. I really need someone to talk to. Ive lost all my friends but also Im very draining because things never get better despite putting the effort in. Im also at a point in this long term depression that notions to just be positive are actually toxic as I did that for a long time and it destroys your sense of self when its done long term. Like you cant make decisions and goals because you dont know what you want as you just have been telling other people what they want to hear and you never expressed your unhappiness. Its important (so Im told) for me to stay true to my feelings and not be pressured to say Im ok when Im not. But I totally understand not wanting to hear any of this. Im estranged from family because of a lot of physical and emotional abuse and theyre the type whom just want to deny any mental health issues despite theyre swimming in them but cant deal with even light criticism. But everything just circles back to wishing I was never born because then I wouldnt be suffering for the majority of my life - I really dont want to wake up anymore. Im not in an upset headspace this is how I feel when calm and help for suicidal ideation seems to revolve around that and just calming the person down through observation and then letting them go back to their shit lives that they cant stand - where I feel the exact same. Because its not all about the family upbringing. I just want someone to tell me what job I can get that doesnt rely on nepotism and socializing and ass kissing to succeed and make a lot of money so I can live alone somewhere nice. Even remotely. Owning property is all Id like so I can be a hermit. And where I am that will never happen and with my stress levels from being around people I cant do a normal interactive job with out crying uncontrollably throughout the day. #lostcause

Thats really wholesome I wish I could do that. I like need to be with someone""

I just thought it was really funny cause I just do that stuff because there's nothing else to do and I dont have anyone to hang out with. But she thinks thats like really cool and something im doing for fun fun or something she wants to do.

I'm afraid not only for myself, but for what I may become. I'm afraid of living longer to find out. I have the power to change things, but why should I? No one has ever given me a damn reason to care for this cold world. ""Be the warmth"" they say. But what's wrong with burning this whole thing down in the first place? It's so, so cold...

lonely,I think the problem js that you,"I think the problem js that you - Make public holidays such as new years so important. Yet it’s not important, it’s just another day(imo). Nobody even sticks to their new year resolutions anyway. 
I can guarantee you that spending a public holiday with someone that appreciates you wont fix your loneliness. You have many more years ahead of you to find someone that will make you feel extremely happy on days that arent even christmas, etc. 
So start hoping and trying your best, so you will not be so upset knowing that you’ve tried. It is better than staying at home all day, developing/maintaining unhealthy habits.
But if new years is so special to you, then get out of bed on days that you don’t have to, do not obsess over the incredibly self-deprecating loneliness you find that constantly surrounds you, just try your best.! I think it is the most important thing ever.

I’m sorry if this is a rude thing but I am just rambling and trying to stay positive before another depressive episode eats me up again."

The rest of them didnt give a flying f, Ive been there for all them so many god damn times, talked and helped and whatever else there was.
I just feel fucking betrayed dude, just the loneliest feeling ive ever had.

Sorry for venting here but I have litterally nobody else to talk to, my family is all gone of to parties or wherever.

She said I was the best guy she's ever had. I tried my best to treat her like a queen. But one day she called me out of blue and told me that she never loved me and that I was a shy and cringy writer that nobody would ever be with. She was a whore who just used me as long as she wanted to. I'm telling you all this because I don't want anyone to go through the shit I had to go. Don't fall for anyone on the Internet. If you do that, it'll be the worst mistake of your life. A mistake for which you'll never be able to forgive yourself.

lonely,This probably belongs in a different subreddit but I wanted to post here,"This probably belongs in a different subreddit but I wanted to post here - I am in a constant state of fear and paranoia about becoming homeless. I worry all the time that my parents, friends and extended family just “won’t want to deal with me anymore” and stop supporting me financially. I think the root of my fear is that im not a good enough student and my parents will not want to pay for my college anymore. I want to get another job so that i can alleviate my paranoia a little, but my parents don’t want me to get a job because they don’t think i can balance it with school, which they might not be wrong about given my rocky history of dealing with adhd. But it’s not just in the short term either, i still worry about being homeless 20 or even 10 years down the line. I worry that I won’t be good enough at what i do to land a job with good enough pay to support me. That’s half regular college kid fear of the workplace, and half me overselling my shortcomings and retreating into my shell. Either way, i find it hard to see a future for myself, and recently i’ve been having nightmares about dying alone in the street at night. Sounds melodramatic, but i wake up depressed and in cold sweats after these eerily realistic feeling nightmares 

Thanks for listening to my ramblings"

Everybody is out socializing, partying, and having fun, while I'm inside, hoping for a message at least. I get none.  


Yesterday I was talking to my ""friends"" on our group chat and they mockingly asked ""Where are you spending New Year's? 😹"" This is a reference to the fact they didn't invite me to their party last year and the fact that they won't invite me this year either.

Imagine having fun with friends to celebrate a new year. Must be nice. 

On the bright side I found 2 episodes of Ab Fab which I’ve never seen before, and that makes me incredibly happy. 

But of course, after a little spark of almost happiness, the episodes will end, Ab Fab will be a show of the past, the new year will be lonely and sad, and everyone is going to die."

I’m a 23 year old woman, I’m meant to be in the prime of my life supposedly but I have no one really to spend my New Year with, I guess my mum but it’s not really the same as like, being around people a similar age idk. It sucks, all my ‘friends’ are at parties and I know I’ll see them on insta or whatever later but of course they didn’t care enough to even invite me. I don’t have a girlfriend to spend NYE with and never have. And it’s just, every year, a horrible reminder of how much of a joke my social life is and how lonely I am.

Because it’s like everyone around you at least has someone they *want* to spend NYE with, and no one wants to spend it with you. The situation doesn’t change, it’s the same every year. I’ve never even been invited to a NYE party in my whole life. Parties sure; but no one cares enough about me to think ‘it’s NYE let’s invite her over’ as if you’re not special enough to spend that special occasion with them. It just fucking sucks, it’s like a shitty reminder every year. And I never really see it changing. I just want a way out of loneliness but it’s like I’m fucking cursed, I was doomed from the fucking start thanks to my autism, my ADHD and just generally being someone people always forget about eventually."

And in this new year I have been sitting alone, with no on to talk too, or celebrate with, all alone. I am so fucking alone and lonely that I am getting bad thoughts.

It’s like I sympathize with the issues that women have to deal with when dating, but at the same time I will never empathize with them.  It just seems like the average woman is living every man’s fantasy, to be desired by many people of the opposite sex. I get jealous of even some of these “depressed women“ when they complain about men because, it’s like at least you’re getting a lot of attention and affection from the opposite sex.

I guess that, all I can do is hope for this coming year to be better. To strive to make it better. I may not want to but I'm going to have to move on. Put the friends I had behind me and try to forget the past so I can live in the future.

I never bothered her afterwards, and I can't really say I have moved on but I'm trying to.

Why did she have to be the first person who wished me happy birthday and happy new year on WA? I didn’t even wish her on her birthday which was in December because I didn’t want to appear as a creep who keeps coming back after putting up a boundary. Yes, absolutely, she's amazing and a kindhearted person and she thought she was being kind to me but all it did was rekindle all the pain of the love that was not reciprocated.

I have no issue attracting attention -- people tend to stare, but that's all they do. I go to a small art school where everyone is obsessed with the avant-garde. This has resulted in a really weird problem where people want me in their photos and want to be seen with me but aren't interested in actually getting to know me. The only people who've been interested in dating me are narcissists who just want to post me on their instagram or something. I feel like a freak show.

I tried and failed to have a (what I thought was) a meaningful, loving relationship. Not my fault shit fell apart, I thought I was doing shit right. I was pretty rad. Sometimes people are fucking horrible. But you can't let that shit sit in your soul forever. I'm more cautious now. I'm smarter, and soon enough I will be complete. Nothing feels better than getting good advice. Sometimes over and over. Until it gets beaten into you. Sometimes, it's better to be alone than try to hold onto someone or something toxic for you. Or, someone who doesn't appreciate you. Am I lonely? Yes. Do I have a cat? Yes. Dies he love me? Debatable. But, I'd rather pour my love into loving my cat than try to keep a toxic ""friendship"", afloat with a dude who damn near destroyed my spirit and soul. My biggest regret was leaving my keys in his motel room. That and maybe not having enough balls to say what I should have. I let a lot of shady shit, and red flags go under the radar. I'm alone. I was alone for my birthday, Christmas, and now ringing in 2022. But ya know what? At least I know some out there appreciates me. For who I am, what I'm not, and what makes me fucking amazing. 
Don't let this loneliness consume you. You're amazing. You may be single. It hurts, I know. But find strength in the fact that shit could be way worse. If nobody else has said this to you today, Happy New Year. You will get through this. I'll be up all day if any of y'all need someone to listen."

Despite not having any experience of it, I still yearn to know it as if it was natural to me.

The closest I can guess is how I feel for G-d, I don't really have anyone else other than Him. I couldn't imagine life without Him, nor would I want my life without Him. I only want to do everything I can for Him.

With other people though, it's alien to me. I have never felt love from another nor do I really feel anything for anyone else. Then again, I am always alone in total isolation. I don't know anyone."

At age 30, I met a woman aged 39 with two children. Long story short, she was a hooker and hadn't  told me - she was not just working as a hooker but actively cheating on me behind my back. This went on for 1 year.

When im feeling sad or anything i just look at memes and i'm suddenly ok but not for long. I tried to talk to my friends on how i missed alot of things but they keep ignoring me. Everytime i wanted to talk about something serious they just keep ignoring me. It's how i got my habit of talking to myself. Obviously i don't talk outloud as i'm a really shy person.

lonely,29M. What Does Your Coffee Reveal about You?,"29M. What Does Your Coffee Reveal about You? - Apparently last post I made was too long and not everyone appreciate the details and density of the text lol 
Let’s try this again; it’s December 31, 2021 and we’re literally hours away from 2022. Having said that, I’d really like to hear from about how your 2021 journey of trying to make new friends on here been? Any new year resolutions? 

I’m still hoping and trying to find that one compatible friend despite all trials and errors lol so I thought, why not start with the basic, ask about your fav coffee ☕️ or how do you like to take it? What kind of coffee do you prefer (e.g., Americano, cappuccino, espresso, Turkish, etc)? 
To follow up with that question, if you had to pick on book to read with your coffee, what would it be and why? 

So briefly, and so you don’t have to spend more than 3 minutes of your precious time reading a long post: I’m from the west coast; Cali! So yeah, it’s still pretty early here now! Hmm, what else… before my 3 mins runs out! I’m 6’1” tall, black hair, greenish eyes, and Olive/tanned skin. I really enjoy intelligent conversations, appreciate wit, humor and never mind a little taste of charm… I just think all the factors requires a great deal of intelligence. And before I forget, oh, never mind, I’ll share that later lol 

Hoping to hear from you (female, woman, girl) and maybe we can actually have a decent and refreshing conversation for a change 😊 
Yeah yeah yeah… I just emojis in Reddit, so what!"

lonely,Can’t even imagine meeting new people without immediately telling them to leave me alone,"Can’t even imagine meeting new people without immediately telling them to leave me alone - I literally find myself having daydreams about meeting new people, and I can’t even daydream about it without feeling immediately exhausted, and like I need to subtlety try to let them know, somehow, that I don’t have the mental bandwidth to care about another person or deal with all the bullshit that comes with having people in my life at all.

I just really can’t have anything to do with people at all. I have a grand total of zero people in my life right now, barring my fucking toxic as fuck family, but I don’t know they even count as people. Only ever had one friend, and since she finally let our communication die out only thing I think about her is that if I ever saw her again, how I’d tell her to fuck right off. Or maybe I’d just realise I don’t even have the energy to be angry anymore, my eyes would glaze over like they do so often now, and I’d just walk right past her, not even acknowledge her existence.

Guess it just feels shitty sometimes. I know I picked this, tried to make shit work with people so many fucking times that I know the loneliness is better than the alternative. All that people bullshit just doesn’t work for me, don’t see it ever working, based on all the experiences I’ve had. But yeah, guess picking loneliness isn’t exactly great either. Just the lesser of two absolutely fucked choices. Still miss sex sometimes, although I’m pretty sure I miss it more in theory, can’t remember ever having sex that didn’t feel like a chore at the time. Mostly think I just miss getting a hug. Still remember my last hug. That friend I had was drunk, came into the bar we both worked at to ask if I was coming out after my shift. Told her no. She protested, and eventually I changed my mind. Then she ran over and hugged me to celebrate. That was over two years ago.

Don’t know what broke in my fucking head to make me so goddamn anti-social that I literally can’t even imagine a conversation with another person without exhausting myself immediately, but what ever it is it must be well and truely fucked cause my mental bandwidth for social shit is non-existent non. Not 2 years of therapy or dozens of fucking medications can even help it at all, in fact it’s only gotten worse since I started trying to “fix” it. Guess I’m just supposed to be completely fucking alone."

nobody cares about me anyways"
lonely,Sigh...,"Sigh... - I hate my life, mid term exams are approaching, no real friends, maybe suffering from depression, having trouble with nofap... why is my life like this? I could talk with people in school about various topics and play whatever with them but I could never make real friends except the one I'm always talking to in recess. I never went out with people other than my family since 2017. Yesterday, I had a party in my school and I talked/played with alot of people, but I was still lonely. Now everybody posted their photos on social media and here I am..Why am I like this? Why can't I just have friends to go out with? Is it too much to ask? People around me say that teenage-hood should be the best of my life. I hate my life."
lonely,Hope for the new year,"Hope for the new year - Happy New Year to all of you here on this subreddit! I know that it's been a difficult year for most of us. Perhaps you lost a loved one to the pandemic. Or maybe became unemployed, homeless, went through a break-up or divorce, struggled financially, fell deeper into depression and anxiety, suffered an illness that has drastically affected your life... Many of us have been suffering in some way even before the pandemic. 

I know that this isn't a hopeful note to begin with but I want to acknowledge that many of us are here because we are suffering in some way. We feel deeply unhappy and isolated. It feels like there is some impenetrable barrier between us and others. We feel disconnected and alone. Some of us may be suffering from trauma. We might be spiralling into despair or consumed by a general sense of hopelessness and uncertainty about the future.

We cannot deny our experiences, nor our emotions in response to them, but I believe that we've got to have hope. The alternative is to choose complete and utter despair. A despair which obliterates any chance of purpose in the time we have left alive. A despair that renders living a completely mechanical and futile process; drawing breath, second by second, without purpose.

If I still believe that there is value in continuing to live, even if it's the fear of death, then I've got to have hope. Hope is often defined as a feeling. But for me, hope is a belief; a conviction that things will get better, and that I will survive whatever adversity comes my way. Like a lighthouse being battered by monstrous waves but continues to shine its light even if dimly. Hope is the belief that the worst will not destroy me. 

Whether the tidal waves of despair are in my mind or outside around me, I have faith in myself because I have made it this far. I have held my brother as he convulsed on the floor in pain, I have survived the sleepless nights of dark thoughts in my head, I have withstood feeling isolated and alone. 

I am still here in spite of all that has happened. And since you are here reading this, then it means that you have also survived. That is an undeniable fact. Hope does not mean that life will be all sunshine. It does not mean an end to loneliness and sadness. 

As long as we live, these emotions will continue to be part of our experience; the fabric of our lives. No one is happy 100% of the time. Chasing happiness is pointless. It's just a chemical rush swirling around in our brains, and then it's gone. I have found contentment to be much more attainable. From moment to moment, acknowledging that so long as I'm alive, possibility exists.

Contentment also requires some measure of self-acceptance. There may be things that you dislike, or even hate, about yourself but these things tend to fall into 2 categories: those you can change, and those you can't. The things that can be changed are not a permanent part of you. You can work on these things by yourself or with help from a counselor. The things that can't be changed, you've got to learn to accept because they will be part of you until your final breath.

Self-acceptance isn't a permanent state of being nor is it a completed work, hence why I said that you'll require **some measure** of it. Find contentment and you'll find peace. You may still feel lonely, but you'll be able to say to yourself, ""Yes, this is what I'm feeling. Yes, it hurts. But I'll be fine."" 

Finally, I'd like to note that nothing will change if nothing changes. If I want something to change in my life in 2022, then I can't continue to carry about my life in an identical way to 2021. If I make a change then, for better or for worse, I will see the difference.

Most of this post started off as a message to myself that I decided to share with you. I hope that it speaks to you too, and that we can see one another in 2022 living better, more fulfilling lives. Happy New Year everyone! May your year be filled with possibility, love, contentment, and hope."

lonely,First time alone New Years Eve,"First time alone New Years Eve - Hello everybody, I’m new here and just really thankful that there is even a community like this. I just wanted to ask, it’s my first time spending New Year’s Eve alone and I know it shouldn’t be a big deal but I feel really bad. I come from a big family so every holiday is always celebrated big with at least 20 people. Because of work I had to move far away from home and now with Covid I can’t go home either. So this year I’m alone and I don’t see to be very good at handling it. I can’t tell anybody because I don’t wanna make my parents feel bad for me so I tell them it’s fine. I pretend it’s just a regular day and nothing special. But I feel like crying all day. So what do you guys who spent NYE alone do today that makes you feel good?

Thank u all for reading and wishing everybody a lovely New Year’s Eve!"
lonely,Happy new year... I guess,"Happy new year... I guess - Time now is 10pm in the evening. Had a really rough day.

Had a mental breakdown during work. Haven't had one in a while. Going through some existential crisis. Tried to talk to my brother, no response. Don't know why I defaulted to a toxic ex. Of course that didn't turn out well. No one to talk to. Just finish my work and got home.

Tried to relax. Wanted to play my favourite game with a couple of friends. Couldn't get the private server to show up on the server browser, so no dice on that. Accidentally flared up at the mention of an extremely grindy game I despised, got yelled at.

I'm just gonna go to bed. Happy new year y'all."
lonely,I’m alone.,"I’m alone. - It’s almost 11pm for me, on Dec. 31st. I’m completely alone, and I’ve been feeling completely alone for a while now. 

This month I went through one of the hardest times of my life. My parents and I had covid, and both of them were in the hospital for 2 weeks. I had to stay at their house alone with the pets to take care of them. I was extremely afraid of losing both of them, because they’re the only family I have. 

But 2 days after they came back home, my mother who was always abusive, treated me like shit because I could finally rest and I needed it so badly (I have depression, anxiety and ADHD, I get mentally drained easily) so I decided to not call them for a day. That was less than a week ago. Today was the first day my father decided to check on me, after a full week of not speaking to me, since he always leaves that to my mother.

I have a bf, but we’re LDR, and lately thing don’t seem to be going so well (could be a fase, idk). And I have no friends, and I mean NO friends. Yesterday I tried to breakup with my bf because I’m really considering “unaliving” myself, but he said that if I breakup with him or “do it” he will “do it” too. 

Besides what happened this month, this whole year was a shitstorm. So much bad stuff happened, I’d be here until next year (haha…) typing it if I decided to say it all.


Honestly, I have no idea why I’m alive, and I don’t want to be. But I have no choice. Happy new year I guess."
lonely,Hear me out.,"Hear me out. - If you learn to really sit with loneliness and embrace it for the gift that it is… an opportunity to get to know you, to learn how strong you really are, to depend on no one but you for your happiness… you will realize that a little loneliness goes a long way in creating a richer, deeper, more vibrant and colorful you.

Until you get comfortable with being alone, you’ll never know if you’re choosing someone out of love or loneliness.

Love you all &amp; Happy new year ♥️

I am a university student \[25 M\]. My life has its ups and downs but at the mean time I don't recognize anything that happened lately that would make me feel depressed. That being said, I don't know what is happening inside of my head, I have been feeling a little sad lately and I can't figure out that why would that happen. I am trying my best to live my life to its fullest as well and that is even a reason that I am questioning why I am getting these sadness waves out of the blue.  


If you are feeling lonely and want someone to talk to...I want someone to voice chat with too to talk a bit about our lives to feel better as I tend to get a mental health boost when I talk with people and exchange talks.

I'm not too sad about it and it's not me needing to vent out about the cancellation or anything. I've just been lonely here ever since I first came to Berlin 3 months ago. 

Been trying to find some good people but it has been pretty difficult. I like one of the people that I was supposed to hang out with today and we're getting closer, but other than that, I just haven't found my group of people yet.

Of course it's never about quantity, but when you're new somewhere, I feel like you do need a bunch of people that you can be at least comfortable around.

It's just me blabbering at this point even though I said I wouldn't. In any case, if you're spending New Year's alone, please feel free to tell us about it, or maybe tell me about it privately, whatever you feel like doing.

In any case, I hope you all have the day you deserve!"
