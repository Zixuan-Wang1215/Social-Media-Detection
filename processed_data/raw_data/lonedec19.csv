lonely,My mind's all kinda fucked up,"My mind's all kinda fucked up - Being alone can leave you bored at times with only your own company to amuse yourself. And your train of thoughts can just go anywhere. The last crazy thought I had was that if Elon musk is trying to commercialize travel to mars. Then people need a reason to do so in the first place.
On the other hand there are crazy ass fires spreading in the forests which are probably not naturally caused. This is happening in multiple places btw.
So if you connect the dots. Who would really gain from all this? I think i need help cuz now i am just blabbering."

My mom and my sister were going to my aunt's house and I'm left with my father. We're not close and I'd rather stay in my room than to see his face.

lonely,I feel so alone even if I have a lot of friends and a loving family.,"I feel so alone even if I have a lot of friends and a loving family. - I love to love and be loved. 
I don’t like to say this with my own mouth because it sounds like I’m trying to make myself look good but I’ll say it. I am kind and caring. Two words that I used to look up and aspired to be but now feel like shackles and I’d rather be selfish and feel less. 

I am in no means trying to make myself look good, I’m just trying to paint the picture so please do stay if it doesn’t get too obnoxious.

I am in a sense kind. To me the kindest people in the world are those who do things even if they don’t want to. Let’s say there is a chair on the bus and someone stands up to give it to someone else. A person who doesn’t mind is kind but to me the kinder person is the one who really doesn’t want to but still does it. 
I am often in the middle. I take joy in knowing I am helping or making someone’s day better. I go out of my way to smile and treat people respectfully hoping to myself that these small acts will make someone’s day a bit better. 

But true kindness is doing things that wouldn’t be rewarded they say. 

I don’t expect lavish gifts or rewards for my actions but I do hope that whomever would at least be a bit grateful for me going out of my way to do something for someone even if I don’t really feel like it. And to strangers it’s all the same. I’m just hoping they may be a bit happier. 
But to friends and family? 

I go out of my way to stretch myself thin so as to be of help to my loved ones. For instances my family. I live far away from home, my family although is kinda financially stable it sure could see some better days. I work two jobs and ask no support from my parents. They say they’d send me some but I tell them to do so when we get more stable. I take care of the housework and try to help my brother in anyway. (I live with my older brother who although a good human being isn’t really a responsible person.) to be honest I came here for college so I could ease my parents worries about my brother who was living alone. I got into the third best university in korea to make my family proud. I try so hard to maintain a good appearance so that I could be a friend and family member to be proud of. 
I’d make time in a very busy schedule to hang out with friends and give them the attention, time, and effort. 
Example, it was my friends birthday. I had work in the morning and a test the next day but I just crammed as much study time the week before just to make time to properly be able to celebrate her birthday.
There are many more instances like these. With my aunt, with coworkers, etc. 
And in the end of the day I sit back and hope that they will appreciate my efforts.
But my birthday was on the 22nd my aunt whom I time and time again helped when she was in a pinch asked me to work an 9 hour shift when she tells me all the time how wonderful of a boss she is and how, when her other workers have birthdays she gives them a day off. But I who was there from the day she opened her business, was there to help her settle, I who crashed my health hoping that it would be easier for her, I who by the simple fact that I love my aunt would work 6-7 days a week so she could settle down, gets a worse treatment than a part timer who started a month back?? The same goes for my family and friends. All I got is a text of “happy birthday.” 
I know that I in sense am not kind if I expect a sort of reward. But today I got an angry call from my mother saying “oh? So now that you are 20 you think your so grown up? You think that now that you are an adult you can do whatever you want?!”
And the answer is no. I am a child who craves love and recognition. I lay at night and cry myself to sleep because I am tired. So so very tired. I was thrown to adulthood and I am trying to do my best but things just slip by my fingers and I am sad how I am at the flower of my youth and I am wasting it away. 
I think I’m depressed to be honest. I’ve been like this for the longest time, probably middle school. But I just want someone who appreciates the small and big things that I do. Someone who I am enough for. 
Someone to tell me that I’m doing good and that they are proud of my accomplishments. 
I just want to be loved. I have many friends and a wonderful family. 
But I have no one who looks at me. Like really looks at me. I am not the happy, pretty girl I show everyone. I study late into nights to get good grades. I work endless hours to support my brother and I. I work so so hard to be as attractive as I can be. And all for who? All for what? 
I guess this is all just angsty 20 year old talk but even if my brain understands that I might be being stupid the fact that I feel so empty and sad does not change. 
Does anyone else feel this way? Do you need me to listen to you just like you read through my ginormous monologue? Maybe we can hear each other and make ourselves a little less lonely? 
I don’t know all I want to say is thank you for reading this helluva of a long rant. I hope that for as sad as I am you the reader is as happy. 
Hoping the New Years is going to be a new start for all of us. 
Please be happy. And one last time thank you."
lonely,Will probably be lonely next year too,Will probably be lonely next year too - I'm hoping that I can find some happiness next year and not be lonely but it'll probably never happen. It would be great if I could find a cuddle buddy but it's probably never going to happen. I hate having anxiety around people.
lonely,Alone on NYE,"Alone on NYE - So because of some circumstances around pay from work as well as pet sitting, I couldn’t get a last minute ticket to the music festival all my friends have gone to. Even then, as much as I want to experience it and would enjoy at least some of it (and nonetheless spend the time with friends which I know I’d love) I always leave it to the last minute every year and end up missing out because of anxiety or overthinking. I’m not entirely sure it’s my kinda thing (you never know if you never try tho right??), and it’s several hundred dollars to commit to too.

My parents went down to the beach with some family friends and I’m sat at home with my cat and consoling my anxiety ridden dog. It’s two hours til midnight. I kinda had something that I was going to be doing for at least a couple of hours this evening which didn’t quite pan out and I was really disappointed. Right now I’m just sitting her knowing that EVERYONE is with friends and loved ones, and I’m entirely alone.

Usually I don’t have too much of a problem being on my own, I’m quite independent anyway and I’ve chosen not to go to DnB gigs several times in the past (something some of my friends are into, doesn’t interest me in the slightest) and not feeling like I’m missing much. But tonight I feel incredibly lonely. I’m kind of at a loss as to what to do with the next few hours (I’m a night owl/insomniac which doesn’t help otherwise I’d just go to sleep) and what to do to prevent myself descending any further down into that hole of loneliness and overthinking.

Idk, sorry."
lonely,"Every time I’m with friends I don’t feel it, but once I’m alone again, it all comes back. It’s like being around other people only numbs it","Every time I’m with friends I don’t feel it, but once I’m alone again, it all comes back. It’s like being around other people only numbs it - Every night when I’m by myself, and everything is quiet and silent, that crippling loneliness just invades everything. But I’ve noticed that if I’m ever around friends it temporarily shuts it off, and then it’s back to the same routine when they leave. I feel isolated even though I know there are people out there who care about me. And every night it just amplifies - I can’t fall asleep and I’m just stuck in my own head."

lonely,So incredibly lonely. Can't sleep.,"So incredibly lonely. Can't sleep. - You know when people in love say, ""my heart is full,"" I think that's about right. But love is heavy without closeness to buoy it. I feel weighted and slow. He's the sun. The days barely register without him, so how can I sleep at night? Welp, turns out, I can't. I know he's coming back, but honestly, knowing that doesn't help. I'm so tired."

lonely,Feeling really sad tonight,"Feeling really sad tonight - Thought I was having a decent few days, but for some reason I began to feel so lonely tonight. I’m out here in a strange city by myself and I don’t have a significant other of any kind with me. I don’t want to sleep because I would like to resolve these feelings before I go to bed, but I don’t think I can. On the verge of tears, but not sure I can bring myself to let it out tonight. Starting to question my sanity too. Wondering if I’m able to make rational decisions anymore. Was going to go bar hopping with a work friend later but I don’t think it would be smart for me to be drinking if I’m this depressed. Plus I have a genuine work excuse. I want to meet someone to date, but I keep coming up with reasons why I can’t do it. It’s so much easier when I meet someone naturally in person doing my normal routine than if I forced a connection at a bar or on a dating app. I feel like there’s so much in life I’m missing out on. My life feels so laughably empty. And it’s because I know it is. I started Basic training just over a year ago, and I told myself “In a year it will be so much better.” Even then, I kept thinking about the life I could have led had I not joined the Army, and how I would have been able to make things work out. Anything is better than Basic, but at least I had companionship with the other guys there. Don’t really have any friends here, just acquaintances, and just about all are married. Genuinely upset right now, but I also feel happy that I’m not in worse shape. My emotions are really contradicting. Sigh."
lonely,"My heart aches for love, but there's no one there to fill it. (Rant/Advice post for those lonely hurting hearts)","My heart aches for love, but there's no one there to fill it. (Rant/Advice post for those lonely hurting hearts) - In my head I dream of the perfect one, my true love, my other half. The one to make me whole, that gives me meaning and purpose.

Then realizing that I'm already enough, that it's all in my head. That I shouldn't let past failures and experiences get to me but they do...they sneak up on you like a shadow. Who just follows you wherever you loneliness leads in the grand expanse of your mind.

Your mind, a tool it is. Tools sometimes need mending and maintenance. Especially after going through intense ordeals, like a break up, a rejection, or out right heartbreak. 

You begin to hear thoughts like, your ugly, useless, pathetic, unworthy of love....that's not you...it's your shadow keeping you down. But it's there for a purpose, listen to your shadow. It's letting you know that there is something wrong, something that needs time to mend, to learn, and to grow beyond. 

You can wallow in self-pity or you can have healthy dialog with your shadow. Show it that deep down you are worthy. Worthy of love, recognition, respect, etc. 

Recognize that you are your own best friend, love yourself, especially in times of distress and loneliness. Where you think of thoughts of  sadness, heartbreak and even death/self harm.

It's not easy and takes practice, even then there are really bad days and moments where you just want everything to stop, end, begone, to no longer exist.

That is the time where you need to ask yourself, why do I feel like this? What happened that it's gotten so bad? What steps that I need to take to make myself feel better? To be happy again and not extremely lonely?

That is something each and everyone of us needs to do some introspection on and find the answer This is a solo journey in becoming whole on your own, well for me it is anyway....I see a therapist bi-weekly. But she can only do so much in a given time.

Any-who, just some thoughts I had as I was dealing with a big episode of feeling so lonely it physically started to hurt. Then I start to just type this post out and it ended up being advice/thought/ideas I really needed to just tell myself. To get out of that vicious downward spiral of  ""I'm worthless"" ""No women will ever find me attractive"" ""I'm unlovable""  ""What is the point of keeping going day after day"" ""I'll never be able to trust anyone again""  to the point where it just gets ridiculous and you know you need to get those thoughts out somehow before they kill you.

So yea, that was the point of this post. As I type this I'm feeling a bit better, the crippling loneliness is still there but it's no longer just building up and brooding inside.

Hope this helps someone else that is in the same boat as I am. Dm's are welcome if anyone needs to vent. I'll listen/help if/when I can.

Sending good vibes your way. Hope they lighten up your world a bit. :)"
lonely,Being alone is always something I've been afraid of.,"Being alone is always something I've been afraid of. - I don't know how to explain the way I feel besides empty. I'm not sad or anything it's just a constant state of nothingness. It's almost like a numb feeling, as I state at the four corners of my room thinking about what it may be like to have someone, anyone that you can be with. Someone to look at while you sit there playing the same video game or watching the same movie are studying for a dumbass subject to pass a dumbass class just for you to get lonely with an income . I have friends people I hang out with constantly and I love as if there family but even with that I just don't feel anything once I get home and I'm by myself. All I can think about is how I spent nearly all of my youth depressed cause I feel like something's missing. I don't know what and I don't know if il ever know. Couping seems to only get harder. I don't think il do anything rash like suicide or anything like that but it's just hard mentally. I'm saying this here cause I just want a place to vent out this feeling that I can only describe when I'm writing or typing. I wish I just had someone that I could love someone I can come home and get a text message from just asking how my day was. Someone that I can cuddle with when I just feel done with the world... its just really hard sometimes."
lonely,I wish,"I wish - ...that the way I love could be acceptable and healthy. I wish I didn't need someone I love at arm's length in order to feel my existence were meaningful. And I wish I had learned the value of friendships and how to make them, so maybe I wouldn't feel be quite this lonely.. It took a violent relationship to force me into self awareness. A part of me truly regrets not dying with the relationship. It's been four years and I can't get rid of the shame or the belief that I'm damaged goods. I can't accept love. I can't accept being used and hurt again either. I feel voided and useless. .All I want right now is to be the naive 19 year old I was many years ago; living in a bubble with my first love, who understood me more than I knew, and loved me unconditionally."

Idk if it’s my parents and my dogs I miss, or just hanging out with my brother and his friends (he’s a few years younger than me and he and his friends are still in college) but I just feel so sad. I have hardly any friends where I’m living right now and the only meaningful human interaction I get is at work. Everything I do I’m alone. I’ve just felt like there’s a huge pit in my stomach.

lonely,I'll never find anyone.,"I'll never find anyone. - M17. Bisexual. I've never been in a relationship. Everyone I fall for seems to be the 'shy, awkward' type. Well, surprise surprise, so am I. Since 'opposites attract,' evidently, those people are more often than not drawn to the more outgoing personality types. I'm never really an option. I just want someone I can relate to, share moments with, someone who will make life a little less hell, and quite frankly, it's starting to seem like I'll never find that. Secondary school will be over soon, and I know I'm too much of an introvert to actually go out and socialize at university. Dating apps aren't for me. If secondary school is supposed to be the highlight of your life, I wonder how shitty the rest of it's gonna be.

Since we don't get many chances,  
Do: Prioritise anything that comes in the way of your relationship and remove those obstacles. Even if you're told repeatedly no, if you know something is wrong fight for it until it's fixed.  
Don't: Spend 10 years with the next wrong person trying hard to make it work just because you were in love with someone once and it didn't work out.  
Don't: Spend 6 years or more twice over waiting for someone online before finding out they weren't faithful.

Basically don't waste decades with the wrong person or with anyone online that doesn't want to meet within 6 or so months. You don't have that much time to waste."

I'm still a virgin, never kissed or anything. My only way to have sex is through an escort which is what I'm going to do. I don't want to be a kissless virgin anymore, i don't care how i lose it. Lesbian dating is slim pickings, we can't even find a casual hookup which is what i want. So I'll just use an escort.

I'm tired of it."

I have ambition out the fucking ass it’s really the ONLY thing I have. How am I supposed to have people in my life man I know I’m fucking ugly I have low testosterone im fucking albino and about 70 pounds obese so really won the genetic lottery. I love people I want to help and I want to add value to people’s lives I want to be there for people and shit but I have no connections of any kind I think I’m funny but I’m not nice anymore. Maybe it was the bullies that literally almost killed me with a big ass rock or maybe it’s just the years of depression and isolation daydreaming about what a normal life might be like that has made me so fucking bitter at 17 years of age no less=) I want to do so many things and I’m working hard af to get to where I want to be but nobody has any fucking interest in me romantically or just to be friends. Is there any way to live a happy life like this or is there any fucking way to escape? I’m ok with waiting a bit 17 isn’t old age and sure some other people haven’t had any experience in relationships by that age but fuck does it feel like I never will. I understand I have no value on the market and I want to be better I honest to fuck do but I just haven’t been able to fix myself whatever the fuck it is that people hate me for when all I ever tried to do was be good. Fuck it I’m sorry that I’m a pussy and I pity myself I’m too fucking scared dude how the fuck can I change? Please I’m seriously desperate?

I really want to be someone’s person, and feel that there is love for me, but it just feels so hopeless. The affection of people from the opposite gender is really important to me, and the lack of it in my life is really hard in me mentally for some reason. Kinda ranty I know. I don’t know what to do to improve my “game” so to speak to find that person I want in my life. I’m 19, in college, and very social, however I feel like women just don’t see me sometimes.

Even if I try to meet new and different people the result is always the same: I always end up in the middle of the night thinking about how I have no one to share this supposed happy moment that is this new beginning, but my beginning just always seems like a sad ending and more I start to think that is the way it is supposed to be and that feeling just sucks, it sucks more than what I can put in words, it sucks in a way that takes my sleep at night and it sucks that I have to get up of my bed and pretend everything is ok the next morning."
lonely,Empty,"Empty - Surrounded by people and yet I feel so very alone,  so lonely.  Been married for 26 yrs but she is more of just a roommate.   I need to feel love, to be loved. I need to feel the touch of a woman to be desired. 
Instead I get granny kisses from the wife. 
Xmas I spend alone.    Feel so empty. 
It hurts"

lonely,Sleeping Thru NYE,"Sleeping Thru NYE - Has anyone else tried to alter their sleep schedule so that you intentionally sleep through NYE? 

I got up early today. Extra early. My goal was to fall asleep early tonight. At least by 8:00 PM. I grew up on the east coast but live in Los Angeles now. I always watched the ball drop. Now that I am in LA, I watch the ball drop at 9:00 PM Pacific time. Doing it alone last year was the hardest thing I ever experienced and I don’t want to do it again this year. My only hope for tomorrow is that I am sound asleep by no later than 8:30 PM. At least I have some hope, I guess... But I know me. No one else wants to know me, but I’m forced to. In 24 hours, I’ll be in tears. Unable to sleep. Unable to not watch. Listening to neighbors enjoying life. Fireworks. Laughter.... Yet it still feels so quiet.

This is what I’ve become. I hate it. I hate myself. I hate this life :-("

I've got a loving family, incredible friends, but for some reason, I just feel so lonely and unloved. I feel unwanted, unneeded. I want something more than just friends, I'd love to have a relationship but no one finds me interesting or worthy enough. I'm so alone. I feel like no one truly understands me.

lonely,Feeling tired (another vent),"Feeling tired (another vent) - A while ago (and by a while I mean 3 months or so) I was desperate for any interactions with any of my few friends, trying to talk to them at any moment they could.

I enjoy talking to them when they can but it's getting harder to live through each day, I'm just tired of only feeling the lack of purpose. There are things I still want to do, make, and see. 
Those wishes aren't enough tho."

lonely,I miss my ex,"I miss my ex - I’m a 20 year old guy. I have no friends outside of co workers and nothing happens outside of work except for video games occasionally with one of them. I dated my ex for about 7 months and it was the best 7 months of my life. We broke up because she was too stressed about school and work and everything else she had going on in her life. Now I’ve been stuck here for about a month feeling about as lonely as I have ever felt in my life. Depression is also my best friend now too. Constant thought about what could’ve been, how happy I could have been during the holidays with her. I had such a connection to her and it feels like I was just a bag of garbage that she just tossed outside. It’s a crippling feeling. I want to make my life better but I just don’t have the physical motivation to do it. I just miss her so much. I miss being loved in that relationship way. Not by just family. But by someone who really wanted to see me and be with me. I hate this."
lonely,By choice?,By choice? - I’m 20 and lonely as hell but I feel its mainly my fault. I genuinely feel like people are interested in being around me but I just dont feel that same interest and end up staying home. I’m not even sure if I will even meet friends I want to be around because I’m so used to not going out now and having anyone to text so I suck at doing both. I hate talking to people online because I feel like it’s pointless.

i just wish someone knew they didn’t have to. my sister was hospitalised for years because of anorexia and refusing to eat. this type of thing happens far far more often to girls than men, so many unrealistic body expectations portrayed everywhere in society, it’s unsurprising.

literally all i want is to love someone for who they are, and vice versa. but it seems impossible, people’s mentality have been tarnished by social media already. it feels too late. people out here spending countless hours and insane money just to try portray themselves as attractive to people they will never meet on social media. they know it’s fake, everyone knows it’s fake, at some point you’re gonna be there a mess in bed with no style no filters no anything and you know what, that pure state of a girl i love is just the absolute best.

You can judge for yourself in my post history. But I lack a personality and my health is pretty bad. I work somewhere that is kinda creepy for women so I dont have a chance of meeting anyone here. 
Datiing sites make me feel worthless alot of women tell me good luck and stuff like that or view my profile n never respond. I'm just confused on Why complete strangers wont even try to get to know me. I've been alone since 2005 to 2019. It's really hard dealing with that when the clock is ticking and I got the experience of a 18 year old. And my last girlfriend wasnt really my girlfriend just someone I would make out with nothing more."
lonely,i feel misunderstood,"i feel misunderstood - when i get back home after a long schoolday, i don't have anyone greeting me. or someone who's waiting for me, let alone asking how my day went. most of the time i'm just home alone. it's been like this since 8th grade. so when i'm in class i keep talking with the teachers and my classmates (we don't know eachother well yet). i hope they don't find me annoying, it's just that at home i don't have anyone else to talk to. but i have to fill my social bar somehow.

 i have adhd and social anxiety. because of my adhd i can sometimes be quite unaware of many things happening, for example, in a social situation. usually my head is somewhere else, and when i talk with other people i sometimes get distracted midway so it take some time to make my point. my impulsiveness also leads to many awkward situations. 

around the age kids develope social and emotionally i got very overwhelmed, since i got bullied many times before + the lack of friends i had made me feel less valuable (?). when i was 12 i got diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. 

since then i just push people away. it's not that i don't want to be with them, it's just that i don't feel the energy to try, and i'm not sure if i'm able to give them a good time either. because of that i became even more socially akward. because of depression u stop taking good care of urself and it made people bully me even more. i didn't go to school because of that, ended up failing the schoolyear and had been sent to another one. that's where i picked everything up again, i got productive again and beat depression. 

i don't tell anyone about my past, even some family members never knew i tried suicide twice. it's just that i don't want to concern them with it, and i don't want them to think about it when being with me. 

actually now that i'm typing this i'm not sure what my goal was, but looked back at that part of my life and wrote it down. idk i just don't know how to handle social situations, which is a big miss since i don't have anyone i can spend my time with. i just end up thinking..."

lonely,New Years Eve,"New Years Eve - Hey everyone,

Is anyone else feeling more lonelier than ever before this holiday season? With New Years Eve being tomorrow, I have found myself in a similar situation as I have in the past years celebrations. I just sit at home and watch the famous New York 'ball drop' and go to bed. I most likely will do the same tomorrow. However, I just feel more empty this year. I feel disassociated with life? I don't know if that's the correct usage of disassociation but it just seems right. As I grow older, celebrations and holidays become more empty. I become even more numb and distant from family and friends. Is anyone else in the same boat? Sorry for the rant."

lonely,A reflection on my last decade,"A reflection on my last decade - This text is long. It’s basically my life in the last ten years, my ups and downs. Feel free to read or ignore but I cleared my mind writing that and that’s already enough for me. 

In 2010 I was 10 years old, confident, innocent and happy I’m pretty sure. I guess when you’re that young there’s not much to worry about. I was really good in school, always had the best grades and parents couldn’t be prouder of me. 

Fast forward to 2012, I got accepted to the best high school in my region and I was excited to start a new page in my life. I remember being super confident and thinking that I was going to make loads of friends. At first it went like that, I met a lot of cool people and I felt connected to them. Something was off though, I didn’t feel like I was ever a part of them but more like outsider looking at them.

Next year, 2013, I was put in a new class, I liked the people I was with, they were funny and interesting but I still felt like I didn’t fit in. That’s also the year my grades started to be lower. For the first time in my life I was failing a class and I didn’t know how to tell my parents, I felt like such a disappointment to them. So like any kids would do, I tried to hide it, it worked for a while but then they found. I got grounded for afterwards and I started isolating myself from everyone. I wanted to have good grades but the pressure of succeeding was too much for me and I got really anxious. 

2014 was a low point in my life. Even though I met a friend that is still to this day my best friend, let’s call him H cause I will refer to him later in this story, that year was the worst. I remember going in this school year thinking I was going to get better but it just got worst. I kept failing every math test and my parents were clearly fed up with it. I knew how disappointing I was but no matter how hard I studied I kept failing. I also remember vividly a moment this year were I was in my kitchen, my parents weren’t home, and I just hold a knife to my throat, sobbing, and seriously thinking about just ending it all. Fortunately I gave up, I wasn’t strong enough to do that, I remember thinking at the time that I was a coward but today I’m grateful for it. Those suicidal thoughts kept happening for a couple of years, just wondering ""what if I just died right now""; ""would people even care?"". I was really, towards the end of the school year I managed to get my shit together and passed the year. This summer, I played soccer, I didn’t play it competitively since I was 9 or 10 so I was worried about it. Let me tell you, this didn’t help, my dad, whose really competitive, always had something bad to say about how I played no matter if we won or not. This has given me a lot of anxiety and lowered my self esteem by a lot. 

2015 is a year were I decided to let myself go a little bit. I was tired of being watched by my parents so I decided to care a lot less about everything. At least that’s what I told myself, on the inside I was still stressed about everything but I decided not to show it. The year went smoothly if were talking about grades, I wasn’t excellent but I passed everything which was an improvement. My friend H also showed me one his friend, let’s call him L. L was a nice guy but he seemed troubled, a bit like me, but I wasn’t showing it. I didn’t want to talk with him about that but it was clear. Us 3 met a lot that year and spent a lot of time together. For the first time in forever I felt free, free from responsibilities, free from anxiety, free from everything, in a way they might have saved me and they don’t even know that. 

2016 was the last year of high school, I was happy about that but scared about the future, what would happen to with the people I know from school? A friend of H and L who happens to be a girl started hanging out with us, let’s call her J. She was kind and always nice with me, over time I started developing some feelings for her but I was unsure about how I felt so I never said anything. In the middle of that she got a boyfriend and I thought to myself well there’s that. But two weeks later they broke up and I was kind of happy. I decided to talk with L and H about how I felt and they told me I should be honest with her. To be honest that’s not what I was looking for, I wanted them to tell me to not say anything. One afternoon I grew some balls and told her how I felt. She told me that like our friendship but didn’t think we should be more. I was hurt but I just shook my head and said that I understands that. As the year went by we talked less and less, I just felt like I fucked everything by saying that. That same year L made some new friends which me and H weren’t really trusting but couldn’t force him to leave them. He started doing drugs and drinking a lot, we tried to tell him to stop but he wasn’t listening

As 2017 began I was scared, I was now in college in a brand new environnement, with new people. The year had barely began that I read on the news that the cops were looking for a teen in our area who had disappeared, when I saw the picture my blood froze, it was L. Immediately I read the article, apparently he left his house late at night and never came back. I texted him but no answer. A couple of days later one of the people I knew from high school told me they found him he was okay but at home and his parents wouldn’t let anyone talk to him. I was stressed, what had happened? I tried to focus at school but couldn’t, H didn’t know much more either. Maybe a month after that incident H texted me a number and told me to call if I wanted to talk to L. I got out of one of my classes and called the number. It was psychiatric house, I asked for him and we talked. He explained to me that he went out of his house that day to meet his other friends, the smoked a lot and drank even more. He got in a fight somehow and was brought to the hospital where he punched a doctor because he thought the doctor was tryin to hurt him. He was later on diagnosed schizophrenic and had to be held in a psychiatric house for a long period of time, plus he had to go to court for assault on the doctor. Learning all that at the same time just made me speechless, I didn’t know what to say I felt responsible for not saying something before it was too late. I might have been able to help him I never said anything. I kept calling him every Friday, it was the only day he could receive calls, but it was hard talking to him knowing he was in such a bad state. This made me really depressive, I talked to some people in school, sometimes texted H, but other than that I just isolated myself from everyone. I didn’t want to deal with what the world had to offer.

2018 wasn’t much different, I would’ve loved for it to be a positive year but it wasn’t. I honestly can’t recall hanging out with someone more than 2 or 3 times that year. I was scared. I didn’t want to go out, meet new people, even just text those people. That year I also turned 18, which is a pretty big deal here since I can legally drink, but I didn’t have the heart to do it, I didn’t want to turn out like L did. Most of the things teenagers would do like drinking, smoking and partying I decided to avoid. That year was pretty shit honestly, I was supposed to finish college but I failed some classes and had to do one more semester. My parents pretty much gave up on me that year, the golden boy that I once was was now replaced by this sad teenagers. Admittedly they know nothing that I just wrote about, I don’t like to share with them, I feel like I’m always judged by them. The year ended like it began, without hope. 

2019 felt like an important year. I got back in touch with L who’s doing well now and thinking about going back to school. H is still talking to me, we try to hang out but our schedule never really match. I should go to university next semester to study in psychology and I’m really happy about it. I started going to the gym at the beginning of November. I always heard about people saying how good for your morale it was to go train and I always felt skeptical of that. They might have been right cause I feel way better now. I also got back in touch with some high school friends and started hanging with them. I feel like I’m slowly regaining my confidence and it’s the best gift I could’ve asked for. I haven’t done anything special but I’ve never felt this good in long long time and this makes me hopeful for the future honestly. I’m still stressed but less anxious about stuff. For the first time I want to live my life, I used to say that I didn’t care if I was to die tomorrow but now I want to live and experiment, I want to make others happy and help people who struggle. I haven’t been the person in the last decade but O want to do more in the next one. I still think about that day when I was holding a knife to my throat ready to end it all and I’m so happy I didn’t have the balls to do it. I know how loneliness affects a person, how you can isolate yourself from people for no good reason but I also know that you’re the only one suffering for that. Everyone has to learn at their own pace, it may take you a year, 5 year or even 20 year, but we’re lucky to be here no matter how hard life is it deserved to be cherished. This was not supposed to be that long but it was great reminiscing about everything and it makes me even more grateful for life. Please everyone take care and I’ll see you in another decade."

lonely,How are your mental breakdowns?,"How are your mental breakdowns? - Today i see at ig that a my ex had a breakdown. She was eating ice cream with her best friends while they probably were supporting her as i could see in said ig story

My breakdowns is feel that I can't breathe and weak, wanting to cry and kill myself, and like if i were about to faint in the floor and don't were able to get up. Anyways i never get to that point of actually fainting because usually I'm busy with shit  and try to don't alarm people (because i would send to shit everything.and don't do  it to don't worry anyone because nobody care about me. I do it because only would get insulted probably ) so only lean on walls. Once that I'm alone i cry out of rage and punch a pillow until I'm done.

They actively ignore me when I meet with them with my friends while they always engage with and make an effort to talk to my friends. They literally pretend I don't exist and only speak to me if I speak to them, but it is always very abrupt and they never try to keep the conversation going. It is a huge struggle of mine that guys find me so offputting and I don't even know why. I feel so incredibly lonely and unworthy of love. I genuinely believe I will die alone at this point.

I don’t feel like I have anything worth saying anymore. Sometimes At work I have a nice conversation with a customer and it literally feels like the entire world to me. 

There’s such a deep sadness that hangs over me always, and I try so hard not to think abt bc I just feel like I can’t go on if I do. I’ve always been a loner, drifter, outcast, whatever and I’m used to dealing with being alone but it just hits differently now then when I was like 16 and sitting alone at lunch. I don’t know how to make friends. It’s a miracle i made the friends I had. I’m not in college I live with my parents and i just feel like a big loser. who would want to be friends with me anyways?

lonely,My aunts recently had a baby and they shifted from me to her,"My aunts recently had a baby and they shifted from me to her - I'm an 11-year old with a 9-year old sister who was originally the favorite across the family. But in March, everything changed when my aunts had a baby. Everyone was turning away from me, even my trusted grandfather (dad's side). I was left out like a pile of mud. The family was all gathering all around the baby. I have to deal with this when my aunts arrive to my house. When I say I hate how she cries, my aunt responds with the fact I was a baby, too. And then I remind her we're all going to be rotting corpses, but I won't be the one that's rotting.

TL;DR I was the favorite until my aunts had a baby."

Just to be around them to deafen the lonely silence.

I'm aware its an incredibly bad habit, but its just makes me feel okay in the short run."

lonely,How to make friends online?,"How to make friends online? - Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

This is probably a really dumb question to a lot of people, but how does one make friends online in this day and age. As part of my New Years Resoluton (yea, yea, I know) I am going to make somewhat of a better attempt to be more social. This could range from meeting more people IRL outside of work to simply just leaving a comment on a youtube video and everything inbetween. I have come to the realisation that I am the quintessential lurker. I browse social media, Reddit, etc. and never actually participate. All I do is read and move on. I can't remember the last time I spoke to someone online in particular. Even the games that I play in recent years have all been single player orientated so I can't even meet people with that old method. I look back on games I used to play when I was younger and marvel at the weird yet interesting conversations I used to have with people that I still remember to this day. I've even tried to use Discord communities but I find it very difficult to get a decent conversation going when each channel has hundreds of users in them each with their own code of in-jokes."

i’m going through a really tough breakup with my previous boyfriend, and i spent new years with him last year so a lot of those me memories are coming back and getting me down. he’s being a total asshat to me (blocked me on all social media after i just wished him a merry christmas, talking shit about me on his social platforms, shutting down my attempts to extend an olive branch, getting his friends involved and getting mad at me when i talk to “his” friends who i’ve developed a solid friendly relationship with through the time when we were together. 

i don’t really know what the point of this was. the holidays have been really getting me down this year and i haven’t been myself for a long time. i haven’t been drawing which is a huge part of my life and can’t bring myself to do it. i’ve been in the ER twice for mental health reasons since november and i don’t have much privacy at home anymore because of it. i can’t show emotion without my parents asking a long list of questions or thinking they need to take me back to the hospital. 

this year, everything just really really sucks. but i guess i made it through another year."

lonely,"Thoughts on life, love and leaving","Thoughts on life, love and leaving - So I'm 18 now and I'll be headed off to college soon. It's got me thinking about my life experiences in these three (relatively) close towns I've lived in. From my first crush, a girl named Ashely; my first friend, a girl named London; to where I stand now. I've been a lot of things-- in love, homeless, high, drunk, afraid, content, happy and lonely to name a few. Nothing profound, most people are these things at one time or another, maybe everyone is. 

The first time I kissed anyone I was 7 years old. Nothing spicy, I was chivalrous and kissed her on the hand. It was my best friend at the time, London. 

I wouldn't kiss again for 8 years after that. It was my freshman year of highschool. The experience was a bit rough at the time but in hindsight is quite funny. The girl was short and well I want expecting a kiss... She jumped up and chipped a tooth on mine. 

Nothing happens for the next almost two years. Then I meet a girl and God damn I didn't expect this one. All folklore and lo-fi, a wilted flower in a window and loose secondhand clothes. I still listen to her taste in music today. She had this taste, this hunger for the authentic and real. Things she could touch or feel, taste or smell, see or hear. She loved other's passions even if it was just for the sake of the passion and not the thing itself. Things sparked up and flared up, then burnt out. Just a summer in the heat I suppose. It ended when I said ""I love you.""

There's been a few people here or there. A boy crush or a few weeks of flirting that ended in nothing. 

Still, I have these scenes in my mind. All these little moments I've shared with people and they hint at something I can't quite grasp I don't think. If you're interested, I'll describe a few of them to you. 

Samantha and I. It's the homecoming football game. The crowd cheers and screens in the distance, the loud speakers blare the game narration. A ways from the game, Sam and I sit atop a building which is situated on a hill. We sit there watching the people roar then the crowds disperse into sunders. 

Bella and I. It's at a party, weed, beer and vodka pollute the air inside. I'm a few drinks into the night but God people are loud and so afraid to be different. I go to sit on the rooftop, the roof sits at an angle. An hour or so later Bella appears on the roof. One of the two prettiest girls in the school, the other was her identical twin. There she is all teary eyed on the peak of a suburban home. At least for a few hours, she wasn't afraid to be different. It's the little things about people, really. The color yellow and how she was always afraid to wear it. The music she loves but none of her friends like. We almost kissed, but she was drunk and I wasn't about to let her regret a drunk kiss.

Aiden and I. Nothing much, just an evening on a bean bag chair. Him stroking my hair and god I just felt so beautiful for a while there. 

Cass and I. We were close friends. One night we went to a bon fire, someone brought weed. We smoked a bit then after the fire, we went back to her house. We made out and all that. Nothing came of it. 

One last story if you're still interested. I've save the best for last. 

Isa and I. We met at a coffee shop around noon. Absolutely stunning. We drank some tea and went on a walk to a pond. We walked about the trails and the backstreets for a bit and then back to the area with street shops. A candy shop, a novelty store, a place which sold little rocks and necklaces. Then when the storm clouds rolled in, we climbed a fire escape. The building was on the side of a hill about halfway up, but it was high enough to see for miles and miles. All the car lights and the outlines of buildings all lined in white strings of stars. We played and sang songs on the roof for hours, throwing playing cards and ducking when cops rolled by. Then when the rain started, the cards got wet and weren't good for throwing. We laid there in the rain watching the clouds turn white-violet. Though the holes in the clouds we could see the sky turn dark and the stars show through the rain and storm. I fell in love with her. 

None of these moments changed much. Just stories now I suppose. I wonder why I can't have more than one story with anyone. It's always just the one."

lonely,Why am I lonely?,"Why am I lonely? - I have an amazing husband and a LO who was born this year. My family are close by and I do have friends....but I can be in a room full of people and still feel lonely. 

Due me being on maternity, my husband is working a huge amount of hours, for which I’m very grateful, and have a huge amount of guilt for. 

Over the last couple of years, I try to arrange things with family and friends, anything from meeting up for a walk, visiting other family, lunch to mini breaks....all cancel on me. I try to go out my way and do all the organising for no benefit. My friends normally give excuses but then will post on social media that they are doing other things...with other friends. 

I tried to organise a lovely meal out, tbh everyone had something to complain out (even though they agreed the food was incredible) and that they should have stayed at home. 

I have had some serious health issues this year to the point that my life could have been on the line.....I am one to downplay things to people but most close friends knew the extent of my issues although they brushed it off. One even compared a 24hour stomach bug to my issues (4 week hospital stay), as in the bug would have been more serious. I wasn’t looking for sympathy or even mentioned my issues, they brought up the whole conversation. 

I can walk in a room of people I know and not a single one will acknowledge me and they’ll just sit on their phones. 

I’m not sure whether I’m just being ungrateful for what I have got, as I know I’m very lucky but I just can’t get over this huge feeling of loneliness. I don’t feel like I have anyone to turn to anymore and I have lost the motivation to make an effort after years of trying with people. 

Sorry this was so long. I just needed to get out what is in my head."

I was asked by an administrator during some grade meeting and they seemed offended that I thought that life on campus is dry and it’s hard to make connections with people. like I was somehow insulting her personally or her school or something. they called me miserable to my face, and just explained to me what I already know, I’m not alone with how I’m feeling. yeah I already know that, thanks though, doesn’t make it go away. I know that it’s a temporary experience and that helps me feel alright knowing I’m in school with a purpose to get a degree. It really sucks that I went through middle and high school not having any quality friends. It sucks now. Feels empty. Running out of ways to cope, want to fix this by finding decent friends."

Now with school over, i’m lonely, kinda depressed, and I don’t even have he motivation to get out of bed, let alone do hobbies. School will start again soon, but even so, this is not a healthy way to live, putting all my life around school, and having nothing but it. Honestly I don’t really want to start again, having to put effort into (platonic) relationships p once again only for them to drift away at the end of the semester. I’ve never had a relationship last longer than a year since primary school. I’ve been told it’s just a numbers game, but I can’t keep doing this, it’s exhausting, I get overly attached to anyone I connect with and it hurts when they eventually drift apart. I’m seeing therapy, but so far the first session was kinda unproductive, and I felt like we were not understanding each other. I know it’ll always be like that for the first few sessions but still, I don’t want to put all of my hope into an hour every week. I’m not really sure what to do, I have family over for Christmas and stuff but I can’t really relate well, and I feel like the third wheeler even with them. 

I’m not sure what to do. I want my friends to know I’m lonely, but I know that’s selfish and would guilt them to be with me. I would like to progress these relationships but I don’t really know how.

One of the people I connected with is a girl I sat next to in class. Before this we got along well, talked with her at class and when we saw each other in the hall, and we also walked to the bus together. It turns out we shared a bunch of interests too. Essentially I invited he to a Starbucks together and spend a couple talking there. Afterwards I kinda invited her to see a movie, but I guess I unintentionally made it seem like I was trying to date her, but this was not really my intent. I kinda went down that path because I honestly did not know how else to progress relationships. She said she was too busy but I took it as a rejection at the time. Anyway, long story short we talked it over, and we agreed to be friends. Now we are friends on snapchat, and view each others stories. Unfortunately she will not share a class with me next semester, but I hope that will not stop us. Shes away at her parents for the holidays, but once she got back, I was hoping to try to watch a movie with her again. We both really like watching the Lord Of The Rings, so I thought it might be a good idea to see that together. 

I guess it’s kinda pathetic, but just having something like to look forward to kinda gives me hope. I guess I’m kinda “obsessing” over one person, but I don’t really have anyone else, and I don’t want to once again abandon what I have. I am not sure what to do. I need help and advice."

I am currently going through a separation, it's hard. 9yrs, we are still in the house together, we have kids.. Separation hasn't been announced yet really, in fact we haven't even discussed moving out. Things have been kosher for the most part. She is off doing her own thing and I am doing my own thing. It was more so on her choice. Well tonight I am home alone and I just feel worse that usual. I mean don't get me wrong I do have weak days.. Some I am strong. Right now at this moment I feel weak and sad. Trying to get rid of my thoughts about the past with my relationship. The happy moments only bring me pain now. It hurts, so bad. I have been trying to fill my life with random people to avoid having to focus on any of the pain. If anyone else is going through something like this, you definitely aren't alone in this. It hurts, it sucks. The lows always follow the highs.."
lonely,Why the f@#k does it hurt so bad,Why the f@#k does it hurt so bad - I was watching a scene from a Australian comedy show today and a particular scene triggered my depression so horribly. A Aussie twin gets high and hooked up with hot guys and the ugly freak is left alone completely still virginity in tact but her twin goes to have sex breaking there virginity rule. This brought up so many memories that haunt me. Of a girl I loved being whisked away by my best friend and sit in in silence as I heard them fuck. Myself not losing my virginity till I was 20. (I was 18 at the time) I saw my friends life propel ahead into manhood and me being the wild crazy one. I hadn’t done a thing and am always the weird awkward kid. Worse thing was the show reminded me that I’m surrounded by some of the most gorgeous woman on the planet (Australian woman) and because of my background I will never be accepted by them. Been called a peasant and poor. I cried so much today after seeing the scene and debated whether to post this. But I can’t shake this feeling from my mind.... tis pathetic but it is me

lonely,Waking up sucks,"Waking up sucks - I have a really hard time waking up. It's not even that I'm particularly depressed or anything, though sometimes it is, yet genuinely being asleep is better than being awake. I've always been an extremely vivid dreamer, and I remember my dreams in detail 90% of the time. If I wake up, I can easily go back to sleep and I dream every time. It's gotten to the point where if I don't have a reason to wake up (work, prior commitment, etc.) then I literally ""sleep"" for 12-14 hours just because I'd rather be dreaming than be awake. In my dreams I'm interesting, doing things worthwhile, often have someone to love who loves me back, have friends and excitement. My life isn't bad, I'm actually extremely blessed, but I am just so unsatisfied and lonely that I have a really hard time waking up."

I finally moved out of my parents house (I'm 23)

I got an amazing job working in the ER of my local hospital and am going to be going to nursing school once I save up enough money for a car.

I cut back on my drinking and other substance use, and in a week I'll officially be 3 years and 7 months clean from opiates. 

I quit smoking. Finally. After 8 years, haven't touched a cigarette since September.

I'm finally losing weight and paying more attention to my looks instead of wearing jeans and a t-shirt every day.

I finally learned how to admit I was wrong, and worked to make up for all of the pain I caused to friends that were just trying to help me when I was lost in the dark.

Everyone in my life is so proud of me, so happy for me, I'm finally on the road to success and my family actually wants me around.

But here I sit, 12:30 AM. I have to get up for work in 6 hours, and all I can think about is the fact that I'm just so unbearably lonely. It blows my mind because I have plenty of friends, family and co-workers to keep me company nearly every day. I'm not sure if I'm just burnt out from work or what, but I just feel like I'm still not doing enough.

I don't know if these posts are allowed here, but I didn't want to bother anyone irl, I just wish I could figure out why j feel so alone and depressed every night before bed. 

My parents always tell me I'm too hard on myself, and they're right, I just don't know why. 

Anyway, thanks for letting me ramble on. I'll be fine. I think."
lonely,Alone on New Year’s Eve this year,"Alone on New Year’s Eve this year - Asked a co-worker what they’re doing for New Years and they said they were going out on a boat and asked me if I would like to come. I said yeah, sure just message me some details and we can work it out. No message, and he stopped talking to me at work. 

I asked someone else if they would like to hang out and drink with me instead and they said yes, checked with them to ask if they’re still coming and they said no sorry I have plans.

Asked a third person who I work with if they would please hang out with me at an arcade as I don’t really know anyone else that likes games. They agreed, but when I asked them if they’re still coming they said no I have plans.

Fuck this, why even bother to say yes to me if you don’t want to follow through. Not to mention they didn’t even let me know they had other plans until I asked if they were still interested. I’m just feeling so down I needed to vent. Hopefully when I do go out for New Years someone will talk to me but I doubt it."

lonely,Isolation is a big part of my life,"Isolation is a big part of my life - I’m 23, going on 24. I feel like I’m an odd case for loneliness honestly. From the ages of 17-19 I was extremely social. The city I’m from has a distinct “cool hipster bar constantly hosting local bands” street and I became a resident there. I’m not one for bars too much now but I’d have pints with friends that I had constantly and everyone kind of looked up to me simply cause I was 18, and I was hanging out with my brother and his friends who were almost a decade older and I genuinely fit in. Maybe a bit more mature than most 18 year olds, and sense of humour that made it easy to talk to me. I dunno.

At the time I had this job (which I still have) but it was just temporary. Now, I’ve been told I’m a bid modest about it, but it’s another thing where people started looking up to me. It’s got about 30 guys give or take and I’m in line to be their foreman. At 23. I’ve given my all to this job and so much of my social ability has been lost to this job I genuinely don’t know where to turn. 

I write this at a point in my life where I have my girlfriend and my mom as friends. Everyone at my work is over the age of 40 and wouldn’t ever play some Overwatch with me or chill n smoke a joint or something and just have someone to speak to. Like the biggest age gap from me to the nearest of age co worker is 21 years.

This has been long winded, I’m aware, but if you’re ever feeling like having someone to play some Overwatch or anything really, PM me! if I’m gaming, it’s PS4!"

lonely,Lonely does not equal alone,"Lonely does not equal alone - To all my lonely warriors out there, lonely does not mean we're alone or that you  don't have friends. I have plenty of friends. Lonely does not mean you're a loser. Most of us have great jobs with promising careers. Lonely is so much more than ""just go out and meet people"". I have no problems striking up conversations. Lonely is not so easily defined nor cured. It's something else. It's something deeper. It's worst for me as I lay to sleep in the quiet. My loneliness becomes restlessness, anxiety, depression  and sadness.  One feeling becomes more. Each one more gut wrenching and desperate than the one before. Can't sleep comes to stay the night and suddenly loneliness is the kindest of them all. 500 FBI friends?  2k Instagram followers?, wtf use is ""snapshit"" anyway? I'm taking my nightly cocktail of pharmaceutical saviours with a swallow of red zinfandel and I will wakeup with the hope and eagerness of making a connection at work, the gas station, the traffic light....I wish you all luck in the same😔😬"

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."
lonely,Lonely as a teenager,"Lonely as a teenager - Hello. I am a 16 year old guy currently in High School. I am not hated and don’t feel all that self conscious too often. However, I have incredible difficulty making friends. I went into 6th grade and made a best friend which quickly evaporated because I was a jerk. I don’t know why I was, but I felt the need to pick at his insecurities. He trusted me enough to open up and I, for some reason, felt the need to put him down. ( Keep in mind he was the nicest, kindest, kid I’ve ever met; He would never hurt a soul). 

After this friendship evaporated, I knew I had messed up. The next 4 years I didn’t even try to make new friends. I was convinced I was an asshole and did not deserve anyone. I felt shame and guilt that was gut wrenching every time I thought about it and just could not pick myself up from it. Of course I apologized, and meant it more than you could know, but the friendship was far gone. 

High school came around and not much changed. I still felt the same guilt and shame. However, I always hid it and was relatively nice to people because I knew they deserved it. Eventually, mid 10th grade comes around and seemingly out of nowhere, I was in a big group of friends. 7-8 guys. They were AWESOME!!! We had a hilarious group chat and hung out literally every weekend. Life couldn’t be better. I became incredibly close with one of them and this continued for about 4 months.

Eventually I noticed the group “leader” would poke at my insecurities and make back handed compliments disguised as “jokes”. I soon realized that he was a narcissist. (Doesn’t feel empathy, needs to put others down to feel powerful, pretty much fucks with your head). I had to cut off the group and they all started questioning why and I could not tell them because i didn’t want to smear the narcissist’s name or “talk shit”. I was back to where I was for years... no friends... lonely.  That one person fucked all my other friendships and there is nothing I can do about it.

I wish, a girl or someone supportive could come around. I am an “empath” (if you don’t know what that is, maybe google a little. But essentially I feel a high degree of empathy to the point that it can be physically draining) I can give all my energy to make someone feel happier and I just want someone to do the same for me. 

The loneliness hurts so bad. I just want someone to hold me. It feels so empty... Anybody...

Sorry if that whole story is jumbled but I just wanted to get it out."

lonely,I haven’t felt happy in a long time,"I haven’t felt happy in a long time - Hi, this is my first post so please dont hate me 

It all started around 2017, I began talking to this girl and we hit it off surprisingly! We would usually just talk about random stuff or joke around in group chats, but late at night we would get into these really deep conversations and it was bliss. After some time we both realized that we had a crush on each other. This was probably the happiest I’ve ever been

Fast forward to 2018, we both liked each other but nothing really happened between us. Still our conversations were the same but with a little bit of flirting. The year was pretty uneventful though.

Now in 2019 we have stopped talking, around May her replies started getting shorter and her voice more monotone. I realized that I was always starting the conversations and she didn’t seem interested so I wanted to see what happened if I just didn’t start a conversation, and that was the end of it.

Ever since then I’ve just found everything dull and kinda boring, I really blame myself because if I would just have been better or kinder or just overall a better person she would not have stopped caring, after awhile I found out that she was talking to someone else the same way during all this time.

But on a happier note, for the first time in my life I have been invited to a party with my friends! I’m really hoping that things will only go upwards from here! 

Thank you all for reading to the end :)"
lonely,Its frustrating to not have a choice,"Its frustrating to not have a choice - I think it's a common theme in this sub that a lot of us given a social situation never feel like anyone's 1st choice whether platonic or romantic like never invited first or at all to things but still manage to be there feeling like we don't belong or aren't wanted. Ive never really come to terms with the idea of being alone forever but idk which is scarier being/dying alone or ending up with someone who doesn't really want me/we just dont want to be alone. I hate the idea of settling compromise is one thing but it sucks that we aren't able to choose our place in society, choose the people who'll care about us and where we fit in. This strange limbo of not being able to choose my own life path in terms of social existence pisses me off. Like i can choose my job, i can choose my education, i can choose what to eat for lunch and although nothing is guaranteed i can choose those decisions in my life to get to a perceived goal i KNOW that even though choosing to go to school to be a doctor or mechanic doesn't mean I'll get that job right away but i know I'm taking steps and working towards it. Ive done all the suggested actions and advice for gaining friends or a girlfriend or even just a reoccurring acquaintance that gives a crap about me as a person and I'm no more closer or sure of anything than i was 5 years ago. This sucks. Sorry for the rant the world just feels extra heavy today."

lonely,20 M Venting,"20 M Venting - This past holiday was amazing. Christmas party with family and friends was super fun, memories being created. Playing video games and socializing, playing with the young kids. One of the girls I think a couple years older than me even said I was cute which made me very happy. My point is is that the day after, I was super sad and depressed that the holiday fun is over. I have no way of finding out the girl's instagram, no contact of her at all. We all have that stupid voice speaking in our head saying ""it is weird to contact her out of the blue."" ""It is not a good idea."" This mindset doesn't help at all for someone who has never had a girlfriend. And since I am a member of this subreddit, of course I don't have the most extroverted life out there, in fact the opposite. I never kissed a girl, I am a virgin which I don't really care for. I usually stay home and play video games if I'm not feeling the urge to go outside with my friends. I have 3 guy friends that i text in group chats. Not very lonely. I guess my point is, is that it would be really nice to have a female friend to talk to and be with. I've realized that money doesn't buy happiness at all. Very TEMPORARY happiness and that true happiness is having fun with friends and family. After the girl said that I was cute, I just have the urge to converse with the opposite sex because it seems so fun (as long as they have the similarities and are interested) but it is extremely hard to find one if you are just home all day on your free time playing video games. I wish I knew a way to contact the girl but sadly I think it is too weird to go out of my way and other people's way to find like her instragram or her number."

lonely,A Fitting End to an Intrepid Group,"A Fitting End to an Intrepid Group - So I’ll give some context. I’ve got this group of friends all of us are in high school. 2 juniors, 8 seniors. It is a very very tightly knit group, or at least it was. The end started as soon as the group really began. 2 of the people were dating and they broke up creating very sensitive fault lines. Some of those cuts healed but left scars. Some time passed, 2 separate people in the group began dating then had a fairly ugly break up creating irreversible damage. They still aren’t talking.

What was once a proud group of ten has split into unsaid factions, none of which work together or against one another. Sounds alright on paper but outside if school there is little to no contact. Of course individuals stay in touch but it’s never really the same.

Cut to now, New Years. The end of the decade. It would have been great. No one planned anything, no one talked to anyone about anything. Nothing. Radio silence. And it’s only just now got me. This is the end. The seniors are off to college and the only other junior was the boy in the ugly breakup. I’m more friends with the girl by this point.

A slow suffocating death. That’s the end of our story. Have a happy new year folks. May it be better than mine."

Setting aside the mental health issues I have, I just seem to be lately how DF I got to this point, what when wrong and why do I continue to just be ""ok"" with things. Haven't dated in (oh fuck its been THAT long) 16 years and yes that includes fucking so I've evolved in to a perverted mess  that can't form any meaningful female friendships with out wondering how her shoes must smell, ect and try to keep the contact going solely to serve that end goal of finding out. Also since I have such low self worth opinion of myself I've allowed my teeth to look like a meth user when I haven't done any drugs and can't financially afford to fix them right (with implants) So I start to question why to I continue to exist, no one finds me attractive or at least enough to FWB or one nighter with me, so why keep on living then?"

I‘m in my early twenties strongly extroverted and i have different groups of friends and some really close ones with whom i talk about everything. So in general i guess most would say I‘m not a lonely person  but somehow i feel lonely all the time its just getting worse and worse with each day and i don’t know why. I‘ve talked to most of them about it but in general even though they try to help me i feel like its only getting worse! I crave closeness but somehow cannot accept it at all, in dating a destructive pattern always repeats. I meet women and start talking to them everything goes really good we exchange numbers maybe even go on a few dates and boom they either flake or ghost me out of no where. I honestly fell like someone (probably me) is running around and telling ever women i get interested in some lies about me that scare them of. But thats just dating i dont even want to try anymore really sometimes the loneliness  comes like a sledgehammer that hits me right in the chest all i want to do is cry but thats something i cant do somehow. When I‘m with friends even when we have fun i feel like im far away its just frustrating af and I hate every fucking second... im not really depressed but its overwhelming once again right now and i had to vent im probably going to delete this post right away so if anyone read this thanks for putting the effort into my life and i hope you at least have a pleasant day!"
lonely,"Meeting lots of people, but lonely","Meeting lots of people, but lonely - Three months ago, I moved to a new country to study my dream subject. Since then, I've met a lot of people at the university, some people in other places, but none of them actually became a part of my life. I also went on a lot of dates during the past two months with men I met online, but NONE of them actually stayed in touch with me, even tough some of them declared the desire to do so. I became closer with one of them, we were intimate. He ghosted me after telling me he wants to meet the next day. 

During Christmas, I realised that I feel incredibly lonely. It also became apparent to me that I spent all that time and energy on meeting all those people, but not a single one actually sent me Christmas or birthday wishes (my birthday is right before Christmas).

I'm starting to feel a bit invisible (must be all the ghosting?), disheartened and drained. At this point, it feels like I'm investing a lot (energy, time, effort), but don't really gain anything."

lonely,I feel replaceable,"I feel replaceable -     Everytime I try to arrange something with friends they push it off or don't reply. Yesterday for example, my friend said we should hang or or something, I said ""Sure, are you free today or tomorrow?"" And she said not today because she had to work on an essay, and maybe tomorrow. 

That's understandable (obvisouly), but when I talked to her yesterday we eventually got on the topic of work. I asked her how her essay was going, and she said she never even started it. I was like, alright everyone has their tough days and she said tomorrow, so maybe we'll hang out tomorrow. 

I never got a single text from her today, let alone a ""hey want to hang out"". When I was checking out friends' stories on snapchat I stumbled onto hers, and it was a picture of her and someone else having lunch. I know I might be overreacting, but it made me really sad. She says she wants to hang out (multiple times) and then completely igores me? Even when I'm talking to her in person she seems so bored, and she'll leave to talk to someone else mid-sentence, I feel so replaceable and overlooked. We've been friends for 10 years, and we've been very close up until now, it feels like my friendships are falling apart. Does she not want to hang out with me anymore? Like if she has moved on, then I can't control that and we can part out seperate ways, but she says she wants to be friends and then pushes me away at the same time, I'm so confused"
lonely,I think I fell in love with my best friend.,"I think I fell in love with my best friend. - I had a girlfriend last summer, genuinely thought she was the most amazing person and that I could not live without her. Then I met another girl around September, we were just friends, but I stopped feeling attracted to not just my (by this point) ex girlfriend, but all girls in general. So I went from looking at girl 1 and thinking I can't live without her to seeing girl 2 and not even finding girl 1 attractive anymore. Anyways, me and the new girl spoke alot, hangout alot, and the attention and understanding she gave me led me to start liking her. By this point, I didn't care about anyone but her. However, she likes a different boy and shows no signs of ever wanting to be more than friends. I have come to terms with this, but I worry I'll never find anyone better than her as I just don't think it's possible to top her. I'm a teenager, haven't gone to university, so I'm bound to meet hundreds of new girls. But will I get over this and find a true love? Or is this genuinely it? Have I jeopardized my future romantic relationships with this?"

I've just finished my first semester of university and I enjoy my subjects and are kinda making friends. 

This Christmas I posed on my Snapchat and Instagram stories to the few friends I have made, and I like the idea. It's a good way to keep in touch with people without directly having to text them. I view there stories and they view mine, and I can comment whenever I have something to say. That being said, I have a pretty uninteresting life, so I don't really know what to post. I take pictures of stuff when I go for walks, but I kinda stop myself from posting cause it feels weird. I'd also like to make more comments to friends when they post, I just sometimes get mixed signals like them not responding, but I'm probably overthinking. I'm not very outgoing and I don't really hang out with anyone because I don't really have any close friends yet. 

I'm just trying to keep the ones I have and progress those relationships so I can actually hang out with them in the future, and I'd like to do so by keeping in contact with them one way or another. Any advice?"

First time poster over here so apologies if I mess/miss something up. Over the past few years of my life, I [M26] have been coming across with this concept of value as in what is one’s personal value? Some folks in my line of work seem to measure it by success (money, professional accomplishments), number of friends, social media presence, and whatnot, but personally I’ve realized that all of these measurements can be circumstantial and transient. 

And while it has been easy to succumb to those metrics, I have always belief that there has to be something more and after enduring a few significant hits over the past few months, I have been trying to reflect to try to implement some changes and grow/improve as a person.. so.. I’m curious, in your experience, how do you find your value?"

lonely,Everything seems to be falling apart.,"Everything seems to be falling apart. - Hello everyone! Let me introduce myself, I am a 19 year old guy from india. This is my very first time writing somewhere about how I feel. Okay so I am a single guy and never have dated anyone till date. It's not that I have a fear of talking to girls or I am hideous or I am weird. I just find it difficult to get close to people.

Let's start from the beginning folks. I used to be a fat kid actually an obese one. I had a rough childhood and am a single child. My parents too are single children themselves so I have no close family as such. Growing up was pretty rough. My parents fight every single day, from dawn till dusk. I grew up in a very toxic environment. Me and my parents were living in a small house, we had a lot of money problems and I was also a reason for their fighting still, and I grew up feeling very very fucking lonely all the fucking time. I was picked up on by kids a lot since I was a single child no one had my back and my parents never backed me. I hated going out in my society but I went every single day no matter what the other kids did to me because that was the only socialization I had. I had good grades in school and passed my 10th class with 80%. But after that I fell into some bad company. I started smoking a lot of pot. Used to smoke all day everyday. Class 11th and 12th, all I did was smoke pot, I don't remember those two years of my life. The pot was like a medicine for me, it helped me forget everything around me, it made my sadness go away, I didn't care about anything/anyone. All I wanted to do was get high all day everyday. Soon people found out that I was a major pothead and stopped interacting with me, p.s. consumption of pot is considered as a taboo in india. I did okay in class 11 and 12 and got admission in a good college. But I couldn't make any friends in college and continued to hang out with my stoner buddies. I eventually flunked my first year of college and my parents found out about my habit. They were really very mad at me about it. They used to lock me in the house to stop me from getting high. It took about 6 months for me to get rid of my addiction. I have been clean for about 2 months now. I had lost tremendous amount of weight due to smoking pot but in the past 6 months I have gained around 30 pounds since I was locked up in my house. I am again very depressed because of the way I look, not obese but overweight. It's like I have replaced my pot with food. I have no friends, to hang out with because all my earlier friends were stoners and I don't want to hang out with them.

Around a year back, I was in an accident and have an ACL tear in my knee and cannot run/do exercise so I can't join any activities around town and spend my time and am stuck in the house.

Also 2 weeks back my grandma was detected with cancer. Which was also a shock for my family. Now my parents fight a lot more because of the money problems we are having. 

I can't type this shit anymore, I have a lot to express but have no fucking words for it. 

It's like I have this heartache. A feeling, of my heart sinking. I want to hug someone and cry so fucking bad. My loneliness is killing me.

Please suggest me a way to turn my life around."

Yes, college is different in the sense that you are not stuck for 6 hours in school, and that makes me feel like I can focus my time on other things. I have never been able to relax or what my parents call ""chill"". I was bullied a lot in high school for being the skinny stick boy. Even in college, I don't stick around for very long as I have work from 1-7 pm. I have exchanged numbers with my classmates, but only for notes.  I spend most of the time reading books and exercising. The only friend I have is Netflix. I tend to avoid romantic specific genres as it envokes a sense of hopelessness and depression. Love is not something that I am searching for as it is not meant for everyone. It's only classified for the ""social people"", the people that can somehow connect with others in this ""god-gifted ability"". All social people have been blessed by God and God loves them. It's like everyone hates negative people so the ones who are going through a difficult time just get put down in life. The ones who are positive show how they are able to connect with others, share ideas, get into relationships, and talk about how grateful they are. If a man like me who is struggling because of isolation and loneliness wants to voice out, society will be like ""Why are you so pessimistic?"". It's like the world only cares about extroverts. If you are an introvert you will be labeled as the ""wise guy"". The introvert is supposed to give the extrovert advice for nothing in return. Doesn't this make you sick? Like you almost metaphorically want to puke? Why doesn't anyone want to help each other? We are supposed to be a community. It's as if the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I always wanted to be socially accepted but as I got to my 20s, I just gave up and started living my life as a lonely isolated introvert. I feel like I live off the grid, even though I live in a city with 500,000 residents. The only time that I speaking is about work or through the drive-thru intercom. I see kids younger than me getting accepted into top Universities. I see kids who were once younger than me, becoming fully independent and really ""living life"". They go on trips with their friends and family. They post pictures on Facebook and Instagram about how much fun they are having. Many have a significant other and are rubbing it in my face like look how grateful we are. No s@#t Sherlock. If life were that easy I would have been just as grateful as you. Even in my family, you have a bunch of rich people who share their vacation photos and personal photos just to make it seem like they are living it. Sometimes I wonder if its all staged. How can people be so happy and blessed? What is wrong with me?"
lonely,I need some advice,"I need some advice - Some fact you should know beforehand:

1. I just started a new job and meet quite few new friends there. 
2. I am a lonely lesbian, basically like really easily attach lesbian.
3. Closeted lesbian, cant be a proud lesbian in public. Big no.

Okay the story is one of those new friends is from far away and have no one to spend time with and fequently told me that she doesnt have anyone, and invite me to spend time but I use excuse that she live quite far and we both cant drive. 

Usually I spend my time at home alone. But this new year I feel like I shouldnt be alone. It will feel suck. And I know she probably too. And I was thinking that I should ask her to spend time during the new year count down. 

The issues is

1. I dont know if thats okay, I not really good at spending time with people because people usually want to do lot of thing but I get socially exhausted pretty quick.
2. I not sure thats a good idea with mind that I might be attach to her. Which probably make it worst is that she is a touchy person. And yes I crave of it. And I am a lesbian. Not good.

So... Should I or shouldnt I."
lonely,27 male lost and alone,"27 male lost and alone - My girl left me 5 days ago, says she wants to explore with females. I told her I support  it, we can be friends, but she shut that down... well , today's my birthday,  and I'm alone...I guess I'm unatractive,  boring, and I turn woman away from hetero relationships.  Maybe I should explore with men....I'd give a buddy a blow job after hanging out all day drinking, play games and talking about stuff. That's what it's about anyway right? friendship, but what do I know, I have no friends!!!

lonely,I want to get rid of this feeling,"I want to get rid of this feeling - I'm 22 M computer engineer. One and a half years ago I lost my mother because of cancer. I don't have any brothers or sisters, I'm all alone. My father is a decent man but can't understand my problem, he always motivates me but something is missing in me. I have lots of friends but I can't share my feelings with anyone. I never had a girlfriend, but always scared of making relationships. Now I'm a graduate and responsibilities are coming over me. I'm feeling lonely in my friend circle. Sometimes I think I should go to a relationship but I don't go outside so, didn't make any. I tried my luck on tinder, but couldn't get any match.  It's not like I want a girlfriend because  I'm alone for a long.  This feeling is affecting my professional life.

lonely,Might just give up,"Might just give up - I don't feel as though I have any close friends to rely on, I haven't had any really friends for several years now. My only friends are online and in other timezones which makes things difficult but I don't feel like I'm really connecting. I don't feel as though I'm able to build real connections with any humans, like I lack a part of my brain.

I've also never had a boyfriend, and it seems like now gay people are dating much younger and it kinda just kills me seeing happy couples on Reddit (some of which are a lot younger) and knowing I'll never experience that kind of happiness because of my looks. I feel like there's point in looking anymore. Just lead a miserable lonely life forever?"

lonely,Hate making plans with people that don’t know the concept of time and communication,"Hate making plans with people that don’t know the concept of time and communication - I’ve been suffering with crippling depression over the past year. I’ve been trying to reach out to my friends lately, because I’ve been isolating myself from people. So we made plans to go out last night, I did a beautiful cut crease look and did my hair and got dressed up, took me 3 hrs. We were supposed to meet up at 11pm so we can all go in one car together, so at 10:45 I called one of my friends she was taking a nap, and said that maybe we should leave at around 12. Her brother will come and pick me up not sure what time. So now is 11:45 and I haven heard from anyone. So I texted them that am not going, I took my beautiful makeup off, and got into my PJs and went to sleep.  I hate when people  don’t respect my time, I was only making myself go because I wanted to socialize with them more not because I cared to go anywhere. Leaving my house after 12am with out my own way to get home when am ready to go is terrifying. I was hoping to be home by 2or 3am. it irritates to my core when am ready and I have to wait around for people. Guess am just meant to be alone"

lonely,Lonely with friends.,"Lonely with friends. - I have a wife. A few close friends. But I feel so far away from everyone. Everything. My friends live anywhere from 1 hr to 10 hrs away. We talk in person but rarely any other times. My work friends are non existent. I can’t be friends with people at work it feels. I’m not in a good position to do so. My parents and I are friends, but I feel they want a lot of things from me, like to move back home or whatever and I don’t need that. I feel they’ve become a bad influence on me. So I distanced myself. I have trouble with my wife. I’ve caused all of it... sometimes I feel she is with me so I won’t go downhill and kill myself. I open up to her. And yet I still feel far away almost right after. Honestly my closest friend besides my wife at times is my therapist. And that’s kinda his job is to be there for me. I feel alone and misunderstood. 
I hate my job. Sometimes my family and wife. Just my life and the place I’m in. I resent a lot of things. I think that’s why I’m alone but not. I’m just so frustrated. Fuck."
lonely,"I want love, but I'm not made for it","I want love, but I'm not made for it - I'm no good at starting posts, but this is my attempt to let out a few feelings in regards of my loneliness - I hope this is not misplaced here.

So, after listening to my friend gushing about his crush for about an hour earlier today I feel a little,,,drained. Not only because him telling me who he has a crush on made me realize that I might've caught a few feelings for him. (I had no idea. But my heart kinda went /crack/. Just the slightest bit.) But I'm used to it. And I'm not mad about it either, because he deserves to be with someone as great as his crush! I just want my friend to be happy, after all!

But with everyone around me getting into relationships and falling in love I just feel more and more lonely.

I know that it's alright to not have a relationship, and that you don't need a relationship bla bla bla but I really want someone to trust and confide in on a much deeper emotional level than just friendship.

Because I do have a few great friends that I love from the bottom of my heart! It's not like I'm completely left alone.

But I just want someone who I can be entirely and unapologetically myself around. Someone I can talk to without judgement and without having to mask all my pain with jokes.

I want something intimate and soft. Someone who looks out for me and checks up on me - people are so used to my resting sad face since I've had depression for year so they just don't seem to notice anymore. 

I want mutual trust and understanding, cuddling and falling asleep in the arms of someone who I know wants to be with me. 

But I'm scared of opening up and being vulnerable - along with the fact that I have no idea how to meet new people. Well, I know a few ways but I'm very socially anxious and generally introverted and meeting new people drains all my energy. It's so exhausting. 

I'm also scared of getting hurt. But isn't everyone a little?

All I remember about my first 'relationship' (it was a long distance online thing, a lot of people don't think it counts. I don't even know if I do.) Is the feeling of falling out of love.
Else there's just been rejection.
And seeing crushes getting together with other people. 

I don't know where I'm getting with this. I'm 16, I shouldn't complain. Life's still ahead of me and I'll find someone eventually but that's no comfort. 

Right now the 'you'll find someone at some point' doesn't really help me either though.

I also feel bad for the people I've rejected - most of which were girls because I'm just not into girls (so I shouldn't feel bad for not wanting to be with them since I'm gay) and if there's ever a guy that likes me they're just not my type or generally unpleasant to talk to (or they get weird about it once they find out I'm ftm, and I don't need that shit)

My loneliness is my own fault. I'm probably just too picky. Too scared. Too lazy. 

Just needed to get that off my chest. Gotta admit, feel a little better already just cause I wrote it down."
lonely,18,"18 - I think I’m really close to the point where my heart is just out of love. I shared this earlier.. I’ve just been going through a lot of rejections, and it just objectively adds to the argument that I’m just an ugly prick, who’ll never have anyone. As a kid I believed in true love, well that sentiment has been abused repeatedly. But anyway, I shared this earlier, what do you do when your heart just run out of love to give? When you get nothing in return.. When you’re in a dry dry desert with no water of love.. I already tried offing myself, that was a bad idea, I just didn’t have the nerve to really do it. Don’t think I ever will, and then I think, am I in hell? I want to die but I can’t; I want to love, but no one ever will love me. I am in pain and I am all out of my Vicodin."
lonely,You can't save a damsel if she loves her distress.,"You can't save a damsel if she loves her distress. - I don't know why but I feel like I am at my best when my heart is in pain, maybe because it's the one that keeps me stronger and stronger each day. I used to hate the idea of being broken but now, I am starting to love it. It's the reason why I keep on fighting, it's the reason why I keep on living, it's the reason why I'm doing everything I can do. Some people may hate the idea of being broken or living in misery but I'm not. I learned to accept the brokenness within me because it's part of who I am now. I used to drown in my own misery before but now, I learned how to swim and I also discover the deepest parts of it which makes me love it more, it's the reason why I'm still alive."
lonely,it would be so nice to love and be loved,"it would be so nice to love and be loved - i can’t say for certain though. i don’t know if love exists. all the love i’ve experienced has been from people who abuse me. is that still love? i have no reason to believe there’s anything out there for me but pain, yet i still crave intimacy human connection. i think that might make me insane. why do i crave love? maybe love did exist at one point but we killed it."
lonely,I don't feel festivity anymore,"I don't feel festivity anymore - I'm not numb I do have emotions.

But I still was a hype kid keyword kid so I don't know I just don't feel anything when it comes to any holiday's or anniversary's (except of SO anniversary's but we stopped with that, or I did? )
Just another day and whenever it's someone's anniversary I try and pretend like it's a big deal, It doesn't matter its just another day and then another day and so on. Its my defence mechanism to not get excited about stuff and block them off I don't like being disappointed anymore but I cannot not be excited about stuff it's not how you live life aperently.
But I don't know about life I have none of that just a thing I heard"

lonely,Holiday gifts,"Holiday gifts - I made &amp; been holding gifts for close friends or at least I thought so.  People I grew up through middle, high school. College now it’s different. Sometimes I feel like I’m growing, intellectually and mentally, while my friends aren’t. Sometimes it also feels vice versa but idk. I think I’m going to have someone drop off these gifts as winter intersession approaches in a week. I think I feel better being alone rather than feel unwanted. I’m honestly happy that school is starting because this is the most depressing winter break I ever had. None of my friends know how I feel deep down &amp; they will never will because I will never express this feeling. I made these gifts because I thought some of us were going to hang and finally catch up, laugh. However, I see every single one of them hanging out but without me. School will occupy my mind. I miss my friends, I miss having fun and going out."

Im so desperately wanting to find somebody I can love and cherish, but Everytime I do, I end up being left more heartbroken than I already was"
lonely,Where Do I Start,"Where Do I Start - I'll try to keep this short, though I know it wont be. Throwaway / new account because reasons.

Rewind to 6 months ago. I met this girl, quiet and introverted and she loves gaming almost as much as me. For all its worth, she's me as the opposite sex. We game together almost every day and talk to each other every day, about all kinds of stuff. She'd had a couple of shitty relationships, as have I, and it made us closer. We could talk to each other about everything and anything. In no time at all, I had a new best friend. Hell, I even developed feelings for her... and that's where I fucked myself up. I thought it was mutual.

So we're both excited for Christmas for the first time in a couple of years. A few days ago we were chatting nonsense over messenger after a day of gaming. She tells me she's playing truth or dare with her friends and she admitted her crush to them. I stupidly thought she meant me, admitted I liked her and she tells me it's someone else and she had no idea I liked her that way.

So I had another shitty Christmas again this year. Drank myself stupid the last few days and don't know what to do with myself. We're still friends, but I'm absolutely devastated. I know it's my own fault for building my hopes up. I just don't know if my quiet, introverted ass will ever find someone like her again."
lonely,I started out lonely; now I'm something worse.,"I started out lonely; now I'm something worse. - There was a long time I felt terribly lonely where I wanted friends, a romantic relationship, etc.  But after feeling that way for so long I now feel just numb to it all.  I don't actively long for these things or anything.  I feel like I died at some point and am living as a ghost or a hollowed out shell.  I can't imagine having people in my life anymore.  I can't imagine a woman ever liking me because I'm too ugly, too much of a failure, and have no redeeming qualities or interests.  The light has gone out in my life and I'm not sure how to be myself again.  I don't know if I'll ever snap out of this as I've been this way for nearly a year at this point.  Does anyone have advice for getting out of the state I'm in?  I'm trying to get therapy but there just isn't any available, and the 3 or 4 therapists I've tried don't seem to know what they're doing.  I'm still trying to find therapy but at the moment, that won't help.  I work a 4 on 2 off swing shift schedule that makes it impossible to join groups, and I've tried meetups for the last 8 months with no luck.  I guess what I'm hoping someone here will help me with is a perspective or little things I can do to be a person again.  Thanks for reading this."

lonely,I just want the truth,"I just want the truth - 12 am Pacific time and something is on my mind and I can't sleep. I just want to know once and for all if I am good looking enough for a girlfriend. I've never had a girlfriend but I'm not sure if it's because of my appearance or terrible social skills. To put it briefly, at 12 am, i made a list of 4 females to contact and ask for an honest rating. Why? Because i don't have anyone to talk to. I desperately want to change my looks and improve myself  but, I will be heartbroken to find out it was all for nothing. I almost messaged them but decided to wait until Sunday mid day. Should I do it? No doubt that is a very unconfident thing to do but none of the girls I'm messaging is my crush so if they say I'm a 5 to 7, for me, that's lifefuel."
lonely,Anyone else feel like they can’t trust anyone and that’s why they don’t have friends?,"Anyone else feel like they can’t trust anyone and that’s why they don’t have friends? - Idk maybe this is the reason, but I just thought about it, everyone I have ever met are just acquaintances to me like I don’t really have any close friends. Maybe I’m just to picky for friends. Just was looking at peoples Snapchat stories and realized that each of them could potentially be my friend but I just didn’t play things right when I met them. Like I don’t think I would ever be friends with them now but if I had just been more friendly back then and opened up more maybe we would have been better friends and I wouldn’t just be looking through their stories."

lonely,I don’t want to change myself just so someone will like me,"I don’t want to change myself just so someone will like me - I know I’m too quiet and introverted, and if I was more bubbly and outgoing maybe a guy would like me. But I don’t want to pretend to be someone I’m not. I’ve tried it and it’s exhausting. I know staying like this is going to make it harder for me to find a partner, but I rather be alone than pretend to be someone I’m not. I have family and friends who accept me, so there might be a small chance there’s a guy out there who will love me for who I am.

I don't even have any social medias. I have a mediocre job at target, no higher education, and I feel like my dreams (songwriter) and hobbies (going to the movies ALONE, watching youtube videos, watching netflix) are pathetic. I still live with my mom and I can't see any way to make progress in life. I feel lost and I don't even know what I want or expect from posting here. I feel like I don't have anything to offer in a hypothetical relationship. and I also have a weird fear of being seen on dating apps by people I used to know.

lonely,Feel like I don’t exist,"Feel like I don’t exist - 22 Male from New York. I just finished college and let me tell you, I didn’t make one friend that I consider a close one. I would walk the halls alone everyday praying someone would just even glance at me or want to talk to me. It made me feel even more like crap. I would sit in my dorm all day and sometimes not even leave the whole day. All a downward spiral. 

I have problems being alone. Always have. I’ve had very bad luck with previous “flings” if you want to call them that, or possible Girlfriends but, always got screwed over. One girl was flirting with me and using me to get to one of my good friends, they ended up hooking up. Another girl flirting with me and leading me on, and openly admitted to it to my face she only used me because her and the boyfriend broke up. Basically a rebound. Met another girl and we got along really well, but it was too much toxicity. Had to break it off this past summer. Couldn’t take the way she made me feel anymore, which was inadequate and always just played games with my head. 

I feel like I am constantly yearning for that relationship where I feel like the person is down for me and just me, someone that makes me feel appreciated, because of the past things that have happened to me. How much I would like to share my love with someone else and just feel that pure happiness that I look around and see others have. Someone I can just hug and look into their eyes, tell them they’re beautiful, make them smile, laugh, or even just be around. I’ve seen boyfriends get so mad when their girlfriends try and hug them constantly or playfully “annoy them” and Im here wishing I could even just get a glance or a hug from someone. 

I feel lonely everyday - that I will never find someone. I’m afraid I’ll be alone forever, which I feel at 22 isn’t a good thought to have. 

Sorry if this all sounds so blah, and so me me me, but it felt good to write it out and get it off my chest. And maybe, other people feel the same way. 
I hope everyone has a good day or night wherever you are reading this, and a Happy and healthy New Year.

Im a highly regarded member of my work community on an international level, people tell me on a regular basis that im living the dream... yet I have never been so alone in my life. Nothing feels right. I never felt at home, i traveled the world looking for that place but never found it, there is always something that feel wrong. Everywhere I go, even when Im standing in front of one of the wonder of the world, I just feel empty. Reality seems like one long ride that doesn't quite make sense, that feeling of a glitch, that feeling that we are bound by something that is clouding everyone. Found the woman of my dreams, married her and it all went to shit because at the end of the day I still had that emptiness inside of me. Nor money, career or personal interaction ever seem to full-fill anything. I felt like this since I was 12 but now that Im 30 and accomplished everything ive been told would make me happy... I dont understand why I cant ever shake that feeling. Why Im always alone in the crowd, why I cant make meaningful connections, why there is always an impending feeling of something being off, why i cant ever seem to live up to any expectation i had.   
I've been waiting all my life for something greater i think, what exactly I'm not sure. Something doesn't add up. Why do I have everything to be happy but all I want to do is leave, move on to the next area where Ill live for a year or two and move on again ? Why do I always want to leave? Why do I always feel empty ? What am I missing ?"

I have a bunch of acquatances, as I’m not antisocial or have social anxiety or anything. I talk to people who sit next to me and stuff. 

I kinda made a couple people who are sorta more than acquatances. One of them a guy I sat next to, whom I shared a bunch of interests and studied for exams with. We’ve kinda lost contact with each other after the semester though.

Another is a girl who sat next to me in history class whom I also shared a lot of interests with but I kinda screwed that up when I tried to date her, as it was the only way I really know how to progess relationships. We did get along well though, and shes pretty shy herself, though has a few close friends. Afterwards we agreed to be friends, and I believed her when she said that. We are friends on snapchat and we read each others stories (I recently started trying to use social media to try keep in touch with people without directly texting them), however she gives a lot of mixed signals like sometimes just not replying to my texts so I dunno if that will ever work out in terms of being friends. We both like the Lord of the Rings, and I honestly just wanted to watch that with her, (in a platonic matter) but something so simple seems so distant and difficult. I’d like to text her more often as I often have comments to make or things to say but I don’t because I’m not sure if I’m just being annoying. I honestly can’t tell if she actually does not like me, or i’m just overthinking. 

I guess I have to try again because I’ve been told friendship is a numbers game. I’m seeing counselling now but my first session seemed very unhelpful and like we did not really understand each other. Even if that does help I’m not sure what to do in the mean time. Constantly putting in so much effort into relationships after finally meeting someone I connect with (which is rare in itself) is so tiring. I cannot keep doing this if I get the same results every time. Relationships apparently take time to build, but I have not had one last longer than a year since primary school. What should I do? Where do I meet people? My counsellor tells me to diversify and look for friends outside of school but I honestly don’t know where? I have hobbies but none of them really get me out to meet people, and I don’t really know of any social hobbies I’d be interested in. I feel like I even struggle to relate to other lonely people, because it seems they are usually do socially anxious or depressed to  go out and meet people. I want to do that but I don’t know where or how."
lonely,"19F looking for new friends in Tampa, USF area (PM open to non-local friends too)","19F looking for new friends in Tampa, USF area (PM open to non-local friends too) - Recently I realized how lonely I am and I’m looking for some new buddies. I’ll be back in Tampa in a couple weeks and live on campus at USF. 
Hobbies are... smoking, studying, gaming, music jamming, eating, cooking, gym-ing (kinda lol), wandering, and whatever else. I’m pretty laid back, but it really makes me happy when I can laugh and goof around with a friend. Not big on parties but kicking back with a few friends never hurt anybody. I like one-on-one but it’s nice to have a clique or a “squad” haha. 
I’ll admit, I’ve got a bit of emotional baggage but that’s what counseling is for lol. But still, looking for someone who’s open minded about mental health, because sometimes I’m up and down and I don’t want to push anyone away if I need some time alone or I seem a bit down or out of it. 
PM if you’re in the area, or not! Online friends are always nice to talk to."
lonely,20M Started working in the city around 2 years ago now and everything’s kinda catching up on me,"20M Started working in the city around 2 years ago now and everything’s kinda catching up on me - Apologies if this is really long and shitty, I never really post anything online and I saw this subreddit and found it a good place to maybe jot some words down and get my head straight. 

I recently left school after I finished my exams and got a placement at an advertising agency in the city about 2 years ago now. The job has been great and I’ve really been enjoying it, it’s taken me out of my comfort zone because the industry is extremely social and a lot of it is about having connections and knowing certain people, so I’ve been trying as much as I can to make friends with people a lot older than me, exerting a lot of my effort on trying to please and not only be good at my job, but come across somewhat entertaining too, which I’ll admit has been quite a struggle as I’m massively introverted and prefer my own company 9 times out of 10. 

When I finished school I came out of a really toxic relationship with a girl that broke me down a lot and I’ve had to build myself all the way back up, so had this to deal with my whole first year at work which wasn’t ideal, but that’s another story. 

I’ve been trying to go to the gym to get myself in decent shape around 3 times a week and become more comfortable with myself, but all of this + work is really catching up on me. 

There’s no one really in my age bracket at work for me to talk to/relate with and I only see my closest friends during the holidays, and even then we don’t do that much because they don’t have jobs and are studying at university. The last two years of my life have been work, gym, home, dinner, sleep and if I’m honest it’s totally draining all the life out of me. I haven’t felt any form of affection in any of that time bar a fling with a girl at work that happened for around a week. I just don’t back myself as much of an exciting person, I go to gigs and comedy shows and would say I have a lot of (cool? dare I say) interests but again these are normally always alone. 

I’ve tried dating apps and probably spoken to around 5-6 girls in the last three months, instigating some good conversation but none of it really leads anywhere, and it regularly just fills me with more self-doubt and a spiral of self-deprecation. I feel like the last two years of my life has just been me slaving away and telling myself that something exciting is only around the corner, for it to never happen and for me to build up this sense of false gratification, if that makes sense?

Im just fed up of feeling like this all the time and just massively craving a bit of affection, which feels a bit strange to type. 

If anyone has any tips or anything of things to get stuck into/involved in that could take my mind away from feeling like this most of the time that would be absolutely fab, but this mainly is just a vent to sort my head out a bit. Ta x"

I send a single text and if you don't respond  I couldn't care less. If I want to go to a bar, go to a museum, or anywhere I don't give a fuck I'll go by myself and have a good time. You can't control the people around you and the number of ""friends"" you have, but you can control how you feel about it. If you don't have anyone, why not just learn to have fun by yourself?"

so there’s this cute girl that started showing up at my work a few months ago and we talked a few times before i asked her out. i was surprised she was single let alone said yes when i asked. we were hitting it off real well over text but at some point i could tell she was backing off. eventually she said she’d prefer if we stayed friends before we even went out on a date. the hard part is now we still have to see each other and be friendly but for a minute there i thought i had escaped loneliness before it all came crashing down.

I should feel released but.. I just feel empty, sad and alone. Like I was all my life before I met her.. 

I am not a big family guy, dont have many friends too(and they dont live in the same city anymore), so must of the time, well.. im alone and lost.. 

My Life is a joke.. no job (cant find one, even after I finished my university), got bullied a lot, no hobbies or passions. Life is tasteless.
I hate myself and do social anxiety , and  I just dont see myself finding someone who will love me again .. 

Maybe I should’nt have left.. It may have been a mistake to leave her.

lonely,My dad told me he would always choose work over family,"My dad told me he would always choose work over family - I (F23) don’t have close relationship with my dad and haven’t really ever. He divorced my mom when I was around 4 (he cheated on my mom) and he moved to a different state for work. I would occasionally see him during the summer as a kid until I hit high school then I didn’t want to leave my friends for the summer. I’m not close with my mother either. She is very emotional unavailable and is very critical of everything I do. She has her own issues for sure but we just never developed a close relationship either. Anyways, so don’t really have a relationship with my dad and within the last 8 years I’ve seen him twice. Once at my high school graduation and once at my college graduation. We rarely ever talk on the phone either. However, the last time I saw him I wrote him a letter saying how I wanted a relationship with him and I wanted to start calling more and seeing him more. 

He flew me out a few days ago and I am currently visiting him. It’s strange, it’s almost like being around a stranger. It’s like he knows a completely different version of me. Well tonight we had a couple drinks in us and we were talking about things and he admitted to choosing work over family. He says that he would always choose work over family and he doesn’t know why but that is how it is. It was so hard to not want to tear up or say something because my whole life I grew up thinking that my own father didn’t want me in his life and he confirmed that. I tried to soften it up by asking if he just had a hard time balancing things in life (I know I do sometimes) and he said no that it was just him being selfish and choosing that because that is where he wanted to spend his energy. He continued to say he could have tried to be a better father but that he didn’t want to. 

My whole life I literally have always wondered why he never wanted me in his life. I questioned my worth and I just didn’t understand why he didn’t want me in his life. I feel numb. It really makes me think I will never find someone that will truly love me and choose me since my own father didn’t even want that."

I’m on winter break as the fall semester just ended and things haven’t been so well.
I’ve just gotten lonelier.
It’s too much to explain here and I’ve been told by people I’m very “chill”. A lot of people think I smoke because I’m so “chill” but I’ve never smoked or drank or anything. But the people who “know” me say I’m annoying and “edgy” and needy.
I just feel like I suck and I’ve lost all my friends and never even really had friends in high school.

All I know is that I’m struggling every day just to exist. I’ve been carrying the weight of too much on my own. I need more support and have no idea where to get it. I’ve looked in a lot of places. 

I don’t have any friends IRL aside from my boyfriend, and my immediate family. I am close with my parents and brother but they are 3,000+ miles away. It’s hard for me to get out much due to chronic illness. I don’t have any friends online either or chat with anyone. That is partially my fault. I find it draining to go through the same “get to know you” cycle of small talk over and over. Not to mention trust issues about sharing my life with a stranger (who I can’t even see) and getting close to someone as a friend.

I find myself wishing I already had a best friend that knows me well who I can trust. I like being there for my friends just as they are there for me, IF they are there for me. I know it’s takes effort to build a strong friendship and I am willing. I just need the right other person. Anyway, I just wanted to get my thoughts out and hope to feel a little less lonely tonight.

lonely,Pros and Cons of my 2020 resolution plan,"Pros and Cons of my 2020 resolution plan - I don’t know where to post this and how to say this without it being meaningless, but I been considering how to kill myself with a foolproof plan since September.
I tried to weight my pros and cons of doing so many (feel free to add anything to the list), while fully knowing that I have every right to take my own life. 
So I’ll start with the pros:
1- I wouldn’t have to exist anymore in the Middle East.
2- the pressure of being a woman and filling a certain role would be over.
3- it would be painless because of using sleeping pills.
4- it would be blamed on my family
5- it will appear on the news
6- I’ll tape my suicide note on my stomach under my shirt, so they can’t get rid of it and I’ll be extra careful by putting one somewhere in the suicide scene and on my computer.

The cons:
1- the ideology would blame me for being a faithless individual
2- everyone will excuse my family unjust behavior of me because of my gender
3- the media will probably focus on how it wasn’t society’s fault for my actions “because not everyone is like that”"

I've never even been in a relationship or anything close to it, maybe that's strange to mention but I've gotten some weird reactions when some people learned that about me, so I thought I'd just get that out of the way :)

So I'll just list some stuff about me and then you can decide if you want to message me or not.

I'm a pretty shy and quiet person, the whole social anxiety stuff means that I don't have the greatest social skills, but I try. The only people I really talk to are my parents, so I do have at least that but I do feel pretty lonely and I don't show them that side of me.

Things I like:

Animals, I feel like they're my only friends even if they ignore me.

Cooking and baking, I'm not Great at either one of them but it's fun.

Tech and PC stuff, I don't know much but I like messing around with things.

Gaming, recently picked up NFS Heat, I really like it but I'm usually more into RPGs.

Fizzles out or moved on from very quickly. Maybe I’m just not interesting but I’m very different from them. Going to events that aren’t like youth group focused, like dancing or dinner. I’m very good with. As I grew up I learned that it didn’t matter but I’m kinda stuck in this conference because I paid and there isn’t a refund policy. Since I’m stuck I kinda just wander around the hotel this is happening at. Went to Starbucks because I needed to get away for a bit. And now I find myself in the lobby watching a college football game that I don’t care about. It kinda sucks because eventually they’ll find out I’m in the lobby and then judge me for being here for the last 2 hours. The first event doesn’t start till 7. It’s currently 5.

I'm back home from seeing *The Rise of Skywalker* (in Dolby, **ooooo my goooooooodness**). Went with my dad, who did say he enjoyed it, but he fell asleep for parts of it and we don't exactly talk with ease about a lot of stuff. It was a silent ride home. There's just so much there that I enjoyed. I felt like my heart was going to explode out of my chest through so many moments; now, that excitement is all still there, but I don't have anyone to share that excitement with. 

It's like this all the time with anything I discover, want to do, do actually do, etc. There's just nobody there. I don't have anyone to discuss books with, or these movies, or new adventures. For instance, I'd love to go to Galaxy's Edge someday, but I'm almost certain it will be on my own or something. I just don't click very well with people, or trust, I suppose. That inhibits me a lot from forming new relationships. Burned too many times in the past. Stutter and tumble when anyone does seem to actually want to talk or share company with me. It's just isolating. With the new year coming up and my birthday, I just don't have any plans. I'll work, maybe catch dinner with my mom and/or dad. I'm very grateful for them and the company I get to share with my parents, too. But still, you know? I don't have anyone I trust to talk to or feel comfortable enough to nerd out with over these exhilarating pieces of pop culture, and that excitement just fizzles into something along the lines of... bitterness? Sadness? Not sure. 

I've always been a pretty lonely kid, despite a few good (but ended) friendships there. Being in my 20s now, it just feels so isolating. I look at my calendar, and besides a few appointments, there's not much there. I don't need to be constantly, exhaustingly busy with people (I do like my time alone and space to breathe), but lunch with a good friend or two, meeting up at a bookstore, catching a movie, hell, just hanging out. I forget what that's like. 

Sorry, just adding my little ramble. Sending y'all virtual support. Thank you very much if you took the time to read my jumbled thoughts."

Im a 23F, that dont know where i am going in life.
I recently discovered that my little stepbrother of 18yro is more avanced in his life than me....
He even got to go in Japan( my last dream)...
Here i am alone for the holiday and for my brithday, still not able to finish high school and still got no job. Yes, i am trying to be positive all the time... but i feel sooo useless all the time, i even gain weight, so nobody will ever want a girlfriend that weigh 200lbs no?
Anyways,have a good night!"
lonely,Vacation,"Vacation - I’ve been on break for about a week now and have spent it in my room the entire time. I’ve tried making plans with people but everyone is busy hanging out with other friends and ofc their family which I can’t judge. It just sucks, I was so ready for break I thought it was gonna be fun but it isn’t. And I’ve been trying to hang out with one of my friends that went to college but she’s not putting any effort into hanging out which is funny since she had called me out saying I don’t but effort into hanging out idk. I just wish I had someone to spend time with and do fun things with."
lonely,"I feel like my life is entirely online, with no friends IRL. So lonely.","I feel like my life is entirely online, with no friends IRL. So lonely. - So, I'm 26 years old, I have a decent paying job, but it's all online as I freelance. I live with my parents, and help them out around the house. I'm at home most the time than anything, though I take walks around the neighborhood when I get sick of being by myself.

As a result, a lot of my friends and people who talk or text with me are people that I've met online. I met them on social media like Tumblr. In fact, most of them are all girls. I even spent over $1.5K and took a vacation to the other side of the country this summer to meet one of these girls who I consider my best friend. She knows everything about me and vice versa, but we never met face to face until I went to visit her. I think I did it because I was feeling lonely and when I came back to my side of the country I felt even more lonely because I realized that I'll probably never meet anyone like her where I live. 

Anyway, I used to have lots of IRL friends, but most of them have become too busy and have forgotten me. Every one of them has also become more successful than me. They don't answer my texts or even bother to meet me up anymore. In fact, the guy who I considered my best friend in High School posts about meeting up other people, but doesn't even answer me when I ask if he wants to hangout. 

Also, most of my friends are teachers, engineers, etc. Even my cousins who I was one close to are more successful than me. They have more money, better jobs than I do. They're always boasting in front of my parents when I visit them, and I feel so stupid and lonely. 

Other people I know have their own lives and girlfriends or even married. And, yet, here I am, as a struggling writer, still living with my parents, with no IRL friends anymore.

I'm going to end up dying of depression or something. Because with all my IRL friends ignoring me, don't know where I'll make new ones."

lonely,It does get better,"It does get better - I’m not sure if it’s okay to publish this in this subreddit, so delete if not!

I (29m) have been lonely for as long as I can remember, I have not really fitted in anywhere and always felt like an outsider.
I have never had a meaningful relationship with anyone but that has all changed, two months ago I signed up to some dating apps hoping to find someone, I meet someone  and we’ve been talking for couple a weeks and today we went on our first date and It could not have gone better, we just clicked instantly and felt so comfortable around each other.
Originally we just decided to go and get some coffee but we ended up spending the day together and I couldn’t be happier and we are going to see each other again soon!

So I want to say to everyone in this subreddit, I know how all of you feel and it will get better, Loneliness just doesn’t go away but it just takes time and a little effort! So stick at it and keep fighting!"

lonely,Do you ever feel like you don't exist?,"Do you ever feel like you don't exist? - I don't know, i just feel really shitty right now. The last friend i had replaced me with someone else and it fucking hurt a lot. I guess it's getting to me now because i feel a lot of pain in my chest. 

I wish i had someone who considered me their #1 option ya know? Like everyone i've ever known always had better friends and only spoke to me when i spoke to them first. Only did stuff with me when i asked them to (and even then it was only like one out of 50 times, the stars had to align and all their better friends had to be offline or busy).

Maybe i'm asking for too much but idk, i'm a loner right now, i mean i've talked to a few people these past few days but those were casual conversations pretty much. 

I don't really want a casual ""let's chat every few days"" friend, i want a long-term friendship, someone i could call my best friend eventually (ik i have to develop a friendship first, i'm not expecting to be best friends right off the bat). I have a lot on my mind right now and i need to vent to someone, but nobody really cares or wants to listen. 

I'm not always like this, i just feel really shit right now. And if nobody knows how i feel, do i really exist? The mirror on the wall is the only proof i have that i exist.

Everyday i do the same thing and i can't tell anybody that i feel sick of my life because they'll just say the same generic lines ""oh others have it worse"" ""it's all in your head' etc. 

Anyway, sorry for making this so long. If you actually read through it then you're a genuinely nice person and i wish only the best for you. At least you listened and that's more than most people in my life have done for me. TBH i'm expecting nobody to read this anyway, it will probably be stuck in limbo.

Married, kids, the whole thing. So last night I was like I'm going to go out to a gay bar, my goal was to just talk to people. I am an introvert and extremely shy. But I did it! When I pulled up to the bar I felt super shy and uncomfortable. But when you move outside your comfort zone, you are bound to feel that way. So I faced my fear and walked inside. Got a drink and ended up chatting with these two guys sitting at the bar. Super kind and sweet. One is even going through the EXACT same situation as me but was with his partner for 10yrs! Needless to say I made two friends. And I feel great about myself for going out. Not saying you have to go to a bar, but you need to get out of your comfort zone! You will feel great about yourself for doing it! Because you faced a fear and conquered it!"

I would love to make everlasting friendships firs. And maybe even a relationship if it comes to that. I don't care how far away you are. A true connection survives all borders.

Something about myself:

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

My passion is cooking. And besides that I love to read, having conversations, grabbing coffee on a rainy Sunday, watching sports and play some games on my ps4.

lonely,The World Is Taunting Me,"The World Is Taunting Me - It hurts so much seeing everybody tell a awesome stories about adventures they want on with friends and the like. People talking about getting invited to bowling and sleepovers or any other activities involving friends. But I’ve never had that. I’ve never been close with anyone irl. Nobody has ever cared about me, nobody has ever enjoyed me enough to invite me somewhere. I feel like this world is torturing me by showing me what I can’t have. It especially sucks because I’m actually really sociable but people at my school are incredibly bigoted and mean and overall just horrible people. I don’t think there’s been a day where somebody hasn’t been called a f*ggot or a n*gger here. It’s even worse because they make up like 99% of the place. So there’s really nobody to talk to. And like I said, it’s tenfold painful seeing my online acquaintances talk about how they’re gonna hang out with friends and the like, because then I like at myself and I realize that I have nothing and nobody.  Not to mention I don’t want to grow up with nothing meaningful to look back on. I want to be able to have stories to tell about my friends, I want moments I can look back at and laugh about with them, I just want this part of life to mean something when I look back on it. But no, nothing good ever happens to me. I wish this world could just kill me off. I feel like a dying prisoner being kept alive only so he can be tortured. I feel like a dying horse getting beat with a bat. I just wish there was someone. Someone to numb the pain that I have to go through everyday just for being alive."

I have a quick tip for all my fellow friends out there! if you’re like me, it always helps me fall asleep faster, or feel a bit more safe and comforted at night when there’s someones presence 

and the reason we’re all on reddit instead of sleeping, is that we obviously, don’t have that luxury

it may sound quite strange, or even desperate to some, which is okay, feel free just to read and not do, but if you’re interested- sometimes during rougher nights, id search up on youtube, “soft breathing sleep” videos which is usually just a long video of someone softly breathing, occasional blanket noises, etc, and id have a comfy pillow to cuddle and hug in bed while listening to the audio with my phone turned away- it might sound super weird and desperate, but it really does soothe me and make me feel safe on nights where I feel unusually more sad and lonely. it really does make it feel like im falling asleep next to someone :’)

if anyone decides to try this out, do let me know how it goes in the comments, best of luck, my fellow lonely friends :)"
lonely,No friends.,"No friends. - I'm a 27 yo male from the UK... I've tried making mates to play xbox with (red dead redemption, dead by daylight etc) and sure I've had people add me but no one will actually play anything. I've tried making friends irl as well to the same effect. I do have 1 friend who I see once or twice a year and have a FWB but aside from the sex he doesn't really care to much to chat or hang out... Just want to have a connection with someone, doesn't have to be romantic just someone I can mess around and have fun with... I really enjoy being silly when I play online games so if we do that then be willing to accept a crazy personality, I literally call random players on rdr ""Blueberries"" coz of their markers on the map and I can get a little odd at time. You don't have to be like that as well just as long as you know how to have a laugh and are fine when I get a little cray. :)

Male, female, trans all welcome, gay straight bi doesn't matter to me all welcome and yeah I'm gay but don't care if you use the term gay ""that's so gay"" or call me a fag or whatever. There is a difference in joking and meaning it in a nasty way. I also don't mind if you don't really agree with homosexuality if we can get on fine then it doesn't matter debates and differences are fun sometimes as long as you know how to drop it when the otherside isn't in the mood."

Me: [https://imgur.com/a/lwMa6Yc](https://imgur.com/a/lwMa6Yc)

Second, I'll give you some random facts about me and you can tell me if you think we'll click! I have my degree in Business Administration BUT started my college career majoring in Psychology with an emphasis in Human Sexuality and scouted models for an agency for a year. (Ex girlfriend modeled and got me the job!) I was a high school and college athlete, I played baseball and almost played for the Chicago Cubs but an untimely death in the family kind of ruined all of that from happening.

My favorite music is kind of hard to pinpoint, but I do think there's a pattern based on the concerts I've been to: My Chemical Romance, Cobra Starship, We the Kings, Staind, Creed, Blue October, Bowling for Soup.

I have sucked pretty hardcore lately when it comes to reading books but I do enjoy them. My favorite authors I'd say are Karen Rose, John Grisham, and Haruki Murakami.

My favorite video games would be Chrono Cross, Persona 4 and 5, the Yakuza franchise, and earlier-Final Fantasy. I recently got a Switch and have been pretty addicted to that as well.

I am down to talk about anything and everything. What are some things you wish you could be more open and honest about? What are topics you'd love to talk about that you don't often get the chance to? What are some interesting facts about you?

Now it’s nearly completely taken over. And I’m accepting it, which is both fulfilling and terrifying at the same time. These last few days I’ve been forcing myself to get drunk early. I’ve never been a drinker and I still don’t considered myself one (no judgement on those who drink), but I’m forcing myself to get drunk just to alter my regular sleep schedule. I passed out drunk around 9:00 PM last night and woke up a little before 5:00 AM today. I can do this for a few more days and come 12/31/2019, I’ll be able to pass out and sleep through the welcoming of the new decade. I never went a year with out at least watching the ball drop.

Even if we do not know sometimes, we atleast try to make an effort to say anything that would be remotely helpful or use google as a last moment savior.

lonely,I have no one,"I have no one - TW

He broke up with me. it was my first relationship. we got together while I had to take a quarter off of college to get my finances and papers together. I was lost. just got out of the hospital because of a suicide attempt.

He made me feel something I had never felt before. I felt connected. I felt like I was meaningful and that I had worth finally. I could dream things for my life that were never a possibility before. I had idealized him and the life I could live with him. 

I was foolish. But what can I say? it was my first time.

less than two months, I knew him. yet here I am, more than a year later, still hurting so deeply. before him I was calibrated to be functionally miserable. stray breakdown here and there, but functional. with him I was miserable but aspirationally seeking not to be. that was a swing higher than I had ever gone so when I tried to recalibrate to my normal, I ended up in devastating misery. I went to the hospital every 2 months for suicidal feelings and attempts.

fast forward through homelessness, physical assault, emotional manipulation, and rape, I end up where I am today. I wasn't able to go back to school. I wasn't able to get a job, I wasn't able to keep a friend.

I am alone.

I am writhing in loneliness. I think I can't get over him because today there is no one who will listen. no one who I can lean on. no one who will lean on me. so here I am left to conjure images of the last time someone said I was a part of them, I was meaningful, I was worth it. 

I have no one. I was handed a bad hand and that makes me feel as if I am intrinsically a bad person. because why else would I have to live out the torture of today? 

I am good, I am funny, I am beautiful, I am smart, I am empathetic, I am mature. I am human. yet, I have no one. It's not meant to be. 

Nothing hurts more than knowing that it simply isn't meant to be."

""this person cant recieve messages"" stares back at me. youre my best friend by queen starts to play and the tears come faster because 1: they were so lucky to have each other and i know i will never have a friendship even a fifth as good as any of theirs and that royally sucks. 2: god fucking DAMN do i want a best friend. i want anyone to talk to. someone who cares about me and its a horrendous fucking feeling knowing not a single person would care if you died. hell theyd probably celebrate it. theres so fucking much wrong with me no one can stand me for more then 10 minutes. every day i have to go through and every day i collapse with a hundred thousand thoughts and no one to tell and my fucking god this will kill me if i dont first. i cant wait to get a gun. i dont want to be by myself anymore. no one ever stays. no one ever thinks im worth it. i have no friends and really i cant blame them but oh my god it hurts. it hurts. it hurts. im no ones first choice. or even second or third or fourth. i never will be. im a background character. no one fucking cares about me and i will spend my life desolute, miserable, depressed and have to face everything on my own. im only fucking 16, and yet i feel i have lived a hundred years due to this. i should be singing karoke in the car with my friends with a fucking mcdonalds cup in my hand. i should have memories of study parties and drinking parties. what do i have instead? endless nights of tears in my room because i am not living the life i want to be living and i know nothing i do will fix it. im too fucking worthless to be loved. i hate this. i hate this. i hate this. i dont want to be alone anymore. why does no one ever stay. why do i have to do this on my own."
lonely,I’m lonely and just want a friend,"I’m lonely and just want a friend - I’m quite weird and love anime, fashion, and cosplay.

lonely,2:00 am,"2:00 am - It's 2:00 a.m. and I'm sat up in the darkness listening to The Hours. I am sitting here and listening to this composition by Philip Glass because I'm an anxious mess. Part of that is because I spent Christmas alone for the second time in a row. My mind won't rest, and I'm thinking about whether or not there is truly someone out there for me. Words and feelings choke my brain from even being able to articulate how frustrated I feel right now. Even so, these thoughts will pass. I know this, but it doesn't make it any easier. 

I am a lonely human being, on a lonely rock, in a sea of billions. There are many people like me, and I wonder if they feel these thoughts as crushingly as I am experiencing them now. Here's to hoping things will turn out okay."

lonely,"if youre reading this, i care about you","if youre reading this, i care about you - hello. 

before i begin, i should say that i was here for the same reason most of you come to this sub. Distressed and incredibly lonely, scrolling through posts and looking for answers, desperate to find something to help. 

But the more I read each post, the more sad I became. Not because I felt less lonely, but because of the amount of people that feel this way, and I dont just mean feeling lonely.

I began to forget about how lonely I was, and it was replaced with a sadness that I was not the only one hurting like this. Eventually, I pm'ed someone I was worried about, asking them how they were doing and if they were okay, even though I had no clue who this person was. I wish I could do that with all of you, but this is probably the best I can do. 

There's nothing I could say or do to fix things for you. I won't tell you to endure, because if it was that easy, this subreddit wouldn't exist. I can't offer an action plan or a path to a better life. I'm not the person to ask where to find the light in the tunnel, because I don't know where it is, either. I'm no different than you are. I post about my issues, and keep checking my notifs to see what people reply and hope someone has an answer. There's no solution I can offer you.

But I need you to know that it's okay. I need you to know that whatever you're here for, I'm proud of you for making it this far and dealing with your issues. I'm proud you had the courage to reach out and be genuine with people you don't know. I'm proud of you for speaking your mind and trying to help one another. Our integrity is so fragile and precious, and you offer yours up to help and be helped. 

I need you to know that I care about you. That phrase might have lost it's meaning to you, but I don't care. It's my truth. I don't know who you are, but I care about you. I care about your story. I care that you aren't feeling okay, even if I don't know you. 

I know that I might never be able to do the things we both yearn to do with other people. I may never be able to see you or hug you or play games or make jokes with you. But, even if i dont know you,

I love you."

lonely,Falling feeling,"Falling feeling - Does anyone else feel as though the more time they spend alone, the more they fall into a dark pit? Everyday I'm by myself it feels like I'm going deeper into loneliness. Then when i hear i have to go somewhere i have to claw my way up far enough to not be a complete disaster. By the time i have to go out and socialize I'm exhausted from clawing up the pit. All i want is one persons hand to come down and help me up. Is it such a hard thing to notice that I'm going to far down? Why doesn't anyone come and help me? All i want is someone to tell me itll all be okay. I want someone to talk to. I just want someone to see me falling. Instead here i am plummeting toward what lies at the bottom of this pit of loneliness with not even a glance from the people around me."
lonely,This feeling,"This feeling - This is probably the worst I have felt like in the last few weeks. Without saying to much car accident lol. I'm just hurting a lot, and I have missed so much time from work from essentially a mental break. Now I got this, then nobody to consistently talk to like that. It all just kinda sucks... I know I'll wake up in the morning and be better but... currently it just fucking sucks haha."

I came out of my depression, I got in shape, I became happy and healthy. But every once in a while, usually when I’m just about to fall asleep I just wish I had someone with me. Someone I could took over towards and hold for comfort just before I drift away into my dreams."

lonely,To anyone who is truly alone out there,"To anyone who is truly alone out there - I would strongly recommend not posting on here. Before I get a lot of hate. If you are someone who literally has no one or very few people in their life at all, I mean friendless or never having a relationship. The majority of this subreddit won't be able to relate with you. The posts that I see get ignored the most are usually from people saying that they have no one in their life at all, meaning almost no friends, no family, no significant other and are completely lost. A lot of people, even on this subreddit, just cannot relate to that level of loneliness and will usually not respond or be able to reach out because of this. So, this is just a thought about what I've seen on this subreddit and I don't want anyone to be disappointed by the lack of people that respond to them."
lonely,Talking to myself,"Talking to myself - I've started to talk to myself a lot recently, maybe because I have no one that I can really talk to or maybe bc I'm crazy. I don't just say little phrases or whatever, I have like conversations with myself. Like the things I wish I could tell to someone, I'll just tell to myself and kind of let the words flow out of me. Anyone else do this?"

lonely,I’ve been lonely most of my life.,"I’ve been lonely most of my life. - I graduated high school and now I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been, but for the majority of my life I’ve been left to myself which up until now, I didn’t mind so much. Always been quiet, sheltered. I don’t have much of a problem doing things but I just don’t fancy being around people. Now that I’m an adult, I’d like to have a few people to talk to..I love sewing and singing, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, South Park, the ocean, rocks...I figured that people enjoyed talking to me because I was an active listener and engaged when I felt it was appropriate but apparently that wasn’t enough for them. 

I hope I can become a friend to some of you, thanks for reading/considering me as a candidate. 

:D Happy Times to all."

I hate the feeling like the whole world is a foreign entity to myself. That no one truly cares or connects with me on any meaningful level.

I hate going on these long walks - as beneficial to excercise as they can be - feeling like the scenery I may come across is the only positive surrounding.

I just feel lost in the world. I don’t know how I get myself back into it. I am presently stuck in the same shitty routine and I’m not getting any joy out of it."
lonely,You were my best friend,"You were my best friend - I’m lonely because you needed to grow. I tried not to let you in. We spend hours in your car cuddling and talking asking me to share secrets because it would bring us together. I let you see me for all that I am but you need space and need to wonton yourself. I tried to push you away. I wanted you to always stay even as a friend. You are beautiful and I can see the good. I’m not overlooking your flaws, we all have them. You can’t get over mine. They are in your ear telling you to leave me behind. We shared moments I’ll hold in my heart a feeling captured with the image of you. I’m lonely not being in your arms.  I miss your belly and kisses on my forehead. I was your friend and you chose to leave. I’m here for you and always will be. Not in the same manner but something new. But you’ve disappeared and don’t plan to come back, I’m empty and learning to be on my own. I have no choice because you were all I had. I wish you the best on your journey and please don’t use. You’ll surly die, you can live with the pain. Let people in and see yourself a thing of beauty in all the ways. Keep growing and be strong, this is what’s best."

2019 was rough to me.
Always the day before or on my birthday do I feel the most alone. I never have anyone to celebrate with nor does anyone really care. 
Since my birthday is on the 28th of December, I get discouraged thinking about what I have and haven’t done throughout the year. My loneliness comes from the only birthday wish coming from my sister. 
I just want to have actual friends that tell me happy birthday, or even text me a cake emoji. 
I go to work tomorrow and it’s mostly to just waste the day instead of spend it in my misery. 
I just really wish I meant something to someone."

lonely,23M Lonely for the Holidays,"23M Lonely for the Holidays - Like most people who post here, I'm super lonely. This Christmas was the first time I've ever been alone, and it hit me really hard. I need a friend, someone who doesnt mind the way I cling to people I like. Someone who doesnt mind that I can never text first, I get stuck in my own head and think people hate me. Someone who doesnt mind the monstrous cocktail of emotions that I am. I really just need someone to talk to, someone I can trust. I am hoping for people closer to Minnesota so I can actually see them, if it came to that, but I'm not against text buddies.

Few things about me:

- Music is what has kept me alive for so long, I listen to it, study it, and dream of the day I have the talent and patience to create some of my own.
- I pass most of my time playing video games, all sorts of games, on every console. I even work in the games industry, I'm super lucky, even though I probably dont deserve it.
- I am your stereotypical nerd, technology is super cool to me, I partake in the occasional D&amp;D campaign, and I'm told all the time I'm a walking dictionary.

If any of this sounds appealing to you for some reason, feel free to message me. I'm on ""christmas break"" until Jan 3rd, but when I get back to work, I cant text often, so dont think I'm ignoring you lol. Thank you for reading this, if you got this far, have a wonderful day/night/week or whatever!

lonely,dreams,"dreams - where your dreams are more fulfilling than actual interactions with people. when you feel so happy people have been open with you. and then you wake up and come to the realisation its your own mind projecting your loneliness onto people you encounter at work.

my dreams have been so vivid ive almost been embarrassed speaking with the people in my life. im not even sure if i said the things in my dreams in real life or not.

sometimes i wonder if maybe everyone might live like this at some point. everything seems so superficial in retrospect.

lonely,My Best Friends Are The Characters I Create,"My Best Friends Are The Characters I Create - Which sounds depressingly close to sounding like, therefore admitting, that I, at 30, still have imaginary friends. But either way, I'm writing a book, and like anyone, I've always loved when characters are so fleshed out and detailed and nuanced that you can not just relate to them but you wanna meet them. Not just in a romantic way either, for example, I would love to sit down and drink with Garrus Vakarian (Mass Effect), like just go do bro shit together, I dont know. And I want my story's characters to be exactly that, I want people to read my story and feel like they've known my characters their whole lives.

But sometimes that feels like, as someone who struggles to find people to relate to, they're the only friends I have. And I know thats only because I created them that way. But sometimes I feel like that's the Endgame here, just focus on writing, like ""I don't fit into this world, so I made my own. I don't have very many real friends, so I wrote my own. The lonelier I get, the more I write"". And I mean I dont mean to make this sound like this belongs more in r/writing or something, but still. 

Jesus. It really does sound like I still have imaginary friends, doesnt it."

I’m tired of people tearing me like I’m some joke until I succeed and they can use me. I’ll be laughing in their faces then.

lonely,Drowning,"Drowning - I've been finding myself laying in bed and crying this entire Christmas break. This happens from the evening into night time so I've decided to finally talk on this subreddit.

I feel like a failure to my boyfriend and friends, so much so I deleted all my confessions to them. It made me feel so useless venting to them, each sentence getting more and more depressed.

I write in my diary, but my boyfriend reads that. And I can tell he's worried but he's busy with life and I don't want to bother him. We're e-dating meaning I can't go over his house, sleep in his bed, etc.

I'm alone all my friends irl are busy or have pushed me aside for other people. I don't know what to do anymore, I feel so pathetic. I can't tell it's burdening others, my depression and body image issues and sensitivity. 

I feel like I'm drowning"
lonely,Celebrating on my own,"Celebrating on my own - I’m someone who keeps my problems to myself 
I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for 10 years on my own no one in my family knows anything about my struggle.

What’s bothering me is not the fact that I deal with my pain on my own but the fact that I celebrate my victories on my own too. 

I have been clean for 7 years of cutting.
I struggled through these years alone and every year I celebrate it alone too.
2017 I hit the rock bottom but I build myself up alone.
Today I graduated from college after 6 years of suffering, depression, and anxiety and here I am celebrating it alone 
Being alone takes away my victories 
Dealing with pain alone is bearable but dealing with happiness alone is a hit to the heart.

Sorry for rambling I just needed to get this out of my system."
lonely,Modern life leans towards loneliness,"Modern life leans towards loneliness - Modern life seems inherently lonely. Technology seems to be replacing genuine connection. We spend so much of our time working or with technology. Community is really lacking. It’s incredibly hard to not be lonely. It’s so easy to slip into invisibility.There’s not something majorly wrong with us for being lonely in the 21st century. In fact, it’s probably a good sign that our nervous system is working correctly and detecting something is wrong and that something meaningful is lacking. We are a product of the times we are living in.However, I hope we can forge a positive path through this."

Drove off, when I got back home she was gone with all her shit packed. Pretty fucked up mentally right now. Why isn’t anyone ever genuine anymore.

i triathelon train everyday and am in good shape.

I travel to various countries and have a lot of experiences.

Yet i dont have any friends...like literally none whatsoever. I talk to people online and guys say im cool, girls say im husband material...

However, on vacation ive spent the past 3 days staring at a wall with crippling depression waiting for time to pass. 

For the times i do leave my house i try to strike conversations with people but im usually disregarded...i tried online dating only to get used for free meals or stood up.

Im done and feel hopeless now. Is it really that hard to have people to talk to? Perhaps a close person to have around to hang out?

It’s crushing me. - Honestly never thought I would be posting on a thread like this, because in “real life” I am pretty outgoing and have a wonderful husband, a solid handful of friends, a big family that I get along with, I am a pretty open book kind of person, and I love to talk. I’m one of those people that has conversations with cashiers everywhere I go lol, my husband hates going to the store with me 😂

I started getting really sick about 7 months ago. Its one infection after another to the point where it’s rare that I can get out in public and actually see people, not to mention I’m becoming afraid to go out to places because I am picking up infections SO easily. I’m still at an age where when friends get together they want to go out and really do some big to-do, which healthy me would be completely on board with, but sick me just “can’t hang” for, not to mention can’t afford because I haven’t been able to work in so long. My husband works about 60 hours a week and is an introvert, so when he is actually home he wants alone time a lot of the time. My family is all very busy with their lives, and I can’t even watch my little niece and nephew because I don’t want to get them sick. 

I’m trying so hard to be patient. But there’s only so much conversation I can have with my dog and cat lol and I just feel like I’m going to explode having to be alone all the time. I crave connection SO badly. I miss work so much. I joined reddit to feel like I’m still connected with people on these days where I’m stuck sick in the house for literally the entire day. I tried to find subs that are funny or of mutual interest to me (as well as occasional medical questions since the reason I’m so sick is still a mystery). And I just feel like I can’t make connections with anyone. I’m emotionally really not doing well from being alone all the time because I really thrive around people, so all the downvotes, ignored posts, only commenting to correct a spelling mistake, or even sometimes bashing, etc. just starts to really get to me, which believe me, I KNOW sounds pathetic, but I just literally don’t have a life so it really gets me down and makes me feel like I’m just an unlikeable person. In “real life” I’ve been what I always thought was a likeable, friendly person. So it just feels weird to me to say things that are genuine or that I think are funny and have the only people I can connect with just have zero interest in having a positive interaction with me. 

I know everyone says people on the internet behind screens are just going to be jerks, but is there anywhere left to actually have fun chats and interactions with people? Does anyone have any sub recommendations? I just feel like I’m going to lose my marbles any day now with the way things are going."

lonely,I honestly just don’t know how to make friends.,"I honestly just don’t know how to make friends. - I’m 17 years old, I moved to Canada some 5 years ago after my parents divorced and throughout high school I was super lonely and made no friends. I just finished my first semester of university, and I am doing well academically and enjoy my subjects. Despite this I still have no actual friends. I have a bunch of acquatances, as I’m not antisocial or have social anxiety or anything. I talk to people who sit next to me and stuff. 

I kinda made a couple people who are sorta more than acquatances. One of them a guy I sat next to, whom I shared a bunch of interests and studied for exams with. We’ve kinda lost contact with each other after the semester though.

Another is a girl who sat next to me in history class whom I also shared a lot of interests with but I kinda screwed that up when I tried to date her, as it was the only way I really know how to progess relationships. We did get along well though, and shes pretty shy herself, though has a few close friends. Afterwards we agreed to be friends, and I believed her when she said that. We are friends on snapchat and we read each others stories (I recently started trying to use social media to try keep in touch with people without directly texting them), however she gives a lot of mixed signals like sometimes just not replying to my texts so I dunno if that will ever work out in terms of being friends. We both like the Lord of the Rings, and I honestly just wanted to watch that with her, (in a platonic matter) but something so simple seems so distant and difficult. I’d like to text her more often as I often have comments to make or things to say but I don’t because I’m not sure if I’m just being annoying. I honestly can’t tell if she actually does not like me, or i’m just overthinking. 

I guess I have to try again because I’ve been told friendship is a numbers game. I’m seeing counselling now but my first session seemed very unhelpful and like we did not really understand each other. Even if that does help I’m not sure what to do in the mean time. Constantly putting in so much effort into relationships after finally meeting someone I connect with (which is rare in itself) is so tiring. I cannot keep doing this if I get the same results every time. Relationships apparently take time to build, but I have not had one last longer than a year since primary school. What should I do? Where do I meet people? My counsellor tells me to diversify and look for friends outside of school but I honestly don’t know where? I have hobbies but none of them really get me out to meet people, and I don’t really know of any social hobbies I’d be interested in. I feel like I even struggle to relate to other lonely people, because it seems they are usually do socially anxious or depressed to  go out and meet people. I want to do that but I don’t know where or how."
lonely,I think I’m going to be alone and lonely for the foreseeable future,"I think I’m going to be alone and lonely for the foreseeable future - I don’t get many opportunities to meet women my age and as a consequence, don’t really have any female friends (or many friends in general). Even if I did get some chances to make new friends , I have massive amounts of social anxiety so I’m almost guaranteed to fuck things up. Can’t do tinder or dating apps because Im ugly as fuck. Trying to go to the gym and eat healthy and pursue my hobbies, and while it has improved my mental health, it hasn’t helped me with any of this yet. That’s what they don’t tell you. You’re told to work on yourself but that takes a long ass time and even then you’re not guaranteed to do any better in the dating department. At least I’m not aggressively suicidal anymore and have things to look forward to but who knows long will this last. I’ll probably get tired in a year or two of this. I don’t even know why I’m trying to find happiness in this. I know we’re wired to crave for sex and relationships but it’s been years since I’ve had anything happen with a girl. My brain should’ve gotten used to it by now. I wish I was asexual and none of this bullshit would matter. There’s a world of wonderful things to experience but my brain still wants to be sad because no girl wants to touch my pp. it sucks. Thanks for reading this incoherent rant."
lonely,I’m starting to slip back into my depressed state :/,"I’m starting to slip back into my depressed state :/ - Hey, I don’t really know where to put this but I just feel like I’m done with everything :(. All my friends have practically abandoned me, none of them ever consider me in any situation whatsoever, never ask me to do anything, they just forget that I’m there and I’ve never felt so isolated and alone. Just the other day I was in a call and the two people there kept addressing each other specifically when talking. I just feel like lying down and giving up. This has been an issue with my friend group constantly and I’m just not sociable enough to make a new friends. All the ones I’ve made at uni just moved on to other groups even tho I tried so hard with them. Even worse, my girlfriend, who I love so much and has been my one saving grace, talks to me less and less each day and I’m sat waiting for her to respond for hours just for a single word. I don’t want to lose her but I just feel her slipping away even tho I do everything to make myself available. I feel worthless and that I’m just not good enough. I’ve always had an issue where everything around me I perceived as I’m not worthy of having and that when it goes, it’s just what was coming.

I just feel hopeless and defeated. I really don’t know what else to do, I just spend my time engaging in my hobbies with a dull ache in my chest.

I'm not very attractive, socially inept, boring, clingy, have social anxiety, mild stutter, Tourette's syndrom, epilepsy, crippling emotional issues, attachment issues, can't dance, can't hold a conversation and only have nerdy interests.

lonely,I wish I had people,"I wish I had people - I made an IG yesterday after years of having/using no social media but this and business. I was pretty excited because a few of my posts (that are honestly more suited for IG) got some attention on here which made me feel like people cared about me a little. But when it came time to follow/request/connect and all that, I realized how alone I am. I have a boyfriend and I followed him and he followed me and all that, and a few of my reddit followers went over too. I have no friends, no family. Just a boyfriend, a snake, and a cat. Even when his friends come to the house, and I know they all want to hang out with “just the guys”, there’s nowhere I CAN go to give them space. I can’t call up my own friends to hang out or go anywhere because I don’t have any. So I’m forced to hover where I know no one wants me and I look like a clingy girlfriend but I’m not clingy, I’m just alone.
Making that page really drove it in for me, and now I’m ranting to a subreddit because I have no one else to rant to."

lonely,In highschool I was the the kid being bullied to becoming one of the most respected and popular kids at the end.,"In highschool I was the the kid being bullied to becoming one of the most respected and popular kids at the end. - So I'm 18 back in highschool which was 3 years ago, I was first bullied in the first few years and in high school we have a total of 5 years. I was called nicknames most of the time but if anyone went physical with me like pushing me or hitting me I would've gotten pissed and hit them back. I had friends who were in my previous school in my class in highschool and they were nice at first in the 2 terms but eventually they saw other groups and decided to take the piss out of me just to look cool and join them. 

This happened for 2 years. In the third year I was in a dodgeball match and I am one of the few ones left in the match at the end and I suck at sports now but before I used to be good at Basketball and baseball. When I was in the dodgeball match and was the last one on my team in the match the teacher either calls it and the other team wins or if there wasn't much of them he would continue the match and people on my team were doubting me saying I'm shit he's gonna be eliminated just like that. I had the ball in my hand and decided to do a useless throw to show I knew I lost but I wanted the shot to eliminate that guy and it did cuz he didn't even catch the ball and then my teammates who were on the bench cheered a bit. 

I somehow managed to eliminate more of them but made just one mistake of getting the ball while they had one and they took the shot and I was eliminated. Everyone on my team went up to me giving high fives, fist bumps and saying that was awesome man etc. After that day I had less people bullying me now and this sounds off a bit but it's true it happened.

Another month after we we're playing cricket and I'm awful at bowling and my turn was up. People did have doubts again but my teacher gives me tips on how to bowl before I did it and my first bowl I did was slow but it was awesome as I eliminated the guy as it was straight and hit the wicket. Everyone cheered because we was loosing and all the top players had their turn but after a few more bowls I eliminated someone else and that was it. I remember going into the changing rooms with people giving me handshakes and then inviting me to hang out with them after like outside of school and I did.

Now I'm hanging out with friends who used to call me nicknames but in their words it was a joke but I know for a fact it wasn't but that's all behind us now. We hang out every other day and we have laughs and watch new movies or eat at a restaurant so it was awesome."

lonely,How to spell lonely in french.,"How to spell lonely in french. - I left my country a bit over a year ago to come ""have an adventure"" in France.

Most of the time I am living an adventure. I have a great job, nice colleagues, a boyfriend who loves me, a family who accepted me as their own. I couldn't ask for more. Right?

Except that none of that feels real. I don't feel real. I am surrounded by people everyday and I still feel like I am alone. That's such a cliché, but the thing is: being in a foreign country erases you in some way.

I have now an excellent level of French, but it will never be like speaking my language. People here don't know how funny, sarcastic and smart I can be. I used to be fun. With this new tricky language I can't make jokes, I have no punch lines and all of my efforts into being funny end up with people not quite understanding what I mean. Both because they don't even expect me to make a joke and because the humour here is so different.

I feel like I lost my personality.

I work in french, I make friends in french, I love in french, I fuck in french. There's something missing. The part of me that doesn't speak French is going insane.

Being the only one to speak another language (and no, it's not English either) makes me feel completely isolated. I can have the same conversation as I would have in my mother tongue, but I still feel like an outsider.

It's a whole different kind of loneliness. 

I meet people, I have people, I love people. But I can't be who I am around them.

I miss my country and my friends who understand me. But the worst thing is: I know that if I ever go back, I'll miss here just as much and I'll be just as lonely without my French."

I am just tired of feeling like nobody gives a crap about me...

Sorry for mistakes.... English is not my first language.."
lonely,"Skip to third paragraph, maybe only that's relevant","Skip to third paragraph, maybe only that's relevant - If i really see deeply into it, I'm responsible for my current situation. I deleted my social media, i live by myself for more than a year now. 
I do go to my classes sometimes and that is the only way i interact socially and just reinstalled reddit after an year,
In my classes fortunately people do notice my presence. As i am good in studies but also really funny and too tall to be unnoticed. 
I have a good life, but i am not lucky, i worked really hard for it, improved my social skills, personality and even learned skills to impress.

I usually don't feel lonely, i study, watch good movies, learning Russian, sketching etc 
I have many hobbies to make myself busy and constantly learning something. 
I'm always available for my friends, if someone needs counseling or just get anything done, i really do help them and don't ever make them feel they owe me.

To the outside world, I'm seen as a guy who has his life figured out and is always cheerful. (its not delusion but i have been said this on many occasions)
I never asked for any help, even when my dad was in prison for 6 months and somedays (not consecutive) i didn't ate a thing because my savings were gone, i was not good with money then. 

I have been away from my family for many years to study further, i have been sick, have accidents that left scars, but never told them to my family or people who care until i recovered. 
I don't want them to worry as i know i can handle it but also i hide because i don't trust anyone with my feelings and people are always dealing with their own sorrow, so why bother anyone. 
I have people who care about me, but I'm afraid its conditional, and once in every 2 months i feel a bit alone, but even in these rare occasions i have no one to listen to me. 
I wish someone who really cared could just see through me and don't say anything about it. No remarks or sympathy, just nothing
It's ridiculous to expect but i wanted to say it. 
I'll never open up to people who know me because i don't want to feel vulnerable like i used to in the past. And i don't mind wearing masks because masks are cool. 
 
I deleted social media long ago because i got addicted to it, in fact i once quit everything i was addicted to alcohol, smoking, masturbation etc 
But recently i feel i'm hating myself again,i could do better and be better but i wasted two days doing nothing. I smoked after a long time today and jerked off because i just wanted this day to end soon.

When i started typing i was hating myself even more for acting like someone who craves a limelight from the crowd of people who will ridicule, but after two hours of writing, erasing and rewriting, i don't care anymore. 
In fact i feel better, and will possibly work for the thing for which i can leave everything

lonely,25 m Always been lonely. I feel I've been born a slave.,"25 m Always been lonely. I feel I've been born a slave. - People treat me like I'm disposible. This isn't new. It's been the case always. I'm lucky that I have a family that loves me, but they come with their own issues and I have to keep a safe distance to be stress free. 

Love life has been non existent. I'd asked a girl out in school, mustered up a ton of courage, given I was relatively from a not so well to do family economically as her. She said she would never go out with me, it was my caste apparently, I wasn't born into a family pure enough for her. I stopped chasing girls around then, worked very very hard, eventually got a good job, paid off my families loans, paid my sister's divorce fees, and funded her marriage and the subsequent delivery of my beloved niece too. I donate a third of my savings every year to this orphanage near where I live, anonymously. 

In all this I never made deep friendships. I'd never been with someone. I'd asked out a couple of colleagues over the past three years but no one's said yes. I never ask again as I feel that's disrespectful. I fell for a friend involuntarily, only to realize she lied about her break up and was back in with her old guy. Years later, still a virgin, but I lie to my few friends that I've gotten laid before.

Feels like slavery. The only things I've been useful for is for others. I've never really understood why. I don't think I'm ugly. I'm not ill mannered nor am I crass. 

Sitting alone in my room, I think I want to give up. It's been very tiresome and stressful. Maybe I'm meant to just work for others and ensure they're happy..."

lonely,Loner lifehacks ( a short rant),"Loner lifehacks ( a short rant) - I've been seeing a lot of posts recently about people saying how they get attached to someone who gives them 5 minutes of their attention. 
It's funny, I used to be like that but after so much time and disapointment I'm to numb to give a fuck. But why be completely misereble? Lets have fun by fucking with strangers, cracking jokes at cashiers and other people you meet troughout the day.
Ya know, one of the greatest life hacks for lonely folks is smiling. I discovered that recently on accident. I was in a waiting room minding my own buisness and then all of a sudden this cute girl comes in, like always I smile at her and say ""hi"". She send the cutest smile I have ever seen back and that made my day. Since then I used this super power a few times and it always makes my day. 
Another life hack is gratitude. When someone does something that makes your life a little easier remember their face and each time you see them give them a smile and wave at them.
These trick don't numb loneliness but they do make you cope with it a little easier. And once you accept your loneliness you'll be just fine.
Somehow I'm having the most fun I have ever had by making jokes with strangers. Of course not everyone can do that, I think I'm quite creative when it comes to having conversations, I think outside the box. So I encourage all of you loners out there to become funnier and to learn to enjoy your own jokes no matter how stupid they might be.
This is probably a dumb post and not the sort of thing you'd see on my profile but I'm quite fine right now, that might change an hour later and I'll be on a bridge trying to build the courage to jump.
Have a nice day lats, thanks for reading ^^"

To the point it feels unhealthy and I daydream about being around them and being their friend. - Well, the title pretty much sums it up fairly well but I will give more detail here. It's long sorry.

I'm a guy in my early 20s and I generally do not have many friends or interaction with much people unless I have to. Never had any relationships either, been on only 1 date ever. Ever since I was a kid I was always the shy, introverted, low self esteem guy with interests that are a bit abnormal, and as a result I find it hard to find commonn ground with people and generally just stay quiet. I have recently found out I may even be on the Autism Spectrum and after reading about it, things make perfect sense.

For years, I had this problem of getting a bit obsessed and fixated with people when they show me attention or I feel like they have a lot in common with me, especially with girls (even ones I don't find super attractive, or I may not even know what they look like at all but once I find they are a girl it drives up my curiosity even more). To the point I daydream about them and would like to get to know them and talk with them more, be their friend, or even more (with girls only though), but fear that maybe they will not like me once they know more about me so I don't even try talking.

This sucks because things get to the point where my stomach seems to tie in a knot, my face is red, and I start over analyzing everything with them like for example, when I comment on their things online, or on the rare chance they comment on my stuff, Subscribe, or follow me.

A recent example is with someone from YouTube who I've been a fan of for years and they actually subscribed to me and commented on a video of mine recently and I was so weirdly happy about it like a little fanboy. They are into very similar things as me and my channel, which is not big or super well known compared to them, is similar to theirs. I recently found that they are even subscribed to a good number of channels that I am and I am so infatuated with them. I feel like a stalker. I don't even know what they look like and I found that they are a girl fairly recently so that made me more obsessed. Almost like a crush on them that I want to be their friend at least, and maybe more.

I have actually been making online friends lately over the past few months which started from following and PM'ing them or them talking to me and I had similar infatuations and nervousness that I have with this YouTuber but they pretty much went away with my friends since I actually have conversations with them and feel less lonely that I forget about depression, anxiety, etc. I even briefly met one in person by accident actually and they didn't seem put off by my awkwardness lol. I do still daydream about them and wonder how it would feel hanging out with them and then I'd get nervous that what if they won't like me all that much if/when they meet me in person. These friends are guys except for one who's a girl which I was pretty infatuated with but knew she has a bf so that infatuation eased up a bit. I don't over spam them with messages if they don't respond for a long time. Now I don't feel too nervous if they don't respond, but before, it felt like the end of the world. And having different people, even if just online acquaintances, to talk to, kinda helps, even though not everyone is always responsive.

Sorry this was a long post but this has been making me feel a bit worse lately especially because I've been home for Christmas break. Comment below if you had similar situations and let me know your stories and what you do about it?"

lonely,My death,"My death - These days I feel like my death is coming sooner than later.

Not because of the suicidal thoughts tho.

More so because of the extremely frequent and extremely painful migraines i've been getting for the past couple of years now that seem to only be calmed with caffeine but only for a small amount of time.

At this point I only think of them to be the result of caffeine withdrawals but they have influenced me to read about brain aneurysms. idk maybe i might just be paranoid but a lot of the stories i read about where the people had to go to the ER...their symptoms were similar to mine....but I don't want to diagnose myself so....

&amp;#x200B;

The point of this post is... just... don't believe what anyone says about me when I die. They were never there for or with me. They just want to appear as good people....they all abandoned years ago. I wonder if all the people who come out saying that ""this person who committed suicide was a good person"" or ""i never pictured that person would do that"" were genuine ya know. I think they're chasing social status and using a dead man/woman to gain clout.

lonely,The biggest lie,"The biggest lie - You know, here and there we can hear ""be yourself"". I thought that it was true, but now i understand that it's not. Or i should say that this saying is not full version. ""Be your good self"" that's more like it, cuz let's be honest. People usually don't want you to be yourself, because it means having some good and bad traits. But almost nobody wants you to be bad. So it's not unusual for one person to say ""be yourself"" and in s minute you can here ""don't be like that"". Don't like my self, huh? Then why do you tell me to show it? No sane person would hate themselves. Yet we show our selfs and they are hated by others. So we start to do the same thing to ourselves.

I get why people here advice this. Maybe it worked. Good for you, let your self always be loved. Bur for me... it never worked, doubt it'll ever work. The only thing left is hope that i can be understood for desire to be anyone, but myself."
lonely,I deleted my social media and feel lonely,"I deleted my social media and feel lonely - Some time ago i felt betrayed by a person that i really really trusted. It made me realize, that if i couldn't rely on that person, who could I trust then? 

I decided to delete my social media - Instagram, Snapchat, Tinder. Now I have contact only with my real friends, but there arent many of them. And its so hard for me, because earlier I was always talking with somebody or doing something together. Now, when i'm in my family town, i dont have anybody here (even my family left to visit friends etc). That loneliness is killing me, even when i realize that people that i cut off werent my real friends. 

Being single was much easier at that time, because i had feeling that i have people who care about me - even if it was fake. I was partying a lot, drinking, having fun. But i wanted to change it, start more adult life. Another problem is when you are ugly its hard to find a girlfriend, especially one that will share your hobbies etc. And those who were into me, they were usually boring party-girls - i'm just tired of such people. 

Dunno if there is any way you can help me, but i just needed to talk about it :("

lonely,Haunted by a pleasant dream,"Haunted by a pleasant dream - Last night, I had an incredible dream. 


It started out kind of wacky, as dreams tend to do. Somehow I found myself in some kind of a “knocked up” situation, pregnant by some guy I didn’t know. Anyway, similar to the movie, we try to make it work but the guy is pretty cold and aloof. Eventually we end up warming up to each other. 


The last part of the dream I remember is laying down next to him, watching while he’s doing something on his phone. I feel pretty bold, so I scoot closer and put my head on his shoulder. At first he didn’t do anything but after a couple seconds he wraps his arms around me and leans his head against mine. 


That feeling of being held was incredible. I remember feeling warm and cared for and like things just felt right. This is around the time I woke up. The feeling of contentment was still so strong that I still felt warm and fuzzy even agreeing hitting snooze on my alarm a few times. 


And then reality sets in and I wake up alone in my cold bed in my empty house. I log into my laptop, work from home, not so much as speaking to another human being all day. Although, I do say thank you to my food delivery driver. 


Even though I still felt incredibly lonely, the memory of my dream was comforting today. Remembering laying in the arms of someone who cared about me, feeling warm and content. When in reality I haven’t physically touched a person outside my family in months. 


It was nice because I don’t typically remember my dreams at all but this one was so vivid I could remember it perfectly for hours. But now I’m laying in bed, dreading sleep and tomorrow for no particular reason. All I can think about is the dream, but it’s faded more now and I can barely remember the feeling. 


I just keep hoping that I have the same dream again tonight, but I think I’m thinking about it too much and it’s keeping me awake."

Nobody has texted me, and I haven’t spoken to anyone else in an actual conversation for 2 weeks now... I feel like I’m gonna go insane. 
And before you say “go out and do something”, I have. I go out to eat.. alone. I go to movies.. alone. Studying in college.. alone too. Sometimes I think I’m invisible to other people, even some of my “friends”, who usually end up bailing on our outing to go with their SO(s) or smoke because “not enough people showed up”. Also, so you guys understand, I am a people person and have good social skills it’s just that... I want an SO too... someone, anyone to talk to face to face... or at least touch. You know that feeling... when you want to be held and be told that everything will be ok, while you cry you eyes out in bed... only to wake up from a dream.

A dream that will never come true and your heart gets ripped from your body and crushed right in front of you.

lonely,Lonely and depressed,"Lonely and depressed - First of all, if you are here to judge...the door is over there, please use it to leave.

I feel doomed to be lonely and depressed forever. I'm stuck in a relationship with a narcissist and I can't seem to break away from her without it costing me the chance to ever see my special needs daughter (19f) again.  we discussed, or rather argued about, divorce and she eventually told me she woud ove back home and keep my daughter away from me since we don't have have legal guardianship of her (she is a legal adult and her own guardian).   I started the guardianship process while telling her I'm not going anywhere, its the only way I convince her to go along with it.  This process is taking a lot longer than I expected.

I just want to be loved and I want to love someone.  I found someone I fell deeply in love with and I believe she fell in love with me.  she would only discuss dating me once I ended my obligation.  It was only fair to her that I follow her wish.  Unfortunately things are more complicated and I have not been able to end my obligation.

I forgot what it was like to be loved and to love someone.  I deeply care about this woman, but I have lost her and it really hurts a lot.   she was everything I have ever wanted in a woman.  she has the most beautiful green eyes, an amazing smile, and a cute laugh.  I loved everything about her, but just as everything in my world it has been messed up by my wife.

I'm sick of working my ass off with nothing to show for it. I work 2 jobs, she doesn't work at all.  she used to work a part time job until she got cancer and survived the treatment.  She never went back and doesn't contribute to the finances of the family.  she would rather volunteer than work yet complains that I work so much.  she does soend every penny that I make after I pay bills and then says I blew all the money.  

I can't stand this anymore.  I desperately want out of this situation and Ill do anything to talk to my friend that I fell in love with again."

My mind is it's own little entity, isolating itself from other minds. I just wish someone was in my mind with me. Just so I didn't feel so god damn alone. I'm sick and tired of this feeling, but nothing I try gets rid of it, only prevents it for a few more hours. I can't live like this.

lonely,She treats me like a boyfriend but we aren’t dating.,"She treats me like a boyfriend but we aren’t dating. - I’ve been talking and hanging out with this girl since the beginning on senior year. (Both 17, I’m soon to be 18  in 2 weeks) We hangout almost everyday and talk everyday several times a day. We do everything that a couple does besides the sexual stuff. We go out to lunch/dinner, we watch Netflix together, she’ll curl up against me and just let me give her a head rub when we’re parked in my car, she goes out of her way to talk and hang out with me, as well as just give me actual hugs everyday. On the way out of school she’ll sometimes put her arm around mine or hold my hand. We go to my house for a little and cuddle/spoon, and she’ll lay on top of me and take naps. She’ll go and playfully suck frosting/ cool whip off my fingers and try to do “a lady and the tramp spaghetti scene” with random food like cookies and pizza crust and even bobo tea ball things. We’re also planning on going to the same college together as well. She’ll do stuff with me that she won’t do with other guys who are her friend. A friend told me that when he sees us together, that we actually look good together and that she looks really into me. The problem is that she’s “dating” a guy she met once while she was at a convention in Florida over the summer. All they do is video chat/ text once a day and only the guy has anything about her in his bio on Instagram. She also seems to flirt with me far more than she flirts with him. Is there anything I can do about this?

Tl:dr- I like this girl, we do everything a couple would do, except for making out/sex. But she’s “dating” a guy she met at a convention who lives more than 1k miles away"

My heart aches whenever I even think about having someone. I know it won’t happen, and I don’t even have any proof that it’ll make me feel better, but in the back of my mind I cling to the chance that it will.

lonely,Been alone since childhood,"Been alone since childhood - Is there a psychological term for the thing I am feeling? This has been apart of me since I was a child. And it still carries with me through age 20. As a whole I feel like I'm always alone. I have a great social circle and family but am still riddled with the fear of being alone. I had a boyfriend for 2 years and he completely ghosted me over TEXT. That has still fucked me up to this day and its been a good year. Anyways, Im the youngest out of 3 siblings (age gap being 3 and 10 years, respectively). All of my cousins are 5-9 years older than me, so I never really grew up with someone my age. I found friends through school because they were my age and they became my support system. My mom and dad are my best friends but they also work day to night so I only see them at the night time. Im in college now so I really don't see them at all. My sisters married and my brothers moved out as they both are finished college and I dont see them either.

When I was younger I'd never be allowed in the ""big kid room"", be able to hang out or do anything. They always left me out. I still remember the time I cried on the phone because my siblings and cousins tricked me and went to see the new Batman without me. I wasn't old enough to go but it still hurt. I digress, as I got older the family started to move apart, I guess that happens when everyone grows up? I keep ties with my cousins still though, but I feel like I'm the only one who trys to keep the connection alive. After my sister got married shit changed really quick. I was depressed my first year of college and I asked her to visit and she didn't even give me the time of day, said she was busy. This girl has traveled to maybe 50 countries with her husband and has all the time in the world and so many days off to see me and won't. I don't know what else to do or say to her. The three of us had a huge falling out over the summer because I finally admitted my sadness as to why I don't have a good relationship with my siblings and it didn't make a difference. She blamed my mother?! for the way we all ended up. And that was basically the last bit of respect I had for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moving onto the friend part, now that I've came home for winter break, I feel as if no one wants to make time for me anymore. Time to hang out, see each other, even have common courtesy to text me back in the groupchat when I ask for the gang to get together? And I feel as if the effort I put out for anything, everything is just not taken into account. And then I get hurt when its not reciprocated. What is this loneliness I feel? How do I overcome it?

Now, I know I'm pretty lonely inside, but I'd say I do a pretty good job hiding that fact- and I have a relatively healthy mindset when it comes to relationships and whatnot, but I've always worried about falling to the point of desperation. So when it got to the point where I noticed my mind CONSTANTLY wandering toward thoughts of this guy, possible futures, etc, I started to wonder if I've hit that point already. Like, I actually had to snap myself out of certain thoughts because it became too distracting.

I've tried looking for meet up groups, clubs, classes, anything to try and meet people to share my interests and they all we're either discontinued or full or just didn't exist.

I go through phases of talking constantly to ghosting for days. It's my main issue right now and I'm so lonely because of it. I really want to start talking to people and (eventually, not now and I'm not posting for this) I would like a relationship (again, not anywhere in the future) but I feel because of past things I've been through I'm just never going to trust again and I'll keep being lonely. 

I would love to have friends and I would love to just chat. I just wish I had the mental availability to do that, if that makes sense. It's a struggle when I'm so scared of being hurt and lied to again, not just in a relationship but friends too."

Even after removing her off all my social media and her friends I still find ways to think of her and assume the worst things every night.

I’m not quite sure where to begin, so I will sum up who I am. 

I work, I a lot I guess..I work about 28 hours..that’s not a lot but if you consider that I’m going to school full time. Then yes it’s a lot

I hate answering guestions like- what are you hobbies? And what do you like to do?

Like I don’t know...I go to school and then work, if I’m not working I’m just laying in bed. And ones a week I’m in therapy, and then I’m helping cook.

I don’t have many friends, I do have people I talk to, I talk out loud in class and I talk a lot to my coworkers. Everyone seems me as happy..but I’m really not. One day I was at work and I feel quite because depression was a bitch and I felt angry and sad. And they all asked me what was wrong. But I don’t feel any better with them asking how I was, I felt alone. Because I realized they don’t know me. No one knows me. 

My closest friends, a friend I used to text 24/7 and a friend that I tried to be more with and failed...we slowly stopped talking over the summer and I felt lonely so I did what I do every summer. Work. Work is my Excape. I’m told I’m the best worker there. And I’m that because I give it my 100%. He forgot my birthday, I remember his. I told him I wasn’t mad. He lied to be and I caught him In it and he lie to get out of it. Things haven’t been the same. He’s an Horrible Friend, and people tell me it’s one sided and it’s toxic, I tell myself that too. But I’m scared to leave him because I will be 100% truly alone, and he would be alone..

Sorry If that was all over the place but I guess thanks for reading"

But I've gotten to the point of having anxiety attacks and panic attacks when I'm alone.

I live in my head too much, I’m my only friend. I was cut off from my friends yesterday, they don’t want anything to do with me. Anytime I’m told to reach out they seem like they never want to talk, or they just wish to be done. I feel like an untreatable disease.

Looking to find that certain connection the old fashion way.  Just by talking and getting to know each other on a personal level. Yes looks are important but someone's personality makes them beautiful. Okay imma quit the corny stuff now. 

I would love to make everlasting friendships firs. And maybe even a relationship if it comes to that. I don't care how far away you are. A true connection survives all borders.

Something about myself:

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

My passion is cooking. And besides that I love to read, having conversations, grabbing coffee on a rainy Sunday, watching sports and play some games on my ps4.

lonely,I have fake friends only.,"I have fake friends only. - I’m 15, I live in central Europe and I feel very lonely. Especially when I go to school or when I would like to organise a party, but nobody wants to come. 

So basically, when I’m in school, even though everybody says that they like me when asked, nobody talks to me or wants to spend time with me during the breaks or lessons. They choose other people and just don’t care about me. Even when I manage to talk to someone, his ‘better friend’ takes him away from me. Nobody never asks me if I would like to go somewhere with them or just even sit with them during breaks. I always have to try really hard to get some people to talk to, but I think that my actions are only making the situation worse.

Also, I wanted to organise a New Year’s Eve party, and a few people even said they can come for sure. But later, everyone said that they are already going to somebody else’s party. When I asked my classmate if I can go to her party, she said that ‘I should come earlier’ and that ‘she won’t invite me because she already has friends to spend the New Year with’.

I am feeling very lonely but I don’t think that anything can change that now, I just have to wait until I go to high school and, I hope, make new, real friends.

lonely,How to be okay with not having friends?,"How to be okay with not having friends? - Due to a bunch of misunderstandings and friend drama, I no longer have friends my senior year of high school, which really sucks.

Using a throwaway, because some of the friends involved in the drama know my reddit account. I've also posted this on other subreddits because I really need advice on how to deal with suddenly having no friends whatsoever. 

A summary of the drama:

I had a three-person plan to hang out, which I initiated. Somehow, they neglect to tell me what time the movie is at. Twenty minutes into the movie, they tell me to come. I interpreted this as 1) they purposefully left me out or 2) they somehow completely forgot about me in this three-person plan, which means they don't care about me or value our friendship.

One of the person apologizes. The other says nothing. The other person (let's call her Anne) before has told me in a game (called Paranoia) that she vibes with me least.

Anyway, that day I hang out with other people and they ask me why I feel sad. I explain the situation. A few days after I ask someone for advice on what to do and if I should talk to Anne. One of these people I told must have said something to someone else, because by the time Anne knows she's furious because she thinks I've been talking behind her back and that she doesn't want to be friends anymore. I guess by the time it reached Anne that it sounded really bad, because she thinks I said something along the lines of ""Anne doesn't care about any of her friends.""

Everyone takes Anne's side, and I no longer have any friends.

It's senior year and I'm left with no friends. I don't know what to do with myself. Senior year was supposed to be fun. I have no idea what to do anymore."

I'm 25 and I've been dealing with Social Anxiety for 5+ years now and i want to fight back at this moment (which is pretty new to me). This year's been the worse in term of loneliness..

A girl arrived at the place i'm working last month and we like to 'tease' each other, like joking about her and she jokes back to me with good humour. I know she is alone so I want to invite her to take a drink or whatever, as long as it's outside the workplace. But I really don't know how to do that without feeling cringe or nervous. Plus, I'm a bit scared of what the atmosphere will be if she's not in the mood. 

On top of that we are always in group of co-worker. I don't want to invite her in front of them, but I don't want to message her to not feel like we are in highschool or so ^^' 

Does anyone with social anxiety went through this and have experience to tell me how he dealt with that ?"

This advice in particular usually just cuts off at the ""before you can love others"" part which is why so many socially isolated people (myself included) are averse to hearing this. Because it makes it sound like if you cross the path to self acceptance and positivity then you won't be lonely anymore.

If u managed to read this far I am a "
lonely,More lonely than ever! Need support and helpful tips,"More lonely than ever! Need support and helpful tips - Hello! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year everyone!

I kinda just want to write my thoughts and story off! It will be hell of wall of text, Sorry about that in advanced! I appreciate if you can read it all!


So, I will start at the beginning of this ""story"".  For about 5 Months or so, I had a female co-worker that got bullied by my best friend, he did do sighs every time He saw her, complained that he did not want her here, all she does is talk and do not work etc. Since both me and my friend are Team leaders, I knew he cannot treat someone like that no matter what his personal thoughts are on her. (No one should treat anyone with disrespect no matter what, don't get me wrong)

Unfortunately it got too far before I had any saying to my friend, She came crying towards the restrooms, I stopped her and asked her what was wrong, what happened etc. She did not want to tell me at first, but after consoling her with one other co-worker, she started to talk about how my best friend treated her, that she cannot take it anymore. She thought work was a place she could just be herself, go away from the personal problems she had. (Did not know what her problems where at the time).  I told her that I would go and talk to my best friend, that I know it has gone too far.

I did not find my friend, but I found the other Team leader of his department, So I told him everything and he said we should go together and talk to my best friend. So I explained what our female Co-worker had said to me, That they need to talk and sort this problem that they had.  Even told my friend it is bullying that he has been doing, His Co-team leader disagreed it was nothing like bullying, that she overreacted about everything. 

We found her, my best friend and his co-team leader and the female Co-worker talked, They did not want me in the conversation for some reason.. But I did not really care, as long as they sorted it out.

Later that day, the Female Co-worker came to me and said Thank you, that none has really stood up to her like I did, exceptionally against my best friend. I told her it was no problem, as long as everyone is in good terms. 

The next day, I got called my My friends Co-team leader that We need to have a short meeting. I went down to their department and we got into the office, We talked about what happened yesterday.
My friend is a bit introvert, so he was mostly quiet during the meeting. But his Co-team leader is very open and talkative, but he said its best that we keep this situation quiet so that others do believe we are bullies here. 
He even got angry at me for calling my best friend a bully. I Told them that its because he is my friend and he needs to know when hes doing something wrong. It might have been unintentional from his side, since he has that kind of jargon in that group. Not all can take it though.  My friend even told me in my face that hes not going to change his behavior towards her, since Hes not doing anything wrong (according to them). 

A bit background about their department, there has been 4 people leaving in short notice, 3 people sick-living and 1 just quits the job, since she cannot take it anymore. There has been a HR investigation about all this. (More about this later)
 They did not want more drama more than this, since they only cared more about their own personal image than peoples well being. (This is what made me angry in the paragraph above) Also, my best friend look up to his Co- team leader like a role model, don't know if it its good or bad. But from my point of view, its more about the image, both at work and personal life. They do not care about others. They say they do, but they do not.

Well, after the meeting I was going back to my department, the female co-worker saw me going in to the office with them and asked me what they talked about, I told her that we talked about what happened yesterday and she should just ignore my best friend for the time being.

I went back to work, All I was thinking about was the situation and how my friend has started to change, might not be for the better.

After few days, the female Co-worker came to me and said that nothing has changed, and its feels worse than before. I told her that my friend told me during the meeting that he is not going to change his behavior towards you.
She got angry, told me that hes being childish etc. She wanted to go to our boss and tell him about what was going on. I told her to just sit tight a bit it might be sorted out by the next week. Since I had planned to talk to my friend during the weekend.  The weekend came, But my friend was busy and did not have time for me. (Which has been like that for a while,  since I am bit of a loner myself, even more so when my best friend started getting more distant from me)

Sometime during the next week she came to me and told her that she had talked to my best friend again, and this time it felt more genuine since he apologized for his behavior and he knew what he did was wrong. I told her that is great, but she even told me that she had to switch to a different department this week. My thoughts was that I am not sure if this was their doing to shove away the problem rather than solving it.. 

Well, Since we started talk more during work, she started to eat with me during lunch etc. We noticed that my friend and co-team  leader started getting more distant from me or us. Since I started hang out more with her.

She said to me she want to go up to our CEO and tell him what has happened more than ever since she told me she had contact with those people who had left for sick leave. What their reason was for leaving/quit work. It was because of my friend and his co-team leader, their behavior, ostracizing.. Just what happened to her. She even showed me what they have written, to make sure that she was not lying. It baffled me, since it all made more sense about what has happened lately at their department , since all I got from my friend and his co-worker is that they were idiots etc.. 

Well, after this I had to make a decision, very hard one. In a professional standard I should go with her, but as a friend I was going behind his back. But since this was work-related and not personal. We scheduled a meeting with our CEO. We even got another co-worker who had few view points too.

Well, We got to our CEO and asked what we wanted to talk about. The female co-worker told him her story, and our CEO told directly that this is bullying, and if its true then he is going to fire my friend without hesitation, our CEO told me something he cannot tolerate is grown-up bullying. The other co-worker said about my friends work ethic was not great, he was lazy, did nothing, told others to do his stuff rather than him doing work himself, he has become very comfortably at his position, since his Co-team leader does all the team leading work.

Since I do not work with my best friend that close anymore, this was chocking.. Something has changed since he got the position as a team-leader, he has said to me that he does not want to be a team-leader, he got the position temporally when the others quit.  
Then the CEO asked us what he should do tomorrow about this, since he know we want something. Me for once, was chocked.. and did not want to do anything drastic, since hes still my best friend. I was defending my best friend, but still trying to make things right. The CEO noticed that. The female co-worker got a bit pissed at me for defending him, she wanted him gone for good. But at last we agreed that we sit tight and let see if it works out.

After meeting, the female co-worker said I was probably right about not doing anything drastic about it.

Well, I after that day, I got home, she wrote to me that she wanted to me and talk. So I went to her (She lived about 600 meters from me).  We went for a walk with her dog, told me about her problems with her brother, her boyfriend and that her sister is being a bit of a bully towards her. I felt so damn sorry for her and said that she now got me in her life if she need a friend to hang out with. Then she told me she does not have a lot of friends. I said I do have that many either.

To make it short here, we started to hang out more after work. We got a good connection. we became very close. I started to like her more than a friend, but I told myself she got a boyfriend, so I kept it that way for now..

But at work, she transferred then to my department, I got to hang out with her a bit more at work, I kinda liked it,since I kinda liked her and  she was doing great job, but I do admit that she did talk a bit too much during work, Told her that she should try not to talk too long, people did complain to me about her talking too much,

She told that she wanted a new meeting with our CEO about it the issues she had faced before..she could not let it go.. even though she did not work with them anymore.  Also since her contract was about to expire she wanted to make things right or others will probably quit due to my friend and his coworker. I told her fine, we can do that. She kinda persuade me.. Hey I like her, and I wanted what was going to be best for her! 

We got a meeting with our CEO on her last day.  During the meeting it was the same all over again.. I defended my friend and she had angry glare towards me during the meeting.
It led not nothing really, it was basically a rewind of what our first meeting was. Except Now I knew that HR was contacted that they going to make a investigation about the situation again. Also the CEO told me personally that last time HR was here, they had a assessment from HR where a woman ask question that they rated from 1-4. This scored got squared so my best friend and his co-team leader kept their job, since the workers that current was working there had no problem with them at all. (But since then, I've heard complaints)  After the meeting, it was late that day. I was waiting at the entrance for the female-coworker. She was really upset about everything. She told me to leave her alone, and she went into her car and drove off.


Later that night, she called me and said she wanted to meet up, she had something to tell me.

So She came to me, picked me up, we went for a drive. She said she wanted to tell me something, but she could not really say it to me. I told her, If I can guess, I believe that you like me, She said that was it. She had feelings towards me. 
I told her that I had feelings to her too. I felt happy, finally I told tell her how I felt. Then she told me she was going to break up with her boyfriend the next day. That she had been thinking about it for couple of weeks since she met me, she told me that she never had met someone that kind like me before. 
Then she asked me if she could come to my place after she broke up with him, I told her she could, then she said it might get late, since he was working until 12 am (shift worker). I told that was fine. 

She then came to me, we sat down in my couch and she told me it felt really good to break up, since they had been fighting for a year or so, a very toxic relationship (What I heard from her)..  She was surprised how well her ex took it. I told her he might have been ready to break up with you too, but did not have the courage to do so. Then she hugged me and said she was really happy that i am here for her, she made me feel like a hero(?) and told me that I took her as a storm (is this a phrase?). She said she rather be with me and her now ex boyfriend for a while. Then she told me about last time they broke up, when he broke up with her.. that she got eating disorder, took distant from her friends etc. isolated herself from everyone. I told her that is not going to happen again.

After few hours of talk about her ex, she told me what I knew about Borderline (BPD) I told her I knew very little, All i knew was that very drastic mood changes. She  told me she had that disorder, and told me little bit about what I should expect and do not take things personally. Since I was clueless at the time, I said it was no problem at all. 
Then she said she had to go home, it was late, and I was going to work in 2 hours.. I did not sleep that night, but I was happy, that I found someone that really liked me for who I was.. Since my history with relationships has not been great e.g: cheating and lying etc.  I've kept my distance from letting anyone in my personal life (love life), but due to what was going on at work, led me to open up more. It felt great at that time..

We started seeing each other everyday, she made me feel so special, she said all kind of things that made you feel superior, it was amazing feeling! It boosted up my confidence, I was more happy than I've been for years. Since she wanted to keep this secret that we are seeing each other from everyone.. she told me people should not get the wrong idea..  I said sure, we can keep it secret for a while.. see if it works out or not.

Then she started being more cold towards me, I asked her what is wrong.. She told me she just want to be alone. Later that day, she wrote to me that she wanted to get back to her Ex and that she loved him, she was the ""one"". I told her to fuck off for playing with my feelings. 

Then day after tomorrow she asked me if I was home, I told her I was with my brother, she asked me to get home, so I did. When i got home I wrote to her that I was home. (During the time I was waiting for an answer I was thinking that shes going to tell me that she is back together with her ex again) Then she knocked on the door, I opened and she told me  say nothing and just hug me please.. after the hug she said she wanted to explain everything she went through today..

She told me that she was going to her ex, but noticed a another car was there (she took a picture to send to her friend, and asked if he knew who that was) and her friend confirmed that her ex had a met a new woman already, then she showed me how she trashed talked about me, how I manipulated her to break up with her boyfriend to make her mine etc.. She told me she was soo sorry, that she made a mistake and I was right about her ex the whole time.

Since I always believe in second chances (not cheating etc) but mistakes, I forgave her, she spent the night at my place. During the weekend she made me feel special again, (lovebombing?) It felt great.. But my gut feeling told me this is going to end really bad. She noticed that I was looking a bit sad when we were cuddling, I told her it was nothing to worry about. But I was thinking this might be a mistake, I am going to get hurt. But she turned around (we were spooning) and hugged and kissed me that she feel so safe in my arms. That worry feeling went away.

Now, it actually started going down hill. Since she wanted to now what was being told about her at work, she wanted to know. I told her that i could do that for her.  Co-workers has said few bad things about her, that shes a psycho, talk too much etc. 
I told her what people said, not WHO said what, but what was said.. But she took it good, she said shes not there anymore, so why care. Then she wanted make amends with my best friend out of all sudden..
I Thought that was great,  Maybe I could tell my best friend that I was seeing her and not hiding it anymore. 

She started getting cold again, more frequently.. I asked her whats wrong etc, but she told me she wants to be alone. Then she tells me that her EX is in a new relationship already! I told her to not stalk her ex on Facebook, it will only make things worse for you, you broke up with him. You are with me now! She got really pissed off at me, told me that I do know how she feels or what shes going through. I told her that I know what she is going through, hell I have been through breakups before too. But in her world I cannot understand her at all. 

This made me ask myself what our relationship or what ever we had is, I confronted her and asked her, what are we, what are we going to be in the future?  She got angry, that she does not want to date anyone right now. I got angry and felt used, I was a rebound, I told her how I felt, she said I was not that at all. But I told her that is what it look like to me. This fight got worse and worse, we started going on personal attacks about past lives. Some stuff that really hurts, she knew exactly what to say to hurt me the most. I told her really bad things too. We did not speak with each other for over a week.  

Since we were going to a after work on a Saturday, we were both going (since this was planned when she worked at my job) so I wanted to solve our issues before we met up with others. But she did not want to. 
I went to the party and told who hosted the party that Me and her had a fight, its going to pretty tense between us and its not you that doing anything wrong. Even told her to keep this for herself. 

Later that party she came,  she was really  beautiful.. but then I struck me she was angry at me.. she said hello to everyone except me, then she sat down next to me.. but after few seconds she told the hostess that she could sit on the floor instead. That she could sit on the cough next to me instead. It was really tense, I did not speak much at all since she came, people noticed something was wrong..  I was looking at her and she was looking at me.. She opened beer after beer.. I wanted to tell her to slow down, but that would probably been opposite effect.. She then opened up a vodka.. I knew I needed to have an eye on her this evening..  

We then proceed to go to the club, where the guard were not letting her in at first, but I told the guard that she will be drinking water only the rest of the night.. She got in, Then a friend order a beer to both me and her.. I told her that is her last beer, then you drink water. She just nodded.. After her beer I got her glass of water, She drank the water really quickly.. then told me she needed to go to restroom.. I said sure..  During the time she was at the restroom a mutual friend told me that he knows everything about me and her, that I should just keep it cool and it will work out, This made me think, she wanted our relationship to be a secret for now, but now a mutual friend knew about us.. I said thanks of course, for the heads up.
But it got me.. shes been talking to him, I was told to not talking to anyone about us, not even my brother.. I kept my word.. (probably stupid thing to do, people do it anyway)

But After 25-30 minutes or so, she had not come back, I texted her where she was, I got a reply that shes on the toilet, vomiting. I told her to get out and I get her home.  She came back to me, gave me a hug and told me that she wants to go home, and I need to help her.  We said goodbye to everyone, We took our things and went our way, she told me she wanted to eat something, I said sure we can go to McDonald's.. While we were walking she kept saying to me, that I can not use her while shes in a condition like this (really drunk), I told her I would never do that to her, and where she even got that idea from..   Well, I paid for the food, we ate, got the cab and drove her home. She ran out from the cab to her door and yelled at me that I should just go home.. I told her to wait so I could pay the driver, Since I lived closed I could just walk from her, I wanted to say goodbye to her.. But she just went inside. I walked home, and told myself at least shes home safe.(This is the last time I've seen her physically)

The next day I texted her asked how she felt, she said had worst hangover ever.. Later that evening she asked me how much money she owe me, I said she did not have to pay me back.

I did weigh myself in, noticed that I've lost 3 kg's on 2 weeks, Which is a good thing(No appetite since our fighting) but my goal is to lose few kgs. I told her this, in a good way, but I forgot the DAMN smiley on the text. 
She took it as it was her fault that I lost few kg's. Then She went on a rampage with everything about us, work, my best friend her EX. 

After days of arguing again and again, I got so fed up with everything and told her That I will Tell my best friend about everything, about us, work. She then told me that she was going to tell him HER side of the story.
I got so angry that I punched a concrete wall, being frustrated, angry, sad and really no control over my own feelings, I am usually calm.. but she triggered me in a way that I really cant recognize myself anymore.

I went to my best friend, told him we needed to talk. I told him everything, about me going behind his back to our CEO, about me and her, what she has written to me (showed him few texts) and she was going to tell her side of the story..
He was scared and conflicted, told me that everything that has happened at work made more sense to him now too. 

Later that evening my best friend told me that she has written her side of the story, blaming everything on me... While my story I took most of the blame, but she was also at fault. So he said he believes my story more, and our stories are nothing a like. I told him, It might be hard for you to be my friend anymore, but he said it might take time for him to gain my trust again. Its fine, for me. 

Also, day after that co-workers and mutual friends started to text me saying that she has been sending our private texts to them, shes manipulating texts (cutting them) and make me look like the biggest douche alive. I confirmed this since someone sent me a picture of what she sent them, I then sent the whole paragraph of what she cut off. 

I then texted her she should stop sharing our private conversations, its between you and me. and KEEP your friends away from our DRAMA, you are just pushing them away from both me and you.  
She told me that I was walking around talking shit about her at work, I told her to fuck off with everything, I do not want anything with you anymore, you have manipulated me and almost destroyed friendships that I had for years.

Shes been sending me Threat texts about making a public statement on Facebook what shes been through, and showing our private conversation and making a police report for not leaving her alone.

Just 3 weeks ago, she sent another one, about the same message, except that she said that 3 other girls has same experience with me, that they had blocked me. Since I do not have social media (Only snapchat) I had no idea what she talked about.

Since I was trying get her a new contract at our workplace, had talking to my boss about these threatening texts, she destroyed her chance of getting back.. She either desperate to make people take her side, to get that acknowledgement that to make her feel good. Or she feels better to be angry than sad over her life situation right now.. 

I even started go to a psychologist, unfortunately at Christmas time, not much time available.. hopefully at the start of the next year!

As a off yesterday, I asked few friends what their New Years plans are, they going to a party.. where I am not invited, since the woman I was seeing is going to be there, and its our mutual friend that is hosting it.So I am pretty much alone for the new year, got no plans at all.  I keep asking what my real friends are? Do i have any?  I've actually talked to my friends about the situation, that I do not want anything with that woman at all. Even though, they know what she has done.. they still keep her in touch, ""Well I do not have that problem with her"" is one of the statements when i asked him why he still friends with her. 

I want friends that are on my side no matter what I've done, right or wrong.. Also I don't blame her for everything here, I know I've told her bad stuff, tried do damage control by talking to people about that she might written to them about our drama that they should just tell her to talk to me instead of them. 

But I feel more lonely than ever after this, few co-workers that she had good connection with has taken distance from me at work, friends that she had written to has also taken a bit of distance.. No one really start to talk to me anyore, unless I engage a conversation first. 

Its like my whole Life has been turned up side down, I am sitting mostly alone now, I planned vacation with that woman, now I am all alone at home for next 2 weeks.. 

Thank you if you read through all the text and sorry for spelling errors and grammar issues, I have never in my (30 years) been through anything like this before. 

Any feedback of what to do after this is really appreciated!

lonely,First post here. It’s very very long so apologies in advance.,"First post here. It’s very very long so apologies in advance. - Holidays can be a drag. The images of happy people hanging out. Friends. Lovers. Families, and I find myself without it. It seems like I’m watching what could be through a window with a limited view. I’m sad. I’m lonely. If I wasn’t I wouldn’t be on this sub I suppose, but idk why. I think it’s because of my lack of companionship, the companionship of another that has evaded me for many many years, but I’m not sure. People I thought were my friends get together without me. People I thought liked me don’t. I’m sick of this shit. It seems life repeats itself. The same mistakes we make will happen again. Whether it be a war or you stepping on someone’s foot. Everything cycles, and cycles continuously, and I’m sick of falling into the cycle. I lay here on my bed, because I’m afraid to sleep. Most of my nights have been spent tossing and turning, with lonesome nights spent after lonesome nights. When I do sleep I dream of a partner. The person is a mystery, but it’s not the person that matters, no. It’s the idea of the person. The idea that someone loves me the way I love them. They say someone’s out there for everyone. I’ve been all over the US and I haven’t found that someone. I find people I think to be the one, to be lead on in some elaborate way, thus falling victim to life’s vicious cycle once more. Much like the Beatles song fixing a hole, I’ve been taking up many different hobbies, I’ve learned the guitar, the bass, the piano, I’ve been painting, and of course playing video games. I try all these things to somehow work through my emotions by conveying it in music or art, but it’s fleeting. It’s not enough, and I’m worried it never will be. I find someone and then what? Would if it still won’t fill the void that’s been made in my heart. I won’t know unless I try it, but how am I to try it if no one is willing to try with me? When I find someone I’m interested in, things go good at first, but I feel like I’m not interesting enough, or that maybe I’m the only one putting in effort. And sometimes it is that way, and when it is, I realize and end things before it goes too far. However when it seems like we both are interested in the other, and things are going good, that’s when things hurt the most. I’m not mad at anyone, I’m sure you understand just as well as I that feelings suck. How can she help it if she doesn’t like me anymore? Feelings are something we cant control, and that makes it all the more frustrating. Who am I to be upset with when nobody is to blame? Myself? I’m still not sure, and like everyone else in the world I’m just trying to find my way. And yet the cycle continues. I have more recently met a girl that has my interest and it would seem I hers. She puts in effort, more than any girl I’ve talked to in a while, and she’s very cute. Like the other girls we hit it off right away, and have been talking for almost a month, but we haven’t hung out, and I don’t want it to die. We hang out at school, but we both know that doesn’t count really. Her friends are my friends and they tell me she likes me. Again though every time I ask if she wants to hang it’s a clouded answer. She says she had nothing going on, so I ask if she wants to hang and she says maybe. We couldn’t link up because of Christmas and she spent time with her family, as did I, so nothing could happen. But when I ask what she’s doing today or later or whatever, I get the same responses. When I see these I think oh she must not be into me, I should back off, but then she says things like “don’t get any weird ideas, I want to hang out but just can’t” which I can understand, so I wait and ask again at a later date, to be met yet again with the same answers. If anyone knows what this means I’d be greatly appreciative, if you could help me out. I’m tired of the cycle. I hope this is the time I can break it. To anyone that read this whopping paragraph I thank you, and wish you a happy holidays. It may get hard sometimes. But stick to it, keep pushing. Even though it might not seem like it at times, I believe there truly is someone out there for everyone. And that means you too. Again thank you for reading"
lonely,Finding peace.,"Finding peace. - Suffering from love can be hard. Being lonely is hard. You have your own mind. You have yourself. The only one who truly understands your feelings is you. Comfort yourself. You are never alone. We are a lot of people in the same place. We love ourselves because we know that if we are not enough for someone, we will always be enough for ourselves. Working on our personality can be hard. Working on our body can be even harder. There is time. Take it easy. You are not alone."
lonely,Online friends and loneliness,"Online friends and loneliness - Many would say getting online friends is easy, which it is. You play a game or two of random squads on Fortnite and you'll find multiple people  that want to play another game with you.
My problem with online friends is that you'll never see them face to face. I used to have a realy close online friend but things went south since I caught feelings and she didn't feel the same. We used to text everyday and since that disapointment I absolutely loathe ""online friends"". I can't bring myself to text or talk to anyone online because I know it will always end in disapointment. It's different in real life. I'm the ""classclown"". I talk to everyone about nothing of importance, just jokes and thoughts I come up with on the spot because making myself laugh is the only way I can cope with my loneliness and I hate when the teacher says "" you are doing this for attention"". Yeah, no I think you are wrong there you garbage scum of a human being, I'm about to pull out an AK on yall motherfuckers and laughing is the only thing keeping me from going on a killing spree.
So stop with conments like: "" oh you're lonely? I'll be your friend"" what the hell do you think will happen huh? I don't want somebody as a friend who feels pitty for me. I don't wanna text all day to a person i'll never see face to face and be able to make plans with. This sucks."

To be fair I'm ""lucky"" this year as I've spend Christmas with my family. A mother with a serious personality disorder and a sister that I don't speak to anymore. My alcoholic father probably spend Christmas alone in a run-down place out of town. I don't have friends. I know a couple guys I could call for drinks, but I don't want to see them. I've been unemployed for a while.  
  
The saddest thing is that even though I didn't have a single pleasant conversation with my family all holidays, it's still better than nothing.

It made me more spontaneous and I found it easier to put my confidence in ""lady luck"" than in myself.

I’m, even tho it might not seem like it lmao, a girl that’s old enough to understand depression, so it’s just not like “weee me very sad” :)

This gonna sound like buhu my life shit, reee feel bad for me but honestly I just wanna get my thoughts out. Since I’ve never ever done it before. I’ve been happy my entire life, never understood why one another should be sad, like what’s the purpose right? Never understood self harm, self hatred, eating disorders, depression, insomnia, just wanting to be alone and suicidal thoughts. And I wish that the young innocent me spoke the truth when she said she would never be one of those. But here I am. My best friend, really were there for me, the only one I’ve had. The second person I’ve said I love. And I truly do, I still do.  Lied to me, and it came to my knowledge. Not only once, many times. This exact thing happened before. 
Idk why but some time during summer I just started feeling, empty? I was mostly sad when walking home from his house, cause he said somth? Honestly idk, idk what made me sad. Somewhere here my eating disorder started. Now, it’s come to eating=severe panic attacks, i hate myself so much, not only my body, I hate everything I say or do or think. I’ve managed to hide the eating thing from my family but my friend know. He doesn’t really seem to bother, which is nice, makes it easier for me. I’ve done some self harm, not much, don’t want scars. I regret it like hell, I feel so dirty and like I crave attention. I think that’s why I don’t speak about my feelings. It feels like my friend is gonna judge me. He has mental issues as well and I’ve helped him for a long time. He says i make him feel better but I think he’s lying. I just can’t seem to trust people even tho I want to. I constantly debate with myself, about everything. Like my life hasn’t been bad, it could be soooo much worse. I know that, and I feel so bad for being sad? Selfish, and I’m constantly feeling guilty. I keep making up excuses to not do stuff with my friend but sometimes I have to anyways and it makes me, extremely anxious and I just want to go home. I’ve always been very very social and outgoing but I just can’t seem to talk to people anymore. I’m the only girl in my class of 40 people and I constantly find myself distancing from my classmates.

lonely,"People will eventually leave, even if you don't want them to.","People will eventually leave, even if you don't want them to. - The reason why I avoid being deeply attach to a person is because someday they will eventually leave and I can't do anything about it. I'm sad today because this is the day that my cousins will go to province and I will be left alone here. It's sad because I really love my cousins so much, they're like brothers and sisters to me so it will hurt so much knowing they'll be going there for good. I will remember all the things that we did and I promise myself that someday, I will go to that place and I will find them."

lonely,I don’t deserve to have friends,"I don’t deserve to have friends - I don’t have anything to offer in a friendship and have zero social skills. I haven’t had even one person I’d actually call a friend. Any time that I even attempt to get close to someone, I can just tell they hate me. Also I have really bad anxiety being around people.

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."
lonely,Happy Holidays,Happy Holidays - I could really use someone to talk to right now. I've spent the whole Christmas sitting in bed with a headache and my mom yelling all day. It's always like this and I hate it. I'd like to vent or just try to get my mind off all this. Any of you get something cool for Christmas?
lonely,People will never treat me how I treat them,"People will never treat me how I treat them - I’m always there for people. I’m always available to comfort someone or listen. Nobody is ever there for me. 

I have one friend who’s been in my life for ten years. I always invite him for holidays, I always ask how he is. He randomly calls me sometimes at like 6am and I get up and open my door (when I say “calls” I mean he is literally at my house, outside already, and he calls and wakes me up and asks if he can come over). I’ve always been there when he needed me. 

He knows how much I love holidays. He knew I’d be alone today, because I told him. Twice. (literally completely alone, I didn’t even get so much as a “merry Christmas” or a hug from anyone today. I’ve been in my room alone all day long, crying) 

I asked him what he was doing. He said he was making dinner, having a pot luck...

No invite. Nothing. 

Why do people treat me like this? Why don’t I matter when I need to matter, but I’m who people go to when they need something? 

Idk. I’m just so tired. I’m so unbearably lonely and it’s too much."
lonely,I’ve never felt this unhappy or lonely on Christmas in my entire life.,"I’ve never felt this unhappy or lonely on Christmas in my entire life. - I wasn’t even excited when I woke up. I got great gifts. I’m thankful for them, but they will never even slightly fill the whole inside me. No object ever will. People say happiness can be achieved without friends. That’s impossible. I can’t just fill my life with nothing but possessions and expect to be happy. I’ve had no friends for the last 3 years of my life. I try to stand but keep falling when every essence of life reminds me how alone I am in this world. I don’t want possessions. I just want a good friend who likes me for who I am, but I’m starting to realize that probably won’t ever happen. Seeing the way my life is heading it probably never will. If things don’t change soon, I’ll probably just give up on life. If I have no one to live for, then I have no reason to live."

lonely,Depressed and lonely and no support.,"Depressed and lonely and no support. - Ive been depressed for over 10yrs. My dad died year before last and that sent me spiraling to rock bottom. My dad was my best friend and if we were born sibling i feel like we wouldve been born twins. So his death really hurt and still does. The worst part of it all is not having anyone other than my therapist to talk to. Everyone around me has close friends or people that they can turn to when theyre feeling sad. I realized today that i have no one to turn to at all. Not even my husband who im considering divorcing in the near future. No one around me understands me nor do they care to understand me. I dont want sympathy i want a friend. Im a great friend to everyone but could they tell me my favorite anything? No they couldnt because they dont care anything about me. They just want me around so they can vent. When im ready to vent all of a sudden everyones busy. I deserve at least one friend. Someone who cares enough to check up on me. Ive been depressed for years and no one knew up until recently when i just couldnt hide it anymore. There are days where i hate being alive but i keep going because im determined to beat depression. Alone or not i wont let it win. Idk what i did to everyone to get treated the way i do. Usually when i meet people they love talking to me and say im soooo funny but when they go out im never invited. Or if i try to make plans with them their busy. Im tired of feeling alone. For the last three weeks ive made serious progress in my depression and no one to talk about it with. The people in my life are not supportive. I get called lazy, told im complaining too much, or told im acting funny. I just feel like im not a likable person and im meant to be alone. Im almost 30 and have no best friend. I only hang out with my siblings. Sometimes i want to go out but realize i dont have anyone to call."
lonely,"Lonely, but I guess I choose it","Lonely, but I guess I choose it - I know this sounds a bit wrong, but at my age I find that being lonely is a relief from so much noise that is in most times just nonsense. As my father would say”foolishness.” Is it wrong to feel this way? Is there anyone else who just likes to be CONTENT? I’m blessed. I have a great job and health, but no friends. As a co-worker stated once, “I guess they are all afraid of you.” That is others I work with who are always carrying on foolishness. I have no time for this so I’m alone. I know there must be some other people who are genuine and just want contentment as I. So if you would like to chat feel free to message me."
lonely,Felt The Same?,"Felt The Same? - A few months ago, my mind wasn’t in a good place.  Things didn’t seem to go well and it just snowballed into something I’m glad I got control of before it escalated further.  However I’m in a much better place now and feel a lot happier.  This was thanks to a few amazing people as well as a change in my mindset.

Before then, things were different.  In my mind, I felt people I knew were barely putting up with me - like they were just being friendly to be polite or out of pity.  I felt I didn’t belong or mattered, I was just someone you bumped into and forget about.  Even if I felt I had a decent conversation with someone, I’d walk away thinking it went horrible.  People I got friendly with, I felt I was a blight on their existence. 

I felt lonely in the sense where I had people to interact with but my friendships with them felt superficial - from my perspective at least.

However, looking back it was just my mind being an idiot.  After self reflection and figuring out my issues, I changed my mindset for the better.  So far it’s worked amazingly.  I’m more willing to talk to people. I feel friendships with people are genuine.  And I generally felt much better as a person after realising I do have people I can turn to.  

I’m not alone."

You’re so handsome” or “You’re so sweet, you’ll make a great husband one day” then I could retire before I turn 30. I always say that I’m focusing on school and never admit how lonely I actually am or how much I would love to meet someone and have a connection with them. For some reason I’m embarrassed that I’m missing out on a basic human need. Like, if I was hungry I would have no problem saying I’m hungry and I could then go out and get something to eat. I wouldn’t suppress that feeling. But I suppress the shit out of the fact that I’m lonely but I don’t know why. Can I anybody else relate to this?

We have met up a few times, ate breakfast together, did some shopping and we plan on getting together soon to go ice skating. This person is one of only a few people I have gotten to know that click so well with me so fast and recently she hasn't been as talkative, leaving messages unread and not necessarily probing for conversation like she was a few days ago. This has really left me feeling a bit lonely and i don't want to continue messaging her with unread messages sitting in her snapchat.

I’ve been wanting to buy myself a pair of Pine Green AJ1s and I’ve really been needing to go to the mall and buy myself some new clothes, jeans and stuff. 
 
But honestly, I don’t see the point in it anymore. I’m not going out anywhere. I don’t have any friends. The only time I leave the house is for work. I really don’t have anyone to show my stuff off to. I don’t have anyone to dress up for. 
 
And it sounds a little unreasonable, but I know a lot of you will say “Well, just buy them for yourself.” It’s honestly kind of pointless. I would just have them in my closet or on a shelf somewhere, and I’d just treat it as a collectible, and I really don’t want to spend $200 on a pair of shoes just to not use them.

lonely,Lonely Together,"Lonely Together - It’s sad to be lonely, but sometimes even sadder to be with someone and to feel completely alone. To feel ignored, to be around someone who is supposed to love you but acts like they can’t be bothered with you. To be invisible unless it has to do with sex, to the point that sex becomes a terrible chore. It’s isolating To be the only one trying during holidays, putting a brave face on for our kids, when inside you’re crying. Sometimes our partners can be Jekyll and Hyde. Amazing sometimes, downright awful others. The roller coasters of ups and downs can really wreak havoc on our self esteem and emotions. Many times I feel like booking a plane ticket to nowhere, where I’ll be alone but feel anything but. I never dreamed of running away until adulthood. Most of the time I can deal with it all and others it’s just too much.

Never done anything sexual like a uber virgin
Never a gf
No college
Lost touch with all friends
Had cancer twice
Mom died of cancer at 9

I just turned 31. I made a pact with myself in my late 20s that if I hadn't had any progress toward career, education, or relationship by 30 I'd kill myself. Spoiler alert I didn't. Ever since I turned 30 my light is gone. My fire for life. My idk essence? Nothing has meaning. I've done the life calculus and it all comes up too temporary to be worth all the work getting to. Also I've missed so much already I cant get back. What I wouldn't give to experience being 16 and in love for the first time. All the stupid overdramatic romanticizing that goes on. My dreams have all died, and I have no energy to find myself again. I'm so terribly lonely. I hug a pillow at night I'm so starved for attention. All my fantasies are about having a deep emotional connection with someone. Masturbating doesn't really accomplish anything anymore. A momentary high followed by a nostalgia that it's not real. Not sure if that's considered NSFW. Sorry if it is. I dont want to die but I'm too worn out to live.

I believe I am quite smart, not looking like a potato, have good sense of humor, making decent money to have everything I need, still the lack of friends and someone close is most of the time really hard.

I dont have any really dark thoughts and I havent gave up, I know what I should be doing, but overthinking is usually preventing me from any action. I am not sure, what is the point of these words, probably just a sharing under the cloak of anonymity.

lonely,I think this is it for me.,"I think this is it for me. - Sorry for the really long post,
I haven’t talked to anyone in years and Ive been in a really bad mood the past few days thinking about what to do, and I just need to vent. 

My whole life I’ve been treated like shit. Wether it was by kids in school or by my family.
My mom gave up rights to me when I was a baby and I lived with my dad and step mom when I was little. I was abused by my step mom and my dad didn’t ever do or say anything about it. She would constantly tell me I was worthless and I will always be a disappointment and slap me and laugh in my face., and many other things. Things eventually ended between my dad and her and we moved in with my grandparents around the end of middle school. I only had two friends in elementary that followed into middle school. Then after moving in with my grandparents and starting at a new middle school in 6th grade, I haven’t had a single friend since. I was bullied for my appearance all through the last year of middle school and all of high school. Not for my weight, I had a growth spurt at the end of middle school, and Ive been the same 5’10 150~lb for the past 10 years. I just had bad acne (I still have some acne but its nowhere near as bad) and everyone would look at me and talk about me like I was a freak. I don’t why, I always showered every day after school, I tried things like proactive, but nothing seemed to work, Ive never been a fan of candy or chocolate, so I don’t know what caused my bad acne. My dad got a new girlfriend when I was a freshman in high school and he got a house with her and her son who was a grade higher than me at the same school. He left me at my grandparents and moved in with her, he told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me.
In school I was always forced into someones group for projects by the teacher because no one wanted to pick me. After school I would just come home and lay in bed and just listen to music, contemplating killing my self, but I was always too much of a coward to ever go through with it. Things didnt last with my dad and his girlfriend and he ended up having to move in with me and my grandparents at the end of my senior year, and he just pretended like everything was normal between us, but to this day I cant look at him without remembering what he said to me. After high school I went to a community college paid for by my grandparents who saved for me to go. I changed from going to campus to taking the courses online after two semesters because it was still the same thing, no one wanted to be my friend or work with me and people still looked at me like I was a freak. I did two years and dropped out, I felt terrible everyday and couldn’t focus on my work. I applied to nearly everything in my town and managed to get a full time job at a grocery store that paid minimum wage ($7.65 in Dallas, TX), and worked there for two years. But I lost my job at the end of 2017 when they let go almost everyone including management and got new management and hired new employees. And at the end of last year my grandparents moved into one of their other houses to get away from my dad and his girlfriend. And Im still stuck in this fucking house with my dad and her, I cant afford to move anywhere, and I haven’t been able to find a job. I have sold almost everything I own and I am down to my last hundred dollars and I don’t know what to do. But its probably for the best. I don’t think I can take another year living like this. I don’t know what to do."

I should be happy right now, with my family, have a girlfriend who loves me and friends I love, but I'm just so fucking numb. I wish I could feel whatever it is I'm supposed to be, I keep getting told that things are going good but every time I try it doesn't feel real. I just want to sleep, I'm sick of being around people and I feel more lonely than ever. Meanwhile I'm surrounded by more people than I actually wish to be around. I'm starting to believe family events are just excuses to be forced to endure long hours of solitude with people you hate and hate you, but I'd be lying if I said I felt anything more than numb with them. So impotent I can barely muster hate, fuck my life."

lonely,I feel like crying this whole week,"I feel like crying this whole week - Everything has been terrible. I always try to improve my life. But my life has always been one step forward, two-step backward.

I've a so called best friend of 1.5 years. I always care for her, go out of my way to be there for her. But she didn't even remember my birthday. I feel if you call someone your best friend, you should at least bother to remember their birthday. When I told her I am upset, she instead blame me and told me I should have reminded her. I thought I should stop going out of my way to do things for her in future, and asked her to move on and forgot what happened. But now she has been total prick. Like never initiating conversations,.. it's messing with my head so much.

Reminded me of my birthday 2 years ago I think. I had invited some friends (they were part of a city whatsapp group) to a party. And two of them were making out while I was standing on my birthday like a loser. I never felt so terrible and wanting to die. It's my birthday and my friends are making out and I am all alone. I literally ran away from my birthday party.

Also few years ago, I met a girl on an app while traveling. Next day her friend also joined her with a guy who she met online. But it was not enough. She also invited one more guy. Now they are 5 of us out in a bar. Now her friend and the guy start kissing each-other and I am looking at them like a loser. I ran away from there.

Also something happened few months ago. I met a girl with plan to go on hiking next morning. We promised that we will do it and made all the plan and were going to our hotels in a different direction. While that time, I saw her talking to some stranger guy while leaving. Fast forward after I packed and waked up early for hiking in the morning, I get a text from her that she went to a party last night and cannot join anymore. So why promise? Why make me wake at 5 in the morning? I just hate it.

Also, I don't understand how that guy approached her. I just can't apprach anyone ever in my life. I wish I had some personality.

Also this week. I am in a beach town for Christmas (see trying to improve my life). But all I see is happy couples in love. I feel so lonely here all the time. I've been trying to do sight-seeing but I feel so miserable and crying looking at the happy couples. I wish I was not all alone. I think I am a decent person if not very good. I care and respect, but nobody even gives me a chance. I feel if given chance, I can show, I am worth keeping. But never. Just walking all alone. 

Also regarding one step forward, two step backward. I am originally from a conservative country. After studying hard and working so much on my career, I managed to find a great job in Europe. But eventually my family forced me to come back. I thought maybe I can be a digital nomad and travel the world, but no, I am forbidden to travel outside my country. So I can travel only within my country.

I am diagnosed with moderate clinica depression and OCD. I don't know about ocd, but my parents are hugely responsible for depression. They never let my skills develop and then blamed for having no social skills. I was not allowed to hangout with my friends in evening, or play outside. My sister who was in my class, would snitch on me all the time. One time I talked to a girl in my class and my sister told them. So they decided to shame me so much and took away internet from me, and forced me to end friendship with a close friend because apparently he was a bad company for me.

It's no wonder I am loser like this who have no social skills esp when it comes to girls. Why would someone like me or want to kiss me. I don't want too much. I just want a decent person in my life who is also my best friend. I swear I will always take care of her and make her a priority and always be there for her. I don't want to walk on beaches alone, I don't want to sleep in bed alone, I don't want to travel alone. I wish I had somebody.

If you want to make fun of me or criticize me, please please stay away. I am feeling so terrible already and crying. I don't want you."

lonely,Truely lonely,"Truely lonely - Hello,

For whoever reads this (probably no one), I am simply writting this to try and understand what is wrong with me. I have no friends, no family, no girlfriend or wife. I am truly alone and by myself. I was never close to my family. As I simply never developed a connection to them. We were never active with extended family and we always did our own things in the house. Although I have 2 older brothers and my parents, I havent talked to them in years. When I did talk to them it was as short as possible so I could retreat back into my hole. My oldest brother molested me when I was six (never told anyone) and is a idiot who could never stay out of legal trouble while being the greatest human on earth, dont believe me, just ask him. He will tell you all about it. My middle brother was nice but I never spoke to him much. My Mother was a religious nut who always tried to force her religious beliefs on me (I am a anti-theist atheist) and we never saw eye to eye. She threw insults and smart ass remarks every moment she could and later disowned me and would call me the child of the devil. She was not a wife to my father and never did anything but suck the life out of everything she could lay her hands on. My Father was the best father anyone could ask for and gave everything he could to everyone. While getting everything sucked out of him from my mother. I never truely deserved my father and I know I must be a disappointment. Although I exceded academically I was bullied throughout elementary, middle, and highschool. It was hard to get friends and any friend I did make was short lived. As they grew and changed while I stayed the same, useless mass while they moved on and grew apart. I could never keep a friend for long. I tried so hard. I gave them space, I always said that we can do whatever they want and I was, often, more then willing to pay and was conscious of my ""needy-nesss"" level. When they asked if it was ok they do something else I always said yes and tried to be as easy going as possible. In my schooling years I was very suicidal and was admitted into the mental hospital multiple times being diagnosed with Severe Depression Disorder, a sleeping disorder, Serve social axiety, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (centered on repetitve thoughts) as far as girls and intimate relationships go I have never had one. I have had a few times when I talked regularly with girls and became close friends (for me anyways). I am a average looking smuch and I never approached them with the idea of intimacy. But there was always a bit of hope. Each of them asked me if it was ok if they see their, now, boyfriends and I always said yes and that as long as they are happy then thats all that matters. They always asked why I have never asked a girl out. The truth is, if I love someone then I should want whats best for them, and deep down I know that isn't me. They always said I was wrong and that I'm a sweet guy that anyone would be happy to be with. But I think it was just to make me feel better. I have only ever kissed and cuddled with  one girl. To my surprise she was the one who ignitiated it and thanked me for the night (we slept holding each other the entire night falling asleep below the stars). She is now dating someone else that she was interested in at the time. Saying that she isn't sure how she feels about me but knows she likes him and wants to try to date him. I have been giving her space the six or so months to try to not complicate her relationship with him and allow her and him more time. I find that I now have stopped contact with everyone and have no one. I don't have friends at work and I have no personal life. I often find myselfing wishing I had someone to share with. Someone to share my time, feelings, and love with. I'm not even talking about intimately. I just want a friend. Although I do dream of once again being able to hold a beautiful girl in my arms again. To feel her breathing and hearing her happy sleepy noises. To feel a kiss again. I woulf just settle fot a buddy. But I don't think that this is in my future... I think that I will forever be alone. Dreaming of friends and love. I am in a successful job and have plenty of money. But with no one to share it with I find little point to do anything but go to work and come home to my computer. I think I need to accept that I will forever be alone...I just need to get to that point.

If you read this then I am sorry for any spelling/grammatical mistakes and my bitching and moaning. Its been 30 hours since I last slept and this was made on my phone.

Thanks,

I have never had many friends though school, I did hang out with and talk to many people when i went to school but i only ever hung out with one friend outside of school and tbh i don't know why. Many people i grew up with where jealous of me and that has caused me a lot of trouble over the years. 

I now have been thinking my one true friend may also be jealous of me and have been the reason why i cannot make any other friends or find a girlfriend. I was at a party recently and i was talking to a girl i previously went to school with, not long after i started talking with her, my friend was tapping me on the shoulder trying to get my attention, calling my name and shoving his phone in my face so he could show me some video he found on Facebook. And only then did it click, he was always doing this to me when i am talking to anyone but him, especially girls. 
Recently i asked a girl to go on a date with me and she agreed, (my friend was there when i asked her) i saw her a few days later and we talked and she still seamed interested in going on a date. Later on I noticed my friend had been messaging her and after that she no longer replied to my messages. I used to trust him so i told him girls i was interested in or talking too and i always noticed if he didn't have them as a friend on social media he would add them after i talked to him. There is lots of little things i have been noticing. I remember when i had a bit of a fall out with a girl i was friends with at school, he sided with her which was fine but he tried to make her hate me more but making up things I supposedly said and then came back to hanging out with me link nothing happened. (I am mutual with this girl again, this happened at the beginning of the year)

Am i crazy or could he be sabotaging my relationships with people?

Anyway now that all that is behind me i am looking to more forward, because i am moving to an entirely new location i will need to meet new friends, the place is located by the sea so maybe i could meet someone there. 
Does anyone know of good places to be able to meet someone?

I work online so i wouldn't be meeting anyone though work.

lonely,Am I selfish to feel so lonely,"Am I selfish to feel so lonely - . I have one really really good friend that I’m super close with. We call and text a lot. In my friend group there’s 6 of us, including him. I was super close with the rest of them in highschool, but since university has started, 2 of them don’t ever talk to me unless I initiate conversation and the other 2 never message me first, so if I don’t message them they’ll never text and ask how I am. I get that they’re busy with university, it took me a really long time to understand that they’re not avoiding me, they’re just busy. Yet I feel so fucking lonely. 

When my really close friend is busy, I feel so alone. I haven’t made any friends in university so I don’t have anyone else who texts me first other than him. I’m so grateful for him, but is it rude of me to wish I had more people in my life? Sometimes it feels like he’s my only friend because I won’t hear from my other friends in weeks. I’ll admit I feel angry at my other friends for being so distant, but I try to push those feelings away. 

Sorry if this sounded messy. But are my feelings valid? I don’t know if I sound selfish to say any of these things. It sounds like a small problem but it makes me so sad all the time."

I've been working at the same place for more than 2 years now, and I really like my coworkers, but I feel like its not the other way around, or at least not to the same extend. That might be because everyone else has a social life besides work and I don't.

I'm in college right now, I've never had problems making friends in primary/middle/ high school, but for some reason I can't seem to make any now. There is a big group project coming up and students can form their own groups, well I guess since we're on this sub you know where I'm going with this, I'll probably end up being the one without a group.

I also find it very hard to believe I will ever be someone's 'special someone' ever.

lonely,Some holiday motivation (maybe),"Some holiday motivation (maybe) - Hey everyone, this is going to be a bit of a personal problem out cry as well as hopefully some comforting for anyone else going through any level of depression this time of year for whatever reason. Hopefully I’m capable of conveying all of that lol. 

So today was an incredibly hard day for me. I’m still getting over a rather heavy break up scenario from months ago, as well as this being the first year I haven’t had my typical friend group in my life. I could get into the details of all of this but I don’t want to lol, so I’ll try to summarize as best as possible. 

The last week or two have really been difficult regarding loneliness for me, but today one of my friends accidentally spiked that by saying that my ex, Alicen, had some shit happen. Upon asking around, I found out her car was totaled in a crash, and that friend later added that she had posted about getting gifts from Danny and Ben (just naming them to keep track).

Both of these details really yanked at my heart. The crash because I still deeply care about her regardless of anything she did to me, and the other being that the gifts bring back many old memories I have with Danny and Ben, being that they are my ex friends. Essentially what happened between us was I was a good friend to Alicen after her and Danny broke up (it’s a really messy story but take my word I didn’t do any wrong, I basically just talked to her after her and Danny broke up), which then prompted Danny to kick me out of his life unless I stated wrongdoing. Ben is just a fuck who does exactly what Danny does. 

Last Christmas the four of us exchanged gifts together and I bought them all copies of Minecraft so we could all play. Roughly two months later is when the friend shit all went down. 

On top of these heartaches being brought to surface, my family also was stressing me out quite a bit making it hard for me to properly think through my emotions. And then we went into a game stop. 

Me and Danny had been friends since kindergarten, and we would often play video games together. Walking into that GameStop after all of that was nearly impossible, yet my sister really wanted to get a switch. I almost broke down crying thinking back to all the times me and Danny had gone into a GameStop to buy cheap co-op or multiplayer games. 

Today was incredibly tough. I feel like I have nobody to really go to to talk about any of this. I feel that I’d give anything to have everything back, even though I know it’d literally drive me to suicide to do that. I miss feeling cared about.

I realize that last paragraph is really dark and scary, but I don’t think I’m alone on this problem. I think there’s probably a lot of people that are like me in this regard, fighting their own battles this holiday season. My hope is that if you read all of this and think you can relate somehow, that you realize you’re not alone either. If you’re feeling comfortable, then maybe comment your own experiences.

I really don’t know how useful this will be to anyone, but at the least, writing a post on reddit has been my go to way to figure out some emotional distress. Message me with absolutely anything you might want to talk about, I love replying to people. And happy holidays to everyone out there who thinks that’s an oxymoron. You aren’t alone."

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

lonely,How to make new friends?,"How to make new friends? - Hi, so I’m 20 and a 3rd year student in university. I realized that I don’t have many friends. I had a boyfriend who I dated for 3 years since our senior year of high school but we broke up in our second year of university. During high school, my boyfriend at the time and I had many mutual friends so that’s how we knew each other and started dating. 3 years later, we broke up because I cheated... which I know was totally my fault. This was in October 2018 when we broke up. I started seeing a new guy in November 2018 and we started dating in January 2019. Throughout the few months and while I was seeing the new guys, things were falling apart with my friends as the story got out about how I cheated on him and almost all my friends from high school took his side. They were also friends with him too. It was weird because I messaged those friends form high school and they would never reply to me or left me on read and never invited me out to anything after. Our friend group that me and my boyfriend at the time (now ex) shared would use to all hang out together. We would do secret Santa, throw parties, go out to eat, celebrate birthdays, go bowling and etc. I didn’t really feel so lonely in the beginning and middle of 2019, but my new boyfriend I had broke up with me in September 2019. So ever since then I’ve been so lonely. I only have one friend I would consider close and she’s the only one that I hang out with. I have made friends from school but the only problem is that they’re just “school” friends and not the type you hang out with outside of school. I’ve tried really hard to make friends this semester but I felt like my personality did not really match other, but I did click with some people. During this Christmas break I texted 3 people and made plans with them but some of them ended up not following through or had something that came up. My close friend I have is the only one that I’ve hung out with so far during Christmas break... 

I feel like it’s easy for me to make friends. I’m a nice person and I am someone that listens to you when you talk. I’m not ugly, I get many compliments from people about my looks. I dont mean to sound cocky or anything but people have told me things like I’m “absolutely gorgeous”, had TONs of men hit on me at the club and at raves and guys have looked back at me twice when walking by. So I don’t think it has anything to do with my looks. But something that I have struggled with throughout my life is confidence. I use to be a very shy person. By very shy I mean in kindergarten other classmates would come up to me and say hi and try to be my friend but I would just ignore them because I was to shy to say something back. I’m 20 right now and I’m a nursing major, so it has really helped me to push me out of conform zone to talk to random patients. I feel I’m comfortable with talking to strangers, but I don’t know how to get started, like I’m not confident enough to go up to someone randomly and start talking to them. 


Could someone maybe help me out? I feel like I’m introverted by nature but people tell me that I’m very friendly. I enjoy going to raves and would love to have a group of friends who are girls to plan trips to Vegas with and go out on the weekends :( 

I was thinking of joining a sorority in my first year of uni, but I realized it was too much commitment and I didn’t have the time with schedule in school."

Regarding the topic here, i'm a 20yo male and i don't have a great social circle, it's actually nonexistent  and i think this is happening because I feel in some way superior to other people. I perfectly know that i'm not superior to anybody but that is the excuse i have in my head to avoid social interaction with the people i think don't have anything related to me, they just bore me. This includes coworkers, family and even one very good friend i had in my chillhood, I saw him some days ago and just don't wanna hang out with him, lol.

I really would like to have someone to chat and stuff but is kinda hard to find it.

My point is that probably i'm very selective with my friendships and that's normal but damn, sometimes you just wanna talk and don't have anyone..."
lonely,Feel Like My Life Is Over at 37,"Feel Like My Life Is Over at 37 - Yet another Christmas alone... come to think of it, I have never had an adult Christmas spent with someone I love.  I was raised in a religion that didn't celebrate Holidays, then I was foolish enough to spend most of my 20s in a toxic relationship with a married woman.  I was content to just feel some sort of love... and therefore never sought the real thing from a woman that I could actually be with.  So I spent all of my holidays alone... while she was enjoying life with her real family.  

Surprisingly to noone at all, that relationship failed when I was 28... and I fell into a deep depression, realizing I had wasted all of my 20s, when I could have been out with friends, meeting women and potential future wives, enjoying my life.  This depression gripped me even harder as the economy forced me to lose my very well paying job, and therefore the house I owned.  By the time I was 30, I had nothing.  I started gaining tons of weight... replacing the comfort of love and materialism, with food.  

This just made it even harder to leave the house, as I was so self conscious about my weight.  On a few occassions I even hid behind ladders and grocery isles when I spotted someone ""I used to know"" in public.  I was afraid for them to see how much of a failure my life had become.  This lead to more eating, and more depression... I went to work and came home.  Things that people take for granted... going to the movies, out to dinner, over to a friends house, a concert, camping... had all completely ceased, for years.  I lost all of my friends.

My drastic weight gain became a passive way to kill myself... knowing full well, as I hit 600 pounds at age 35, that my life would soon come to an end if I didn't make changes.  I came to grips with this, as I shoveled more tear soaked food into my mouth.

Health problems, that are surprisingly not related to my weight, took me out of work at 35.  I went on disability.  Though the health problems were not related to the weight, my weight did make recovering nearly impossible.  I have slowly become weaker, and more fatigued as these few jobless years have gone by.  At 37 I spend most of my day sleeping, getting out of bed for a few hours to kill time playing a few video games, and eating.  I haven't had sexual contact with a female in over 10 years now.  I have lost a little bit of weight, but nothing even remotely close to taking me out of the risk range for cardiac arrest before I hit 40.  At my size, losing even 100lbs still leaves you weighing 3x the normal person's weight.

Christmas roles around... in my quiet one bedroom apartment, I sit here watching youtube videos, thinking about all of those friends I left behind, somewhere off with their families, laughing, drinking, looking after their kids, and appreciating each other.  I have noone to call, noone to visit... I will receive no presents tomorrow.  Hell, i don't even know if I will wake up tomorrow.  My family all lives in far away states, and I have been distant from them physically and emotionally for far too long to think I will even talk to them over these holidays.

Every Christmas that goes by, I think to myself... ""Another lonely season.  Maybe next year will be different."" Yet, it never is.  I have no wife, no kids, and no self worth.  I remember the energetic, social, and rather attractive youth I used to be... and when I see myself in the mirror, at 540lbs, balding, alone, and aging... I can't help but think my life is over, at only 37.  I'm sorry if this brings anyone else down... this is seemingly my only way of having ""someone"" to talk to on this lonely Christmas Eve."
lonely,First post! Merry Christmas Eve (vent),"First post! Merry Christmas Eve (vent) - Recent lurker, and first time poster! Just wanted to get my feelings out somewhere. 

I've spent a couple of days with my family, as I am home for the holidays. Home for the holidays, I have been trying to shove the Christmas spirit down my throat. I've been baking for the past week, cleaning, reading, writing, watching Christmas movies, putting Christmas music on as much as I can. Healthy distractions. I have so much to be blessed about, so much to be grateful about. I graduated debt-free from undergrad in May, I start medical school in July, my parents just moved into a beautiful home, I survived my first real adult job during my gap year, and my extended family is healthy and well. I am able-bodied, financially stable, have parents who love me, and plenty of friends to spend the holidays with. I had a holiday gathering just the other day filled with laughter and hot chocolate with some of my close friends. I watched one of my favorite Christmas movies with my best friend last night, staying up and staring at a Yule log till late. I just finished a Christmas Eve dinner with my family tonight. 

But I feel so incredibly empty. Fighting chronic depression for 7 years now with so much therapy, feeling alone during the holidays seems almost inevitable. It's where the loneliness is highlighted and all of your insecurities are brought to the surface. Everything that you did wrong, everything that you have to be ashamed about is illuminated to tell you that you are not worthy of love or anything good. 

I crave the touch of somebody who isn't a relative, who isn't my best friend, who aren't my high school friends, or my college study group. I crave the safety of the relationship I lost, the security of a future of my own choosing that now seems so structured that I can't deviate from it. I didn't think I'd be swiping left and right on Tinder on Christmas Eve, listening to ""Blue Christmas"", and writing my heart out on Reddit. 

This is my 4th glass of wine, and I want to cry but the tears aren't coming. 

Happy Holidays."

For example, breaks at work are starting to feel like hell if none of my buddies are around, and I've been wandering off looking for a place to hide recently instead of sitting alone in the break room. Tomorrow is most likely going to be similar; being surrounded by family members that don't interact with me often. Wouldn't call myself shy, but it is really hard to just go up to a stranger and start a conversation. 

The feelings of loneliness have been confusing. Part of me really wants to be with even just one person, but the other part thinks being alone is for the best. I'm not boyfriend material  (emotionally unavailable, don't particularly want to commit to anyone, not the most empathetic), I'm a pretty bad friend all things considered, and I have long-standing trust issues that make it hard to introduce new people to my circle. Reaching out to existing friends for company makes me feel like a burden and meeting brand new people feels almost impossible. Not really sure how to move forward."

Even if I had family to spend it with, I think I'd still feel alone."

I'm 18, got out of a multiyear relationship a few months ago and have been feeling pretty lonely ever since, in all areas of my life. When I do hang out with my friends from high school I feel like they've all gotten so much closer without me, and I just feel awkward and out of place in the group. College is pretty lonely as well, and I feel like it's pretty hard to connect with people there; everyone is so busy too (myself included) so it's hard to find time to hang out. Ever since getting out of my last relationship I've jumped into a friend with benefits type relationship, as well my first one-night stand with someone, which at first made me feel really great and confident. Now I just feel so unwanted and unattractive, I feel like I'm nobody's first choice. Even when I'm with my family I feel like an imposter and that I wasn't meant to be born."

lonely,Happy holidays fellow lonelies,"Happy holidays fellow lonelies - I know it is not being truly lonely because I have supportive friends and I live with my parents but I still feel lonely. I think it is mostly because I don't have (and never had) a romantic relationship but I might be wrong. I just never had a kiss and even though I have been in love I always have been ""refused"". Sometimes (well actually once) I feel I have some chances but then I blew them up and just go back to zero.
I don't get why I am so unsuccessful and this is probably what pisses me off the most. I get it I am not the best looking of all but I am ok, I'm pretty funny and intelligent I have a lot of hobbies and I am interested in almost everything so I just feel different and alone.
Sorry if it is hard to read but it is not my native language and I am a little tired.

I was doing so well since school got out a couple weeks ago, and now I’m really feeling the seasonal loneliness. It’s hitting hard and it almost doesn’t feel fair.

This past semester I was so active in my school. I was on the board of an organization, went to many club meetings, parties, etc., and met some cool peeps. But it doesn’t seem that any of that is paying off because here I am alone for New Years’ while my friends and such are out there enjoying themselves with their families and friends.

Everyone has moved back to their home with their childhood friends, and I can’t help but feel hopeless that I’ll never have that mainly because I didn’t have that in high school.

Can anyone else relate? I just don’t know why I have to feel like this and go through this."
lonely,I am becoming a caricature of myself,"I am becoming a caricature of myself - Christmas Eve, almost 12am: while most people are out there having dinner with their loved ones, sharing presents and knowing they are loved, I have had to basically sneak out of my house to take a walk while smoking.

I am a bloody meme: r/doomers or r/depressionmemes material: simply another fun man that you see on the internet, think he has a sad but kinda relatable story, and forget about once you reach the next post about how a puppy chases their tail.

I am a caricature of myself: I simply am a living stereotype, and nobody seems to realise while I am too stupid to tell anyone.

My best friends ever won't probably even desire me a merry Christmas nor will they remember me unless I send them a message first: I am always the forgettable one, the shy and silent one, the one who ""doesn't need anyone"", but I can't seem to believe it with the same strength the people around me are convinced of it.

I wish I was to get mugged: I could be able to have a non protocolarian conversation with someone, at least.

I am surrounded by people (including family and friends), yet I'm so alone my plans for one of the most comfy nights of the year is sitting in a bench lurking into Reddit posts: and I'm not even alone there. It's not even something so strange: I am but another one, another sad man who creates a sad post and is forgotten between the thousands and thousands of posts here. I am not a human being, I am a living stereotype, a meme, a caricature, and I hate it."
lonely,Feeling so lonely,"Feeling so lonely - I feel so lonely tonight. 

My partner broke up with me 6 months ago, ending a 5-year relationship. Yesterday, I got a pretty bad performance review at work and I think there is a real chance I'll lose my job. 

I can't help but think about where I was a year ago, celebrating Christmas in a warm and cozy setting with my partner. Everything was good at work. 

And one year later, I'm sad and feeling so much pain when thinking about the break up and how much I miss being in a loving relationship. I'm going on dates but nothing seems to be growing into a real connection. I don't understand why. 

I don't know how to make things better at work. I'm terrified of the prospect of losing my job. 

And to numb the pain, I'm doing the only thing I can - I eat. I stuff myself until it hurts in my stomach and the emotional pain goes away. 

I'm a big fan of self-growth, of taking a crisis and turning it into an opportunity. That is what I've been making the effort to do in the last 6 months. But today, something snapped in me and I cried while walking in the street, watching people around me laughing and holding hands and looking like they belong here. 

I feel so lonely. I'm trying to make friends, going to social events where I don't know anyone and talking to people. I've definitely made lots of acquaintances. But I can't seem to move past that to creating meaningful relationships. And I'm starting to think that maybe there is something wrong with me. I've always thought of myself and nice and kind and likable. But people don't want me as their friend, so that has to say something about me, right? And romantic relationships - I'm really eager to move on, I'm ready. But I just haven't met someone who is interested in me while I'm interested in them. It's always one or the other. And I don't get. I sit here, writing this, on my bed. Surrounded by a pile of clean clothes that I haven't put in the closet and empty wraps of chips and chocolate. Crying. Because it hurts to be so lonely and I don't understand why it is the way it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I'm writing this. Just feels nice to put my feelings into words, just like thousands of people did before me."

lonely,Heartbreak and Anxiety Attacks,"Heartbreak and Anxiety Attacks - Imagine what it must be like for one of your own parents to be with you when such an attack happens...and in a public place.

My dad and I went to H-E-B to buy some stuff for a Christmas barbecue family get-together tomorrow.  Well, as I was pushing the shopping cart, I saw somebody that I had a crush on that has never given me a chance, 15 years ago and just last month.  Well, this reaction manifested into a full-blown anxiety attack.  I don't know if this is silly or not, but my dad was there to observe the whole thing.  He described me as somebody constantly looking over his shoulder, playing keep away from a mortal enemy.  Due to my disorder, I have a tendency to treat anybody I am not in good terms with as a mortal enemy, or at least my responses fall along those lines.

This is not the first time I've overtly averted someone who's hurt me in my search for a girlfriend, and responded to the sight of her as I would a mortal enemy, but this is the first time my own flesh and blood has observed this of me.  It hurt me to hear him say that it was a silly sight for him, forgetting that I was diagnosed with a disorder.

This is why I don't like having crushes; when I see them after the fact, my fight or flight responses are just so out of whack."

lonely,This uneasy feeling,"This uneasy feeling - I was trying really hard these days to be happy, to feel good with myself. Normally people would say I only look calm. But in the inside I'm burning myself down.
Today I feel this pain right in my chest (I've been in the medic less than a month ago, so it isn't something medical) it feels like something isn't there or an uneasy feeling that something is wrong. Idk I only want to cry. But I don't want my family to know. So I'll wait until bedtime."
lonely,Why I am lonely,"Why I am lonely - I live alone in a foreign country. I am admittedly an introvert; in the period of my life where the cows were fat and happy I still NEEDED to be alone after hanging out with my one best friend for a whole day.

I like the idea of living abroad and independence, and while I miss my family I think I'd be sad and disappointed in myself if I went back. Regardless that doesn't mean I don't feel alone.

It also doesn't help that it being Norway the locals are difficult to socialize with.

Moving on, another reason is that I am gay and I had several negative experiences with girls when I was a kid. I still don't feel comfortable getting close to girls emotionally, so that means most of my friends are guys. This sucks. The gay ones make it all about sex, which doesn't alleviate my loneliness, and the straight ones clearly have a harder time vibing with you, which is understandable.
Additionally this makes it harder for me to feel comfortable around my family or just being myself in some contexts.

Finally, I guess I'm just a bit choosy. Sometimes I just don't wanna meet people that I'm sure are completely fine human specimens, just because I don't ""feel"" it. I know it's dumb, but I really ""felt"" it with my best friend (who has unfortunately long ago moved away) and it has made me rely on it sometimes to make the decision.
And I simply would rather be alone and lonely sometimes than force myself to hang out with people that aren't my cup of coffee. I know some people may surprise you, but I suppose I would be unable to conceal my awkwardness, or that it'd be more of a draining effort than just being alone.

I write this because it helps me recognize my faults and the things that are not my fault but still block me from having a healthy social life, and because I hope some people might make it feel better by relating to it, and maybe sharing some advice or experiences."
lonely,Starting to feel unbearable,"Starting to feel unbearable - Hi and merry Christmas to the people that will read this.

Is there even an option not to feel lonely on Christmas? At least I don't know it. 
Normally I'm pretty good at bottling up everything or just push it back down but today it just feels crushing. 

My family isn't a really family, they spent time together on holidays because I could be the last one with all the relatives there. The girl I recently started seeing isn't really affectionate and of course as a guy you can't ask for more because that is what drives women away...

I have a suizidale and another quite uninterested friend who only talks of he needs someone. I can't remember the time someone asked me how I'm doing or wanted to know something of my life, granted it's not very interesting right now but the studying has to be done.

Anyway the only thing I really hope for this Christmas  is that many people don't feel that way because its sucks sitting underneath a Christmas tree by yourself and cry silently just hoping it will end."

I just finished my first semester, and it’s the Christmas break. I have Aspergers so it’s always been hard for me but I am starting to see counselling to help me now. 

I have never really used actual social media, but I’d like to because it’s a good way of keeping in contact with people without having to directly text them. I have a bunch of acquaintances as “friends” on facebook but I never really post anything there and I don’t really like the platform. 

I kinda made one friend this semester, and it’s a but complicated cause I originally tried to date her, but she did not see it as a date, and long story short, I didn’t really know what I was doing and we agreed to just be friends. Other than that we got along well and share a bunch of interests. Were both kinda introverted and shy so I’m sympathetic towards her for that. 

Anyway, she uses Snapchat, and posts on there a bit, so I friended her on that. I’d like to post on there but I feel odd with only with her as a friend, and I also just always generally worry that “nobody cares what I’m doing or have to say”. I like the app and how it works. The fact that images only last for 24 hours is nice imo, and I feel like it is more private and personal.

I also kinda made another friend after who shared classes with me. We also studied together and ate dinner before our last exam. He kinda posts on instagram which I also have but have never posted on and don’t like as much. He does not use Snapchat as far as I’m aware.

So I dunno what to do. Should I just post without worrying about it? Should I ask my other friend if he uses snapchat, and maybe even suggest him to make an account if he doesn’t? I dunno, I just feel"

lonely,"Lonely, or not?","Lonely, or not? - Hey, I feel like I need to post something somewhere. Sorry for my english, it is my second language.

It's christmas now, and first time in many many years, I am alone. I broke up with my girlfriend half year ago and it's the past now, but loneliness doesn't go away, or I am somehow lost. I have my family and I am respecting them, but there's something more. There is something on my heart but I don't know what. There's a hole that need to be filled.

I have a job, money, hobbies (gym, guitar, frisbeegolf. Thinking to start some martial artists), own apartment, friends. I am probably going to study again at next spring. I have some goals. I could have more friends. I don't have many friends and at this point it is not easy to get them.

I am introvert, but very very human-centric. I like to chat with people, but I am really bad at small talking. Conversations are not easy to begin unless I am doing it on internet. Or being drunk. But alcohol is not really a part of my life anymore.

I felt so long time that I will never get a crush again, because I don't want to hurt myself again. I have some bad dating experience in the past. Then I meet this girl on internet. She's basicly everything I want, so many same thoughts and values of life, music taste, etc.. And she's beautiful. We were in same school 14 years ago, it's crazy. I am 28 year old now btw. We met once and I am having a little crush. Just a little, like taking a step back now. Date didn't go that well because I was so nervous, she felt it. But she said she wanna see me again, if I agree too. But she's being busy now (she has 7 year old kid and 3-shift work, etc..). Meanwhile we can keep chatting. Well, haven't heard from her for 2, almost 3 days now. Feel like shes ghosting. This situation is making things worse right now so wanted to share it.

Anyway, after 28 years I thought that I am satisfied with myself, but no. But I am not exactly sure where I am lost. I want to find inner peace and **be happy alone**. First of all I need something new, but will it fix things? Should I talk to someone?

It's like, I just wrote something, but theres really nothing to catch, I just felt that I need to write."

I literally have to sleep through New Years to get through the loneliness. I’m glad college is coming up and I’ll have an excuse to not got come home for a long time.
And do you know how depressing it is to like stuff like anime and videogames when you’re lonely? I do... It just depresses me that I even care about this stuff when I was single for all this time, why should I even care about some dumb lore or character relationships when I’m lonely, I’m ugly as shit and therefore I’d have a hard time talking to anyone let alone being loved I just cry sometimes... because I’m afraid all of my life was for nothing and that nobody will ever love me. 
Every day is starts fine but the waves of fear and depression wash over me, I just wanna be good enough for someone I just want somebody to hug me and tell me that I’m okay, I just wanna be right for someone I just wanna feel wanted, but my face is like a curse, it makes me paranoid like nobody will ever be able to get past it I just want someone to hold my hand and say “see, we can be happy too.” You know? 

And now here I am coming into the worst season for this stuff, New Years Christmas and Valentines Day back to back and all I’ll see are commercials with loving couples and a bunch of  “my girlfriend made/ bought me this” posts. It all just feels like it’s mocking me, it’s why I could never have sympathy for people who look better than me, they don’t have to be alone. I’ve worked so hard just to be average and I’m still a 4/10 to most people, it’s crushing and the only time I get 5’s is when Someone goes through my post history lies to me because they think I’m on suicide watch or something.

I Can’t give myself value I don’t even want value I just want that warm wholesome shit, I know it’ll never be perfect but The bad shit would be worth the good stuff"

lonely,"I feel soo alone ever since i stopped talking to this girl, and i just can't get her off my mind","I feel soo alone ever since i stopped talking to this girl, and i just can't get her off my mind - when I (m/19) got my license I used to go a lot through Mcdonalds drive-thru because i like food. There was this girl working and i started seeing her more often there. at a certain time she started joking with me(without us ever having an actual conversation) because i was there so often. after that we started to talk whenever we saw each other and also through text and i didn't thought anything of it. Allthough she was the prettiest girl i've ever seen, i didn't try hitting on her cuz i liked talking to her and didn't want that to stop if i would ruin things by said hitting on her. after some time passed i caught myself catching feelings for her, and after like 2-3 months i told my friend that i had a crush on this girl. she happened to know the girl because of her brother who used to be in the same class as her in high school. another time has passed and i'm still crushing very hard on this girl. My friend, who's an idiot btw, went to her at the mcdonalds and started talking to her about boys and stuff. my friend is a girl who i met at work, so they easily talked about boys. my friend wanted to figure out is she had an boyfriend and what she looked for in a guy. she told her that she was single and that she wants someone who genuinly wants to spend time with her no matter where they are. liking sitting at home all day in pjs and just talking chilling and stuff. which is also what i want so i thought that it was great. after the convo my friend had with this girl she asked for her number cuz she had to tell her something important. she gave it to my friend. my friend later proceeded to text her that a guy was crushing on her. after some texts with her she wanted to know who it was and she told her that it was me. without me knowing anything about this thing going on. after she knew it was me she apparently didn't respond for a day or two. after she finally responded she told my friend that it was impossible for us to be together because of the age gap. She is 25 btw(i know, too old for me but what can i do, i just fell in love).

after this girl told my friend this, my idiot friend got my phone and started texting her through my phone. saying stuff like give me a chance you're like an angel when you smile, it's like everything else just fades away and some more cheesy stuff. even though i actually felt that way about her smile and stuff i was pissed that she sent her this. i thought that it was all over. i knew that we wouldn't be together because of the age gap and i had made peace with it, because after all i was talking to her almost daily. during this period i had a lot going on. school was very hard and at home i was always very stressed. but whenever i saw this girl and i heard her voice, i just forgot everything like it just faded away. she made me feel so calm and kind of happy. and after these text messages i thought that i would lose all these convorsations with her, and lose also this calm feeling. which i indeed lost. everytime i saw her since it was very awkward and we didn't talk at all.

after a month of this all happening i texted her saying something just wasn't right, and that i couldn't get my mind off her. i was hoping that she would say something like i don't like you in that way or you're just a friend of mine instead of just hearing the age gap. but thats just all she tells me. our age gap is too big. i know that, and it kind of breaks me inside thinking that if we would be the same age that it could work out between us. i even asked her if that we would be the same age that it maybe could turn into something, but she didn't gave me an answer. i know that she doesn't like me that way but still i needed to hear it from her, so that i could come peace with it if that tv any sense. she went on to say that she would just keep talking to me the way before she knew that i was crushin onher, but i knew that wouldn't happen again. 4 months has passed now since her finding out and this freakin girl is still on my mind most times of the day. i just wanna talk to her again like we used to, but i know that we will probarly never go back to that so i have to get her off my mind. but i have no clue how. 

I feel lonely ever since this happened and i know i have other friends and family who care about me and love me but i just can't help but feeling alone. Something about her made just happy by hearing her say hello. And now it's all gone and i don't know what to do anymore.

I hope you all have a great Christmas!

As for me, well, I feel really strange, and lonely.

I'm not physically lonely (I live in a house with my Mum, Sister, and there will be lots of Family coming over for Christmas to 'celebrate' it). But I feel completely disconnected with reality.

I've always been an introverted person, but I think I convinced myself (subconsciously) a while back that I was a BIG introvert. This means I've essentially hibernated socially for the last few years, which means my friends and other companions have been forming new friendships and broadening their horizons in life, whereas I haven't, and I've sort of fallen out of sync in life (it feels like it anyway).

When they ask me what 'plans' I have for Christmas and New Years Eve, I have to lie and come up with something vaguely interesting, because ""I'm doing nothing"" is just sad, and maybe lying to them makes me feel better as I'm setting up a fantasy in my own head.

I'm trying pretty hard to enjoy the festive period, even though it often feels forced, and I'm often caught daydreaming or drifting off mentally by my Mum who will often be looking at me and asking ""Is everything ok? You seem a bit down"". Well she's right, but I know she is unable to help me, as the things I need to do to improve my life can only come from within myself.

Anyway, this was a bit of an aimless ramble I'm afraid. So you get a gold star if you had the patience to read all of this.

Best of luck in the new year!"

I've dated without success. My two brothers and all my male cousins, even the younger ones have girlfriends and im just always alone. When we have family gatherings they all walk in with their beautiful girls and I think how nice that must be to have. It's like I've been left behind in the whole equation of life, go to sleep alone, wake up alone, spend the fucking day alone. In the back of my mind I think, ill probably meet someone eventually, I'll be fine, but that never happens, even with the unpredictability of life and all the people on this planet, the odds should be in my favor, yet, it never happens. I see it just happens for other people though and the years are passing me by and I've just kind of accepted it.

One month later he moved away to start his 5 year PhD program 5 hours away, so I knew we definitely would never progress to a relationship (he considered us “friends”). So this week he texts me (after I drunk texted a week prior admitting I missed him) and says he’s going to be in town for one night, and of course I quickly accept hanging out with him. We had an amazing dinner date followed by drinks at a bar where we kissed and went back to my place. I know he probably took advantage of the situation, but now
I can’t help but have even stronger feelings for him. I haven’t felt anything romantic towards someone in over a year and I’m sad it’s with someone I can’t really be with, and I feel if I expressed that he would freak out. He’s doing a PhD far away and I’m doing grad school soon somewhere else. Part of me knows he just wanted sex out of me and now I’m sad and alone again.

I’m 19 years old, not attractive, lonely &amp; shy. 
I go to a community college near my house &amp; it is hard to make new friends because everyone pretty much leaves right after their class ends.

I was slowly regaining confidence, but we all got into a big fight &amp; I’ve had no friends since then. 
Sure, I’ve made friends on the internet to chat with or whatever- but it’s really not the same as being able to go out &amp; hang out with people in real life.

Yet I’ve never been asked out by a guy. When I turned 30 I decided not to follow the advice of love will find you when you’re not looking and asked men out myself......the answer has always been no. I then started online dating but the few men who matched me only insulted my looks and then blocked me.

lonely,Just Found Out My Friend From High-School Is Engaged,"Just Found Out My Friend From High-School Is Engaged - It’s been a couple years since I’ve seen this girl from my highschool, we were really good friends and I was definitely smitten with her even though I never told her that.

We’ve kept in touch a little since graduating but we don’t live near each other anymore so it’s hard. I recently found out from social media that she is engaged obviously this is great for her and I hope she’s happy but it’s also giving me a really weird cocktale of emotions I’m having trouble processing.

On the one hand of course I’m jealous, even if we did start seeing each other again on a regular basis I’d never have the courage to ask her out and I don’t think she would be interested anyway but I can’t help but feel sad anyway.

Also we’re not that old. I’m not judging her morally for getting married a few years after high school, but it’s viscerally upsetting to see someone your age grow up so fast. I still feel like a kid in most ways.

And finally it’s just a very isolating feeling, I have lost touch with basically all of my friends except her, but now it somehow feels like I’ve lost her too, not be because she has a partner (she had a boyfriend in high school) but because she’s grown up. Which is not a bad thing for her at all, but for me it feels like that since we’re at two completely different stages in our lives I’ve lost my only real friend. Which is ridiculous because we haven’t seen in each other in person for a few years but the mixture of romantic jealousy and temporal shock is just making me feel super isolated. I’m not really in the position to make new friends where I am at right now and I have been having family issues so I feel super lonely and depressed.

Hi guys,

I’m a 19 year old boy from The Netherlands and this is the first time I’ve actually created an account and posted something on Reddit, so let’s see how it goes

This year I got diagnosed with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). It started off with simple mood swings but quickly grew to become a disorder that would determine most of the actions in my own life. It felt as if my mind was seperated into two different entities, with the “bad” one taking most of the control.  I began to push friends and family away, began abusing substances such as weed, alcohol and cigarettes, and have unsafe sex. I quit school and started an 8 to 5 job, and moved back in with my dad (he lived in another city during the weekdays, because it was closer to his work, so essentially I still lived alone) This period in my life was the most alone and scared I had ever felt. I lost all my friends. Pushed my family away when they tried to get close. The worst part of it was, I was aware. I was totally aware my life was spiraling out of control because of my own actions yet there was nothing I could do about it

However, 2019 has also been the year where I got to meet the most special person in my life. Amidst all the chaos, I had the pleasure of meeting Myself. The only constant in my life, the one that has seen everything I have seen, cried with me, laughed with me. This may sound weird to some, but meeting myself has been the reason I was finally able to tell this “other entity” no. Enough is enough. This is my life, and I’m going to live it the way I want to. Ofcourse this didn’t immediately fix all of my problems, but at least it gave me a base from where to start. I finally have the will and power to face my problems, and started working on resolving them

For every person who is going through the same or is feeling alone during this time of the year, please hang in there. Please feel free to send me a message any time, I’d love talk, or just casually chat, whatever you want :) I would love to help you in any way I can"

My mother is struggling with money which kills me because I can’t work. I can’t work because I’m so dumb that I can’t get a work permit from my school. I go out with my school friends and as much as I love them, they make me so happy, I began feeling so lonely. I compare myself to them and one of them ,being my best friend, makes me sad by being around them. They make me sad because I still have feelings for them, even though it’s been a year since I told her how I felt. I tried to move on but everyday I hang out with her, I see how amazing she is and just let my feelings grow. When I see her with her long distance boyfriend, I make myself feel so shitty. I should be happy for her, but I can’t help but wish that she loved me instead. Then I make myself feel bad because I feel like a shitty friend.

I fire up Warframe, fart around with my mods for a little bit, then turn it back off. I open a book, but I cant care about it and close it back within minutes. I scroll one loop through Netflix and then the tv off. I type out my 100th Reddit sadpost of the day and (usually) delete it. 

I just want a hug. I want someone rub my head and tell me that everything is ok the way she used to. To hold my hand and tell me “Bobby, you’re not stupid. You deserve to be loved.” To fall asleep on my chest and say that I make them feel safe. I want to have someone really listen to me and feel like I can let out all of the worst things that I keep bottled inside. Will I ever be able to do that again? Will I ever be able to trust someone like I used to trust her? It was all fake before. Why should I believe it the next time. 

But right now I don’t care if it’s true. I want to be lied to. 

I just want a hug."

It crazy she’s the closest I have ever been to someone. I love her so much but what can you do. I will never be able to tell her. I’ll have to live with these feelings til I die. It going to be difficult because of all the anxiety. I guess I’m a terrible person for having these feelings. I hate myself so much.

At least for a little - I’m just here because I’ve been very sad and very lonely but I met someone. I don’t know how much he’s into me, but he spent the night the and it just felt good. It felt so damn good to have someone to lay beside and to hold onto even though I was actually shaking the whole night because of my anxiety. We didn’t even have sex but we did sleep together. And that’s all I really wanted. Someone to squeeze me as I trembled from a lack of physical touch for so long and anxiety that never lets me rest. I’m just hoping I can get more nights like this with him in the future. Everything ends, pleasure is temporary, and I’ve almost always been lonely and afraid. But I have some hope now.

lonely,Just a general post about being hit hard with heavy feelings of loneliness,"Just a general post about being hit hard with heavy feelings of loneliness - I expect this to get lost in the shuffle, and I’m sure I’ll feel better when I wake up in the morning. But damn man, this sucks. I just wish I had someone. I’ve been single my whole life. Sure I’m only 20 but still. I’ve yet to have any sort of intimate connection with anyone, in any way. And I honestly crave it. I just have all this affection sitting around, waiting to give it to someone. 

On the positive side of things, I did ask someone out for the first time a month ago. And at first I got a yes, which made me feel incredible. But the next morning it became a ‘im not looking for anything more then friends’. Which sucks yeah, but I was ok with it. But even then, we only hung out once, and it was with someone else. Not that it wasn’t a good time or anything. I was just really proud of myself to finally do something like that, and it sucked to have the joy sucked out from it.

So yeah, I’m back to the drawing board. Hopefully thinking I might find something on a dating app. Hoping that I might run into someone that I end up liking enough to ask out, and then hoping things go well after that. 

But until then, I got nothing. And yeah I know things will happen eventually, things take time, all that Jazz. It’s nothing I haven’t already heard. And I’m not asking for dating advice either. I’ve gotten enough of that as it is, and it’s all the same at this point. 

So yeah, I don’t expect much of a response, just wanted to type out some thoughts I guess. I’m sure this is all over the place but whatever. And again, I’ll probably be better tomorrow, but I’m just in the moment."

lonely,Finally met someone great. It suddenly fell apart days before holiday plans together. Now I'm going to spend the next week alone and sad.,"Finally met someone great. It suddenly fell apart days before holiday plans together. Now I'm going to spend the next week alone and sad. - Semi-long distance relationship of only a few months. Everything was going amazingly. I was supposed to be driving to visit him now. Instead, he very suddenly developed what seems to be severe bipolar mania. After the initial crisis a couple weeks ago, things seemed ok and he saw some doctors but refused medication. Suddenly a few days ago it happened again. 

In the last couple days, he's gone off the deep end, alienating his friends and family, and getting banned from businesses left and right, and engaging in dangerous behaviors driven by paranoia and delusion (heard about this from his mom who's absolutely bewildered, as are all his close friends). I spoke with him once on the phone and he was mean and aggressive without any logical flow. Any attempts at even gently suggesting seeing a doctor have been met with rage. 

I feel terrible for him and have been doing my best to be supportive and calm when talking to him or his mom, but inside I'm falling apart. I'm not sure if I'm even in a relationship anymore-- out of nowhere he sent me a bunch of very mean and insulting texts which I chose to ignore and tried not to take personally. Now I can't get ahold of him.

Aside from being physically nauseous with worry for his well being, I feel incredibly lonely. Needless to say I'm not traveling to his town, and now I'm alone for the holidays. I live in a city thousands of miles from my family, who I'm pretty much estranged from, and my few friends are traveling or visiting their families out of state. The last couple days I've tried to keep busy, but mostly I just lay in bed crying. I'm not working until January, and I'm dreading a week plus of having nothing to do."

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

lonely,A message from your father...,"A message from your father... - Maybe we've lost touch, maybe I was there physically and absent emotionally. Maybe I had too much of my own pain to give you the love and support you needed. Maybe I never gave you the space to speak your truth without feeling judged and unloved.

Truthfully and intentionally, I am sorry! I have always loved you and always will. I am sorry my love looked like judgement, condemnation and cruel.

I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression of what true uncondirional love looks and feels like. This is on me entirely! 

You my dear child were a gift to be cherished and celebrated because of everything you are and everything you do.

When you spilt the milk, scratched my new car or snuck out at night to meet you love. These were also gifts for me to lovingly share just how scared I was because of the overwhelming love I felt for you. So much love that I cried myself to sleep at times hoping I wouldn't mess you up too badly.

I accept I have made mistakes, some small and some huge and everyone felt like a betrayal to you. I am sorry with all of my heart.

Sometimes, as ridiculous as it sounds, we parents feel like we have failed you, when we see you doing something that may cause you pain. Even though your choices may be the best thing for you.

Your first love, I scared off so they wouldn't break your heart. When you came out as LGBTQ and all I could think about was fear. Fear of the prejudices you would hear. Fear of the insecurities that may come up.

However, Any of these situations, if they came up would have been a lot easier to handle, if you knew to your bones that Dad loved you and was proud of you and that you could call anytime for us to share a good cry. So I could tell you it would be alright because it always will be again.

I am sorry I didn't give you exactly what you needed  when you needed it.

Know today and always and especially during the holidays and times of happiness, time of concern and absolute fear that this Dad loves you with every ounce of my being.

You are perfectly, imperfect just as you were meant to be. I couldn't love you anymore. I think of you every day and hope you love yourself completely. Thank you for completing my life.

I'm sending you the biggest, warmest, and longest Dad hugs you will ever know.

lonely,I need friends.,"I need friends. - Hi. I am 23/f. I managed to push all of my friends out of my life but my very best friend by the time I got out of high school (self-fulfilling proficiency of losing all of my high school friends). My best friend and I were really like sisters and she even moved in with me briefly at one point. I had a serious boyfriend at the time, my first one (we were together 5 years total) and we all know how easy it can be to get wrapped up in them and them alone. But I never let that happen, I was always conscious of her and always made sure she never felt left out of my life or pushed aside. After high school (2014), my best friend and I grew apart a little bit, due to us both having serious boyfriends. Obviously I expected this. But over the years we just grew more and more distant, and not for my lack of trying. I should mention we only live 30 mins for eachother. That's when it started to feel like she didnt really care about me anymore. My boyfriend and I broke up in 2016, and that's when I just felt so lost. I didnt have any friends, my boyfriend, or even my best friend, whom of which I never imagined our relationship would change so drastically. We still talk sometimes, but at this point she's really just more of an acquaintance with the title of best friend, because she's the only one I ""have"". I have felt so lonely ever since. My next serious relationship began in 2017. We love eachother very much and we are still currently dating. But it still doesn't tame the loneliness because I still have no friends. While he is amazing and we're super close, it still sucks to not have anyone to talk to but your boyfriend. Now, I can't even really talk to him because he just left for Marine boot camp. I have family, but they're not really the type I can talk to about anything or reveal much of my true self too. I love them so much but they can be extremely judgemental. I just feel extremely lonely and isolated right now, and quite frankly like I might go insane lol. 

Anyway, I dont know what my point of writing this really was. I guess I honestly just needed someone or something to vent to. And maybe people to talk to. 

Also, I'm here to lend an ear to anyone else who might be feeling lonely. Merry Christmas!"

lonely,Does anyone around my age from the UK want a socially anxious 19 year old,"Does anyone around my age from the UK want a socially anxious 19 year old - Even when I make an effort to connect with people they are disinterested. I am not the best option or even a good option. The cycle is self fulfilling. I am alone so I am unused to being around others my age, which causes people to prioritose others because I am not good with people.

What people either do not understand or do not care about is that I want someone to listen, and that in turn I would listen back. That is what a friend is. Someone to talk to without fear of prejudice and in turn someone who would talk back, expecting no prejudice. That is what I think I could give.

I have been alone for about 6 years now. I am in my first year of university, studying computer science. I like being outside and want someone to walk with through the forest I live in. I have walked through the surrounding area a lot by myself.  months from turning 20 and my teenage years have been wasted and hollowed. I need someone but no one is there.

Really I am just looking for anyone else I could reasonably get to, aged either 18 or 19, that I could spend some time with for the remainder of my last year a teenager. As much as I know there is no physical process that occurs upon turning 20, the loss of these years is very significant to me. There is time for me to recover it yet, but based on the evidence provided so far, it looks unlikely that will happen.

If you come across this post in months time, I am still amost certainly looking. So pm me.

I will likely post this again."

lonely,I don't know what to do.,"I don't know what to do. - Hey fellow lonely hearts, 

I have never ever posted something like this and don't even know how to start, but I just wanna come clean with myself. 

The last 2 years have been really hard for me. I'm usually a very social person, I have a lot of friends and never felt quite lonely until the point I met someone very special. Whilst being on Vacation I met the girl of my dreams 3 days before my flight home. I never would have even approached her, because I thought that I was way out of her league. However, it was she who told me that she really liked me. We spent the last 3 days together. It was like something out of a movie. Watching sunsets, kissing whilst doing so... it was like a dream &amp; I never experienced anything quite like this before. Those 3 days went by so quickly, but are still, to this day the best 3 days of my life. Unfortunately, I live in Germany and she lives in Spain. I had 2 relationships before, but I think this was the first time I was actually really in love with someone. I confessed to her &amp; she said she loved me, too. I was really flattered but didn't know what to do. After my flight home, we tried to keep contact up, but because of the distance and the wealth-state of her and my family we weren't really able to afford a meeting + I was in the middle of my A-levels then. The contact kind of broke down, after she told me, that ""she wasn't really ready for such kind of a relationship"", but also told me that she really ""loved me"". I haven't spoken to her in over 1 year. I had 1 relationship and plenty of dates until now because I hate being alone, but somehow I start comparing everyone to her. Not any of those dates &amp; not even the relationship felt like love for me. I sometimes wasn't even able to make love, because there was that feeling inside of me telling me that this is wrong and not even the person I actually love. No one matched her and I think my body just tried to fight the loneliness or try to cope with the loss of hers. I know you are not supposed to look at what happened, but I just can't. It's also very hard to express this feeling it makes me feel lonely when I'm home alone, even tho I have plenty of friends and being socially active. I know it sounds very childish and like some 14-year-olds love story, but I'm actually 20 now and this is still something I'm trying to figure out within myself. I can not stop thinking about her even tho I know it's only gonna f'ck me up.  I think I will never be able to find anyone like her and I hate myself for letting her go so easily. 

I'm here to seek help from those who might have experienced similar things. How do I handle this? How can I find someone who matches my expectations? Why do I feel so lonely, even tho I am not?"

It was difficult and I was scared. I wasn't sure how they were gonna take it, but I figured fuck it, I might as well try and be open about things with them.

And all I got, was an ""okay.""

It really got me thinking because I don't have close friends right now but maybe someone I know needs someone. I decided to reach out to friends/acquaintances that may also be lonely to send them some Christmas cheer and to let them know if they need someone to vent to during the holidays they could talk to me. As someone who tries so hard to make other people comfortable that I fail to make close connections I thought that would be something kind. I really hope that anyone would reply that genuinely wants to talk. But I'll probably just get a couple of basic ""Merry Christmas"" replies and be just as lonely as always. At least it may be a temporary distraction."
lonely,Holidays right....,"Holidays right.... - Last  3 year's the holidays hit me really hard, I hate going to people's houses and seeing their happy families and all the Christmas cheer. And then I feel bad because they're good people and done nothing but try to include me in Holiday. Try to remind myself that I'm blessed and that there's a lot of people out there that have less than me, but the end of the day when you're sitting, watching the four walls.. It not much comfort.. I can't wait for Christmas to be over."

I have weeks where I get depressed because I don’t have someone to snuggle with or talk to irl. My interests are so obscure and I want my partner to like the things I like too. I just really think my standards are too high. It doesn’t help that it’s common for people with antisocial behavior or conduct problems like me are said to have trouble keeping relationships.

Recently, my 'girl' admitted to me that she is acting as my girlfriend for the sake of my happiness and was scared to admit that I would be sad again. I told her I am fully happy (and I love her truly from the bottom of my heart) and she replied a casual, ""Yay!"". 

Next day, I saw pictures of her and her new boyfriend (a lot quicker than I thought it would be) and I'm actually not too sad about lying to her about being happy. At least I gave space for her true love... Well, if you truly love someone who has done so much for you regardless if the intentions weren't the ones you expected, you'd do everything for them.

I actually do not know what to do anymore. I haven't necessarily talked to anyone because I don't have anymore friends other than her who needs to be with her true love.

I say females because I do already have a solid group of guy friends from my other online hobbies so sorry. I just recently discovered the world of reddit and I am 100% hooked. Sooo much information, and sooo many groups for anything of interest. You can kind of say that I am hooked. A little about me. I am a attached (married) Asian male, 27 (is that mid 20s, or late 20s? I dont even know LOL), 5'10"" descently attractive but can use more time at the gym, sweet, caring, and high energy when it comes to conversation. I would say I am an extreme oddball extrovert because I LOVE people, but i easily get deterred because of my lack of confidence does not allow me to easily make friends out of the blue unless they are online. Ive always been that way ever since I was growing up. Talking to people online or over text was so much easier than chatting in person. Probably because I am absolutely horrible at thinking of things on the fly. So texting allows me to think about my words before I say them I guess?  ok. back to me. I work in the great garden state of New Jersey as a project manager for a nice consulting company. Its a standard 8-4 easy going white collared office job with descent pay and lots of room to keep climbing the ladder. I love what I do but sometimes I feel like I overgive and overcommit to crazy deadlines. I like to take a lot of mental breaks throughout my day so I would go on twitter, IG or fb, and now recently mostly reddit to take mental breaks. On days that I don't have crazy projects to do, I can respond alot on discord or kik. I have been told recently but a couple of reddit friends that I am veryyyy chatty. Some find it endearing, and others will find it borderline annoying. Please, be warned. If you send me a message or text, ill probably get back to you within a minute if I see it. Because I am such a high need extrovert but dont have alot of outlets, I guess I am looking for some female friends for all definitions of ""friendship"". You can be cool, down to earth, flirty, bossy, I dont really mind, but I am still a guy right, so I do prefer the flirtier types. I am super flirty myself. As I noted earlier, I am married. I love my wife dearly but shes a super introvert and has previously restricted in our early dating days from talking to ladies. But now we are married so she trusts that I can be a good boy :) She's wasn't wrong to do so but you can only starve an animal so long before they go on a rampage right? I do have permission to take it in a little bit at a time. Just a little about me regarding interests, I recently have been obsessed with making cash via reselling sneakers and earning credit card points for traveling. I also watch a ton of subbed anime (black clover, fairy tail, Holy Grail Wars, and many many more) and play COD and LoL. I am well rounded because I do have a sporty side too with a little bit of laccrosse, basketball, and even going to the range to practice my aim. Oh, I also LOVEEE food of any culture. I can be boujee and eat a Wagyu or have a date night with a 4 for $4 at Wendy's :D . Harmless fun is suggested and just enough to satiate my hunger for attention would be appreciated. If you have made it this far into reading, thank you. I hope I still have your attention and we can chat. East Coast girls are better for the timezone but anywhere in the US is fine too :). I have kik but discord works 100% better for me. If my long winded post interests you, please send a DM and I will surely respond in a timely , probably 5 min, fashion :) Have a great weekend everyone and thank you for reading."

I can't just get people to stick with me. My friendships don't last more than 2-3 years. Ok obviously I have never been in a relationship as well even though I'm 21. Forget that, I've never even kissed someone yet!

I'm not bragging in anyway but tbh everything else in my life is pretty sorted.

This turns to rambling half way through I sorry. 

Me (19M) and my ex broke up roughly four months ago but had a messy time after that. I really didn’t want to break up with her but she didn’t really leave me a choice. My mental health was rapidly declining to suicidal depression and after going to therapy I was convinced I needed to do it out of self preservation. I wanted to get back with her (and still do) even though her behavior and actions have been deemed cruel and abusive by one of our mutual friends. There’s a lot I could go into but I’m just really lonely. I miss being cared about, it’s not something I really ever had a strong feeling of throughout my life and for about six months I felt truly safe and loved. I really miss that and I’d do anything to have that back even though she practically put me in suicide therapy. I don’t know if I’m that ducking stupid for that or if I love her that much or even if there’s something wrong I did to deserve it all and if so can I fix it.

I kinda felt dirty after it, like I gave in too easily. He hasn’t responded to any messages I’ve sent him either so that makes me feel like crap, he hardly responded in the first place anyway. I don’t have anyone to tell this to really, my family doesn’t exactly believe in gay rights either because they think it’s a choice and I can’t tell them and something doesn’t feel right telling anyone else.

To find a girl that I absolutely love being around and loving everything about them, it seems impossible.

 I went from working a job I thought I had future at to meeting my fiance there and then bam...I wound up pregnant and the amazing relationship I thought I had with my fiance just seems to be gone....he has his problems and I have mine and we are trying to fix them while raising our 1 year old...but I can't express in words how much it feels one sided for me...it feels like I'm doing everything and I get nothing in return. Not a nice date, a day off, a break, flowers, etc. 

It feels like no matter what I do to keep our relationship alive it only wears me out in the end. I've been cheated on twice, hurt, used and abused etc. I don't want to sound cliche here. I just don't know what to do anymore...I love him with all my heart but as I lie here in bed next to him, I'm afraid of what the future holds if there even is a future for us at all. I feel like he proposed because he felt pressured into asking me earlier than he wanted because we found out I was pregnant....(and yes he actually said these words to me).

lonely,I fell apart again,"I fell apart again - It seems like every time I try and piece myself back together that the stress of loneliness crushes me and I'm left back in a broken state. No matter what i try to do to keep myself together it doesn't matter because in the end i can't handle being alone and I crack under the pressure of my loneliness. Everybody in my life has seemingly moved on to bigger and better things while I can't seem to break free from This dark hole I've backs myself into, no matter how many times I've tried I just can't seem to do it."

 I went from working a job I thought I had future at to meeting my fiance there and then bam...I wound up pregnant and the amazing relationship I thought I had with my fiance just seems to be gone....he has his problems and I have mine and we are trying to fix them while raising our 1 year old...but I can't express in words how much it feels one sided for me...it feels like I'm doing everything and I get nothing in return. Not a nice date, a day off, a break, flowers, etc. 

It feels like no matter what I do to keep our relationship alive it only wears me out in the end. I've been cheated on twice, hurt, used and abused etc. I don't want to sound cliche here. I just don't know what to do anymore...I love him with all my heart but as I lie here in bed next to him, I'm afraid of what the future holds if there even is a future for us at all. I feel like he proposed because he felt pressured into asking me earlier than he wanted because we found out I was pregnant....(and yes he actually said these words to me). 

I don't know how to truly feel.

I love her I love everything about her. The way she smiles, the way she laughs, the shy ways that she'll say hi to me in between classes. Every thing about is just wonderful even the slightest compliment from her makes me feel wonderful. I love her so much but I know she doesn't feel the same way. I've asked her out three times, I got no,no,maybe and like a week after the maybe she started telling her friends that she might be I've tried to move on but there's just something about her."

I’m depressed, and don’t see the point in getting up. I used to have hobbies such as writing and 3d animation but I guess I just can’t be bothered. I play video games sometimes but I’ve kinda got bored of that a bit. I’m going to see therapy for the first time in my life in a couple days but I don’t know if it’ll help or what to expect. And my Dad is rushing to leave as soon as it’s over, so we can go spend Christmas at our parents place, which I am not looking forward to. Not because they are bad people or anything, I just don’t enjoy it, and I guess I feel bad for that. 

I really do honestly love school, I enjoy my subjects, it keeps me busy, I talk to people. As soon as my last exam ended, I just felt a deep depression, as I realized I had nothing to keep me going and look forward to. I had a crush on a girl during school and I tried dating her a bit but it did not really go anywhere. Just that though, kinda kept me going and gave me motivation, which is kinda pathetic I guess. We’re kinda still friends, we did get along well, and we do share a lot of interests but we won’t share another class next semester, and shes leaving for the holidays. Were friends on snapchat, so I kinda see and sometimes respond to her posts but I don’t post myself. I sorta made another friend to and we got along well and studied during the end of the semester but he’s also leaving for the holidays, and I don’t know how to keep the relationship going. I really don’t want to go through all that effort again just for all my relationships to fade away again next semester, so I hope I can build these ones I have, because we do share connections. 

I’d like to get out and be outgoing over the holidays, and meet more people my age (I’m a 17 old male) but I dunno were to go or what to do. Maybe I just need some motivation to do my hobbies again or something."

So I plan my funeral instead.

I plan what venue it’ll be at, the food that will be served, the music that will be played, and there will be a slideshow of places I’ve been in my life. I hope men and the women who tear me to pieces for my lack of experience will hate me less when I’m dead and think, hey she wasn’t so bad."

I’ve felt lonely for sometime and my friends invited to go somewhere and when I met with them, I had a smile that made me feel so, calm and just free from this loneliness I’ve had. It’s  kind of hard to explain but it made me feel so good like it was a breathe of fresh air. I wanted to know if anyone else does this normally or did I feel so alone that something as simple as a invite to just hang out made me feel so confident and happy for myself?"

lonely,"Somewhere, Someone","Somewhere, Someone - At some point in your life you may feel lonely and it may looks like the world turned its back around you. The people that you cared the most will hurt you, your one and only happiness will become your greatest nightmare and it may seems like you have nothing but yourself. But believe me, it will all end. I know somewhere, someone out there deeply cares about you and they're just too shy to let you know. I know you will eventually found someone in your life that will never intentionally hurt you and will never leave you. I believe that someday you can finally go home, you can finally be at the place where you truly belong. I want you to keep on fighting because it was all worth it when you finally found your home. Somewhere, someone will eventually found you and will never let you get lost again."

I haven’t had a group or even a person to hang out with let alone have fun with for a long time, and social media just reminds me of this fact. Anyway, one of my “friends” constantly ghosts me every time I message him. Every weekend I may send him just one text and he literally never fucking responds. NEVER. I want to die just thinking about it. Why can’t I be happy like them? I don’t have the confidence to even make friends and my self esteem is non existent."
lonely,The Frustration of Loneliness,"The Frustration of Loneliness - It's sad to lead such a young life, in my case there are 22 of them, and to see other people having fun and talking as if nothing happened and to have such a basic human relationship, I don't know if I'm a very complicated person or the same people and so the same human relationships are, I'm quite confused about the concept of friendship, I think that loneliness makes us commit impulsive acts and maybe not know how to relate to other people, it is something very practical but it seems so difficult and unmotivating to think that you achieved something that for you is a tremendous achievement and then realize that it is not so.

I know that friendships come with time and for the same reason you have to give time to time but I am tired of being alone, I have been this way for many years and licking my own wounds for so long it hurts to feel that the truth is of no real importance and we don't matter, maybe in this need to have someone we make mistakes, someone else feels things like this?

Have a great day."

lonely,"If you're feeling alone, lonely please read this! 💖💕","If you're feeling alone, lonely please read this! 💖💕 - Boundaries. Boundaries are the biggest enemy of a human being. Boundaries where people trick your mind into limiting yourself to boundaries where people cross to humiliate you, make you feel in a certain way crossing the limits of a human being's humanity and morals disgracing the core values of humanity sending a person into a state of Anxiety and Depression. This has been the case with me and every person who goes through anxiety and Depression.

The human brain is not predictable so isn't it's thinking, but one thing can surely be said that most people can easily get into people's words and get discouraged easily, after all words cut sharper than knives inside the brain if taken to seriously and again that's something that happened with me too. A human forgets his/her true self and dwells into the discouraging thoughts these cruel people give rise to inside the brain through their hurtful, disgraceful and awful actions and the words they say to hurt people and they succeed when a person gives up and goes into his/her dark corners pulling himself away from the reality lost somewhere in the lost ruins of his/her mind. 

The thing here is, we tend to give up more easily and more often when easily persuaded and discouraged by people who like hurting people and make for their very own entertainment and jealousy of not wanting to see you excel in your life.

This inturn lowers a person's self confidence and in turn gives birth to to a state or depression and what arises in his/her brain through the change in their confidence and courage thereafter is known as ""ANXIETY"" which which comes in the way of everything, could come in many ways either through breakdowns, sudden heart beat rising out of increased fear due to lack of confidence when infront of a huge crowd or among people or sudden shivering, body turning cold and trembling and lowers his/her strength. 

This happened with me again.

In the end there's one thing a person should think and pull themselves back before it's too late. That what these people says and what the world wants you to be can't decide your way of living life or finding happiness and can't change your thinking, strengths and can't affect your aims because in the end you are like phoenix rising from your very own ashes everytime they try to burn you down because it's never too late even when you are cornered, all alone or even if it's you vs the world where you are all alone so be it and do whatever it takes and stand back on your feet rising up above and fighting it all for the world to witness your rise while these people remain where they are and realize in the end that hadn't they wasted their time into disgracing and pulling you down they'd have been somewhere better where you are and their shame, jealousy and regrets will be their end while you succeed.

Just chime in with your strengths and be that courageous master of your own life as you stand by giving your haters no attention what they want and those people coming in your way a gaze that will lower their confidence not yours because you don't deserve the anxiety and depression they want you to have . Nobody does. Find that one little thing that pulls you back in with more confidence and bounce back into this life that is precious and long enough to learn from and to grew into a stronger and better person.

I just did that. I found that one thing in my brain that arose in this darkest time, that one thing that I had that was going to revive me and that was my humor that was birthed in my brain during this darkest time when i had to find it and it made me feel happy and I felt as long as it makes me happy it's great and I don't care bout the rest when they come to pull me down they'll get a greater share of my actions. That's when I realized all of this what i talked to you about right now about depression and anxiety and stopped caring about what they said or did and if they ever came in my way I always give them that evil smirk and that gaze that lowers their confidence and an unending humorous take on them that makes lose their confidence and give up, declare me to be a mad person, mentally unstable or something else but deep down they now know that they cannot defeat me and that's where I have succeeded in driving them away from my life even when they get in my way through my strength, courage, unending faith in myself and this new found self.

You just gotta be strong. In the end you will succeed. All the very best for your life! And I'm always here to talk if you want to! :)

lonely,I over share on social media,"I over share on social media - I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, ocd, and an eating disorder for a long time. I’m also extremely lonely. I live 1500 miles away from my entire family (including extended family), and haven’t really made close friends in my new city. I’ve struggled with loneliness long before I moved to a new state, however. Lately that and depression have been the main themes of my life. One way I’ve always dealt with this is over-sharing on social media. I think It’s just an intense craving for connection and for someone to relate to what I’m going through. In the past I’ve shared about my mental health in detail, struggles I was going through at the time, and certain things that were bothering me. For some reason it’s easier to word vomit all over social media than it is to ask someone close to me if I can talk to them. Maybe it’s because I’m not expecting a response with social media, and I’m not forcing someone to listen to my problems and have something to say back to me. Instead, people can just scroll through my post and ignore it if they want. In the past, posting like this was somewhat empowering for me. I got to get emotions off my chest, and the posts were always well received. Lately however, when I get the urge to post and go through with it, I get extremely anxious and feel physically sick 10 minutes after posting. Thinking about how many people know deep things about me makes me super uneasy. I think this started when someone from work used a post about my anxiety against me. Anyway, I always end up deleting the posts.  Now that this outlet is gone, I feel like everything is building up inside me and I’ve been feeling really tense, negative, and sad. It makes me feel 100x more lonely. I just don’t want to be “that girl” anymore. These people don’t deserve to know me so intimately. At the same time, I love when I see personal posts on social media from other people. I just don’t know what to do anymore. My loneliness is amplified, and I don’t have a remedy."
lonely,Please talk to me,Please talk to me - I’m all alone
lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."
lonely,Looonelyyyyyy~ 🙃(19f),"Looonelyyyyyy~ 🙃(19f) - I've been typing out my feelings for years now and I'm getting tired of it but here we go again ig. For a while there I got to experience what it's like to have someone want to talk to me and it felt so good. To think someone found talking to me enjoyable! It was just texts so idk if they'd still want to talk to me irl (I'm less fun in person) but I will cherish the feeling nevertheless. I'm pathetic :( someone please love me. Having low self esteem and crappy social skills really sucks. I have 2 close friends who, without them, idek where I'd be but they have lives too and can't be dealing with my bs all the time. When will anybody love me? (As I am 19f ik I'm being dramatic. Let me live, I still have a few months to blame it on teenage hormones right lol.) The day someone just wants to sit beside me coz they like my company I'm gonna burst into tears. It's not easy being not fun ya know. Can someone come into my life who wants to grab a coffee with me? Go ice skating. Watch a movie. Bake. Origami. Anything. I'll do anything. Please just show yourself stranger. A friend. A boyfriend. Anything at this point :("
lonely,the days blend into each other,"the days blend into each other - I guess this is just a rant because I have no friends to complain to. I started my first semester of college and was excited because my many different therapists ever since 6th grade have told me that I will “find my people” in college. I haven’t. On top of this, I just recently moved and go to community college so there are no dorms or parties. I am not even socially awkward or ugly and but I just feel like someone people use to pass the time with in a moment. I don’t feel truly important in anyones life. I’m a background character in everyones life and every time I try and ask someone if they want to hang out nobody ever wants to. 
Fuck. I didn’t even realize Christmas was in 2 days because the days are all the same. My boyfriend is the only person who loves me and he left for the military a few weeks ago and all I do is lay in my bed with the white noise from my fan and try and pass the hours."
lonely,Feeling depressed and lonely.,"Feeling depressed and lonely. - I would make a long, in depth post about how deeply lonely and depressed I am. It’s worse some times than others but some nights like this it hits me even more how alone I am. I’m 20 and still not allowed to date because i “have to be ready for marriage”. It’s a long story but nonetheless I just have such a deep craving for companionship. A yearning for touch. It’s like I can’t breathe... I don’t know what to do."
lonely,Would it be cool if there were designated public spaces for just socializing with new people?,"Would it be cool if there were designated public spaces for just socializing with new people? - It seems to be the norm where people go to cafes or places on university campuses to simply go on their phone, buy coffee and leave, or meet up with friends they already knew prior. I feel that it can be kind of tricky to talk to a new person sometimes, maybe you could more easily in a lineup or something but otherwise people seem to keep to themselves? 

I'm trying to think of ways to implement this idea that people would be open to and would be easily implemented and actually used by people. How could we advertise this to places and where? Starbucks? In my head it's like, ""corner where you meet new people"", which I see happening. Do you think there'd be any safety implications? 

I'm pretty sure that the British government is dealing with loneliness formally as a public health challenge and I think that's brilliant, open, and caring.  

Please let me know what you think of the idea and anything you'd think to contribute as well!"

a little bit about my journey and myself if you would like to read (and maybe relate)

so i () have been struggling with loneliness for the best part of 6 years now. it started when i was 12 and everyone was going to discos and liking boys and i just wasn’t into that. 
eventually secondary school (high school) came around and it was worse, year on year i jumped to any group that would take me which eventually landed me in a group that i was bullied in. 
summer of this year was the worst time in my life, i was completely isolated, i felt like i couldn’t even talk to my family as they wouldn’t or didn’t understand and often thought of death. 
but after 3 months of preparing myself to ask i finally asked my mam could i go to therapy where i got diagnosed with anxiety and social anxiety. i now go every 2 weeks and while the whole friends thing is still a work in progress i am finally building my life up again and slowly building relationships 

once again, if anyone would like to talk, my dms are open !"

lonely,My BF wont finish me off EVER. I feel so lonely and unloved in this relationship,"My BF wont finish me off EVER. I feel so lonely and unloved in this relationship - Im feeling really down right now and writing this out is making it worse but here we go. 

So my bf[M23] and i[F22] have been together for 2 &amp;1/2 years. We have sex pretty regularly sometimes everyday sometimes a few times a week it really depends. Anyways almost every single time we have sex he orgasms but almost every time we have sex i dont. I spoke to him about this multiple times telling him to put more effort in to finish me off too but i just feel like he doesn’t really care. Today after he orgasmed he asked if there was any way he could make me cum so i asked him to give me oral he gave a negative response and the whole convo was just upsetting. He basically told me that because his dick had been inside me he didnt like the idea or doing it but he would try but he probably wouldn’t like it basically some bullshit like that. Anyways this made me feel like absolute shit almost every single time he’s about to orgasm i let him cum in my mouth and keep sucking until he’s completely finished, now for him to say that to me has really made me think and now i don’t really want to be intimate anymore. I feel like im disgusting i feel unloved i feel like i have to beg him to pleasure me and do things  to me. I always have to ask him for sex he rarely ever makes an effort anymore and while were having sex im the one always doing the moving no matter what position. I have alot more stamina but that doesn’t mean i should have to be the one moving every fucking time. He’ll just stop moving or go soft and that makes me feel insecure af. I love him so much but this shit is really getting to me like i do whatever you want sexually but you wont even give me oral without complaining about it for 10 minutes straight first like what the fuck man. Im feeling so insecure i have to work so hard to even get him hard sometimes but hes never ever ever willing to put the same effort in EVER. Seriously i need some advice."
lonely,25 and I've never had a boyfriend. How would you men feel if you learned that about a girl you're interested in ?,"25 and I've never had a boyfriend. How would you men feel if you learned that about a girl you're interested in ? - I've always ruined every potential relationships I could have been in because of my trust/commitment/self confidence issues. Which results in me never experiencing what it's like to have a boyfriend and I'm ashamed of it.

How would you feel ? Would you find it weird/""not attractive"", have pity for her... ?"

It used to be something I looked forward to but now it just feels like any other day. I guess it’s the first year where I’m just not feeling anything much.

I’m not sure if this is just me or maybe something going on."

lonely,Harsh truth,"Harsh truth - To be blunt,  women that are attractive (and my view of that is relatively broad), open to relationships, nerdy, and  chatty are non-existent.  They are quickly snatched up and its frustrating."
lonely,I feel like I don’t belong anywhere and it’s making me feel more depressed,"I feel like I don’t belong anywhere and it’s making me feel more depressed - This is really hard for me to come to terms with and even talk about. I have been getting depressive/suicidal thoughts because of events happening more recently. I never have felt a part of a group or activity, or even had my own consistent thing. Ever since I was younger, i was never a part of anything for more than a year or so and my family could never keep up with the same thing. They would let me try out different things but never would continue them. I used to be a part of Girl Scouts for a few years and that stopped, I tried different sports like soccer and ice hockey and that stopped, we used to go ice skating with our family friends every Sunday and that stopped. Some of my favorite things stopped and I never got to form hobbies other than playing Pokémon on my Gameboy and DS for most of my childhood but even that stopped.  My family has been described as extremely scattered by people I know which is kind of hurtful because I never really thought of them that way but it’s true. We never know what to do and when we do something, if that fails, we move onto the next thing almost instantly. None of our relatives talk to us. I have a few aunts and uncles on each side with older cousins and I never see them anymore or throughout most of my adolescence childhood. I never felt like I had my own “clan”. Even my own family does separate things in the same household so we never really connect as a whole and have things we like to do together other than shopping and go out for food but we are becoming broke so they don’t want to do that as often anymore which I can understand. My family friends don’t talk to me that much as friends anymore which makes me really sad because I was raised with them and I will reach out to try to talk and most of the time they won’t respond. Throughout high school I never had a set group of friends. Each year I would have a different pair of people and they would stop talking to me the next year. I thought I made some good friends my senior year but even then most of them except for one stopped talking to me and even blocked me without explanation. I’ve been to college for 2 years and last year I thought I finally made some friends that would stick for longer than a year. This year my friends one by one stopped inviting me out, stopped replying to texts, and stopped talking to me in person even if I saw them. My roommate doesn’t even talk to me anymore and I let her move in with me because I thought we were friends. She ended up taking all my friends and now they all hang out together leaving me out of the picture and I am constantly alone. I have tried to talk to other people and even they stopped talking to me after a few weeks. I constantly feel alone by not having anyone to talk to or hang out with. I’ve told my parents this and that I want to transfer to a different school but it’s been difficult. I can’t seem to find a school that has what I want to pursue. I have good grades and I am passionate about my career, I have a good opportunity for an internship that I really want to do and I hope I get it because that’s the only thing I’m looking forward to. My mom made me really upset today because she said maybe things don’t work out for me and people don’t want to talk to me because of me, how I am myself, because this loneliness seems to follow me wherever I go. This made me feel extremely alone because they don’t see how hard I try to keep friends, they don’t understand the situations I’m put in where people can drop me like I’m nothing, they don’t get what it’s like to be me. My mom doesn’t seem to have a lot of friends either so its made me think maybe the apple doesn’t stray that far from the tree. I have recently thought about taking my life because I feel so worthless and the only reason I don’t is because I want to stay for my parents and I want to have my dream job and I want to be with the guy I love. I am not even sure if I will ever be able to be with him because we live on opposite sides of the country and when he talks to me, he doesn’t seem that interested since the last time I saw him in person during thanksgiving time. I feel like I’m never going to be important to anyone and I don’t want to seem like I’m begging for attention. I feel like nobody. My best friend from college who recently stopped talking to me even said that nobody is ever going to love me because I’m easy. I have never let anyone’s hurtful comments get to me until this. My moms comment too has made me feel extremely alone. I don’t know why people decide to stop talking to me, I tend to put my problems upon people and ask them for help but that’s because I don’t know who else to go to. I’ve been going to therapy and I haven’t told her any of this yet because things haven’t gotten bad up until now. I feel like a complete waste of space and I’m not going to do anything to myself besides cry about it so don’t worry. I don’t self harm and I stopped smoking weed as often. I need advice on how to keep going even if I feel like I’m falling apart. Are there any group chats that are out there where I can talk to people and make internet friends?"

lonely,Watching YouTube vids of my new man to feel less lonely,"Watching YouTube vids of my new man to feel less lonely - So my narc ex of 2 years dumped me out of nowhere and I don’t really have too many people I’m close to and essentially no family so I’ve felt super alone. I met this new guy and I’m pretty sure I must have dreamed him up or something because he’s everything I ever wanted (gosh I hope he becomes a permanent fixture.) Problem is though, my new guy is a super busy and successful business owner so he doesn’t really have much time for me. He buys me whatever I want and sends me spending money to make up for the fact he can’t be around to give me attention and while that’s great it also simultaneously sucks that he’ll never really ever be around. So here I am watching his inspirational/ self help videos on YouTube to feel less alone... I’m not crying. You’re crying. :,("

I don’t understand what happened. Everything seemed fine. We were talking and seemed like we were going to keep talking. I know how bad it seems to be posting this but I don’t know what else to do. Maybe I got too attached. We didn’t even know each other that long but we both said it seemed like we knew each other much longer. 

We started talking on discord right after reddit. You got sick of it and moved to telegram. We talked for hours on the phone. I tried not thinking about her but fuck me I guess. I know this is probably futile but I gotta atleast try. You said you’d text me in the morning and I’m still waiting. 

Honestly I don’t even know what I’m hoping with this. If she sees this and by some miracle decides to give me closure idk if that will even help..... you said you didn’t think I would try as hard but you didn’t even give me a chance to prove you wrong.

I live alone in my own house, I work 2 jobs and pay the bills fine. I'm just soulcrushingly lonely, I have a crush on a trans coworker of mine (I'm actually straight), we're really good friends. I hang out with him weekly, though last week we got drunk and I told him how I feel. Now things are awkward, he did tell me he's gay (I heavily suspected) but, didn't express interest. I have been through hell with suicidal thoughts over the past few years and thought I was over my past. Now I feel them growing stronger each day, today I felt totally alone when out with another group of friends. Now I sit home alone with nothing. I cannot get these thoughts out of my head, all I wanna do is find someone(such as my coworker) to cuddle with I honestly don't even care about sex.

lonely,travelling can be so lonely,"travelling can be so lonely - I'm posting this out of the curiosity that anyone else has felt the same severe loneliness that I have been feeling after several months of traveling. 

To give you some background, I am a 21 year old girl that has been travelling for work pretty much non-stop for the past two years. I stay in one spot for about two weeks and I travel between the US and Canada. Although, I do interact with a lot of people during my stays, I am constantly reminded that every interaction I have with the wonderful people of Earth, maybe my last and that I will most likely never see them again after I leave the city. 

I have no friends in my home town accept for one, who is overwhelmed with school and work and for the maybe 2 weeks that I am in my hometown, we never make it to see each other. 

I start to wonder to myself a lot if there is something wrong with me, if I am that clingy, forced friendly interaction type person that I loathed growing up. But then I think to myself how many dear friends I have made traveling I am just no longer around to continue the relationship. 

But then I begin to doubt any friendship, is it only because two people are forced together in a certain environment and have to interact? You have to find something you like about the people around you otherwise, existence would be miserable? Does anyone truly enjoy another's company or is it just a primitive survival tactic?

Honestly, at this point. No matter what it is. I am severely lonely. Craving real life interactions, with people I enjoy, frankly, just straight vibing. If anyone else has experienced this, please let me know."

lonely,Why are Christmas movies so happy all the time while in reality it's not.,"Why are Christmas movies so happy all the time while in reality it's not. - It's just that movies are always happy ends or things about love this love that,
 while in reality it doesn't work like that :

Reality is based about having a career making sure your part of society  (useful to society). And perhaps maybe just maybe some person thinks your special but occasionally your just one parasite from society just like the others there are no snowflakes . 

 Not that I'm madd at people who do find it . 
Just that it's frustrating , depressing and a bunch of other words that would create quite a list .

 During Christmas it's just  hard on us loners 
Perhaps we need to be more out of the box like people . Or perhaps do what we feel like because it makes us unique how we are and who we are .
We all have our struggles our own fights our own problems . That could be a reason why we aren't to talkable , noisy not sure how you call it but you get it.




The point is even though movies are lies and deceptions we all make our own in the living thriving and struggling . 

My question is whether we are here for a reason .


I don't really have any other questions not really good at it .

Also hopefully we are all having an unusual day .

Cheers

lonely,I'd like to chat with someone,"I'd like to chat with someone - Hi, I'm  and want to chat with someone."
lonely,Am I Wrong?,"Am I Wrong? - My parents have been punishing me for about a month now. I'm not allowed to go outside at all, my phone is taken cutting me from all outside interactions with my friends (I never connected my iCloud to my Mac which I'm using right now) so I'm left to just sit in this empty house alone while they go out everyday doing I don't know what. It's all because of my grades and the fact that I was smoking weed. I understand that is more than enough reason to punish a child but this has been going on for a month. What hurts more is that I had so many things planned for my two week break which started two days ago. I thought they would have some sympathy since it's Christmas time but no. 

The day break started my mother drove me home from school and I had asked if my friend could come over the house (they previously had let her before) and my mom coldly replied no and started cursing at me. I started to cry, not because she said no but because I had just seen a class full of kids excited for their holiday break, to hang out with their friends, go iceskating, open gifts. But for me that no indicated that this long ass break will be just like how Thanksgiving break was. Alone. 

Thanksgiving break was the most terrible point in time for me. I had fallen into such a deep depression. I don't think its okay for anyone to be stuck in a house for days on end with no human interaction. I slept my days away not doing anything because there was nothing to do. I felt like I was in prison. 

Every time I try to explain to my parents why I smoke weed they tell me it's a excuse. I have struggled with depression and anxiety ever since middle school. I have told my parents this ever since middle school. However I live in a ethnic household, and especially hispanic people don't believe in mental illness. They think my generation is just crazy. But the crazy part is mental illness runs in my family. My uncle is in a mental hospital in Florida due to schizophrenia, and most of my family are ex crack-addicts due to mental illness.  The only time Ive ever seen my parents look the tiniest bit empathetic for me was years ago when I used to cut myself and my mother found a bloody razor. But that was years ago. Now when I cry they look at me with disgust. When I tell them I want to die they turn and walk away. It feels as though they will only believe these feelings of mine are true when I kill myself.

Anyway back to the first day of break, I was crying. I went to my room and tried to sleep.  I sleep whenever I feel sad so I don't have to think because when I think I start to cry endlessly without being able to stop. My dad busted my door open and told me to take my contacts off. He obviously knew I was going through something at the moment and now was not the time to argue, or so I thought. I had a really bad day overall but I said okay, expecting him to leave. However he stayed at my door staring at me. So I asked what? He told me you don't take them off when you want you take them off now. I don't understand them. Why does it matter when I take them off?  I feel as though they have a superiority complex, if anything I do isn't done exactly when they say so, exactly on their timing, even something as pointless and stupid as this, that doesn't affect them in anyway, they will flip out. And that's exactly what happened. Anyways, I told him I will take them off and he closed the door and left. I went back to closing my eyes and trying to calm myself. I had a blanket over my head so when my dad had snuck into my room again and grabbed me I didn't realize what was happening. Mind you, I'm a petite 5 foot highschool female, and my father is a 5'11 muscular man who goes to the gym. He grabbed me out of my bed, slammed me onto the floor and pulled me by my hair. He choked me and hit me. I have a long red scratch from my jaw to my neck which I have no idea how I am going to hide it from the rest of my family on Christmas. 

My mom is  familiar with my dad's outbursts. When I was younger and he used to relapse a lot more (he's a ex addict even though he probably hasn't been clean for over 2 months max). He used to do that to her instead of me. My mom came rushing in telling him to stop. He kept yelling and screaming like a animal for her to get the fuck out over and over and that he was gonna hit me making fists. He told her that it was her fault I was scared of him. After about 10 minutes of this  he left. My mom then came in my room screaming at me. Telling me it's all my fault, that I must love this stuff. I was crying asking her does she really think I deserve this? I couldn't breathe, I was so scared. I couldn't get anything out. I just kept begging for her to get me out of the house I was begging, telling her I was scared, saying please please just let me live somewhere else. They had let my brother live with my aunt for a while when he was younger so I thought they could do the same for me. While I was sobbing and begging she was just telling me to shut the fuck up and that it's not okay when he does it to her but it's okay for me. She said I'm just spoiled and parents beat their kids. This isn't the first time this has happened with my Dad. What hurt the most was her shutting the door on me when I said ""Im scared Mom please"". Leaving me alone. 

My mom hits me a lot and I put up with it because it's my mom and she's a woman. I understand for ethnic households that's normal. But for a Father to touch their daughter like that? I have bruises and scars, I don't feel like this is okay. When I told her that he choked me and showed her my neck she said he'd only scratched me and brushed it off.

I feel so scared and alone in this house, I have no way out and no way to contact anyone I know. I'm forced to sit alone in this house.

I have no say in anything that goes on in my life, I can't even decide when I want to take off my contacts! They believe every decision I have should be made by them, but then complain about me being irresponsible. How am I supposed to know how to be independent when I never had the chance to? I used to have a job, and go everyday on time and just do my work. But my mother made me give all my paychecks to her, I've never even touch a cent of the money I've ever made in my life. She made me quit my job as a part of my punishment. 

Im young, still in highschool so it's expected that sometimes I may act irrationally because I' a teenager right? Any normal parent would have a understanding of teenage angst and hormones right? Well not my parents. My whole life since I was young I'd have to make sure that I control how I express my emotions because my parents can't handle that, they will lash out instead of being adults and being the bigger person. I have never ever been able to just be a kid and have those moments of irrational outbursts, because I am too busy being the bigger person for them when they threaten me constantly for every little thing I do. I had to mature quickly and just tell them to calm down when their anger issues flare up. Shouldn't it be opposite, shouldn't they be the ones trying to calm me? It doesn't feel right.

I don't know what to do, I don't want to spend two weeks alone in this house, I feel like this might be my breaking point if I do."

Earlier this year my mom was diagnosed with incurable cancer and this Christmas is probably going to be the last one for her. So we were supposed to spend it together with all my family: me, mom, my siblings and their kids and my sister's spouse.

First we were going to spend it in my home town at my mom's place, but that had to be cancelled due to some private reasons. Then we planned my family would just travel to where I live and I'd host the Christmas this year. I was super excited about it, planning it already, when my siblings informed me last week that they could not come all the way here after all. 

So it would've been just me and mom. But I got sick! Of course. And since my mom has been getting chemo for the past six months, she cannot be around sick people due to high infection risk. So she cancelled as well, obviously.

It all happened on such a short notice that my partner couldn't cancel his plans with his family, and he left the city today as well. 

So here I am, alone in an empty flat, with too much food stuffed in the fridge, too much effort put into decorations, and just feeling like it all went horribly wrong. I feel so sad seeing and hearing about my friends with their big family gatherings and all the joy they have. 

Also, I am not very close with my family and we don't see often, so I was really looking forward to catch on and spend some time together. 

So yeah. Just needed to get it out of the system. I'm sure I'll be fine on my own - just gotta stay out of social media the entire time! 

(And if anyone else's in any similar situation, I'm so sorry for you, I hope you can still enjoy it even a little bit.) 🎄"
lonely,Heyyy anoyone bored? Hmu?,"Heyyy anoyone bored? Hmu? - Hi, this sounds super shallow and stupid. I'm bored and extremely lonely. I'm a younger college student and I found out that my friends always have something to criticise me about (""you go out alone, whenever you go out you should always ask people out. "" I think it's ok to go out myself every once in a while, or, ""why are you trying to cut your hair like that, don't!"" ""Eww, you like *band*?"" ""You're so stupid for feeling *some emotion* stop being a wussie and get over it."" ""I don't get how you and your highschool friends are soo spoiled""). So I decided to distance myself away from them and now my only friend is a younger lecturer who always accepts me unconditionally and as a result, motivates me to try harder in her classes. But now since I try not to get too involved with that group of friends, I find myself always just hanging out with whoever just once, and bouncing to a different group of friends and now I technically have just piled up a bunch of acquaintances but never exactly a friend. So my dumbass decides to hit it online to go talk to some people.

I was hoping I can strike a few conversations or maybe even an awesome friendship here.

So let me talk about myself a bit, I'm Vii and I love drawing! I'm single and bored. I have a broken home and I never really talk to my dad and my mom wants a lot from me and my dad too, he just expresses it through my mom. I don't only love drawing but also love to just laze around and watch YouTube and just have a good laugh in my dorm! Alone so far though.... I also love turtles and bunnies! In fact, I want to get 2 bunnies once I'm back from spring break! I actually think I'm a pathetic piece of shit because I was an asshole growing up and I would get so easily offended so now I always think that people are secretly annoyed at me even though they always said they are not. I'm trying to be better though! 

And being a bit repetitive, I've been feeling a bit lonely recently and I have just been staying in my room if I'm not having class. So I just hope that I can find someone to just chill with and maybe have some virtual hugs every once in a while when needed! I only have an instagram and tumblr aside from reddit just incase we want to move to another sm platform. I don't really plan on having new social media accounts because I always end up ditching them. So if you are interested, feel free to chat me here, introduce yourself down below, anything! I know this will get burried anyways but I hope someone sees this. Well, I hooe to see you guys 💙🤍"

I try to be strong and most days I am able to manage myself well enough but there are some days that it gets overwhelming. This hole in my heart feels like it's constantly expanding. I don't have a safe place to go to, it's always been me all alone.

 I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how long I can proceed like this. Maybe the internet will understand me or maybe it won't. Wish I could be just normal, you know?"

Sometimes we're already dating in the dream and we're just enjoying each others company, playing video games or something. Nothing sexual, just two people spending quality time together.

When I wake up I feel like I've lost something, even though I've never had that to begin with. In the dream I always think ""finally, I've waited so long for someone like this"" then I wake up and realize I'll have to keep waiting. If it happens in real life I might think I'm still dreaming. I hope it comes true someday."

I know people come and go, especially online but what we had was so real. I've never experienced anything like it before in my life and don't think I ever will again. I remember being here in my grandparents house last year for the holidays at this time. I wrote her a good note coming from my heart. She loved it. It was before she fell off. And eventually left. I just miss her. I'm very alone now. I could really use some help getting through the holidays if anyone is reading this. The family trips can be overwhelming. I'd love to meet a new friend."
lonely,I can’t take it anymore,"I can’t take it anymore - I so badly want to talk to someone but I feel like I’ll never find someone who’ll stick around. 

I feel like I’m totally worthless and my problems don’t matter. I want someone who will understand and who won’t give up on me. Everyone always does. 

I realized that I’m actually totally alone in the world. I’m surrounded by people but none of them care about me. 

I feel like I have nobody to talk to and I can’t turn to anybody for support. 
Every time I try I get ghosted or ignored or told to go to therapy. 

I just want a friend or really anyone who will love me and want to listen to me. I don’t need to be fixed. I just want someone who will listen and still love me. Every time I tell people what’s going on inside my brain/heart they start to distance themselves from me and eventually they stop talking to me. I know it can be emotionally draining. But I just want someone who will listen and care enough about me that I feel heard. I feel like I’m not important to anyone. 

 Is that an abnormal want? Why doesn’t anybody love or care about me?"
lonely,"If you're feeling alone please read this and if need someone to talk to, I'm always here! 💕💖","If you're feeling alone please read this and if need someone to talk to, I'm always here! 💕💖 - Boundaries. Boundaries are the biggest enemy of a human being. Boundaries where people trick your mind into limiting yourself to boundaries where people cross to humiliate you, make you feel in a certain way crossing the limits of a human being's humanity and morals disgracing the core values of humanity sending a person into a state of Anxiety and Depression. This has been the case with me and every person who goes through anxiety and Depression.

The human brain is not predictable so isn't it's thinking, but one thing can surely be said that most people can easily get into people's words and get discouraged easily, after all words cut sharper than knives inside the brain if taken to seriously and again that's something that happened with me too. A human forgets his/her true self and dwells into the discouraging thoughts these cruel people give rise to inside the brain through their hurtful, disgraceful and awful actions and the words they say to hurt people and they succeed when a person gives up and goes into his/her dark corners pulling himself away from the reality lost somewhere in the lost ruins of his/her mind. 

The thing here is, we tend to give up more easily and more often when easily persuaded and discouraged by people who like hurting people and make for their very own entertainment and jealousy of not wanting to see you excel in your life.

This inturn lowers a person's self confidence and in turn gives birth to to a state or depression and what arises in his/her brain through the change in their confidence and courage thereafter is known as ""ANXIETY"" which which comes in the way of everything, could come in many ways either through breakdowns, sudden heart beat rising out of increased fear due to lack of confidence when infront of a huge crowd or among people or sudden shivering, body turning cold and trembling and lowers his/her strength. 

This happened with me again.

In the end there's one thing a person should think and pull themselves back before it's too late. That what these people says and what the world wants you to be can't decide your way of living life or finding happiness and can't change your thinking, strengths and can't affect your aims because in the end you are like phoenix rising from your very own ashes everytime they try to burn you down because it's never too late even when you are cornered, all alone or even if it's you vs the world where you are all alone so be it and do whatever it takes and stand back on your feet rising up above and fighting it all for the world to witness your rise while these people remain where they are and realize in the end that hadn't they wasted their time into disgracing and pulling you down they'd have been somewhere better where you are and their shame, jealousy and regrets will be their end while you succeed.

Just chime in with your strengths and be that courageous master of your own life as you stand by giving your haters no attention what they want and those people coming in your way a gaze that will lower their confidence not yours because you don't deserve the anxiety and depression they want you to have . Nobody does. Find that one little thing that pulls you back in with more confidence and bounce back into this life that is precious and long enough to learn from and to grew into a stronger and better person.

I just did that. I found that one thing in my brain that arose in this darkest time, that one thing that I had that was going to revive me and that was my humor that was birthed in my brain during this darkest time when i had to find it and it made me feel happy and I felt as long as it makes me happy it's great and I don't care bout the rest when they come to pull me down they'll get a greater share of my actions. That's when I realized all of this what i talked to you about right now about depression and anxiety and stopped caring about what they said or did and if they ever came in my way I always give them that evil smirk and that gaze that lowers their confidence and an unending humorous take on them that makes lose their confidence and give up, declare me to be a mad person, mentally unstable or something else but deep down they now know that they cannot defeat me and that's where I have succeeded in driving them away from my life even when they get in my way through my strength, courage, unending faith in myself and this new found self.

You just gotta be strong. In the end you will succeed. All the very best for your life! And I'm always here to talk if you want to! :) 

Also here's a Discord server i made for people to talk and socialize breaking this wall of anxiety and Depression if you wanna join to socialize and make friends.

lonely,Does anyone spend a night with a bunch of friends then feel they don't exist?,"Does anyone spend a night with a bunch of friends then feel they don't exist? - I have a great bunch of mates tbf, and a loving family, but it very much feels like i spend my life on stand-by. Unless I am specifically invited I feel like no-one wants me and even when I am I feel  like its just people being polite. 

I really get on with my mates and they're massively accomadating to my delusions, but does anyone else struggle with feeling amazingly lonely even though you technically have friends??"
lonely,the outcast.,"the outcast. - so uh, i ended up venting at the end, sorry for making this long LOL
 
for once, i was actually invited to go see star wars by a friend i used to talk to a lot in high school. i was extremely excited to go and was really hyped to see it too. however, my excitement got cut short when he said “so we already have a ticket for you since another friend couldn’t make it. pay me back when u can, see you in a couple days!”
 
i’m sure he meant well, but that statement was a solid punch to the face. it reminded me that i’m an outcast, the last resort. this friend as well as the people he hangs out with never talk to me, and they never bother to invite me anywhere. 
 
i have tried literally everything in my power to improve on my inability to make friends and also embrace my loneliness but it just hurts so much. i’ve lost all of my self-esteem, and even though i’m trying so hard to get it back, nothing works. in the end, i still feel like everyone fucking hates me. i still feel like people are uncomfortable and uneasy when talking to or being around me. i know my problem, i know that i care too much about what other people think but it’s something my fucked up mind continues to do and i’m having a hard time changing that. i’m trying so hard to work on myself and improve my mental health, but nothing is happening. no one asks me how my day is. no one fucking asks me if i’m doing okay. and honestly, when that day comes when someone asks me these questions, i swear on my fucking life i’ll break down and spill everything. i know it’s not healthy to bottle it up but i have literally no one, and i’m too fucking poor to afford therapy.

Seeing movies, traveling, hanging with other friends, and more. And I've just been sitting at home, every day for the past few days slowly becoming more isolated from them. Checking their messages less often, responding back in more lackluster ways. Seeing my friends post about it all on social media or tell me about it  just makes me feel worse. I'm just sitting at home while everyone else has a good time. And it's not even on my part most of the time because I'm not invited.

People always say your too hard on yourself, so I tried to see what was wrong from someone else’s perspective. I’m not attractive, I look easy. My personality sucks. My voice sucks. I’m unrelatable. I’m weird and awkward. I’m slow. I got all this from multiple strangers, and some from family and friends. I don’t know how to fix this. I just need to give up, there’s no hope. I wish I didn’t have to feel like this. I wish I could actually be liked. Loved even. Not family love, most of the time that’s forced. I wish I was a person who someone wants to spend time with. I wish I could stop making plans that fall through and actually be invited. That really wouldn’t change much, would it? I’m moving soon, so the last attempt I have is coming next year. I’ve been told I’m in the wrong place, now I’m staying half a year in a city that’s full of gay guys. If it doesn’t happen there, it won’t happen. I’ve been crying a lot. This guy messaged me and kept telling me he didn’t like all the attention he was getting from guys in sex clubs. He has a boyfriend, and from what I understand he lives a pretty sex filled life. What he feels, I don’t know, so I can’t say it’s worse than mine. It just made me think. It’s a joke amoungst my friends, that even sex traffickers wouldnt be able to sell me. One time, a friend of mine responded, “the only time you’ll ever get laid is if your raped in an alleyway”. So far that hasn’t happened either. I’m a selfish person because I know I’d push so much baggage on someone else that I’d ruin their life with a pool of toxicity. Yet here I am, telling everyone that I just want to feel love. I don’t know what love is. Maybe I’m just one of those people, forever alone so that others could know the joy happiness. Not everyone can be happy, right?"

lonely,I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO! I feel so torn about my bestfriend....,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO! I feel so torn about my bestfriend.... - I am currently 23 years old and I have no one. That of course is a slight exaggeration, I have an 'on again, off again' bestfriend. Right now, things are rocky and I'm very hesitate to open back up to her. It's heart wrenching every time.. She has always been my happy place/my safe place, and the only one I feel truly understood by (most of the time). SOO with that being said, I'm sure you can imagine how lost and defeated I feel when an ordeal goes down. I just feel extra alone, knowing that she has a bunch of love and support on her side, and I'm left crying in the mirror, alone. I truly don't understand why our relationship is so fragile, we've been through a lot together growing up... and I genuinely care for her well-being.  A part of me believes she is so quick to cut me off because she doesn't need me. She has her boyfriend and 7 other bestfriends. I'm easily replaced. Which is one SHITTY feeling. Especially when she is a key component as to why I didn't kill myself for so long. I realized that we had a co-dependant relationship while we were kids but that all changed when we got in a fight over a lie that was told and went our separate ways. In that time, I starting dated a older guy, got a place with him. And learned that he was abusive in everyway. A year of that bullshit almost killed me, weakened, stressed, and wanting to die. I reached back out to my 'bestfriend' and we reunited, and it was blissful. I was so happy and hopeful. Eventually, I got rid of my ex. Got back in therapy and started meds again, signed up to see a psychiatrists. During this time my friend gets into a relationship and I become non-existent. I have terrible crippling anxiety so I could only hang out with her one-on-one. SO obvisously she stopped inviting me to social gatherings long ago. But that's ok because I never feel welcomed anyway. Despite all that I still cherished the time I got with her. Helped her move into her boyfriends, loved her, supported her, even putting her needs before mine at times. In this time I still feel that she is m other-half, but things aren't the same. It became easier for her to roll me off other her shoulders in a disagreement. She was there for me emotionally anymore. One night some guy was messaging me trying hit on me and randomly brings up the fact that my ex cheated on me all the time. This brought back terrible memories, and I began to fee really depressed and sick to my stomach. I text my 'bestfriend' in hopes to get a little love, because I knew that would make me feel better. Even though we were already texting each other, when I brought up feeling like shit because of my ex Jacob, she completely ghosted for the rest of the evening. I was calm with it, and even expected it because I knew she was with her boyfriend. The next morning, I was expecting a response from her, because all she does is play on her phone and laptop at work, but nothing. She had nothing to say until I brought it up again. She then gave me a short unmeaningful paragraph, basically saying she said all that she could say to me about the matter, and if I can't work it out on my own, I should talk to my therapist about it. That of course angered me further and more questionable things were said on her end. She never wants to be around me when I'm feeling low because 'it brings her down' but vise versa, i'm there for her to listen, to cheer her up, to be there. I've always been the more passive person in our relationship because she is so easily rattled and vicious. Most things would go her way because I'm more laid back and don't really care as along as we're together but also there were things I didn't want to do but did it anyway. Like the last time we saw each other, I'm not a big drinker because I act a fool and feel the effects for days after. But that night she just randomly sprung that she wanted to get drunk that night, so we did. I took a cab home and everything was fine... until the next morning. I realized that I forgot my purse and I was urgent to get it back as it had my health card and house key. My family made me feel like shit about the key and demanded I got it back that day. Anxious, hungover little me went overboard with trying to contact and get a response out of my friend, but I was getting nothing which made me more anxious because now I'm thinking, 'what in the fuck did I do last night?'. 7+ hours later she said she had just got her phone and she was in the hospital. Right away, I apologized and made sure she wasn't alone. The texting stopped soon after that. The next day comes around and I'm just receiving snaps of her being extra. I checked up on her and so on. Now it's thanks giving day and since her boyfriends parents live up by me, she was able to drop off some of my things. CoolCool. She asked me for money because I guess I broke her boyfriends bowl to a bong. So I sent the money that it cost to replace it and right then I realized she wasn't happy with me. Soo I'm like whatever... nothing serious happened. But the day after I get this long text about how I didn't say sorry for anything and I made her feel like shit when she was in the hospital, and that she basically needed time from me, but she's not mad at me or anything. I questioned her and she very rudely said 'I said I need time, why are you still talking to me'. So that was that but as it began to get colder out, I messaged her about getting my favorite scarf back in a kind way (even thought I was heated inside). She's Like 'ya I have it, but I don't think I can drop it off today because I'm busy'. Busy. A phrase I would hear from her a lot when she didn't want to do something. I let it slide and I waited through the weekend and days after. I message her again, asking if she could drop it of today after work. and she went on about how tired she is. Sick of waiting around for her I decided to pick it up myself. We traded scarfs the year before but I didn't bring hers when I went to pick mine, as a last minute petty decision. I felt because she kept me waiting, made me ask more than once and put me through hoops of getting that same scarf back months prior. I'd make her come to my place to pick it up. I gave her a dose of her own medication and she did not like that. She continued to scream that I was a bitch and to never speak to her again. I didn't turn back, just kept going. 4 hours later I get a text from her saying that 'I can keep her scarf as symbol of our friendship (or something) because I clearly didn't want to be friends anymore'. I ignored the shit out of that dramatic ass text for days. But it was on the top of my mind everyday so I finally answered. Basically saying that this is not what I wanted but I cant convince her to see how much I care and that I can't change her way of thinking, so I wasn't going to chase her and that I was ready to let people in my life that value me. She sends me another paragraph, first stating she didn't read a word I said and went on discrediting me and saying that I've been a bad friend a lot throughout our friendship, saying she doesn't want to be surrounded by shitty people anymore and ending with 'I no longer want to continue this friendship'. I responded I'm not a shitty person but that was a shitty response. Blocked her number and died inside. She obviously went back and read what I sent to her after that because she's been trying to reach out to me since. BuT I couldn't let her back in right away. Everything was so uncalled her. We're starting to message again but I don't know if I want to let her back in. I feel like things can't be the same. Not if she can say I've been a bad friend to her... wheres the trust? whats the truth? This all makes me really sad and I just don't know if it would be worth it to hang out with her again. She's a good person but I know I'm going to get hurt. But I'm so alone without her. I don't know what to do.."

I’m sure some of you can relate.,"I’m getting really pissed off by how inconsiderate people have become in this day and age and I didn’t know where else to post this. I’m sure some of you can relate. - For starters I have dealt with social anxiety and self isolation for a really long time. Im a 26 year old female and for the longest time I would always think that people did not like me, that I was not good enough to sustain long term friendships, that I’m forgetful and not cool enough, I don’t try hard enough to make friends, etc.. I’ve always internalized everything. 

I’ve started going to therapy, I’ve started trying to “put myself out there more”, Ive been practicing positive self talk, and I’ve been trying reeeeally hard not to internalize things that have nothing to do with me. Another big thing is genuinely asking myself if what I’m thinking about myself is true, or if the issue is not me. If I’m being honest with myself about what the issue actually is, I should be able to find some clarity. This has been life changing and I had an epiphany just now.

Ive come to realize that the issue is a lot of these people I’ve come to call my friends are actually just really inconsiderate and genuinely do not seem to give a damn about me. We’re just not compatible. I need to stop being so desperate to be friends with these people and branch out and make new friends on my own. 

Today I told myself *ok instead of sitting in my apartment alone, I should grow a pair and reach out to one of my friends to hang out.* I reached out to a girl I will call A. I asked if she wanted to meet up and go get drinks. She genuinely sounded like she was interested.  She told me she’d love to and to text her when I was done getting ready so that we could meet up. She even named a few places she thought would be good to go to and I thought great, the balls rolling.

I took a shower and got dressed, did my hair and makeup(which takes a bit of time), and then I texted her. I said *hey, I’m going to be heading out in a few minutes. Which bar did you want to meet at?*

Half an hour goes by and I get no answer. 

As someone with social anxiety it doesn’t take much for the negative self talk to start. I started thinking to myself *wow I suck as a human being. She hates me. Everyone hates me, I have no friends.* 

I started the process of talking myself down and out of this mindset since it’s obviously not healthy. *Maybe she’s in the shower, maybe she’s driving, maybe she’s at a bar and it’s loud so she didn’t hear her phone....*


I kid you not, two hours later she texted me like *hey! I’m on a date at ______! Rain check?*

I was so confused. Why would this chick tell me she’s down to meet up and then ghost me for two hours only to respond telling me basically she can’t meet up because she’s on a date? If she knew she had a date why agree? If she didn’t want to hang out, why agree? 

This is the type of shit that people do these days that seems to be common practice. People have no manners anymore. Mind you this isn’t the first time I’ve experienced something like this with a so called friend. When other people hit me up to hang out, I’m there. However when I    reach out to other people it’s like suddenly they cannot be bothered. Case in point - I remember when I was 24 I made sure to show up to all of my friends birthday parties. When my birthday rolled around only 2 people came. 

I really just need to make new friends. I’m too old for this shit. Yes my feelings are hurt and I have the right to have hurt feelings."
lonely,lost most of my friends because I don't do fun things.,"lost most of my friends because I don't do fun things. - In the past I had many friends, not anymore. I lost them mainly because I have become obsessed with self-improvement, discipline, ascetism, and all that stuff. My friends wanted to have fun, but I wanted to work. I also consider most of what teenagers do to be a waste of time and degeneracy, most of my few friends now are adults.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want friends because I am busy, but as time goes on my loneliness stays with me, no matter how much I rationalize my lack of friends it still makes me feel very uncomfortable. There's probably no one else like me in the world, but if there is then send me an email to [eselef@protonmail.ch](mailto:eselef@protonmail.ch) as I won't be using this reddit account ever again. why did I even write this?

I study a really intense course in uni as well as working and although we saw each other rarely everything seemed fine, one even took my on a weekend trip for my birthday just a few months ago. I can’t describe the pain when I saw them out together without me, after pleading to see them after a few weeks without contact (despite sporadic ‘please let me know when you’re free!’ Texts to her), and have got no response after reaching out to ask what’s gone wrong. My university friends that I met this year are basically doing overtime all Christmas break and despite making another new friend this year (on bumble for friends!), we’re still a fairly new friendship and not ‘that’ close yet, I don’t want to scare her off with any neediness. The women I work with are at least all twice my age but the nature of my job means I’m in myself most shifts anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

  
I feel like pure utter shit right now. I have like 4 friends, they are the only friends I have and recently I've thought about it, and I can't think about how they give a single shit about me. Its always been like this but I've never really noticed it.

  
They all go out separately without me all the time, they never ask me to hang out directly and only ever ask everyone together in a group chat. The main one though is that they never go out of their way for me one bit, I do it all the time for them when someone needs someone to spot some cash, ill do it, someone doesn't want to be squashed in the back of the car, ill do it, yet I never get the same kindness in return.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Up until today, I thought maybe it was just my overthinking, and maybe when they hang without me its because I live a little further away so they don't bother but that's so fucking stupid. Do I matter that little that a 20 or 30-minute drive is too much, 2 of my friends drive and they drop everyone but me because I like a little further away, is that normal? because I know for sure that even if they lived an hour away I would drop them off home no matter what. Today was the day I've had enough, I went out with them and they did something that made me know that they don't care about me (would rather not talk about it) and then in the pouring rain I take the bus home when they both have cars, they ask me if I want a lift but id had enough and just went home, they didn't even realise what they had done so I just stayed silent till I could leave. There's no way this is my anxiety or overthinking anymore its right in front of my eyes now.

&amp;#x200B;

  
I know its wrong and would make me selfish to say all of this but I feel so fucking betrayed, the amount of stuff I do for these people I thought were my friends, the amount I care for them, these people are supposed to be my best friends, I fucking helped one of them get through their depression, gave him constant advice, cared so much about him and told him all the time, no one even fucking asks me if im okay, anytime any of them needs something from me I do it because I care about them but they never do anything for me.

  
I don't know why I choose to be their friends, I have no one else and if I wasn't their friends I would legitimately have 0 people in my life other than my parents but im starting to think that's better. I haven't said anything and IDK if I ever will but I feel so done.

No matter how depressed and lonely I've ever felt I've never been able to cry no matter how much I wanted to but today I got home and just couldn't stop the tears coming out of my eyes. I thought of these people as my own brothers and I feel so betrayed and alone now that I've realised this. I cant take this anymore."

Sure, I have my family, but it's dysfunctional and nobody is ever around anyways. We're all so busy nowadays. I just wish I had somebody that loved me and vice versa to spend time with during the ""happiest time of the year"". I just want to feel needed. I've never felt needed, and it makes me feel so useless. I feel like I could die any second of any day and jack shit would change. I just want to have a Christmas where I'm happy. Maybe I have a girlfriend that I spend it with, I invite my best friend as well as a few other close friends over to spend the day with, we all exchange presents and eat a nice big meal, then as the day concludes I'd watch Christmas specials with a girl that loves me for who I am and vice versa. That would be the most perfect Christmas ever. But I doubt I'll ever have one like that. I doubt I'll ever truly be happy. When you're as miserable as myself (and as miserable as we are) you sort of look past the magic of Christmas and see it for what it is; a capitalist consumer-driven corruption of an ancient pagan fertility holiday that's run by suit-dummies in coperate America. Cynical? Yes. Edgy, even? Yes. But try and tell me that I'm wrong. I don't know. I just hope that one day I'll have a happy Christmas. Until then, I'll be getting my Christmas whiskey ready, also known as liquid happiness/emotional novocaine.

lonely,To have so many «friends» and still be lonely. Wtd?,"To have so many «friends» and still be lonely. Wtd? - (Sorry for bad English, not my first language)

Hey, I’ve (F19)just joined the lonelyfam! I have dealt with loneliness for quite some time, but no one seems to have the same problem as me. You see,  I had two close friends growing up, from 6-16 years, but we never talked about deep or private stuff, like boys, periods or feelings. Looking back at it now, it was kind of a toxic relationship bc they were closer (they were twins so) and way more smarter, so I used to be the dumb one. 

After I started high school, I got some new friends, who were really fun to hang out with. We were in the same class, so we had a lot in commoner that time. We drank together in our free time, etc etc. But I never became really close to any of the girls (there were 5 girls and 4 guys in our gang). But they sure got close with each other. They were in the same friend circle and such, so they would always hang or party together. So basically, my old friends got new friends and my new friends had old friends they could hang with. I wouldn’t complain at the time, since we were all partying together, hanging out at school, which was enough for me since I am an introvert who’s social battery runs out quickly. 
Now, I’m in college with new friends who’s got their old friends/ closer with each other, old friends which never invite me to anything unless it’s “reunion” with the whole group, and me who’s all alone on a Saturday night feeling bitter about it. 

On one hand I understand that my high school friends don’t invite me bc I am really not on their wavelength, they are more exited and enthusiastic, while I am not. Plus, being an introvert with a little social anxiety doesn’t help either.

This was really just a rant, but if anyone has any motivational speech or tips, I would be grateful."

lonely,I don’t have anyone that genuinely cares about me,"I don’t have anyone that genuinely cares about me - For me I define a genuine relationship as someone who truly wants you and wants to be with you. Someone who genuinely cares about what happens to you and genuinely enjoys being with you. Someone that you are important to and thinks about you.

Sadly I have no one that fits this definition in my life. People usually come and go. Someone may seem a little interested in me at first but after a while they leave. Sometimes for a reason and sometimes without even an explanation. I genuinely do feel like there is something about me that causes this but I’m not sure what exactly. 

About 2 years ago I was in much worse shape than I am now. I was very determined to change my life so I started working hard. 

- I used to be obese 2 years ago. Now I’m happy to say I bought my weight down to a normal BMI and am no longer overweight

- I have been in Therapy for over 2 years now. I have consistently worked on my Mental Health. I used to be very mentally unhealthy 2 years ago. Now I’m happy to say I’m in very good Mental shape thanks to therapy and have learned good coping skills.

- I forced myself to step out of my comfort zone and start to talk to people in the real world. I’m happy to say now I am much more confident being around large groups of people. I used to be severely socially anxious. Now I can talk in front of large groups of people with relative ease and little anxiety. Another accomplishment for me.

 Clearly I’ve been working hard and made an effort to change. I’ve been successful in many ways and have made lots of progress. I’ve come a long way from how I used to be and that’s good. However despite all this I’m still isolated. I still don’t have anyone that genuinely cares about me or wants me. Sometimes I still feel like I make other people uncomfortable or turn them off somehow. 

I need to figure out what I’m still doing wrong or what it is about me that turns other people off."

I only have a few random acquaintances on discord and one good online friend separate from discord. Of course family too. Beyond that, I am very lonely. I’m not even sure if I did this to myself since I always have to reach out with new friends. 

I’ll make a new friend in college and I will always have to reach out. If I don’t, that friendship dies. At this point I don’t know what to do. It should be a two way street. Maybe waiting and keep on trying is the best I can do.

Also in 2012 I think, asked a girl out for the first time and got shot down. 2017 or 2018, met a girl with similar a personality to mines, hit it off over text during winter break, and went out twice in January, and got shot down. Needless to say, I hate Christmas so much, it’s just bad memories. If you’ve seen my previous post, I’m just upset all the time because I’m single and lonely. I don’t really ask my parents for gifts anymore because they’ve done so much for me already, currently putting me through university, feeding and housing me. We’re not poor, but I still feel bad if I asked them for luxuries that aren’t critical to my life.

Never really cared for gifts during Christmas time, although I do enjoy them. Totally random, but I started getting into watches, I love them, I bought a few nice ones already, and now I’m hoping to buy an Omega Seamaster or Rolex OP one day soon.

lonely,i dont know how this works 😅,"i dont know how this works 😅 - I am 19 years old and I feel like i will be lonely forever. Its weird because I have a lot of friends but nothing really sirious and deep. I feel like my time has passed. Like, everyone at this point already have formed group of friends, their bestfriend, lover..but not me.

 I kiiinda have social anxiety and its really hard for me to even talk to people, let alone “make” bestfriend out of a stranger. How do you do that? I mean, i am ok with hang outs and that stuff, but how do you become bestfriend with someone? Like full on bestfriends. 

I always had that pressure cuz my sister has a bestfriend since birth practically. Shes her No1 and the other way around. I never had that kind of a relationship with someone. Usually its one way. Like i will think of someone as my bestfriend, but that person already has someone ljke that. That has been a problem my whole life and it kinda sucks."

lonely,Need someone to talk to,"Need someone to talk to - I guess the title says it all. I just need someone to talk to. I spend all my days alone and when I'm not working, there is no one else for me to talk to... I'm dreading the next 2 weeks that I have off as there is no one to do anything with or even just talk to.

lonely,I wish someone just wanted to talk to me,"I wish someone just wanted to talk to me - Nobody ever messages me first, I always have to start, and even then they don't usually reply. I don't care if you're F, M or other; I just want someone to talk with. I feel like nobody really wants to talk to me even when they reply. I feel like an annoying burden on people most of the time. 
Collage has been rough. Even though there are tons of people around, nobody wants to talk to me. Im to socialy nervous to talk to any new people anyway.
I've tried those apps that let you meet new people. If I don't get a guy going "" M or F?"" and leaving as soon as he doesn't get the answer he wants; I get a good few messages from someone before being forgotten and never messaged from them again.

lonely,I don't know what to do,"I don't know what to do - I don't know how to express my feelings. I have been suppressing my anger for a very long time now. Everybody thinks I'm happy. But I have been depressed lately. When I feel like I want to share my feelings, I realize that there is no one I could talk to. With this kind of personality I can never get a girlfriend. I'm the boring person someone will ever meet. My mind is just empty all the time. I have never shared something like this before. Just wanted to take this off my chest."

Last time I was myself, I was treated like shit by everyone. I feel like I’m going insane. The only people that care about me are my parents. They try to help but they can’t because they don’t understand what it’s like to be me. I have no desire to try at life anymore. I’m done, I just want someone to kill me."

lonely,My first breakdown,"My first breakdown - So I just talked to my parents how my mental health isnt at it's best and that I might need to go see a therapist and I might have have cried a little too.

My dad questioned how can someone be sad and depressed when one gets everything they have asked for from their parents.

The struggle with myself and the issues I have been going through are too little to them and the solution is to wake up early in the morning and meditate.

Also my dad asked me not to be a baby and to stop crying. 

The interesting thing is I have such major issues wity being close to someone because of my family issues I literally have no one to share this with and to talk about it.

The more I think about all the ways I have been affected by the minute things I have sent back in my mind have changed and destroyed my wall of strength completely as I broke down.

I am scared that sharing this personally with anyone will result in same reaction as how my dad reacted and that breaks me more with every thought."
lonely,Ever get this feeling ?,"Ever get this feeling ? - Like you're down and lonely and you actually  deserve it.

Because you never interacted with people or because everyone just has you as a backup person?

Today is that day for me and I honestly don't know what to do or what did I do to deserve this."
lonely,I've never felt more lonely,"I've never felt more lonely - I've for so long felt alone. I've always had a hard time connecting with people, making friends. But over the years I've chosen to stay alone. I believe I'm a complicated person, and I hate to say that but I feel like I'm more mature and way more open-minded and thoughtful than the people I generally talk to. (I may sound super pretentious and it is so wrong to say that because I'm in no way superior to anyone but that's what I really feel). I have really high standards concerning a lot of things. Everything I hate, people love. Everything I love, people hate. So yeah, super hard to make contact with people..

I'm now not even trying to build relationships.. But you know, the only place I've always felt good was on the internet. And now I can't stand being on the internet anymore. People are so mean, people are ready to insult you for nothing. People feel superior behind their screens. Just now, I've said my opinion about something so trivial and people came insulting me, despising me as if I had personally attacked them. 

And I always feel guilty, I always try to ease the conversation, I never insult people because I don't know them and the last thing I want is spreading nastiness. Hate and violence sadden me so much I just end up crying. Every day I see negativity, people saying mean stuff online.. Every time I'm about to say something I'm scared people won't get it and say something mean. I think I'm about to delete all my social media, and then I'll have no one to talk to at all. No friend, no one."
lonely,I don't think I have any friends,"I don't think I have any friends - And I know and hang out with lots of people.
It's just that they don't really give a fuck about me.  They like me, sure. But they don't really care, you know?   It's like I have to go the extra mile to make people remember I exist, and that's really tiring. 

Legit if I died on a car crash or something everyone I know besides my family would go like ""oh, that sucks"" and 5 seconds later move on completely.

I don't think I had any meaningful connection in, what, 7 years? And I don't really want anything like that, I don't need a best friend forever. I just wish people around me cared.

I do have my family, though. That's pretty good"
lonely,One of my best friends got a girlfriend and I just can't be happy for him,"One of my best friends got a girlfriend and I just can't be happy for him - I guess that says something about me. Speaks to something awful about me. He never struck me as someone who really wanted or needed a girlfriend in the years I've known him, but I could be wrong. It makes me feel so far behind everyone though, like I just keep getting passed up. When am I gonna get a chance? I'm trying my best, I just don't know how much longer I can keep doing it. I can't bring myself to care about anything that isn't love. It's the only thing I want, the only thing that'll make me feel everything is worth it. All I have ever done has been in the pursuit of that. Everything constructive and self-destructive stems from that absolute need to be loved and wanted by someone. How can I enjoy anything in life when in the end I'm as alone and unloved as I've ever been? I'm so tired of being alive."

lonely,No one,No one - I have the evening free and i felt like going out to eat with someone. But I can't call anyone I know for that. I have very few friends in the first place.

I want to make new friends but all my attempts till now have failed. I wasted 3 years of college being awkward and making zero friends.
lonely,Not lonely enough,"Not lonely enough - I feel like I’m constantly living on a roller coaster ride with my loneliness. I can’t seem to convince myself that I am lonely, due to the fact that I have friends. Ironically, my friends are the people making me feel more lonely. I’m always seeing my friends hang out without me, often times everyone’s together, except for me. It feels like I’m the one everyone hates. The thing is, when we hang out together everyone seems to enjoy my presence, they even got me Christmas gifts this year. 

I know that I’m going to have to confront them about it eventually, because every time I see it happening it hurts even more. I’m constantly trying to convince myself that i have friends, and that’s only because I don’t want to face the fact that, I might not have friends."

lonely,"Seen by many, heard by none, a really weird type of lonely","Seen by many, heard by none, a really weird type of lonely - There’s a special kind of loneliness where on paper you’re social, but emotionally you are completely isolated. 

You go to parties, you’ve had a fair share of hookups and fuckbuddies, you’re invited to things, you’re in circles but you have some close knit friends too who you love endlessly.

But the moment you go deeper or think about it for more than 5 seconds you realise it’s all confetti, under all that shiny stuff it’s dark because no matter how happy or safe you feel, there is always a guard or shield up in your head, and you’re playing a persona 

That guard never comes down because your asshole-monkey-brain has the bright idea that vulnerability = threat or danger.  A shitty childhood coping mechanism from a history of abuse and hurt.

In every relationship I’ve had in my life there is always a degree of disconnection, some more and some less. That separation is meant to be there to help me because yadda yadda vulnerability = bad but it stops me from actual, genuine human connection. Or love. Or validation. Or just about any essential for a healthy emotional state.

I can articulate my feelings and problems properly, talked to enough shrinks that it’s become a script at this point, but I never let myself *feel* what I’m feeling because it’s like a built up dam at this point, if I let it go for one second it’ll just explode. And that dam is really, really heavy."
lonely,I wish I can see you again,"I wish I can see you again - In the past 11 years my only wish for Christmas was to end my loneliness, to have a partner. But as you see nothing happened. 

I thought I have found aloneness, but it was a lie. 

How many times I saw someone asking for help, asking for partnership, even to be friends with... But people usually ""ohh, don't give up, there is always someone for you"" ""keep going, keep going, someone will come along"" 

Someone.. But not me, I don't have time for you.. This is everyone's answer. 

In this group no female was bothered about guy, if he's virgin and alone, he is a loser and I don't want to be with loser. His life? I don't care. Mine is more important... Best I can is to give encouragement and advice...

:( all the pain I felt for working out, for people telling me I'm not good enough and from rejection from the one I fall in love with. 

I understand, nature is forcing us to match with someone better, for survival. 

You either have looks from the start or not. 

You either are lucky and you have happiness, or you are unlucky and have misery.

You don't choose this body, you don't choose your parents, you don't choose your deseases... You have no free will.

Within next 24 hour my life will be over. It is my own choose. I've tried everything, but failed.

Be compassionate towards each other, if you really want to help someone, let go of your stupid pride.
Don't think 24/7 for yourselves... Go out and help people.
I've tried... But out of altruism, to fill this emptiness I had in my heart. But nobody was bothered about my heart.

I'm stupid Hehe.. at least I will liberate myself"
lonely,You are not alone.,"You are not alone. - I [F25] came across this sub an hour ago and I started reading your stories.

Whatever is currently going on that makes you sad and lonely - it will pass, sooner or later. Don't let that loneliness eat you - start working on yourself. I know, it's hard, but take step by step. 

Do something nice for yourself today!
Bake some cookies, read a book, make origami or just take a long walk. Start with one and then every week add something new. 

You need to take care of yourself first!

lonely,"disregarded, disrespected, disaster.","disregarded, disrespected, disaster. - Hello, 27F brand spanking new to reddit. Found my way here post a ""what is wrong with me?"" google search because I am a fucking MESS. My head has literally been manipulated so much that I do not even trust MY OWN feelings, like maybe it's all in my head... but isn't that just what all feelings are? 

OK if there's anyone out there I apologize because this is not going to be a fun read. I have a problem. He is laying 2 feet to my left. 

Began as a hot and heavy romance, 6 months into our relationship I see a change. Or actually I realize he is an alcoholic. Although his substance abuse does not stop there. And for some reason he's not the happy drunk I've been shooting Crown with. This is when he got dark... This is where I start becoming abused in a sense. No black eyes just more like pushing my head back forcefully, throwing elbows at my ribs, slamming the car door on me, straddling and choking me 2 months after having a C-section. Yeah, I have a beautiful  old daughter with him.. talk about good choices. While I do not regret her, he has had a strong hand in fucking me up, and I regret him. I fucked up. And I keep fucking up because I've been with him for 3 years this December.

Last December, I was 8 months pregnant. Hospitalized. With a herpes outbreak... he spoils me, what can I say?  In that moment I felt like he fucking ruined me. I was being told by my specialist and the infectious disease doctor the baby could have brain damage had the infection gotten to her. I had decided I was just going to kill myself post birth, had that been the case. But here I am... She was born perfect with no health issues a month later. 

He pays attention to me when he's horny, otherwise, no real connection. It's fake every time. I keep falling for it. During intercourse, I can't confirm 

She is the only person I have. She's my best friend. She's 10 months old watching me sob uncontrollably. Seeing him call me a stupid c*nt. And like a kicked puppy, what do I do? ""Please, please let me hug you. I love you dont treat me like this"" he shoves me away ""get the fuck off of me, you are childish."" 

Why the fuck am I like this? It's humiliating to know someone will read this. 

I am NOT the type of girl this happens to. I consider myself to be intelligent, especially considering my hometown (moved away 5yr ago) the methiest podunk town Florida has to offer.  I consider myself pretty. I have always been genuinely liked by coworkers, I am kind and nurturing so why am I tolerating this? He is only verbally abusive when he is drunk and only physically abusive, (I don't count the shoving anymore), twice since the straddle and choke deal about 8 months ago.

I just need someone to be gentle with me. I just need someone to fucking care about me. I hurt in a  way I can not even describe and I need something foreign to me. Idk even know what it is because I've been deprived of it... I read an article that said joining an online community could be helpful. Anyway, what a way to introduce myself... I just couldn't stop once I began. I almost feel lighter."
lonely,As I grow I realize how lonely I am,"As I grow I realize how lonely I am - So right now I’m almost 20 years old and I realize how lonely it is in this life. I’ve grown up as a military child, who just moves around, make new “friends”, learn the area , just adapting. Lately I’ve been looking back, so all the times I rarely hang out with friends, how I have a hard time getting into relationships, and how hard it is to express how I feel because I feel like no one wants to listen and care. I’ve been having trouble sleeping, because of two things. One thing is that I just keep thinking and thinking and other thing is that I have weird dreams with symbolism that’s relating to the relationships around. I don’t know why but there’s times where I just cry no apparent reason. There’s times I decided to go into friends with benefits situations and I realize how sex doesn’t satisfy me. I don’t know why am hurting myself in this way. I felt like no one cares about me, about how I feel, how my life is, and just don’t understand. I’m sorry to whoever is reading this that my writing is bad, it’s probably mixed with my emotional state and how tired I am right now. My loneliness just makes me think of the future for me, I just benefit others instead myself. I feel like I’m lonely to the point that I really need the TV on at night just to hear someone’s voice. I feel like I’m lonely to the point that I need to text someone once a day. And I feel like I’m lonely to the point that I need to write, draw, or watch something that have it worse than me just make myself better."
lonely,I've never made a post before.. but I feel like I need to,"I've never made a post before.. but I feel like I need to - So I like commenting and scrolling here on reddit. I don't seek too much attention. Mostly because there aren't people to give it to me in my life buuut that's neither here nor there. 

I turned 26 last week. Didn't get really any messages. Just a text from my father reminding me I am off his insurance now and to look into it, along with a few facebook posts from people who don't talk to me any other day in the year. Recently my boyfriend, the only person who I think cares whether I'm breathing still or not, moved to be with sick family in Colombia. So now I'm alone. I had a mental break and didn't work for 1.5 months. I'm a flight attendant. The thought of helping people, being happy when I am not, stuck on a loud plane with no escape, and dealing with difficult passengers taking their travel stress out on me caused a wild panic attack every time I went to call back in. I got my doctor to sign off on the call out so I wouldn't get in trouble and I'll return to work in the new year. However.. All this time laying in bed, usually in the dark, getting heavier, and watching what little I had in savings drain away.. It's been hard. And now I don't have my boyfriend to talk to on my ""dark days"" because he's busy in another country and so here I am. lonely.

I just needed someone. A (kinda lame) reddit search of ""I am so lonely"" brought me here. I was hoping one of you could tell me it's normal to be this old and this alone? If not normal, at least that I'm not the only one. My thoughts are getting bad and dark and a little scary again, bf isn't here, and I feel like a little confirmation someone cares what I am thinking would go a long way tonight. Ok, that's all.

My entire life can be summed up as being a ""visible ghost""; not a single person will speak to me unless required to, and I only matter to my 2 friends. Whenever I'm not around my friends, I play video games to mask the pain, because I know I'm dying alone. I have no redeeming qualities other than being booksmart; I can't cook, I have no common sense, I lack strength, I'm emotionally fragile, and the list goes on. I could never get a girlfriend, and I'm also simultaneously afraid to ask anyone out, because I know I would be rejected, and my soul would be shattered."
lonely,School Just Got Out...,"School Just Got Out... - School just got out for the winter and we had a pretty big project due today. My team and I got an A and had a fun time doing it, but the whole time my brain was more or less forced to acknowledge the presence of someone I’ve been trying to get over for a while now. The story with her is long and complicated, but the short version is just that I love her and have invested so much into her and she said she loves me back but can’t be in a relationship due to past experiences and mental afflictions. I haven’t been speaking to or trying to look at her for almost 3 weeks, and today it was really rough. I almost cried off the makeup my team put on me. 

I walked home by myself once school got out and played Counter Strike for what I can only guess was around 3-4 hours. I was doing terribly today, worse than normal. Eventually I lost the motivation to speak and spoke very rarely in my last couple of matches, only using my mic to apologize when I lost a clutch and disappointed my teammates. 

Winter Break is about 3 weeks long and I have no one to talk to. No one to text, nothing like that. Right now I’ve felt more isolated than ever and have been crying in my bed writing this. I don’t really expect or care if anyone does read this, I just really want to share my thoughts somehow. Last night I stooped as low as to listen to ASMR where a girl talks about how much she loves you just so I could feel calm enough to fall asleep. 

I just really wish I had someone, would rather it be the girl I mentioned, but it doesn’t have to be romantic I guess. I’m just really really lonely and it’s getting me down more than usual."
lonely,"Hey, Don't worry lad.","Hey, Don't worry lad. - Right, so- think of this as that big bro moment where you an' me are having a sit down. park, at home on the couch, wherever.

Now listen, I wanna tell you that first of all, it don't matter how old you are. You're still young. got plenty of life left in ya. I don't care that you're 40 or 50 going on 41 or 51, or 18, or whatever. That's a lot of life left.

And you can bet your arse that big brother here's been through some pretty bad times.

you know what? I'll even divulge to you that I've been a pretty lonesome guy most of my life.

Now, i won't go prattling on about how ""it gets better"" or anything. Things will only get better once they start changing, and that can be so random, it's unreliable to stress on a singular point.

See, big bro here is smart. First thing he learnt is how to be comfortable being alone and lonely. two really different things, but once you've got the hang of waking up and smiling for no particular reason than being alive, and looking forward to your independent day, then you're well on your way.

It was hard at first, yknow? I always felt like i needed someone, or that i couldn't go on without someone. Then I'd hit the sack, wake up, and find myself in another day. an' before you know it, the week goes by, and you're livin'.

yeah-i know, i do have some hobbies now, and i sure do treasure my family, and it really helps, but whenever Im alone, I can look in the mirror and smile, knowing that I am all I need, will ever need in any given situation, and that me and my thoughts will think towards tomorrow.

and the pain just doesn't come anymore.

so chin up bud, eh? tomorrow comes, we all live, and sooner than you'll know it, you might find yourself somewhere completely different, wearing a new expression. you got this."

lonely,I'm not trying anymore.,"I'm not trying anymore. - Maybe there's hope for you but not for me. Not in the relationship department at least. I made lots of posts here and sometimes I get messages asking about my current status so I'm making this last post in hopes if people see my other posts they'll also see this one and won't have to question me.

I'm not looking for any type of relationship anymore. No romance, no friendships, no nothing. It's just not healthy for me anymore. I've been looking for friends regularly for over a decade and the results always start or end bad regardless of how good I try to be. I kept trying longer than I should have and it caused more harm than good. 

I decided the best thing I can do for myself is live in solitude to salvage and restore my mental. I'm not bitter or upset but I no longer have the desire to know anyone or to be known. I just want to make money, buy what I want, go where I want &amp; do what I want. I've had enough with the constant disappointment, heartbreak and abandonment. It's just not worth it at this point. Normally I take whatever time needed for some sense of recovery or vent here because I have no one and occasionally have people discredit my problems because I'm a woman (**nice guys by the way**) I thought since being lonely was a broad issue &amp; all genders were welcome but that doesn't appear to be the case so maybe a separate sub is needed.

I don't know who or what gave me the idea that things will get better when I recovered from depression but I can't continue with life wondering whose last choice I'm going to be. Don't tell me to keep trying because it's not rational. Everytime I gave up someone wanted me to give them a chance and I gave in and ended up making the wrong choice. I always end up wrong when I deviate from my decision and I refuse to make anymore mistakes. I know not everyone is the same but I can't trust me or anyone else anymore. I think it's absurd to think since there are 7 billion people in the world that there's someone for everyone.

I feel like my family is cursed. Doomed to be alone or to wonder into relationships one after another just to be abandoned or treated poorly. No one in my family has friends and the ones in romantic relationships are not satisfied but keep it going just so they won't be alone. I hope no one in my family will have children so when everyone dies the family line will be done and it'll finally be over. It's the only thing I know that can make things alright and prevent future suffering. I will never commit suicide or encourage others to do so but I recognize there really are some things only death can fix. I feel like I'm genetically designed to be tossed or ignored regardless of what I do. There is absolutely no value in being different. Whoever says so is a liar.

I tried to start off fresh but I can't do that with another person. I hope by the time technology advances to address this problem I'll still be alive.

Accepting I'm gonna someday leave this world as if I never existed was initially a tough pill to swallow but since then I feel a weird sense of relief as if I don't have to do anything about it now. I have found a sense of contentment (or complacency) in the world but I know I most likely won't find the type of happiness I truly wanted to achieve.

When I die I want to be cremated and if possible have the ashes destroyed as well. I feel like cleansing away everything will take away whatever made me undesirable and will hopefully lessen the chance someone else will have the same problem.

I don't know if reincarnation exists but if I am to be reborn I just want to have a normal life and relationships like the majority of society has instead of instead of being entangled in this web of absurdity I have to handle myself.

**If you read this and think ""I wanna talk to this person"" or ""I wanna try to be this person's friend."" I implore you not to.** I couldn't stop myself from wasting my time but I can at least try to prevent you from wasting yours.


While this might seem majorly depressing for anyone that's reading but this is only mildly saddening for me. A sniffle here, a sob there then I put on my big girl pants and get back in the game to deal with things as adults are expected to. =/ I'm not trying to be patronizing. As much as I would love to throw a pity party and have someone console me it's not gonna happen and I can't delude myself again into thinking it will happen someday. I apply these tough standards to myself only and it's the only way I can keep myself going as ""well"" as I can.

I wish there was somewhere besides my imagination to escape to. The internet was better in the early 2000's when not that many of people were on it. Back then escaping your problems with the internet was easy but now since the nature of society has changed and lots of people are on the net there is no where to escape to.

I think I made this too long so I might delete this and type it over so it's more coherent. Regardless, I hope you guys have a wonderful weekend and Christmas."

They all did a gift exchange with each other today and they were all going to hangout after work (I could hear them loudly taking about it) and it made me feel so shitty because I have a week and a half off of work that I’m just going to spend alone in my room playing video games because none of my “friends” ever want to hang out or talk. 

I don’t know why it’s so easy for some people to make all of these friends. I think I’m a kind and funny person, but no one wants to be my friend no matter how hard I try... :( 

At least I can rant here because when I try to tell anyone who I think will care they just ignore me and never respond, change the subject completely, or tell me all I do is complain."

* sighs in knowing regret * 

I’m 17 years old (but sometimes I feel so much more older than that) but this particular narrative is placed about a year ago. I was living in South Africa and went to this prominent All Girls Boarding School which was by far the most self-actualising and thrilling time of my life. I was surrounded by close friends and like-minded people whom I bonded with on a visceral, sisterly level. I have nothing but fond and goofy memories of those halls that somehow always smelt of burnt popcorn and noodles. You can only imagine that when sharing your living space with at least 50 other individuals while simultaneously going to school with them and having them involved in every other aspect of your life, your bond grows into a near unbreakable one. Similar to Van Der Waal forces, the more there are, the stronger the bonds. I can confidently say that I had many sisters and an entire support system behind me - a family. They pushed me to be the best I could be. I got the best grades, excelled in sports, had a healthy social life and still came back to giggles in my pjs with my friends. It was a fantasy life to say the least. My knowledge of the world and it’s pain was quite sheltered living in this Utopia. 

So one can only imagine the pure shock and utter despair I felt when I was told we’d be relocating to England. At first, it didn’t feel quite real - just words without substance, ya know - but as the months rolled by, it became more obvious that this wasn’t just loud barking but a harsh bite that would drag me to the other side of the equator. 
Instead of being sorrowful about it though, I decided to enjoy my last few months with my friends. Truth be told, we went crazy and overboard with trying to make memories but things can be so painful when you’re forcefully trying to be happy while well knowing that there’s an underlying lie behind the euphoria. Up until this point I had never had a boyfriend (and still to this day haven’t even had so much as a kiss) so I decided that having my first boyfriend before I leave would be something great to add to the bucket list. 
* sighs deeply * 

One evening, during a school event, I met this stupidly amazing young man from our brother school. I’ll never forget that faithful night. I had just won 2nd place at a public speaking event and he had come up to congratulate me, and as fate would have it, I met my best friend that day, three months before my departure. Everything in me told me not to do what I knew I wanted to do but at the same time, everything in me screamed “heck!” 

We had started “talking”, just being friends. I know it was cruel to lead him on as i knew I’d be leaving soon but sometimes, one can’t help but succumb to these bugger little things called feelings. Long story extremely shortened, we ended up dating for a while and I say this  with a heavy heart and a head swimming with regret, I fell in love. Come November (t minus one month) I came clean and told him that we had to break up. I was reluctant to say why as I myself couldn’t come to terms with it but after many, many break downs I finally did. I remember him being utterly speechless and not reacting the way I would’ve liked (I got super angry because he didn’t cry when I told him 😂) but he said that me moving wasn’t a reason to stop trying. You’ve never seen the twinkle and hope in a desperate child’s eyes until you saw the look I gave him. 

To put some weight behind this, and as cheesy as it sounds, our relationship wasn’t a basic, modern, teenage romance that fleeted and was fuelled by hormones. I actually believe that he was the ying to my yang how alike we were. Our relationship was purely intellectual, we had never even done so much as kiss. All we did was talk late into the early hours of the morning about all the ways we were going to change the world. I honestly loved him. So when he said that he wanted to try a long distance relationship, I jumped at the opportunity because at that moment, I knew he felt the same way I did. 

To make a long story even shorter, I relocated and it was not the fairy tale Great British Adventure that I thought it would be. I was bullied profoundly (mainly for the basis that I was from “Africa” ) and had not a single friend. My old friends back in South Africa were the only roots that stabilised my sanity and he was my entire reason for waking up every morning and trying over and over again. I never told him about what was happening as I didn’t want him to worry or think less of me so he and everyone else assumed I was doing great but it was quite the contrary. My friends began to steadily drift away from me as they carried on with their lives but mine completely stopped, all I did was obsess over what once was.  That boy got me through so much pain and depression and I’ll forever be grateful to him for that because I don’t know what I would’ve done without him. 

Anyways, I began to hear rumours from friends that he had another girlfriend, someone shit tonnes prettier than me, and that many people had seen them kissing. That particular detail broke my heart as we hadn’t even shared our first kiss yet. Two days after Valentines Day, he broke up with me and moved on and I hear he’s happier for it now. 

I carried on with my tired, monotonous and difficult existence and thought about him everyday. As I went through all the pain of losing my home, my life, my friends and all I knew, I suffered my first ever break up alone. 
I’ve never told anyone this and quite frankly, it feels good to let it out. I know no one will find the time to read all this utter gibberish but this has been therapeutic. 

I guess what can be deduced from this rambling is that I’m hurt. I fully put my love and trust in this boy during the most vulnerable time of my life and he just threw it away like it was noting and carried on like I meant nothing. Did I mean nothing? Why’s it that he doesn’t get to feel the same pain as me? Why’s it that a year later, I’m still crying over some stupid boy in a foreign country where I’m alone while he’s comfortably feeding off my friends who’ve all drifted from me? I haven’t spoken to anyone in months. I feel so alone and broken... a single atom floating in this vast space, all my bonds broken."

lonely,spending christmas alone,"spending christmas alone - Not sure if this will get read or not, I'm not even sure if its a good idea to post this. The thought of someone reading it though will feel like I'm talking to someone about how i feel rather than holding it in.

 I'm spending christmas alone, I thought i'd b ok. I was fine with the idea that my family is traveling and the other part of my family is too far away. I get that my boyfriend needs to go see his family too. However, I didnt think id begin to b filled with alot of sadness the closer it got to x-mas. I'm trying not to make this long because I know how sometimes it can get too much to read but i've never spent a christmas alone. I miss the way it used to be; family getting together, making dinner and opening gifts together and now we've all gone separate ways. To add to all this, my birthday is also coming up in  two weeks and I feel like thats going to be another disappointment too. The older i get, i feel like the less people care to reach out to me. Its not like i expect gifts or a huge thing, I just want to know im still thought of and remembered. 

I dont have anyone i can talk to because I dont like to show sadness and then try to explain to people how I'm feeling because sometimes people dont get it and I get told to distract myself and do something fun like its that easy to go from feeling sad to all of a sudden happy. I'm honestly dreading my birthday and christmas coming up, because I'm scared I wont be remembered. I'll end this here"

lonely,I don't understand why I am always alone,"I don't understand why I am always alone - I don't understand why I have never had anyone who I could say is my friend. I am always the lonely kid no matter where I am for example in school or with family.

In primary/elementary school I had noticed that all of my classmates had made friends and I would always be left out. Fast forward to high school I find myself in the same position. This is extremely challenging as we are required to carry out group tasks. This results in the teacher placing me in a group with all of the trouble makers which results in me doing a lot of the work whilst they just sit back. I also don't understand why people feel awkward whilst talking to me as I am friendly and ok to talk to. 

The school thought that there might be something wrong with me and suggested that I could be autistic. However this wasn't true and the school has now left it as they are not interested anymore.

I will graduate from high school this year and worried about how I will manage in the real world. 

I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice about on how I should approach people and how I should act around them?

Thank you to all of you that have come this far in reading my post and I hope you have a great day.:)"
lonely,I can’t live anymore,"I can’t live anymore - I’ve been struggling with depression and suicide these past 2 years. I’ve been losing sleep, gaining weight, suffering from mental breakdowns, and have no self worth of any kind. Every single day I suffer from suicidal thoughts,  irrational guilt, mood swings, anxiety, low self esteem. It has gotten so bad that I literally picture myself being beaten to death by my family, friends and loved ones every single night. Some days I even ask myself “why am I still alive?” “How does someone like me even function?”. These questions plague my mind to no end. And every time I try and tell people about it I get extremely self conscious and more often than not I mentally beat myself up in doing so. My depression has also caused me to lose long lasting relationships with women. and they ended up cutting ties with me as a result. I feel so afraid to talk about how I feel because i am a man I should just “suck it up” and “stop complaining.” “You life’s fine you’ve got nothing to bitch about.”  I can’t live like this anymore, I just wanna get hit by a fucking truck and rot."

 \- Just got fired. My job was the only thing holding my life together. I can't gather strength for interviews. I can barely gather strength to wake up.

 \- I have some 3 or 4 months of savings left, then I'll be homeless if I can't find a job. Homeless people suffer terribly where I live.

Even worse is that the 31st is my birthday and the last few years I've not seen anyone I know over the whole last half of December even after asking people. Suppose it's gonna be another few weeks of drinking by myself.
lonely,Just..i don't know anymore,"Just..i don't know anymore - First of all, thank you all for reading this.
Means a lot.

I am a male, 27 years old. 

I've been in a relationship since February and she broke up with me last week.

Since the beginning of this relationship I tried to to do anything I could to make her happy, sacrificed a lot and moved to her town.

She is a very introverted person and needs to be alone a lot, which I respected (I tried not to be at home after her coming home from work, to give her her time.)

She had bad experiences from her past relationship, cause of how much of an Introvert she is. 

The problem is we are still living together and I love her. And both of those things won't change anytime soon.

I gave her anything  a woman/ human beeing could want and to my sadness, even more.

She never truly appreciated what I did.
But I still loved her and did the best I could do.

On one morning she kisses before going to work and smiles, on the same day she says she doesn't love me anymore and totally blindsights me.

I feel like vomiting every day.

She turned extremely cold from one moment to the other. 

It's eating me alive, this incredible tense heartache and the feeling of beeing betrayed and left alone. 

Since the initial break up, I am trying to convince her that we can do it. Writing letters, speaking to her. 

I feel lost and alone in a town I moved a couple of months ago. Life doesn't seems worth anything. 

I feel like dying, on the inside.

She just lives her live as we live together.

And I am here, slowly rotting away."
lonely,Just a vent....,"Just a vent.... - Came to a striking realization that I will be lonely for the remainder of my time on this rock.  

I'm in a 19+ year marriage, known her for 22 years.  But the last couple have been awful for me.  She basically has relegated me to a life of working to support her and the kids(16/10) and that's my life.  Work to earn money to provide her with her convenient lifestyle so that she never has to really exert herself.  This is my fault for allowing this for so long.  

I'm not happy, I no longer love her.  But due to our situation where we live, etc, divorce and what it would cost me would be a near death sentence for me.  At least now I get to exist.  

But I saw a picture yesterday on FB of a woman I have known for a few years.  Her and I get on like...literally it's just near perfect how we get along.  But she's in her relationship, I'm in mine.  She lives about 200 miles away from me too.  I believe if we were both single something might come of it.  But the picture said it all...she's never, ever going to be available to me.  

As they say plenty of fish in the sea...but this is a unicorn.  She's a unicorn.  Who knows...might not work out even if....but the hop has been there for a while that maybe if I can get a couple ducks in a row, and escape without becoming homeless that something could develop....but this picture just crushed that loneliness home that I will never, ever be in a happy relationship.  Not one that I deserve.  

Honestly it was one of the more crushing moments of my life.  Nothing anyone did to me...but just the realization that this is as good as it gets.  

Thanks for coming to my TED talk."

lonely,Gonna be better me in 2020!,"Gonna be better me in 2020! - Yeah... It maybe sounds like a basic stereotype of the every year, but I really want to change.

I'm kinda sad and slightly depressed, because next year I'll be 18. I've never been in relationship or never been kissed by girl even through girls often say that I'm pretty good and charming guy. I can speak to girls but I can't talk to my crush or even say some nice romantic things because I'm shy.

So... With start of 2020 (new decade) I'll try to change a lot of things. I'm not a fool, I actually have my style of clothes and I think I'm pretty interesting and gentle person (my dream is to be a true classy fashioned gentleman). Also I'm gonna move from my mother's to my dad's house, so that will be start of my improvement. I'll try to meet new girls, be less shy and maybe even find a gf. I have a lot of plans for 2020.

So... Who's going to start a new decade to be better yourself with me?"
lonely,Hello lonely people!,"Hello lonely people! - I was lonely my entire life, never had any friends, wasn't invited on any birthday parties, and pretty much suffered from it. I got over it. I'm a firefighter, and this job keeps me from breaking, because of much more pain I'm witnessing every day. I got over my loneliness and now I'm totally fine with the fact of being alone for the rest of my life. I feel paceful and relieved when I'm with nature. I decided to build a small house somewhere in the woods, far, far away from the other people, that I can live a quiet happy live not worrying about loneliness."

lonely,This time of year,"This time of year - Does anyone feel more lonely than normally at this time of the year? People at work always talking about their plans with friends and family, plans for the new year, etc - it really gets me down, much more so than normal, and the people I do count as friends (mostly living far away) are too busy to talk to me too.

I'm not anti social, I went out with some people from work last weekend and had a good time but they won't ask to socialise with me until next Christmas probably. 

I just don't feel like I belong as I've only ever had a few people in my life who wanted to spend time with me as much as I did with them, but they've all moved on now for various reasons. True friendships seem to be more serendipitous in my experience, few and far between, arising from nowhere and disappearing just as unexpectedly.

Anyone else feel similar?"

Being alone isn’t biggest fear but right now it’s all I want?  I think about loading my car up and abandoning everyone behind and starting anew somewhere else?

lonely,Is it possible that I don't do anything wrong but still have people that find me unlikable?,"Is it possible that I don't do anything wrong but still have people that find me unlikable? - I don't have friends (also lovers ofc), never had one.  and a lot of people always tell me that I am unlikable, but I usually tend to care about my own business. 
It's not that I am selfish or stuff like that, actually I try always to be helpful and kind, but still everyone thinks I am mean and that I will be alone, even if I don't see why. Nobody with me tries to give me a chance. Far now I have accepted the fact that I will be always alone, but sometimes I wonder if is it possible that EVERY PERSON I met is actually crazy and mean, or if actually I am the mean one."

I don’t understand what happened. Everything seemed fine. We were talking and seemed like we were going to keep talking. I know how bad it seems to be posting this but I don’t know what else to do. Maybe I got too attached. We didn’t even know each other that long but we both said it seemed like we knew each other much longer. 

We started talking on discord right after reddit. You got sick of it and moved to telegram. We talked for hours on the phone. I tried not thinking about her but fuck me I guess. I know this is probably futile but I gotta atleast try. You said you’d text me in the morning and I’m still waiting. 

I’m only posing here because I know she frequents this sub. 

If the world was ending you’d come over right?"

For the sake of feeling the Christmas vibe, for the sake of getting some fresh air... Maybe just to get some mulled wine! I've seen the pretty market on the news... But my energies are all over the place, I'm heartbroken, sleep most day... I need to be a kind of comfortable to go, I just have no idea how... Scared to leave my house, my pets... Scared to take the bus for two hours... I've been laughing a bit to myself: ""I might just go on the farris wheel alone haha!"" but it's not the funniest idea at all times...   
How ~~the hell~~ do I get brave enough to go? How will I not feel incredibly ashamed? By myself, with so many people around... How could I even enjoy it? If I get back home and didn't have a good time, idk how well that will sit...   
I'm scared but I know the regret would haunt me for *months*...

lonely,Made a huge commitment,"Made a huge commitment - Hey guys, I am 19M  and I am going to be shipping to US Army basic training within 20 days! I currently have almost no social life whatsoever... It's prolly because I came from Korea originally, so I couldn't speak English properly, so I isolated myself from non-Korean people.

Recently, I got almost fluent with English, thankfully! And yeah lol. I am still technically required to enlist in the mandatory Korean military service but I don't have to if I join the US military.

 I never really had a girlfriend in my life before, and I don't have that many close friends ATM so I decided to join the Army. I'm fairly good at making friends, so hopefully this shit works out fine. I'm also joining because I am very interested in firearms, tactical military shits (lol), and want some new experiences. My MOS is a combat mos (19D, cav scout) and hopefully I could make some good lifelong friends and memories. 

Even if I do die, it won't be as painful as suicide to my parents and close relatives. And I don't have a GF so there's no way I could make her sad."
lonely,Accepting never finding love.,"Accepting never finding love. - I accept it by recognizing that not everyone was born to be loved. Some of us will live a sad and lonely existence. Our lives will be forgotten. We are the lives poets feared. 
You will most likely find people here telling you, don’t worry there’s always someone for somebody. They know and most importantly you know most of us will never find true love. The only advice I have is to just suffer through it, but do the dignified thing and not accept the pity people give you. I’m not saying don’t be happy. At least you could live knowing you aren’t lying to yourself."

I have always been a good guy at school, nice, charismatic, calm and so on
The classic ""friend of all"", approximately
Despite this, both in high school and now at university, every time I come home I feel alone and excluded from everyone 
As long as I follow the lessons, I'm in class and I'm in the university with the old classmates I know from high school, I keep laughing and joking, I'm in company and I'm fine

Then when I get home I realize I'm alone. Nobody chat with me, unless rare situations, or call me
And it makes me sick, it makes me feel lonely
Every time I start thinking that all of this is useless, at the end of everything I will be alone and that, the group of people that I know since high school, when it will be everything over, will go

Just seeing others who socialize without problems with other students, unlike me who do a thousand of problems, who are making friends on friends between various work groups while I can't talk and tie up with anyone makes me think and feeling blue"

lonely,Has anyone else developed really high standards,"Has anyone else developed really high standards - For years I've been the “Friend” that never actually is included. I've had glimmers of hope but I'm always let down. I'm a good conversationalist and a happy, optimistic guy when in social situations but here I am, utterly friendless.

This has caused me to have pretty high standards for me to make the effort. You see, 99.99% of the time if I meet in person or talk to someone new (online) my mind is already telling me how it's likely going to go. We might get along well, have things in common etc but ultimately I'll be a complete afterthought to them once that particular conversation has ended. So now I don't give it my full effort, hell I barely give a quarter, to trying to build the friendship further. It's just going to end in disappointment right? So why cause unnecessary sadness.

Online in particular, unless the other person seems super in to keeping in touch and clearly puts effort in to responses, I don't bother at all. 

I know this can cause me to miss out potentially, but my mindset now is “If they really want to be friends, they can make the extra effort initially, then I'll reciprocate”. This isn't to say I'm now standoffish or introverted etc when talking for the first time, I just won't be the person to message first after that or invite them to do something.

Anyway, I just wanted to know if anyone else is the same and if anything changed?"

I was made to be alone I think, but I don’t want to be alone... because I don’t want to be forgotten. I want someone smile when they hear a joke I told too much by another when I’m long dead. It’s so painful that I created this mask for myself to become more friendly, at this point I can’t take it off. Not that I won’t but I CANT, anything underneath has rotted away. I am the mask now.

lonely,Conflicted,"Conflicted - I’m always in kind of a war with myself. Do I reach out and talk to someone, or keep it to myself. Someone once mentioned to me that I’m an attention seeker when I’m trying to get help. That’s really all I can think about now. On the other side, if I keep it to myself, it’s pretty damaging. Idk who to talk to so I think I’ll just vent here.

The past few nights I’ve been having a lot of body issues. A. Lot. I’ve been weighing the pros and cons of starving myself. If I do, then I would get my ideal body. However I would negatively impact my health. But I have this obsession and need to be a thinner person than I am right now. I could die of starvation if I take it too far. But then again I’m not really too scared of death. Or heart attacks. Or impaired cognitive function. 

I’ve also been bingeing a shit ton. I hate myself for it but I can’t stop. I’ve never been diagnosed with an eating disorder. I don’t want to self diagnose like I’ve seen others do before from one look on webmd. But I really wonder sometimes. Is my relationship with food just strange? Or is something wrong with me? 

I was also thinking about how I want to starve myself and how it’s maybe a form of self harm for me. It’s scary to think that I’m in a place like this where I feel the need to do this. But I. I feel really hopeless. Ya know.. I have never been one to harm myself until recently. I know I have so much to live for. Sometimes I feel really confident in myself. Sometimes I feel happy and that I’m just as beautiful. But other times I look in the mirror and see myself as a dysfunctional michelin man. 

I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital 2 months ago and it didn’t help at all. And I have this horrible fear of going back. But somehow in my fucked up mind, that fear turns into depression and guilt and then I have these self destructive thoughts. I’ve told a friend and they calmed me down in the midst of a depressive episode but it keeps continuing. Nights after nights. I can’t go back to the hospital. That in itself should be enough of a motivator to stop myself. But maybe I deserve it? Another 3 weeks in there to deprive myself of the outside world.

Idk what the point of this is. Tempted to just delete this and not let it see the light of day. But I need to get it off my chest. If you read this, thanks I guess."

lonely,Rinse and repeat,"Rinse and repeat - For me the cycle of loneliness has been going for over 3 years now.

Everything is fine everybody, I'm totally over my divorce and fine living all alone with my dog who's going to die of cancer soon. 

Friday evening rolls around, time to relax! No, it's time to use marijuana to forget about your loneliness and force yourself to finally eat food. Eat healthy? Oh no, you're going to binge eat so bad that you nearly throw up. Saturday comes, time to go expel all that nasty food by exercising til your feet hurt hiking 20 miles. Come home, time to abuse my body again with marijuana and binge eating, anything to distract from that loneliness. 

Sunday? No work or exercise, just get stoned and forget about being lonely once again. Fuck it's Monday again and I have to go to work, oh well, start the cycle again. 

I have a good life, good physical health which I'm slowly destroying, plenty of money, no debt, big house in the expensive city, no worries. But I'm slowly killing myself because of loneliness in this cycle of faux control. I believe I have control but I don't. The loneliness has control of me. I'm afraid to get hurt again.  

I've gone on dates, I've tried meetups, my family moved away and my friends have families now, no time for me. Why can't I make friends, why am I afraid to be social?  I have my dog, but she will be gone soon and I'm fucking scared as hell. 

Nobody really reads these things, but I just needed to vent. Being lonely sucks and the cycle of it is very exhausting. But here we are."
lonely,It still amazes me how many people are single. I can't figure out why,"It still amazes me how many people are single. I can't figure out why - Why are relationships so difficult to obtain? There are more single people now than ever. It really makes me sad because I've been patiently looking for the right one for quite some time now. I'm not super active getting to social events or clubs like everyone keeps suggesting but I do make a move when someone catches my eye. I'm a guy and enjoy the excitement of talking to a crush. I'm just tired of being disappointed. 

I just can't figure out why it's so difficult. I would like more than anything to spend my time with a significant other. I was reading about being ""touch starved"" and it's definitely how I feel. It's like I haven't had physical affection in ages that it's killing me inside. I know more people feel this way than they care to admit but I don't really see anyone doing anything about it. Is everyone feeling hopeless?

Please don't say love yourself first either. Or ""Stop looking for it"". I'm not narcissistic but I don't hate my self image or anything like that. That will certainly help others but it just doesn't apply to me. I'm getting so close and it's slipping through my fingers. Obviously  you won't find anything at all if you aren't looking for it which is why I can't stand that phrase."

Is it too much to ask that one's best friend calls them back when they say they will? Or that they send a simple ""hey, I'm busy"" text when I call and they don't answer? So many times, we'll be on the phone and they'll cut it short, then act as if they're going to call me back later but never do 90% of the time. I feel like I have one ""actual"" friend and they don't even like me that much. Usually I'd blame myself (I'm definitely to blame for the loss of some past friendships) but they have often randomly told me what a good friend I am, and I certainly try, so I'm positive it's nothing I've done this time.

Is this more normal than I think? Do most best friends act like this? I feel legitimately embarrassed to contact them now because I feel stupid when they don't answer, which is most of the time. 

My friends are the only part of life I enjoy, besides eating, sleeping, and occasionally music. The idea of losing a close friend scares me."

I start to feel lonely, then I feel like no one will ever be there for me, and I end up always crying at night because I also start to remember my ex. My last relationship ended so abruptly and it just hurts so much. I miss him, I feel hopeless, lonely, very sad, and just pathetic...I hate the night. I wish I didn't wake up in the morning. I want to sleep forever."

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

lonely,Lost the only real friend I've ever had. Being alone really sucks.,"Lost the only real friend I've ever had. Being alone really sucks. - I have no family I can talk to, and I've never really had any friends. But about a year ago, this one girl decided that I was worth the effort to be friends with. She was there for me through everything for a year. Several mental breakdown, one of them extremely severe. A lot of what I thought was emotional growth on my part, but it turns out I was just going soft.      
     
But then we had an argument the other day. She wanted to blame me for something that I had nothing to do with. And I argued back, trying to defend my innocence. And in the end it was too much for her, and just like everyone else in my life, she left. I've been blocked on all social media, most of which I created purely as a way to keep up with her when we couldn't meet up. I don't blame her, though. At some point, when something's happened often enough, you've got to start looking at the common denominator for the situation. And that just so happens to be me. It's not her fault I'm difficult to put up with. It's not her fault I'm an idiot. It's not her fault that dealing with me wears on people. If anything, she should be applauded for making it almost a full year. I just wish I wasn't such a freak and could handle people better. I just wish I wasn't such a freak and could find ways to not bug anyone. I just wish I wasn't such a freak and could actually figure out how to make people happy. But that's all I am. A freak. That's what everyone has always told me. My family when the decided I was too much. Every friend I've tried to make when it didn't work out. And they were all right. I'm a freak.      
     
Sorry about the rant, if anyone is still reading. I just had nowhere to go but Reddit, and hoped that someone out there would be able to say something that might help. But I probably don't deserve that help, so I'm sorry. You don't need to feel any obligation to say anything. After all, I'm just a freak."

We loved each other and she kissed me. It’s the only time I’ve felt love like that. I was so happy. But then she said she had to go, and that she couldn’t do this. So I poured my heart out in my dream. I begged her. I told her all the things I’d do for her. But I woke up and that was it. I hope my life gets better soon."

Be it sharing personal stories or simply asking me for weird history facts and memes, please do message me. My dms are open for all."
lonely,What’s your first thought when you get sent a text like this?,"What’s your first thought when you get sent a text like this? - Ok so This girl and I had known each other for a while now, we get on well in real life but on the internet she would ignore my texts, even though I only ever asked her about assignments and stuff regarding college. Anyways I managed to get her number (asked her irl) and sent her a text about class which again she would ignore. 

After a while I felt a bit disrespected and would completely blank her in real life when we see each other. You can tell she would look my way to say hi but I wouldn’t even give her eye contact. This continued for a few days, and one other time I felt like I overdid it because we were talking in a group and I was flirting with everyone in the room (mostly girls) without acknowledging her, and you can tell she was visibly upset. When I ignored her multiple times irl, I eventually greeted her. Then I sent her a bunch of texts basically apologizing but indirectly, saying “This is the last year of college, I don’t want you to be mad at me...i’ll delete your number and I don’t need you to respond, just be safe and good luck.”...she read the texts and actually called me on the phone, she was nice and explained to me that the reason she ignored my texts before was because she had a boyfriend and she is trying to respect their relationship by not talking to other male friends (even though my texts were only ever about class, it’s worth noting). I made sure I was understanding and we ended the call on a really good note. I honestly thought that was it...that she had a bf and I wouldn’t contact her ever, which I didn’t. 

But then another week later she texts me herself out of the blue and says “you’re a great person and if you need anything for class feel free to hit me up”, all after we had already cleared the air and everything was over (on a good note). Isn’t that text a bit weird or am I imagining things? I honestly just can’t tell.
 
How would u interpret a text like that? It’s been nearly 3 weeks since that text and I’m gonna move on anyways but I’m just curious to hear your perspective"

I feel so lonely and terrible constantly, everything hurts and I just wanna crawl in a hole and never leave - I have literally 0 friends, I have a girlfriend and she means a lot to me but I’m constantly scared of losing her. I always feel like I’m not enough and I’m too much to deal with, I’m incredibly socially awkward and have rly bad social anxiety. I can’t ever have a conversation with anyone even if I try, my head starts boiling with shitty thoughts about myself and I never really say more then a couple words. Due to my girlfriends parent situation I’m only able to see her 1-2 times a week, she has a lot of friends and sees them pretty often and it just makes me feel bad about myself. She always encourages me to go and make friends but I just feel like I can’t, even when I genuinely try to. I’m always so scared of what they are going to think of me, and when I do make friends w someone I’m constantly in fear that I’m going to say the wrong thing or just seem boring and weird/awkward and I start to distance myself to avoid embarrassment or being made fun of. I can’t help it, I can never fight my anti-social tendencies. I’ve been suicidal and depressed as could be for years now and don’t think I’ll ever make it past my twenties, I love my girlfriend so much and she’s really the only thing keeping me alive right now. But yet I find it so hard to tell her how I truly feel, she cares about me a lot and I don’t want to upset her Bc I care too much. I’m always in pain but I just put up a front that I’m completely okay all the time and it hurts so fucking much. Idk why I’m even saying this rn but I just needed to let it out cuz idk what to do w myself anymore, nobody talks to me, nobody likes me or cares about me but her. I just feel so alone, I want to hide in a hole and never leave. I just want to be normal for once and live a decent life instead of in fear and feeling constantly alone and depressed, even tho I have someone who’s there for me I just can’t get myself to tell her how badly I really feel about myself. She knows I’ve always struggled and still am but she has no clue how terrible it really is, which makes me feel even worse because I know I’m not honest with her when she asks how I’m doing or what’s goin on"

No girls like me, not in person, or even online. Sure, I get matches, but the girls ALWAYS have someone else they are already fucking and or texting so I don't matter. My parents always tell me ""you're a good looking kid"" even though I never had a girlfriend. I'm 6'4"", go to the gym as much as I can, have a great physique, but it's still not good enough for girls. It's like I'm invisible or something. I get matches on tinder, but they are ALWAYS flaky. I even get some snapchats and they leave me on read. But my friends go on tinder and they get talking to girls. Why not me? If I was out of shape, lazy, and weird then I would understand. 

I'm in the car right now and thinking of suicide. I'm 20 years old and I just want a solid relationship but I feel like every girl I talk to has a few fuck buddies and plenty of other guys hitting her up so I don't matter for shit. You hear that, guys? A 6'4"", white, built, ""handsome"", guy and he isn't banging all the girls people claim guys like me would.

Maybe if I was born elsewhere. It's too late now and I feel like such a fucking outcast it hurts."

I’ve got a few friends and co workers that I interact with on a daily basis. I just feel so alone. There’s only one person that can take the emptiness out of my life. She recently told me she’s involved with someone else. Literally in October she was living with me and telling me that our souls are connected and how she’s undyingly loyal to me. I had to go away for a few months so I suggested she go stay with her parents while I was gone. She took that as some sort of betrayal. She became less and less loving in our short conversations while I was gone. Finally I asked if she was seeing someone else and she said, “something like that” and ended the convo shortly after. How could it go from me being her everything in October, to her being with some other guy in December? Is it possible she felt abandoned and lonely and us just acting out? Or is it indicative of her general feelings toward me? It’s out of my character to be so upset over a girl, but like I said. She’s very special to me and I thought I was special to her. Any insight would be appreciated. And if there are any F that would like a distraction or an escape via phone call, I’m looking to connect with someone on that level tonight.

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

My passion is cooking. And besides that I love to read, having conversations, grabbing coffee on a rainy Sunday, watching sports and play some games on my ps4.

lonely,Everything feels so pointless,"Everything feels so pointless - I was never a very social person. The first few years I was out of work, the being alone and very rarely ever talking face to face with someone didn't really bother me, I had a few friends I would talk to online, and one I would meet up with for lunch a few times a year. That was enough to keep me content, but things are different now. The closest thing I have to a friend doesn't seem to want to talk to me, we went from talking almost daily to me having to fight to get more than a few sentences out of them once every few weeks. The only thing that changed was that my father died, and I don't see how that would have changed anything. I don't know if I did something wrong, or said something wrong, but I'm getting tired of trying with them. The only person who will talk to me now is my mother, who I love dearly, but it's not quite the same. It's hard meeting people when I feel like I only ever leave the house for doctor visits. I'm not disabled enough to where getting out and going places is that big of a deal, but I can't stand going places by myself.

I'm sitting here thinking that it's been 6 years since I met up with a friend for lunch, 17 years since I've even went to see a movie. Thinking about how great it would be just to have someone to go have lunch with 3 or 4 times a year. Ranting on a website where no one will really care, hoping that typing my frustration out might make me feel better. It's not."

I need someone to talk to. I am too conscious about what other might think about me.. maybe I am a desperate thirsty guy?... I have abundance of feelings I want to share with someone and be just vulnerable and without holding any guard.... Want to surrender my soul as it is, to someone. But too afraid to be broken away...

lonely,It's been a while,"It's been a while - I was broken up with abiut a month and a half ago. My girlfriend told me she doesn't love me anymore and was leaving. This was the 5th time she tried to leave in 7 months we lived together. She didn't sleep with me for 6 months and we took a month off at one point to work on stuff. We moved in together and she just became my roommate and a shitty one at that. I feel so worthless and lonely. The last time I was touched was on my birthday 3 weeks ago when, for some stupid reason I got dinner with my ex, where she told me I wasn't worth trying to work on any of her problems.

She moved back in with her parents and is storing all the stuff at the house we rented together. I have to live amongst her stuff until the lease runs out in 4months. I feel so empty and lonely every day that I walk in the front door. It's like I just get punched in thw face with pain and loneliness. 

I have friends but they have lives and things. I play hockey twice a week and try to do little things, but I can see my passion N. I'm lonely at my little cubicle job and lonely in the now empty house. My dog keeps me company but moving, but I just can't get take days of not talking to people and certainly being touched.

lonely,Unanswered questions from past affecting my present and ramping up the loneliness.,"Unanswered questions from past affecting my present and ramping up the loneliness. - Bear with me......

I lost my partner about 3 years ago. We were both head over heels in love. Or so I thought. 

We were long distance for a bit as she had to move for work. So there were times we didn’t see each other for weeks and due to her shift patterns. 

Now I knew she had male admirers but I always thought that she stayed faithful and loved me and she wasn’t the type to cheat. We had talked about things and she always reassured me that nothing ever happened with anyone else despite at least one guy making a pass. 

However since she died things have been popping into my head that with the passing of time might cast doubt and the odd thing I have over heard make me think that she wasn’t faithful. Of course, since she has passed away I will never know and it is the not knowing that is KILLING ME. Not a day goes by where I don’t play some scenario in my head where she cheated on me. 

I can’t talk about this to anyone as it’s all just hypothetical and I wouldn’t want to tarnish her memory on doubts. 

The thought that the person I loved could have hurt me and betrayed me like this is stopping me making any new connections and is pushing my few existing friends away as I’m always in my head thinking about it and seeing as how she’s gone I will never know so I fear that I am on a never ending downward spiral of loneliness"
lonely,Being a parent is lonely....,"Being a parent is lonely.... - People always say that when you have kids you’ll never be alone again.

I guess that’s true in the sense that you’ve always got your kids, until they grow up that is.
The thing is though is that no one really talks about the fact that, while it’s amazing being a parent, it’s incredibly lonely. 

Friends you once had drift away when you have kids and they aren’t at that point in their lives yet. Going out is almost impossible, and even then the whole outing is usually spent worrying about the kids at home, did they brush their teeth? Are they behaving? Are they looking for mummy or daddy to tuck them in with a bedtime story? All these things make it feel like it’s easier to stay home.

Do other parents feel like this? Or is it just me?"

I end up just sat there, procrastinating about what could have been with past relationships. Think about how I need to change... But nothing I do/think ever comes to tuition. I just seem to be stuck in a loop, I try and reach out to my friends and I make plans. Then I'll cancel them the day before, pretty sure they've given up on me. I think about my ex with other men, when she cheated on me and I should be glad she's out of my life. But it doesn't stop me from blaming myself about the way I am and how I look. I feel lonely, even though I have a great family/friend support but I feel like they don't truly understand me.

At 4 am. I feel I am in a unique situation in life, not necessarily a bad one, but very painful for me, and very distinctly lonely. I feel estranged from my siblings, and my closest cousin just died. This confused me a lot and put an even deeper wedge between my family and I, and I think it’s because I blame myself and feel I can never make anyone happy or that I ruin people’s lives. I have had two really bad breakups over the past 6 years which were really depressing for me. I’ve made and lost a few close friends over the years but I find it very hard to work my way through this depression, and the stress of my job (teaching) gets to me which just brings me down more. It’s hard for me to make a friend. I doubt myself. I know the benefits of thinking positively but right now life does not seem worth it. I think I’m a really boring, semi-useless person. The only person I can really keep happy is myself and that’s not even really working very well. Not trying to be negative, but I just feel this so hard on nights like tonight, when things don’t make any sense, and I feel worthless and spineless."

I've tried going to bars, the belt line, and a few other things but Jesus I don't know how to talk to people without feeling like I'm being a fucking creep or something. I started going to the gym and that was good but then work got busy so I fell off that bus and need to get back to it. 

The only dates I was ever able to set up ended up cancelling and I'm definitely not attractive enough for tinder. I'm okay looking average but just nothing great. 

I feel like I'm caught in this stupid cycle of being lonely so I don't go out anymore because I don't have any friends it things to do. So then I fail to make friends.

I feel weird saying this but Jesus I haven't had someone touch me in a friendly or intimate way in three years.

lonely,I Am Only Friend Material and it Hurts,"I Am Only Friend Material and it Hurts - I have always had low confidence and have been shy but during 2019 I have been making a big effort to break out of my shell. 

I joined bumble back in August when my friend suggested I join and started meeting people off of there and going on dates. I have been on and off the app ever since in a cycle of deleting the app when I am frustrated and downloading it when I am lonely.

After going out with guys from various backgrounds I learned a lot about other cultures and potential hobbies. 

It was an interesting experience and I no longer am scared of first dates but it did chip away at my self esteem.

I can never get past 2 dates besides the one time I was lucky enough to go on a third. Usually I end up getting ghosted. 

I asked one guy what happened and he told me that I came of as wanting to just be friends.

In middle school and high school I was never anyones crush and I didn’t start dating until I was 18 and reconnected with an old friend via Facebook who later became my boyfriend and now ex. So my dating expertise sucks. 

I can’t flirt for one thing and I am not receptive to it. For me to realize that a guy is interested in me I need him to outright say it so I find internet dating so convenient because its pre established after the first swipe.  I am not comfortable touching a guy I am just getting to know unless its a hug because generally I am not a touchy feely person. My compliments don’t go beyond a compliment on my dates outfit. 

I have done the calculations and  concluded that there is a 21% chance my date and I will kiss regardless of the amount of dates we go on. 

After much thought I realized that dates for me are similar to when I go out with my friends but I would like to have at least some resemblance of a friendship before I feel comfortable doing any sort of PDA or sexual contact.

This as a result has led to me being ghosted and I recognize that I am not fast enough.

It hurts though because I feel like I am not relationship material. 

Although I have a diverse group of friends to go out with that I have maintained for years. It does hurt to know that I can’t go out with someone for more than a few weeks before it fizzles into nothing.

I workout, improved my diet, have gained new hobbies, and have worked on my professional life but the one thing that hurts is the fact that I am not enough."
lonely,Stuck in a lonely but close friendship,"Stuck in a lonely but close friendship - I’ve had this friend for multiple years by now, and we’ve grown so close together that we can share some of the deepest aspects of ourselves with each other without batting an eye. 

Over the past couple months, we’ve grown increasingly distant despite remaining close. I’ve come to realize how dependent I am on this person for some form of relief, because they’re one of the most natural and genuine connections I’ve ever experienced. 

Sometimes, knowing that we’re not exactly as close anymore but never going to not be that level hurts so much. It’s like I’ve reached a neutral point where I have the option to salvage our relationship or move on. But it’s so difficult to move on, we both feel like we need each other and yet we’re inhibiting each other. 

I just want to talk to someone and feel less lonely, because the closest person to me is so distant now that somedays I don’t think I can quite function with how utterly lonely I feel."
lonely,None of the others I loved ended up loving me,"None of the others I loved ended up loving me - I cannot believe that this will be part of the actual story of my life. It could have been the story of why it ended short. The invention of money solved the problem of barter, that is, the problem of the coincidence of wants. I have what they want and they have what I want. In my life when I met others that had what I wanted, themselves of course, I did not have what they wanted (my self was not what they wanted.) If only there were a common thing that we could trade our value for and then use it to get what we desired from others so that there didn't need to be this coincidence of wants. Trade was so hard before money was created. And this problem regarding love has not been resolved so we can go our entire lives without finding someone with whom to trade ourselves and in so doing experience true love and true harmony. Life will be so much more worth living in the day that this can be overcome. As for now, if my life completes without ever finding at least one true case of a coincidence of deep desire with a mate then it will have been a strange life indeed. There are few places outside of relationship to find the significance that relationships possess for us. Great achievements might but they are rare and difficult. If someone does find a person of significance though they would probably not trade that person for the greatest achievement you can think of. We see our significant others as truly priceless and unexchangeable. None of the individuals that I loved with all my heart ended up loving me at all... Guffaw."

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."
lonely,A few things,A few things - I have only really have one close friend. It sucks because the are an online friend and not someone who is always there for me. I think about them all the time so I haven’t been able to connect with other people. I am sorry I’m not good at talking about myself. I cry myself to sleep every night because I don’t know what to do. I been feeling it more now but I really wish I didn’t exist. Sometimes the world just seem too big. I’m still a bit young so people often tell me it will better when I get older but I see people going through the same thing. I don’t know it’s just another day no one will remember me. I guess I’ll sleep at least then the thoughts go away for a few hours.
lonely,I don't know how I'll keep going if I end up alone on my 21st.,"I don't know how I'll keep going if I end up alone on my 21st. - So my 21st birthday is coming up after Christmas, and I'm paranoid and panicked at the prospect of possibly having to spend it alone. Me and my boyfriend broke up earlier this year, and I feel worthless, empty, and perpetually lonely in a way I can't ignore.

A little backstory - after ruining my reputation in my hometown following a traumatic event in my early teens that I'd rather not get into, I finished high school and knew I had to get AWAY for college. I got a great scholarship offer to a far-away 2-year college and immediately fell in love with the school. Even though I loved everything about the college, my freshman year kind of sucked due to me being incredibly awkward, horrible at meeting people and making real friends, and I guess just not the type of person most people like to be friends with, not even my roommate who I actually already knew even though she went to a different high school. Honestly, my boyfriend was what kept me holding on.

A little bit into my sophomore year, however, everything changed. Through my new roommate who was a year behind me in school but chronologically a few weeks older, I met the most absolutely amazing, incredible people. Having this group of friends quite literally gave me the will to live and the strength to stop relying on self-harm while I was away at school. When me and my boyfriend broke up, I lost all sense of self-worth and have since felt like I'm just making everyone's lives just a little bit shittier by existing. To be honest, if it wasn't for these friends, I have no idea how I would have gotten through me and my boyfriend's split. 

All of that joy, security, and sense of belonging I got from being there was ripped away from me when I had to transfer to a 4-year college to finish my degree back home in Illinois. I initially loved the idea of starting at a 2-year since this particular one had agreements with so many 4-years, so it was okay that I didn't know exactly where I wanted to finish my degree. Now, I feel like my life has just been a slow but sure downward spiral since leaving my first college. None of my friends or family know this, but I have been making myself throw up after eating occasionally and relapsed into self-harm again just to get through all the emotional pain.

My BFF from the first college and I have talked quite a bit about going out together for my 21st since she's already 21. I want so badly for this to happen, but she lives just over an hour away and I'm scared possible winter weather is going to ruin the chance of that happening. Also, the last time we talked, she just didn't seem very excited about it anymore, idk. I only talk to 3 people from back home, and two of them are going to be out of the state visiting family, and the other has to work at night so could only join in for a short while for dinner or something. I'm also completely terrified that BFF will end up thinking I'm a loser for only having 1 (or possibly 0) friends to join in in my hometown. Other friends from my first college aren't really a possibility because so many of them live so far away, and some of them are fighting amongst each other right now, which utterly breaks my heart.

I just feel like spending my 21st alone will force me to acknowledge that I'll never have my relationship back and never have a group of friends like that again, which, in my mind, translates to me being lonely and sad forever. The one BFF I mentioned (possibly 1 other person? idk) is the only person I feel comfortable enough reaching out to and actually trying to spend time with. If I tried to reach out to the others, who I love just as much, I would just feel like I was being annoying. A couple people are actually transferring to the same college I'm at now, but I know we won't be there forever. We'll inevitably go our separate ways and, as bad as I want to, I won't be able to hold onto them forever. I'm too fucked up and sad to keep going indefinitely, and I feel like I'm just postponing it at this point. It's so pathetic that there are people out there who would kill to be living in my life, and I'm just lonely and sad and cutting myself all the time. I feel like I'm taking up valuable space in this world while just being a complete inconvenience to everyone. 

If this happens, then I have to acknowledge that me finding these people and feeling worth something for once was just a fluke. I'm just too fucked up in the head (and other places) to keep living. I'm one of those people that is just naturally annoying and repulsive, and I haven't been able to figure out how to change that so far. It's just that for a short little while there happened to be a few people able to see past it.

I would never tell anyone that I'm feeling this way, because that's entirely too much pressure to put on someone's friendship. I can't keep denying that my life is going to be a lonely one, and the nightmares won't stop. I can feel my will to live slowly slipping away, and I won't be able to hold on much longer if I end up alone on what is supposed to be a celebration of life with the ones you care about. 

I guess I'm just posting here to see if anyone has any similar experiences or can relate at all. I promise I'm not looking for sympathy even if it may read that way.

Tl;dr: If circumstances cause me to spend my 21st alone, I'll have to acknowledge that I've always been lonely and fucked up as a person, and always will be. There's only one awful, terrifying way out."
lonely,Lost. Lonely. And slowly dying.,"Lost. Lonely. And slowly dying. - My name is Preston I'm 20 years old and I have a hard time connecting with people. I have a lot of insecurities and  I'm also really shy. I've never been in any type of relationship , and I don't have any friends I hangout with I'm kind of a loner. I never really ""fit in"" I've always been on the outside looking in. I honestly find it hard to keep a conversation going. Idk maybe my brain stopped working its hard for me to even think. Most of the time idk what's going on I have to really concentrate just to type this. Something's wrong with me I think I keep screaming but no one listens. I feel stuck in the darkness like the light will never shine upon me. And honestly I'm okay with it. I just can't deal with the loneliness its slowly killing me. I'm losing hope, losing sight of my goals."

lonely,What the fuck? (a lesson in vomiting and sadness),"What the fuck? (a lesson in vomiting and sadness) - I am currently writing this while sitting beside a vomit stained toilet. This really sucks. I had an awesome friend and we decided to take a break for finals and so she can spend time with her new boyfriend, who is awesome but I feel separated. I tried texting her last night for the first time in a month and no response. She tried to call me, and as soon as I answered the connection cut out, making me feel gutted. And all the while she is posting pictures of herself with her boyfriend. We've been friends for years, since the first grade and being separated from her sucks. Its been a week since she started ghosting me and I try not to seem clingy though maybe I should. It just got too much today and I began crying and then I had a headache and in the middle of a sad nap I woke up choking on my own vomit. And now I'm here. Alone. Again. fuck. We had known each other since the first grade and we weren't always friends. I was almost always feeling lonely and I thought I had my shit handled until she started this. I don't know what I did. I just wish I knew. I was used to being alone, I could roll off the physical and mental abuse I received and still do receive on a daily basis at High School. But now I feel empty. Excuse me while I furiously punch the wall and then cry again. Fuck."
lonely,Afraid I’ll stay this way forever (21F),"Afraid I’ll stay this way forever (21F) - The happiest I’ve been in life was when I felt connected and close to other people. I have a few friends that I love, but I’ve been depressed and increasingly socially anxious the past few months and it’s like I’ve completely forgotten how to just be with them. Gradually, I’ve withdrawn from all my relationships, telling them “I’m not doing so well now, but let’s hang out when I feel better!” (knowing I’m never going to magically get better on my own, but isolating myself anyways.) It’s gotten to the point where I’ve avoided socializing for weeks or months on end, and the longer I go in isolation, the harder it is to present myself to other people. I’ve had periods of time when I felt more sure of myself, but generally, I’m really inhibited and unable to keep a conversation going naturally.

I’m just really lonely. I want somebody to talk to, to just feel close to, but I get in my own way. I don’t know why I’m posting here… I guess to rant about feeling lonely because I feel too ashamed to tell other people in real life how I feel.

I’ve made plans to hang out with one of my best friends this weekend, and I’m really nervous about it. Even with the people I should feel comfortable around, I’ve become awkward and shy.

I’m truly sorry for all the people on this thread who feel alone. Like it’s physically painful to feel lonely, and nobody deserves it, but the sad truth is, the lonelier you are, the harder it is for you to get the love and validation you need. (In my case, when I try to pull myself out of hibernation and socialize, I end up becoming even more aware of how isolated I’ve been. It’s like starving so much that eating a bit of food will make you sick.)

Anyways, (on that depressing note haha) please feel free to message me! I like to (mediocrely) draw and paint so if you have any suggestions I may or may not draw and send them to you."

I need some advise, if anyone else has experienced this. I feel like I need a girlfriend to fix this, just someone I can cuddle with and stuff, I think it’s cause I need lack the feeling of being intimate with someone

I know it sounds like a stupid problem, and that I should just be happy with all of my loving friends and family, but I feel like I need something more. Has anyone of you ever experienced this?"
lonely,How do you exactly 'click' with someone?,"How do you exactly 'click' with someone? - The obvious answer is, you can't really control it, you just have to hope you have enough in common.

But social skills, confidence and ability to manage social anxiety &amp; depression obviously play a huge role in the ""clicking"" process. As well as having a fairly well-rounded life, being pretty, having several hobbies and interests (but even people without hobbies have close friends!), being physically fit, having a lot of personal stories to tell, and so on.

And all I can't help but think about is how alone I feel in comparison, it does hurt, I feel my heart-aching knowing that I haven't been so lucky in finding love myself. That nobody has seen me in that way, that I've never been meaningful to anyone... 

I know it sounds pathetic, I feel pathetic, which is why I can't bring this up to anyone in real life. Who would I bring it up to anyway? I have no friends, apart from one, and she doesn't need to hear about this either..

lonely,Oh...,"Oh... - I don't want this to sound like bragging, as there is nothing for me to brag about. I don't feel more superior than anyone here, especially as this is rare for me. For the first time a friend noticed that I unfriended her on Facebook, and she realised this... she actually realised I unfriended her and sent me another friend request.

All my previous friends just up and left, once my head got in a dark place I wasn't able to respond to their messages as much, and this is usually what ends up destroying the friendships I've once had. If I can't contribute to the conversation, then it's making everything collapse. So instead of burdening her, I decided that maybe I'll save her the trouble and unfriend her myself, because I don't feel anyone would want to be around me when my mood's low. Not like this, it's unfair and wrong. 

But no, she realised that I removed her from Facebook. I never said anything, but she still noticed that I wasn't there. I feel guilt... it wasn't right for me to unfriend her, but this was never expected. I've never had a friend who cared this way, who cared enough to even bother. Usually if I stop messaging first, it's a que for them to leave. Suddenly they realise I'm not that important, so this would've been the perfect opportunity for her to leave, and I wouldn't have argued or hated her for it either... I would respect her choice and quietly wish her the best.

lonely,"Something that happened to me, and why it doesn’t matter.","Something that happened to me, and why it doesn’t matter. - So I met a great girl. Really cool, funny, and cute as hell. We hung out for awhile and then I wanted to take things in a romantic direction because she seemed to be enjoying my company. She not only turned me down flat, but told me she thought overweight people were disgusting. Now, I have posted a lot on this board so you guys may know that I’m rapidly dropping weight and went from almost 400 pounds to around 250. Still 50 pounds overweight, but working on it. The point of explaining that is that the weight comment was not devastating or anything. I’ve heard muuuuch worse and have had a lot of women interested in me since losing so much weight.

So, yeah, it hurt to be reminded by someone I was getting along so well with that I was still not ideal, but here’s why it doesn’t matter:

She asked if I was upset and I said I was sad. She asked why and I explained that I was really into her her rebuke was disappointing. We parted and I went to the gym and then home. Life kept going. Today I had a really cute checker I work with grab my arm and say I was starting to get ripped. I am moving forward. The injuries still hurt, but loneliness is not a foregone conclusion anymore. My college classes start soon and I’ll probably meet tons of great girls.

So please, everyone. I know it seems dark now, but keep up your self-improvement. The light in the darkness will come. I promise."

I would love to make everlasting friendships firs. And maybe even a relationship if it comes to that. I don't care how far away you are. A true connection survives all borders.

Something about myself:

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

My passion is cooking. And besides that I love to read, having conversations, grabbing coffee on a rainy Sunday, watching sports and play some games on my ps4.

lonely,"Don't let people set boundaries for you, let yourself see through and make it possible to reach through.... ❤️","Don't let people set boundaries for you, let yourself see through and make it possible to reach through.... ❤️ - Boundaries. Boundaries are to be the biggest enemy of a human being. Boundaries where people trick your mind into limiting yourself to boundaries where people cross to humiliate you, make you feel in a certain way crossing the limits of a human being's humanity and morals disgracing the core values of humanity sending a person into a state of Anxiety and Depression. This has been the case with me and every person who goes through anxiety and Depression.

The human brain is not predictable so isn't it's thinking, but one thing can surely be said that most people can easily get into people's words and get discouraged easily, after all words cut sharper than knives inside the brain if taken to seriously and again that's something that happened with me too. A human forgets his/her true self and dwells into the discouraging thoughts these cruel people give rise to inside the brain through their hurtful, disgraceful and awful actions and the words they say to hurt people and they succeed when a person gives up and goes into his/her dark corners pulling himself away from the reality lost somewhere in the lost ruins of his/her mind. 

The thing here is, we tend to give up more easily and more often when easily persuaded and discouraged by people who like hurting people and make for their very own entertainment and jealousy of not wanting to see you excel in your life.

This inturn lowers a person's self confidence and in turn gives birth to to a state or depression and what arises in his/her brain through the change in their confidence and courage thereafter is known as ""ANXIETY"" which which comes in the way of everything, could come in many ways either through breakdowns, sudden heart beat rising out of increased fear due to lack of confidence when infront of a huge crowd or among people or sudden shivering, body turning cold and trembling and lowers his/her strength. 

Again happened with me!

In the end there's one thing a person should think and pull themselves back before it's too late. That what these people says and what the world wants you to be can't decide your way of living life or finding happiness and can't change your thinking, strengths and can't affect your aims because in the end you are like phoenix rising from your very own ashes everytime they try to burn you down because it's never too late even when you are cornered, all alone or even if it's you vs the world where you are all alone so be it and do whatever it takes and stand back on your feet rising up above and fighting it all for the world to witness your rise while these people remain where they are and realize in the end that hadn't they wasted their time into disgracing and pulling you down they'd have been somewhere better where you are and their shame, jealousy and regrets will be their end while you succeed.

Just chime in with your strengths and be that courageous master of your own life as you stand by giving your haters no attention what they want and those people coming in your way a gaze that will lower their confidence not yours because you don't deserve the anxiety and depression they want you to have . Nobody does. Find that one little thing that pulls you back in with more confidence and bounce back into this life that is precious and long enough to learn from and to grew into a stronger and better person.

I just did that. I found that one thing in my brain that arose in this darkest time, that one thing that I had that was going to revive me and that was my humor that was birthed in my brain during this darkest time when i had to find it and it made me feel happy and I felt as long as it makes me happy it's great and I don't care bout the rest when they come to pull me down they'll get a greater share of my actions. That's when I realized all of this what i talked to you about right now about depression and anxiety and stopped caring about what they said or did and if they ever came in my way I always give them that evil smirk and that gaze that lowers their confidence and an unending humorous take on them that makes lose their confidence and give up, declare me to be a mad person, mentally unstable or something else but deep down they now know that they cannot defeat me and that's where I have succeeded in driving them away from my life even when they get in my way through my strength, courage, unending faith in myself and this new found self.

You just gotta be strong. In the end you will succeed. All the very best for your life! And I'm always here to talk if you want to! :) 

Also here's a Discord server i made for people to talk and socialize breaking this wall of anxiety and Depression if you wanna join to socialize and make friends.

Normally I value my alone time and i actually prefer to spend time by myself because I feel like we all need time to ourselves. But lately I’ve been feeling lonely, like extremely lonely. I’ve had the same friends since I was 5 (18 now) and I feel like none of us ever hang out anymore. Literally the only time we all hang out anymore is when someone has the house to themselves and we all get together and drink/smoke/party. But I can’t remember the last time we hung out to just, hang? Even when we do get together, it’s always me that asks if everyone wants to chill. Take last weekend for example, we were all gonna get together and drink at my friend joshes. This time I didn’t offer to buy beer or anything and because of that when we got to joshes we realized that none of us  ever got alcohol so we had nothing to drink. I feel like they were subconsciously just expecting me to get it. I feel like everyone else at least has a few people that are their ride or dies and care about them.

They are physically around me but they cant seem to get inside and be with me. I still have no clue why. But 7 years ago, my ex-wife came into my life and right from the 1st moment we conversed, I no longer felt alone. She was there right beside me in my head and I was in hers. And for the entire duration of the past 7 years with her actively in my life, i didnt even for a second feel alone or lonely.

Watching my “friends” hang out with each other or with their families absolutely devastates me for some reason. Hope is patient. This happens every couple of months and each time the storm hits, it’s worse than before. Every time, I feel like I have less to live for. Everything that stresses me out usually becomes a hundred times worse. The idea of suicide, which was a tiny shadow in the back of my mind, becomes clearer and darker. It reminds me of that prison in The Dark Knight Rises. You think you’re so close to the light but you’re never able to make the jump, and it slowly drives you insane."
lonely,I am ok with not having a girlfriend.,"I am ok with not having a girlfriend. - I think there are worse fates. 

Like you could get a girl and she could be a nightmare or you could be born in a rough place like Yemen. 

I am ok with going places alone and being alone. I will spend the rest of my 30's traveling meeting people having fun going to concerts art museums fishing etc

When I am 40 I will buy a xbox and just hang out smoke weed and chill

I have nieces I can help raise and expose to sci art etc. I have already been doing that cause one of them has terrible parents. 

I have seen so many bad relationships that I am ok with being free.

Don't get me wrong it's not like I have a choice. I am not mgtow. I am mstow. Men sent their own way.  But I figure if no one is gonna wanna date me I should at least have fun and be happy.

I won't spend all my money on it and I know it's shallow and gross but I can always party with strippers. 

It's my fault I am being lonely. (This does not apply to everyone just me) I am so annoying and I am working on it. I googled how not to be annoying and found some great advice. 

I am fat and want to change that.

Every time I had friends I pushed them away with my terrible personalty and then I wondered why I couldn't find anyone to travel with.

NYE I am hoping a old friend who is maybe my last real one will go party with me. If not I will go party alone. I can keep from being annoying long enough to go out and party. I have done it before and had a great time and actually  partied with strangers. 

the only friends I have left are Scott who hates me and treats me like dirt so I only go to his house to buy weed. Plus Scott only cares about video games and never wants to leave his house Ken who is awesome but super busy cause we are in our 30's I am 32 and Steve who is a huge drunk and ruins everything I try to do with him. He has no job and only cares about drinking. 

I still love exploring the world and going to big music events and I am so happy I got off my knees years ago and decided not to beg for a women's approval. 

I don't hate women. There are some I look up to some who make amazing music I love and I don't care who they date or what they do as long as they make great art or make amazing sci breakthroughs. Women are just people and deserve to live a great life too. I have seen men be monsters so I know some women can feel so lonely even if they have a man. 

I am so happy I didn't have Reddit growing up or I might have found the Incel subs and got stuck in a terrible awful black hole. Plus I know life is unfair and hard because I saw my dad have to be a man in the face of a cruel world so I know I am not owed anything and if I can chill in a warm place I am lucky. 

I want to be a good person and help people so I also try and spend my time doing that but I am MLK Jr. Music reminds me I need to do this though. 

Of course I still have a great family great mom and dad and I can't imagine how hard it is for those who don't. All of this is just about me being lonely and if it helps someone get off their knees and realize they can still be happy alone then I will be happy with this rant."

Now usually I get home, head up the stairs and as soon as I shut my bedroom door I feel at peace. I can be alone with myself which is often where I’m happiest. Not tonight tho. Tonight I heads up the stairs, shut the bedroom door, left the lights off, collapsed on my bed and burst into tears. 

Why? I wanted a hug. Just a hug, someone to wrap their arms around me and say it was going to be okay. But there’s no one to hug, so I’ll fall asleep hugging my pillow instead. On the plus side though, today made up my mind that I need to quit my job next year."

lonely,a small problem!,"a small problem! - still a student here! i know my problem is a pretty small one but i can't get over it. it's strange. few years ago, i never had this problem. i could easily make friends and i would always have a close friend. i'm not really the type to confide in people but i do talk about small problems and it made me comfortable to know that i belonged somewhere. but now, whenever i get close to someone, there's just this nagging feeling that i can't get too close, and i would willingly distance myself from the person to go back to being normal friends (the kind where you're okay with talking to the person but you don't confide in). it keeps happening and i have given up on trying to make close friends. i do have friends but there's something holding me back from getting to know them better. i don't belong anywhere. i've resorted to spending my lunch break in the library to read instead of eat because i'm too afraid that people will judge me for being alone. there are times where my friends have asked me to join their friend group but i would get really nervous and guilty over intruding so i would end up declining (even if i had agreed initially). just needed to get it off my chest. thank you for bothering to read so far :)"

I feel like I was made to be social, I was made to build connections, I was made to make people laugh and feel good and be there for them. I’m an extrovert and always willing to be a people person as I mentioned. But all this aside, I (M18) feel like this life isn’t worth it... I’ve never been in a relationship nor have I ever been intimate with a person on a deeper level. Shoot, I haven’t even had my first kiss yet. And it kind of hurts because I’m in college, I look good, and all the other good stuff but I feel like my youth is being wasted because I’ve never dated or hooked up with somebody before. My friends are getting attention and they all have their own kinds of relationships and I’m here, just kind of watching them and supporting them, in hopes one day I can be as happy or as lucky as them. Is my social image / standing really worth it when indeed I truly feel alone? Everyday I have nothing and no one to look forward to seeing. This is probably why im a people person and always like to be social, because I have nothing besides that...? I feel so unwanted and ugly and feel like everything I try and do will amount to nothing. I’m not even looking for sex or anything like that, just someone who I can cuddle with and tell my problems and just be there for them and care for them in any way that I can. I just feel so alone and want something before my youth ends or at least learn something so I’m not old as f*ck and naive when it comes to relationships and love. Any tips, or ideas as to why this is so? Thanks &lt;3"

lonely,Do you ever think of me? Because I think about you all the time...,"Do you ever think of me? Because I think about you all the time... - Do you ever think of me?  Because I think about you all the time...

If you are here...you know who you are.  I just hope you don't hate me.  I just hope you understand what I am doing.  If you don't know what I am doing or why I am doing it, I would love to discuss it with you so you completely understand.  

Don't take anyone elses word for it.  If there is anyone we both know has said anything about me, it isn't necessarily true.  I'm the only one who truly knows my plan, but I am willing to share it with you and only you.

I have never tried to avoid you, I'm just keeping my distance while I am going through my plan.  My heart pounds so hard when ever there is a chance that our paths  cross.  I get so nervous too.  I am keeping my distance so I can focus on completing my plan and not get distracted because I need to complete it as soon as I can.

I only know one thing and that is I am risking everything, but I have to do this.  I may have completely lost my chance with you forever and that hurts a lot, but the alternative is going to drive me to places I don't want to go.

This plan is making me lonely and depressed, but the result keeps me driving forward.  This plan is going to make a lot of people mad, which could include you, but I'm going to have to risk it and ask for forgiveness later.

I just hope that what ever damage there already is and any damage that may happen in the future is repairable.  I've told you before how I feel about you and I still feel the same way about you.  I just pray that you are there too at the end of my journey.

Do you remember the question you asked me that I wanted to say ""Yes"" to but couldn't?  I hope that in the future sometime after my plan is complete, or almost complete, you will ask me that question again because I will say ""Yes"".  I regret saying no every single day.

You are my Lily...

""Always"" - Severus Snape"

None of the people I’ve had sex with were my boyfriend. None of them wanted a relationship with me. I was fine with that, up until now. I’m sick of being everyone’s fuck buddy. I want to be in a relationship. I want to feel loved. And before anyone says anything, yes I do love myself. No I’m not just looking for validation. All my friends are now in relationships and I’d love to have that too. I recently met a guy that told me he was looking for a relationship. We connected amazingly well and I thought this was it. But then he expressed some doubt and said that he wants freedom, doesn’t know if he can commit, etc. that upset me. He’s still affectionate towards me and texts me like he’s still interested in a relationship. We have a sleepover planned for tomorrow night and I’m kinda uneasy about it. I know that he’s just stringing me along. But I don’t want to cut him off. I can at least enjoy the night pretend he’s into me. But I guess I’ll always be the fuck buddy."

When somedays I feel happy but still feel wary, I become hyper aware of what my parents respond to me. 

So I was trying to bake, but felt anxious since I'm doing it where my parents around. Also I knew that my parent would make some sort of remark, because I'm rarely active around them. As I was measuring, one of my parent did eventually made a remark that felt like an insult to me. The remark was about me being on my bed all the time and that I do nothing helpful. I knew it was true and I dread hearing it again.

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

Long story short, the people that have graduated and moved on, we barely talk anymore. It's like I'm still in their past, but since we don't see each other, there's no reason to keep up. 

This has been a problem with most people in my life. Even when I texted first and initiated plans, I always get left behind. Then I start to think maybe my company was not enjoyed or maybe the friendship was not real.

lonely,Can someone help me make friends please. I really need some.,"Can someone help me make friends please. I really need some. -  

I was raised alone by my Father who did the best job he could with what he had, by one reason or another we would move houses and towns frequently, maybe once every 14 months on average and I really feel like this has impacted my approach when it comes to my social interaction. In the sense that, on a psychological level, I’m prone to not invest in people as friends because I’m used to having to leave all the time. 

I’m keenly interested in child psychology and I’m betting that not having any other long term bond other than my father has really shifted my perception on healthy relationships. I didn’t have any long term interaction with anyone apart from my father and grandmother. I was unintentionally kept from both my father and mother's side of the family because of the frequency that we would change location. 

I have definitely noticed this later on in my life as I started talking to girls. Anytime I liked one I would keep them an arms reach away or longer because of my subconscious need to not be attached to anyone other than my father, the one I knew wouldn’t leave.

I have noticed that I have been set up for mental and emotional failure now that I’m 21 with a somewhat adult brain able to conceptualize the effects of my upbringing. With a huge lack of an immediate and physical support network I’ve been left to figure out how to deal with life through the lense of one man which isn’t healthy in my opinion. 

There’s a reason people say it takes a village to raise a child, but most of my life up till I was 11 has been spent alone in my room. I’m still unsure of the effects of isolation on a child but to me an unhealthy mindset is a bomb with a very slow burning fuse, it’s hard to see it happening over the years but as of today, I can see I’ve begun life with a social handicap."

I'm super inexperienced sexually and sometimes I just want to say fuck it and fully immerse myself in sexual pleasure, at least as much as i can online. i try to find women who are willing to talk to me and basically just casually talk about sex in voice chat, share porn we like with each other, watch it together while chatting,ect.when seeking stuff out sexually online, people want kinks, or roleplay, or a performance. I just want to have a fucking conversation most of the time. Like I litterally just want to talk about it not put on a performance or have one performed for me

That fills me with guilt. But then I have nights like tonight where I just a few days ago said ""i'm done"" and deleted all my accounts, and have this hole left, where I just want to hear a pretty  womans voice tell me im not a horrible disgusting person for engaging in sexual desires. I just want to feel wanted, or at least not repulsive.

I don't know wtf to do, i'm tired, and i hate myself. Sometimes I go online and try to find a woman to help me get over this I post something like this 

&gt;I'm looking for someone to help me get comfortable with being sexual. Like becoming friends with a woman but the friendship , while being a real friendship, more or less existing due to the sexual component. Someone who will voice chat with me often and talk to me about sexual stuff and who I can casually be sexual ""with"", what I mean by with is that she could talk, send me porn she likes, i send her porn I like, we talk about fantasies, she would encourage me to masturbate while talking with her, who really wants to help me become more comfortable with mysexuality and can handle the weird bits of guilt and embaressment I have around it after I get off. She would almost be motherly but of course not in a weird way. I guess she would be emotionally ""warm"" for lack of a better word. Like she would be EXTREMLY kind and caring towards me without being condesnding, but just truely wanting to help me get comfortable with sexuality

I never get a response, you know why? Because who the fuck would respond to someone posting that? I mean seriously! I sound like a fucking nutjob. Maybe I am."
lonely,human connection? who is she,"human connection? who is she - my best friend is someone i met online a few years back. they know everything about me and understand me so well and vice versa. i cherish them so much. i’ve never met them irl. my sister is probably the person i love most in this world, we are extremely different but love each other unconditionally and facetime every other day. she’s also long distance. i only see her a few times a year maybe. these are my two closest relationships. 

my in-person interactions are not great. i’m terrible at talking to people. im awkward and stilted and serious. i don’t know what to say. literally, nothing at all comes to mind except quick one liners of small talk where i’m not even present in the conversation. i feel like a robot. i hate it. i don’t know if it’s social anxiety or what, but i literally cannot be comfortable around people who haven’t known me for a long time. i feel like i come off as aloof and unfriendly but really i’m just awkward and uncomfortable and quiet. 

what is even the point of being a human if i can’t have genuine human connection? i feel like i’m a robot, just devoid of any personality. what is this?"

lonely,I really dislike most people my age,"I really dislike most people my age - I'm not saying I was ""born in the wrong generation"" or something silly like that, but I don't fit in at all and no one likes me. My whole life I have felt isolated and defective, and other people reinforce this. Everyone thinks I'm weird and creepy no matter how much I try to act normal, and even though I'm kind to people they just throw it back in my face. 

Most people in my peer group are so cold and selfish and treat me like crap. They're boring and vapid, when I ask them about their hobbies and interests and goals they have almost none, unless you count excercise, social media and getting drunk which I don't. 

Their lives are a tedious parade of drama, gossip, sex and parties. I have been to three parties and they were all lame, a lot of guys sexually harassed me and tried to pressure or trick me into drinking alcohol and got mad when I politely declined. The girls did some dancing but not even with passion, they just awkwardly bobbed up and down like they were being forced to dance at gunpoint. 

I find myself making excuses for the people who have bullied and harassed me over the years. They're hormonal and insecure, they can't help being horrible. But I'm even younger than most of them and I'm not horrible to people; I have never gone out of my way to be cruel to someone. People at my school used to kick and shove me unprovoked, chase me every day, threaten to break my legs, tell me to kill myself, throw things at me, scream, forcefully hug me (I know that sounds ridiculous but I was afraid of being touched), film the bullying on their phones, call me autist and schizo and say so many sickening things about my body and what they wanted to do to me. They wouldn't stop until I was crying and shaking. And no the school did not help. On TV someone always swoops in to save victims of bullying, but that's rare in real life. Massive crowds would gather and usually everyone just laughed and jeered. 

How can people be so pointlessly mean, so sadistic and self absorbed, so careless and narrow minded? It's so hard to make friends, forget ever finding a boyfriend. Everyone thinks I'm a stuck up prude because I want a serious romantic relationship and not just some casual sex. ""Like wow, you want to marry your soulmate and have a happy relationship where you love and support each other? What a NERD let's have a 6v1 fight because you disagree with me you frigid slut virgin etc."""
lonely,Just wanted to get this off of my chest,"Just wanted to get this off of my chest - Hey there fellow strangers. Wanted to get something off of my chest that's all. Not comfortable talking to anybody about it cuz it's embarrassing. 
3 years ago give or take, I went through a terrible falling out with a person who I thought was the one. It hurt me more than I imagined. And ever since then I've been on a downward spiral. For a while I was afraid to talk to women cuz I was afraid of being hurt ( I've had an abusive older sister who I very recently cut off from ). Also I wanted to cut off all my relationships cuz I thought I was an obligation to them. Was never able to cry for some reason so was never able to vent out my frustrations/sadness. Soon enough lost all my friends. Was depressed for 2 whole years. It was terrible cuz it took a toll on my health - physical and mental. Gained weight consequently and lost most of my hair. Which pushed me further down. 
But I did snap out of it kind off. I just told myself every morning that I was the only person who could make myself happy and I couldn't rely on anybody 'rescuing' me. I no longer feel sad all the time. But I do have nightmares pretty often of being stabbed in the back till date. 
I've been on a downward spiral for 3 years now. But I feel like I've somehow stopped the fall all by myself. But now I've no clue how to climb my way out. Still figuring out things. 
Ik it's long But thanks for reading. Makes me feel better that somebody else knows me just a bit better."

lonely,"I destroy every friend group I'm a part of by accident, and it means im in a constant cycle of losing friends","I destroy every friend group I'm a part of by accident, and it means im in a constant cycle of losing friends - So for the last few years, every friend group I have ever been in has fallen apart. Nothing to write home about until I find out that a lot of those friend groups fragmented into seperate sub-groups that all dont want to speak to me. I'm not surprised - I'm a bad person and a worse influence - but it just feels so shitty to be left out of everything, especially given I'm not socially adept enough to actually make new friends because the idea of talking to people I don't know seriously scares me.

lonely,Left behind,"Left behind - A group of cyclist were riding, there is one at the back, who wants to help others that fall. But when he, the back cyclist falls, there is no one to help him up.

My social anxiety has always lead me to isolate myself. The funny thing is tho that I do have 3-4 close friends who try to be there for me. Although I do have good conversations with them, there is still that vivid loneliness clawing your mind. Sort of like a part of me that is missing. My family has always been there for me and I honestly can’t figure out the root of the demons in my mind. I have Abandoned emotions, saying ILY to my parents or my sister makes me so uncomfortable that I have never told them those words since middle school. ( I am in uni now) My loneliness has lead me to look into everything too realistically and some might say quite negatively. It’s like I have sucked the beauty out of life. All the things that ppl deem beautiful seems like a myth to me, I can’t imagine myself experiencing it. I keep cooking up sad futures to kill expectations so that when reality kicks in I can be happy with whatever lies in the future but I believe that does more negative than positive . But well I keep living because maybe it will be better"

lonely,College loneliness,"College loneliness - I am so depressed. so lonely. never had a friend in 9 years. never hung out with anyone for 9 years. i am willing to bet i am one of very few who can say that. my mental health has been on the decline, especially these last 2 years as i near closer to graduation and adulthood. 


im about to get bad grades this term in college as a result of my mental state. im expected to usually get a  3.4 gpa...think im gonna get a 2.7 this term which never happened to me before. i skipped so many classes due to my social anxiety. now gonna have to lie my way out of it because if my father finds out he'll go crazy on me as usual. 

at college, nobody in my small department knows who i am, no one in class knows my name. im just ignored like im not even there. also ignored when i pass by people i worked with in previous semesters in projects. being ignored is such a terrible feeling to experience.

 i have no one to talk to and no one to love or be loved by. its so depressing seeing couples on campus knowing this is the best time to find a partner (in my region of the world at least), yet i dont have a chance due to my looks. 

i know im ugly, got told i was a 4/10 on one of those rating subreddits. self-confidence is nonexistent as a result. just a total and complete failure really


i always think of just offing myself anytime im under stress. it's been like a weekly thing now. idk how long this will keep up, but dont worry, i don't  have the guts to do something like that. i also dont have the guts to go to a therapist either because of my social anxiety. 

it's a lie that loneliness can be dealt with. used to tell myself that, but time and time again a new wave of depression hits and i just crave for someone else to talk and cuddle with. knowing i'll never get that always make me question why i deserve this suffering"

Everytime I try to go for a girl I get denied, everytime I open up and tell a girl how I feel in hopes of mutual feelings I get rejected, it’s almost as if no girl ever sees me as an option. I’m always nice and respectful, I always compliment girls, and they laugh at my jokes so I know I’m not doing things wrong. I’m not super hot but I am by no means an ugly guy. I’ve been working out recently and overall just trying to better myself but it seems like nothing I do works. I’m just tired of being led on, being told, “Oh yeah that’d be fun, but I might be busy” or “Sorry I’m just not feeling good I’m gonna go home”, I’m tired of being friendzoned off the bat. I have enough girls in my life that are friends I don’t need more, what I could use is a girl that is more than friends. Idk what I’m doing wrong, and seeing all my friends get and my roommates get girls makes it even worse. Idk where I’m going with this post, I think I just want someone to know my pain, I’ll try to keep my head up."

Long story short, before highschool i had my heart broken a couple of times,and then i had to gk through my parents's divorce,which was not pretty.My dad had a couple of times where he beat my mom to the point where she had to go to the hospital.My parents were always abusive to me and everyday they tell me i'm fat,dumb,that i'm wierd and so on.

In my first year of hs i met this girl and she was the most wonderful thing on the planet.I felt like she cared about me,we had conversations till 4 am and because of her i'm the person that i'm today.I loved her more than anything at that time,and i tought that she was my soulmate(maybe deep down i still belive/hope that).But there was this guy who was friends with the both of us and i felt insecure because he always made her laugh.I tried to be friends with him,i even told him that i liked that girl,but he didn't care.He is the person i hate second most in this world. At the end of freshman year i had an argument with both of them and until new years i didn't spoke with neither of them.After that i spoke with that girl and she was sorry and i felt like she missed our conversations,and we became friends again.The same thing happend  and i had to take a few months to find myself because i didn't know who i was without her.And i found my love for movies and cinema.In my 3rd year of hs i tried to start a film club in my school,and i made it,but those to wanted to ""help me"",which started a whole new fight and the end of that club



now i'm in my final year of highshool. I don't know if i'm 100% over that girl,but now i'm so much better,i have new friends that,not always,but most of the time i feel like they really care about me and that they really like to hang out with me.And there is this new girl that at first i didn't knew that well,but we became closer and closer and now i'm in love with her.The problem is that she used to really like my best friend,who to put it in a few words is a fuckboy who didn't give a fuck abour her. Then,at first,when i started liking her she started dating another a-hole,who treated her like shit and they broke up after 3 weeks.
I talk to her everyday,and i see that she cares about me,but sometimes i also feel like she gets tired of me  .I don't want to tell her how i feel bc i can't go trough another heartbreak,i can't lose another friend,especially since i have to go to college next year.I don't know what to do."
lonely,"My birthday is in 6 days,","My birthday is in 6 days, - I'll be turning 18.  On all but a couple of birthday I've spent the day alone. My parents would give me a present and  the two family members close to us who are not Jehovah's Witnesses will drop off some presents two. I'm very greatful for what I do get but I always fill a little unfulfilled on the birthday and Christmas what are supposed to be wholesome celebrations.

It never feels as if I'm given anything of substance or sentimental, normally just some chocolate what I'll eat by myself, hand how my body looks, feel sick, then repeat the cycle.

This year someone made friends with me. We've become really close and they share the same birthday as me. This year I have felt a little more upbeat because I spent time getting a gift for them and the two family members who visit.

lonely,Left my boyfriend of 6 years,"Left my boyfriend of 6 years - I’m pretty new to reddit so bare with me here. But a few months ago I left my boyfriend. We were together since my freshman year of high school. We have a small child together. But he can’t hold a job and lies to me about his drug use which has been a catalyst in his search for employment. I was unhappy in the relationship for a while and had tried to leave several times, but there was always a big scene played out with begging and crying and threats of suicide even in front of our infant. I still care and want the best for him, but I could not force myself to be in a situation where I was becoming so miserable. My only wish is that he gets it together so that he can be the dad to our son that he didn’t have. We coparent and things are civil at the very least. But there is still tension and recently I can’t help but feel lonely because he was my very best friend for a long time. Everything was different and none of the bad things that drove me away started happening until our child was involved. I guess it’s true when people say having children together will show you someone’s true colors. I miss how we used to be, but he isn’t the same person I fell in love with. I can’t talk to him the way I used to because of the circumstances and the general awkwardness of trying to explain your feelings to someone who use to be so intimate with you on an emotional level. I’ve tried to just focus on providing for my son as a single mother working full time. But as I said, I can’t help but to let the loneliness creep in sometimes. He was once my partner in crime and I guess I’m just getting used to not having that anymore. I will persevere, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there and off my chest.

lonely,I just wish people were more into me,"I just wish people were more into me - To just be that someone they wanna hang out with, someone they find interesting and just generally someone to talk to. I have to put in extra effort to be noticed and I’ve tried really really hard, but nothing will change. I see the way some people look at me, I see the way they purposefully avoid me, look down at me, how they make fun of me behind my back (how I look and act). I have to invite myself to what’s going on as I’m generally forgotten, to keep in contact with people because nobody else will put up the effort. 

I’m afraid I have to try, I have to put in 1000% more effort than others, I have to convince myself, to fake being confident, to force myself to continue to take part, despite being 99% invisible.

I have accepted I am just a background character in other people’s lives and always will be for the rest of my days. I have accepted that. Please do not tell me different. I have tried for 8+ years. I gave up once, I had enough, and I stopped. Did not talk to anyone for over a year, it made me worse. So please do not tell me any different, I do not need false hope, I just wanted to vent. 

Here’s to 2020; another shit year. Merry Christmas folks"

I posted in the r/lonely subreddit discord and once again just like everytime, lots of people started freaking out at me that I'm ""talking about the same problem that I always talk about there.""

I thought I had a group of friends at another place, but it ends up that, well, they clearly stated that they only like to have me around ""because I'm fun to make fun of.""

I took the picture and realised I had nobody to send it to. Nobody cared where I was anymore. What I was doing. 

Heck I looked at the picture and it was like looking at somewhere else. The colours. The water reflecting on the ground. I don’t think I’ve seen colour like that in the world through my own eyes for weeks now."

But i am overthinking too much ...more specifically about the meaning of life....

In last 3 days i came to many conclusions and searched those conclusions on google and found there is already a theory or idea about that in philosophy or science.

I discovered nihilism, antinatalism, determinism, and postmodernism.... on my own ..and really learned how consciousness really works.....all these are really pessimistic theories which also states my mental state.

I see humans as robots or ai or something.. like how you see machines is how i see real people.

lonely,Post Move Loneliness,"Post Move Loneliness - So I just recently moved to the middle-of-nowhere Pennsylvania. I didn’t have anyone out here, I just needed a change of pace after living in the same place all my life and I definitely got it. Before moving out here I had a girl who I was seeing on and off who was really there for me but recently that ended and now I just kind of feel alone in the middle of nowhere. I know it really doesn’t seem too bad of a situation but it just somewhat makes me feel as though I can never really commit to a plan unless I have someone there along with me but there’s no one who really cares enough to stick around for me (or at least there hasn’t been in my life up until this point). Not sure really what to do about it, it’s really been eating at me for years but airing it out there seems like a place to start, so no matter what happens thank you for taking the time to read it, posting it alone seems to help a bit."
lonely,23 [M4F] Europe | Anywhere | falling in love the old fashion way,"23 [M4F] Europe | Anywhere | falling in love the old fashion way - Hi there everyone ,I’m 23 and from Europe. Looking to find that certain connection the old fashion way.  Just by talking and getting to know each other on a personal level. Yes looks are important but someone's personality makes them beautiful. Okay imma quit the corny stuff now. 

I would love to make everlasting friendships firs. And maybe even a relationship if it comes to that. I don't care how far away you are. A true connection survives all borders.

Something about myself:

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

My passion is cooking. And besides that I love to read, having conversations, grabbing coffee on a rainy Sunday, watching sports and play some games on my ps4. 

Hope all of you have a good day. Looking forward talking to you!"

Imma head out.,"To those that are truly lonely and have lots to offer don’t give up. Like another user who left not long ago. Imma head out. - When I first joined. I found a lot of like minded and confused people. We were looking for ways to make friends or meet up and not feel so isolated in such a big world. We had grown up lonely or maybe just noticed it happening over time and were trying to find ways to fix it. To get back in with a person or a group. Reconnect or figure out what was wrong with ourself that put people off and do something about. A group of people-who didn’t want to wallow in self pity and blame the world for their faults.  

Unfortunately im noticing a trend on here recently. Some people are posting how lonely they are but that they are also miserable self-pitying and no fun to be around. What are we supposed to do with that? If nobody wants to be around and you and you make half-ass attempts at correcting your outlook and negativity what’s the point in whining? What do you want from people? Obviously not a friend to share in things because you wouldnt give them the support they need.  When it’s only about yourself then it’s selfish to complain as well. If you are not someone others want to be around stop blaming society and stop giving each other a pass. Unless that’s the kind of friend you want then by all means start your own group of angry dejected people who’s only joy in life is complaining about how bad it is. I guess it’s true misery loves company. So if my only option for friends are a bunch of emotional-vampires I guess I’ll just stay lonely. 
I used to like trying to help people on here. Made me feel less lonely. But now so many on here won’t even help themselves. Theyll say “you don’t even know me! You don’t know what I’ve been through!” And I’d say to that “that’s your problem. Instead of trying to understand others and show compassion you just want it all for yourself. Some people are just parasites and when they use up others of course they get lonely they killed their life source.

lonely,I Don’t Get It,"I Don’t Get It - No matter how many people I end up surrounded by (college is very good for forced social interaction), I just feel so damn alone most of the time. My most meaningful social interaction comes from online and even then it just feels hollow. And no matter how nice people are to me, I just always feel like they would be better off if I wasn’t there. I don’t even know what to say since I never really open up like this to anyone because I don’t want to be a bother to them and make them feel like they have to treat me specially. I don’t even know what I’m looking for here, maybe I just wanted to vent while I’m sick and tired enough to want to open up."

I'm a loner in the  real world, been screwed over and betrayed by family and friends and it's just really hard for me invite people into my home and in my life unless I know in my heart I can trust them. So I take my time in real life, I know there's good people out in the world. Reddit has helped me with the loneliness, I'm still new to Reddick but when I'm sitting here all alone in the walls are closing in, hop on, find somebody to chat with. the people that I've encountered are great people 🙂 non-judgemental and I truly feel like they care more about me then people  I have known the whole life. So I just wanted to take the time and say to everyone....


You're awesome, the world is a better place for having you here, you deserve happiness, you're beautiful!! If anyone  needs somebody to hit up and say hey I'm feeling down, I'm here. I'm just me I'm nobody special, but I have a heart and I have empathy and compassion for my fellow human beings,I know what it's like to be lost, alone, depressed and full of regret and guilt. to feel like you don't have one single person in this world...So I'm here if anybody out there needs somebody to talk.


Wishing everyone out there the most happiness life can bring,also a happy and safe holiday for you and all your families! I know it's that time of year and it can be really hard for some of us."

lonely,My anxiety is the source of my loneliness and it’s ruining my life,"My anxiety is the source of my loneliness and it’s ruining my life - I () have really terrible anxiety which gives me a fear of older people (usually over 30yrs) and younger people (under 13 yrs). I haven’t hugged anyone in almost 5 years since human contact makes me feel sick, this includes family members as well, the only living thing that I’ve been able to hug recently was my dog this morning. I’ve never really had a best or close friend due to the aforementioned anxiety and if I find someone who I think could be a good friend I get really clingy and just basically non stop try to talk to them. I’ve lost a lot of friends as well, I wasn’t always like this as I only developed anxiety about 5 years ago and over the years as it’s gotten worse more people have been driven away. I deleted all of my social media apart from a tiktok and instagram acc as well as this reddit acc that I don’t really use often, I usually only use instagram just to look at nerd/art stuff. The reason why I did that is because it made me feel very left out by seeing people I knew hanging out together and just having fun. I’ve also never had a love life (I know this is cliche or whatever I’m not fishing for sympathy honestly I’m just venting) I’m bi if that matters, I know that I’m not bad looking at all but whenever I meet someone I again drive them away with me being all quiet and cold which is just lovely. Also when I turn 18 in a few months I will be way too terrified to use a dating app, also let’s not forget that human contact makes me feel sick so even though I’m not aromantic at all I’ll never be able to find a partner. Unless I manage to get cured or whatever I don’t think that I’ll be having a very interesting life at all, I’ll probably end up being that guy down the hall who does nothing other than work.

 Closest thing I have that you might call a friend is an older family 'friend' in the their 50s and I want to drop her completely for I feel that I'm just an inconvenience; her time would be better spent with her husband. Im sure it wouldn't really effect her anyways.

Anyways, I just want to drop everything and live alone in a secluded area: as I'm way far gone to reintegrate with normal human relationships. Only thing that's stopping me is money.

lonely,I(m26)'m lonely and want a woman to talk to about this stuff,"I(m26)'m lonely and want a woman to talk to about this stuff - I'm 26. ive never had sex. Ive only been in one relationship, if you removed 3 or 4 days from my life you would remove all the physical in person interaction Ive had with a women romantically. I can talk to women fine, several friends are women and its good. but I just don't know how romance works.

I'm pretty religious at times. Don't want to talk about that AT ALL. But its relevant for the next part.

I started watching porn when I was younger. about 4 or 5 years ago I started talking to women online, sometimes sexually. I just feel so absurdly lonely that I don't know how to deal with it. I just want to feel a connection with someone.

I got to the point where I felt like I need to talk to someone sometimes. I'm super inexperinced sexually and sometimes I just want to say fuck it and fully immerse myself in sexual pleasure, at least as much as i can online. i try to find women who are willing to talk to me and basically just casually talk about sex in voice chat, share porn we like with each other, watch it together while chatting,ect. when seeking stuff out sexually online, people want kinks, or roleplay, or a performance. I just want to have a fucking conversation most of the time. Like I literally just want to talk about it not put on a performance or have one performed for me

That fills me with guilt. But then I have nights like tonight where I just a few days ago said ""i'm done"" and deleted all my accounts, and have this hole left, where I just want to hear a pretty womans voice tell me im not a horrible disgusting person for engaging in sexual desires. I just want to feel wanted, or at least not repulsive.

I don't know wtf to do, i'm tired, and i hate myself.




-------------

I'm looking for someone to help me get comfortable with being sexual. Like becoming friends with a woman but the friendship , while being a real friendship, more or less existing due to the sexual component. Someone who will voice chat with me often and talk to me about sexual stuff and who I can casually be sexual ""with"", what I mean by with is that she could talk, send me porn she likes, i send her porn I like, we talk about fantasies, she would encourage me to masturbate while talking with her, who really wants to help me become more comfortable with mysexuality and can handle the weird bits of guilt and embaressment I have around it after I get off. She would almost be motherly but of course not in a weird way. I guess she would be emotionally ""warm"" for lack of a better word. Like she would be EXTREMLY kind and caring towards me without being condesnding, but just truely wanting to help me get comfortable with sexuality"
lonely,My real life story part 2 (Allison)❤️,"My real life story part 2 (Allison)❤️ - One day when Allison was nine she left the confession box with blood running down her leg. ‘The nun saw me and she called me over really roughly. And she gave me a rag, she said, “Get in there and clean yourself up”. She said, “Don’t be so disgusting and don’t you come out of there till you’re cleaned up” ... And I didn’t do that. He did.’

Allison could not tell her parents about the abuse because they were often drunk and abusive themselves, and she couldn’t tell the nuns at school because they would call her ‘dirty’ and ‘disgusting’. But Allison believed that policemen were soldiers who could ‘fix anything’. Knowing what Gregory was doing was wrong, she saw a policeman and tried to explain what was happening to her.

‘He knelt down to my level, he looked right at me and he said to me, “You are a naughty, naughty little girl”. And I remember it, I’ll never forget it. I can see him now, the policeman. I wanted him to save me.’
The abuse continued until Allison left for high school. As a young adult, She became restless and unable to stay in the same job for very long despite enjoying the work. She had difficulty trusting people and had problems with intimacy.

‘It really does make you bitter and twisted … I don’t find much to smile about, there’s nothing to laugh about. I stick to myself, I like to be by myself. I don’t like too many people around me.

‘This is what it’s done to me. When I did have my first child, I didn’t know I was pregnant until I was five-and-a-half months pregnant. And I asked the doctor, “Please get it out of me, just get it out”.

'I wanted him to take it out of me, get it out because I was so filthy. I felt so disgusting. And today I still feel filthy. Although I shower three times a day I still feel filthy. I cannot get myself clean.’

At age 19 Allison started receiving counselling and later became pregnant again. She had a second child who she was very protective of.

‘I made sure no-one, absolutely no-one went near him to have that chance to do something horrible to him.’ To this day she has a good relationship with her now adult son and his children.

Allison suffers from insomnia and has been prescribed sleeping tablets which only give her four hours of sleep every night. She has also tried to commit suicide on numerous occasions.

‘They really wrecked me, they really, really wrecked me.’

Allison has not sought compensation for the abuse because she couldn’t see what good it would do her. However, recently she has had a change of heart and believes she might be able to accomplish some good with any settlement received.

‘Because they did this to me, yes I will go for that claim. But you know what I want done with that money? I don’t want that filthy money. I don’t dare want it. But I’d like that money to go to the little boys and the little girls that are little children today. I want that money to go to them to help them. I don’t want no one going through to end up like this. I don’t want no-one to end up like me.’

Allison still receives counselling, which she said ‘makes you feel a bit better, especially you know someone believes you. And that’s so nice because no-one before believed you’.

‘I’m getting believed. It’s such a relief.’"
lonely,My story,"My story - Allison was the youngest child in a Catholic family living in Sydney’s western suburbs in the 1980s. Both parents were born in eastern Europe, had limited English skills and were heavy drinkers. Allison’s  father abused the children, which their mother knew about but did not try to stop.

When she was eight, Allison was sent to a Catholic school run by the Sisters of Saint Joseph and their parish priest, Father Gregory. The nuns were very cruel and dealt severe punishments to students for the slightest misdemeanour. She still has several scars from violence inflicted on her by the nuns.

On one very windy day the lid from a metal rubbish bin flew up in the air and hit a nun on the head. The children in the playground laughed at this but it was Allison who the Sister decided to punish, and sent her to visit Father Gregory.

Allison was alone with Gregory in the confessional where he undid his pants. After she confessed to the incident in the playground, he told her she was a ‘naughty girl’ and her penance was to touch his penis.

‘Well, I did what I was told but all I remember was I didn’t like it ... I was made to play with it for a while and I did that. He let me go out and the nun told me that if I was naughty again that the devil was going to come and get me. And I was so scared because I didn’t want the devil to get me.’

After that incident Allison was sexually abused by Gregory almost daily. Her two closest friends were also abused. Allison recalled an occasion when all three girls were sent to the confessional box one by one, and one by one they all came out crying.

‘Then he said to us, “You girls go out and play. You don’t tell nobody. I’m going to talk to God now. I’m going to talk to God and see what God wants me to do next”.

‘Every day it was a survival. And I thought, “I’ll be extra good today” because I didn’t want to go in there to the priest. But you know what, it doesn’t matter how good I was, I still ended up in there a lot.’

In addition to forcing Allison to finger her vagina and perform oral sex on him, Gregory digitally penetrated and eventually raped her in the church building.

‘I thought he put something inside me like a pencil. But it wasn’t, it was his finger. And God, the pain ... I had to do it. If I didn’t he was going to tell God, and God’s going to send the devil to come and get me, and take me into hell where I’m going to burn because I was very naughty.

‘He got me into the church. Nobody was there. Out the back, up the altar and around there to the side. And he started to have sex with me. And I tell you, I was stiff, I was eight. Oh God, I was eight, I was eight years old.

‘The priest started to try and have sex with me and all I can remember, I was laying down and he was telling me, “Now you be quiet, you don’t want to wake up Jesus” … And I’m laying there and he was trying to put his penis inside me and oh boy I tell you what, all I can remember – pain.’

Allison told the Commissioner that Gregory’s rape was more painful than childbirth.

One day when Allison was nine she left the confession box with blood running down her leg. ‘The nun saw me and she called me over really roughly. And she gave me a rag, she said, “Get in there and clean yourself up”. She said, “Don’t be so disgusting and don’t you come out of there till you’re cleaned up” ... And I didn’t do that. He did.’

lonely,Not physically alone but definitely feel emotionally and mentally,"Not physically alone but definitely feel emotionally and mentally - I’ve always had trouble with people. I’ve been used, verbally abused, harassed, bullied, sexual assaulted, ignored, and forgotten. Everyone that I’ve been close to has either used me or left me. I’ve been bullied for years and verbally abused by both bullies, “friends”, and significant others. And I’ve been ignored and forgotten by people who I had always been there for. People know I’m weak and use me for it. I’ve been changed to match what people wanted me to be and I’ve been sexually assaulted and I still can’t find it my heart to be mean to them. The best I can do is ignore them. Like they’ve ignored me. I have a group of friends yes but I always take care of them. I don’t mind of course. I just want them to be happy. But it often makes me feel as if no one could care for me like I do for them. My brother and sister are both way older than me and either never can or want to hangout or talk to me. My parents really just only see one side of me and haven’t even been home these past three months. I’ve practically been living on my own for these past months because my older brother is always tired and busy, when one parent is gone the other pretty much forgets my existence, and the one week my grandma came out to watch and take care of me while both my parents were gone my alcoholic and druggie uncle was also out to watch me and I ended up having to call the police on him after he threatened my grandma and I in the car. My birthday was a week ago and I felt forgotten and like it was even my birthday. We had actually celebrated someone’s birthday that was a couple of days before mine in my birthday and of course I was fine with it. As long as they were happy. And I always seem to somehow make people like me. Like, like like me. And I hate it because they say they love me then leave me within a week because they’re done using me. They’ve had their fun controlling, verbally abusing, and once using...my body for their own enjoyment. Then they leave. They always do. Or I somehow find the courage to leave them. Which is quite rare. Sorry for the long essay. 

TLDR: People have used me and I’m tired of it. But I’m to weak and lonely to do anything about it."

lonely,Constantly feel like a burden to my friends,"Constantly feel like a burden to my friends - I’m friends with a lot of smart people, but lately most of them have been taking Ls in school, work, and personal life. I, on the other hand, am flourishing. For the first time ever, I got straight As and am completing some really exciting and high profile research with my university. I want to be excited about my accomplishments but I can’t bring up any of my happiness or worries without my friends thinking I’m bragging or complaining over nothing. I feel so illegitimate for being concerned about my life because things, on paper, are going so well. And then I can’t expect my friends to be happy for me because I don’t want to make them feel like they are failing. And I try really hard to support them and I take hour long phone calls to talk them down. But as soon as I want to talk about myself, I feel like an emotional burden. So I don’t talk about myself, or I at least try not to. And this is starting to really impact me because I’m consumed by my own thoughts. Do I have a huge ego for wanting to be proud of myself? Why am I so worried about the future if things are going fine right now? And my therapist has been useless at trying to help me deal with these kinds of questions. I seek advice on how to deal with my uncertainty about myself. I decided to post this in this sub because I feel lonely not having my friends to support me and because I feel that my success is alienating those around me."

Not the weeb, or the nerd, or the jock, or the jerk, or any other typical school stereotype that you would think of. I'm just ""that guy"". That guy in all your classes that just seems to be there, floating between enganged and disengaged in class, or in conversation, or in almost any other situation. That guy that has a decent group of friends, but outside of that, nobody talks to or about.

My closest friend, who also happens to be very well known and liked by our grade and has a lot of connections told me this today. He told me ""You know how our friend group shits on each other all the time? You're like the exception. Nobody shits on you. Nobody talks about you either. You're disengaged but not enough to come off as weird. People even talk about [redacted], saying that he just sits there and whatnot. But you do the same, and nobody seems to care or say anything.""

I always thought I was ""that guy"" who is just in class that nobody really pays attention to unless he has to give a presentation or whatever. And this only confirmed it, that I'm some guy who is lonely because nobody seems to really care. At least my friend group is pretty cool."

My sister and her can just talk about anything. But when my mom and I talk there’s always an awkward pause or silence because I don’t know what to talk about with her. I’ve been trying for years to bond with her but she doesn’t try. It doesn’t help that her boyfriend of 10 years is an ass munch and disrespects me any chance he gets. I feel like I’ve been in defense mode ever since I was 10. This past week my sister graduated and even though I’m super proud of her,
I looked at my moms Facebook and it’s all of my sister.
You could never tell my mom has two other kids. I have no one to talk too, no one in my family can “deal with me” because I struggle with depression and anxiety, they’re the type to sweep it under the rug and not recognize it.

I was lonely for a super long time. I know this might sound childish, but almost every day for a year after school I used to go to my room and just cry. I was and I still am picked on a lot at school, probably due to my high functioning autism and ADHD, but the main reason why I would cry was because of having literally no friends. All my friends either moved away or became rude to me, and I was super lonely. I’d just get home and start crying because I felt like no one cared about me. No one wanted me to be happy. I felt like a useless human being. I was at the point of wanting to kill myself, then something happened that changed my life. It all started with a Discord server invite from a student at my school. We have talked before, but we never really got to know each other enough to become friends. When I accepted the invite, we started talking a lot more. He invited me to some group chats that he was in, and eventually we became best friends. We are both in chorus now, and I love him so much (no homo). He doesn’t know this, but he indirectly saved my life. I’m telling you all this for one reason. If you feel lonely, don’t give up yet. There someone out there that will want to be your friend, you just need to find them or they need to find you."
lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

It gets rather frustrating when I try to look for genuine relationships on apps and practically every guy there is looking just to hookup.   Some have treated me with respect when I say no to hooking up, but others have gotten nasty.   I’m planning on getting out more socially and meeting people the old fashioned way, it just gets disheartening.  I miss sex a lot but I’m not going to make poor decisions just because of loneliness.

I took it really badly at the time but I’ve been doing much better recently. However just now I went on an old social account I forgot we shared and saw his updated pics of him at the gym and stuff. 

It’s so trivial but immediately it somehow took me right back to how I felt on day 1. I guess it made me realise he’s moving on with his life same as me. He always talked about starting back at the gym and it hit me that he doesn’t share everything or even anything with me now.

One of these guys would be considered a ""popular guy"", I'm not saying this with any malice and I truly do love him as I do my other friends but it really drives me nuts sometimes. We've been friends for so long but everything is so different now, we live in such completely different worlds, he has so many friends and groups that he hangs with other than us, yet he's the only person I hang with. I don't understand why he is friends with me, we barely have anything in common,  he's attractive, a social butterfly, and extrovert and Im the opposite of all of those. Im honestly thinking he's just my friend because he knows I have no other friends. He always talks about girls and new mates he's made that university and all I can do is stay silent, sometimes we hang out with some other old high school friends with whom im not as close as and they talk about girls and stuff and I can't say anything but I can see how much more fun he has with them.

It doesn't really matter anymore though, we barely hang out, I go weeks alone in my room and alone at college whilst he's having so much fun, Im happy for him, but at the same time Im so jealous and I hate that I am.

My other two friends are more like me but the ""popular guy""(don't really like calling him that seems weird) is the only reason we hang out, we basically never hang out without him for some reason. They all also hang out without me a lot because I live like 30 minutes further so I guess my thoughts don't matter in this. Im just waiting till we all drift apart."

lonely,Feeling lost and alone. I feel like no one cares if I am not OK,"Feeling lost and alone. I feel like no one cares if I am not OK - Hi everyone,

I just felt like I would post this here. I hope I'm doing this right. I'm not extremely familiar with this platform. 

So, this year has felt like everything has gone wrong, even though it started promising. I was even expecting to get engaged to my partner. I got a new job, got a car as soon as January started. i just felt like this was going to be my year.

Oh boy, was I wrong...

This year proved to be the worst year in my life. My family has been cut off as they kept interfering in my relationship and they didn't take this well. They have always been very demanding and abusive but I've never expected them to go to extreme lengths to do me harm if I said ""that's enough. no more"". They tried to destroy my relationship, my friendships because I wouldn't let them continue with their behavior.

Anyway.. once they have been removed - blocked and ignored from every social media platform and address book, my relationship went down next. My partner has had enough of the drama and felt disappointed with me as a person and wanted a break. Currently, we're on a break and he's moved out. 

I'm on my own and living each day as it is but I feel lost completely.

I forgot to mention that all of my friends are in my native country and I can't see them. 

My finances have taken a blow as my partner moved out and we have to cover the rent where he is, the utilities here as well as the rent here. It's horrible, everything is going down.

I've started having issues as work because of all the stress I'm under and my boss gave me the lovely advice to pull myself together as I could risk losing my job. So that's amazing as well.

Long story short, I try to talk to my friends from back home, but at the end of the day, I am here on my own, even though I see my partner once per week (on a break, not broken up) I feel like I am on my own and am very very lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been the sort of person who would look out for others, but now when I am at my lowest, I feel so abandoned and nothing seems fair. Sometimes I keep my optimism high but other times I just lose it completely. 

I just want to feel a bit appreciated and have someone tell me for once that it will be okay and everything will pass. It feels very lonely when I get home from work and see the now half-empty house. I don't think any of this is fair."

Everyone around me seems so oblivious to how I feel - that or they’re too worried about my possible suicide that they don’t want to push me, I don’t know what to do anymore - all I want is someone to look forward to seeing, or something to look forward to doing - I once was feeble minded, but even when I have a holiday booked with friends, 3 concerts planned for some of my favourite artists - yet I still feel so empty and void, I don’t know what to do and that lack of knowledge scares me..."

Its strange cause I have friends in real life, I hangout with them often. I don't always feel like I can fully be me around them though. I feel like they don't really and truly know my hurts and pains. My life is very segmented. There is the me that I show the world, and the me that is on the inside. 

I'm religious and have strong convictions about how I should live my life. I don't have a desire to force those convictions on others but also find i have to self censor a lot because I know they just wouldn't understand my views. There is a hopelessness in my life as well. I feel like I will never find love. I'm 26 and more than anything I crave a significant other. I want affection in my life. Ive considered getting a massage because I desperately need to relax but also because I crave human touch. Dear God I crave human contact. None of my friends are huggy and even if they were its not like we would be cuddling or anything. At least a massage would get a persons hands on me, granted it wouldn't be in a sexual (or even affectionate) way. I'm not sure I want to pay for human touch though, thats....that seems a dangerous road to go down.

My personality Isolates me from others. Not that I'm an ass (i'm not, i don't think), but I just don't value what others do. I have no drive to get some super well paying job (Though I want to have a comfortable life). I don't seek power or money or even recognition. 

My inward convictions also make me ashamned cause I don't live up to them. I get angry at people when I want to be kind, I feel hurt when i shouldn't, I feel lustful and desire to be desired anyway I can. I'm a wreck of a person on the inside and I can't let anyone see it."
lonely,Anyone here despise people?,"Anyone here despise people? - I'm aware despise is a really powerful word but it has to be how I feel about people. I've been a loner for so long that when I see a group of friends hanging out I can't but to fucking hate them. 

I hate fucking everyone. I can't trust anyone anymore. I see them walking with their friends, girlfriends, boyfriends. Laughing, gigling, fucking around. It pisses me off that I wont ever get to experience that because these assholes outcatsed me. 

Then they pity me. How dare they. If this bullshit dosent change after HS I'm opting out of life."

lonely,Sincere Apology to Lonely People,"Sincere Apology to Lonely People - I used to think that loneliness was a choice; that if people didn’t want to be lonely, they wouldn’t be. But with age, experience, and the inevitable changes in life, I’ve learned that it may sometimes be a choice, but for many of the truly lonely people out there, it is not a choice. I am sorry that I judge you and I’m sorry that you are lonely. I am new to loneliness, it’s not a choice, and it hurts more than anything. But chin up and smile right? Just keep going. The inevitable changes will come again and might bring sunshine instead of rain next time... I hope."

lonely,Dad is leaving us. Is it our fault?,"Dad is leaving us. Is it our fault? - Okay hold on let me explain. I don’t even know what to feel right now.

(Btw I’m a 20(F) in university so don’t worry about me. I’m worried about other people.)

My dad pulled me aside last night &amp; told me “Don’t tell the kids. But I’m going to leave.”

I didn’t know what to say at first.

He told me he’s tired of living like this. He doesn’t have the best job &amp; works all the time but he’s done that all the time, even when he had a great paying job.
He told me we’re ungrateful and we don’t respect him even though he works so hard.

I understand why he feels like that, but we never see him. And when he does come home he’s tired &amp; either goes to sleep or yells at the kids

I try to be happy around him &amp; so do the kids, but he gets so angry all the time. And I don’t understand. Why just up &amp; leave?
I know those kids are a handful and just as mean assholes &amp; stubborn as any young teen. But they love him. We all do.

I wish we had told him more.


So as of now he’s staying till Christmas then leaving for 6 months &amp; I have to take care of the bills until everyone decides what to do. The younger ones can either leave to live with our mother or stay and change the attitudes.

As for myself I’m not too concerned. I was going to move our anyways. I just have to step on it now. It’s those poor kids that my heart just...man"
lonely,Starting to feel it set in.,"Starting to feel it set in. - As of lately I’ve realized how little my friends care to listen to me when I’m in need of a small vent session. They either ignore me, don’t know what to say and freeze up or just outwardly don’t care. I’m bottling it all up and it’s causing me to cry a lot even at the littlest things. I’m not great with handling my emotions or talking about them and I even tried confronting a friend about it and he admitted to feeling too suicidal to help which just made me feel like a bit of an asshole. I don’t like this hopeless feeling and being so alone. It’s depressing and doesn’t help my situation with handling my emotions which I need especially around this time."
lonely,Am I being egoistic?,"Am I being egoistic? - I just feel so lonely every day. But my family still talks to me, we have fun sometimes I still live with them. And some friends migth text me once in a while. And also I might share some words with co-workers.
Am I being too egoistic? I really just want someone to hug me, or let me hug them, I know that asking for a significant other would be something huge. But I really liked being kissed, it felt really good. But that person already told me that would never see me in any way other than a really good friend.
I know I'm just letting all this out, and sure nobody will care, but thanks if someone read this far, really means lots to me.
Have a good day!❤️"

lonely,23 [M4F] Europe | Anywhere | falling in love the old fashion way,"23 [M4F] Europe | Anywhere | falling in love the old fashion way - Hi there everyone ,I’m 23 and from Europe. Looking to find that certain connection the old fashion way.  Just by talking and getting to know each other on a personal level. Yes looks are important but someone's personality makes them beautiful. Okay imma quit the corny stuff now. 

I would love to make everlasting friendships firs. And maybe even a relationship if it comes to that. I don't care how far away you are. A true connection survives all borders.

Something about myself:

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

My passion is cooking. And besides that I love to read, having conversations, grabbing coffee on a rainy Sunday, watching sports and play some games on my ps4. 

Hope all of you have a good day. Looking forward talking to you!"

lonely,Do I have the right to feel lonely in my context?,"Do I have the right to feel lonely in my context? - I’ve made a post here before but my dumb ass likes to tell myself that it’s all in my head. So, basically for years and I mean years (since middle school and now I’m in college) I’ve been constantly telling myself “I don’t matter, no one cares” the usual. But every time I’ve reached out and told someone this they keep telling me “no dude we love you” etc.etc.etc. Which at first was relieving, but like, idk I look at all the people I talk to and they all have a go-to person to hang out with, (I’m in a handful of groups so you would think this wouldn’t be a problem lmao 🙃) except me, and the worst part is now if I tell them “bro like I feel lonely  no one cares” they get upset as if I have people I talk to 24/7 no all I do is stay at home doing work on the apartment and go to work or school. I have damn near nothing going on in my life but all my friends got their own thing going on. Although I have moved 100 miles away for college (90 something actually but) I still make the trip to go see them and I just...idk man. Side note only 2 of them really have my back but at the same time those two have lives so I respect them a lot, but the rest have LITERALLY have nothing going on except hanging out with each other."
lonely,Having a vary hard time getting over a breakup. Desperately need advice.,"Having a vary hard time getting over a breakup. Desperately need advice. - We were together for about 3 years. And now we have been apart for more than that.
I think about her often, a few times a day every day. If there's a lot going on  and I'm generally stressed about life and not thinking about her during the day, often times I will still dream about her.

I know thats kinda normal immediately after a breakup, I don't know what ""normal"" is, a few weeks? Maybe a couple months of being sad about it if it was a long term relationship?

It's been over 3 years since I've talked to her. I completely removed any reminders of her from my life. No social media, no mutual friends I talk to anymore, I have moved to a new town since then, I've dropped out of school, I have even deleted all the music that I listened to during that time of my life. There is literally nothing. Nothing that should even faintly remind me of them. Yet I cannot get them out of my head.

What's wrong with my brain."
lonely,Don’t you ever get me wrong...,"Don’t you ever get me wrong... - I’m lonely. But don’t think for a second that I haven’t tried to break free. I spent years getting out of my home to meet people, to find my tribe, and to open up, sought therapy, and I haven’t made any headway. I now stay home besides work because I now hate people for how they make me feel. Misunderstood. A misfit toy. I now live a hermits life. But don’t think for a second that I don’t find joy in it. I love spending my time alone, playing games, watching movies, reading books, and browsing YouTube. They bring me joy. However, I’m still lonely. I want someone to share my life with. Someone who ADDS to my life and I theirs. I have everything I’ve always wanted.... except companionship."
lonely,Why do all my friendships seem one sided :(,"Why do all my friendships seem one sided :( - So let me start off by saying I’m not blaming other cause it partially my fault. In IRL I’m extremely anxious, and can sometimes give off the vibe that I don’t want to be approached. I have a resting bitch face 😂. But, some how in the past people have asked me if I wanted to hangout, however I say no. Not because I don’t want to, but because I’m pretty introverted and do enjoy being alone after a long day at work or school. But that does not mean I like to feel lonely. Anyways these people take it I don’t like them and don’t want to spend time with them, when that’s simply not the case. I just need some space, or maybe hang out with a person one on one that I feel comfortable with. That never works tho cause after that they never even initiate a conversation with me again. 

As a result of this I tend to gravitate towards online friendships, but those seem very fake. Here I feel less pressure and I sometimes will even initiate conversations. At first the friendships seem to be going really well, but then I realize I’m the one who has the start the conversation 95% of the time. Which I don’t mind to an extent. But, these people they’ll say things like “ oh I love talking to you”, “you seem really cool message me anytime”, “ you’re a great friend”. BUT THEY ARE NEVER THE ONES WHO REEACH OUT! After a while they’ll even leave me on read, ghost me in the middle of a conversation, take weeks, sometimes months to respond. Then they will say “ I was busy “. Like really ? I saw you on discord playing league, I see you posting stories on Instagram and Snapchat at parties. It’s annoying af. Like you’re treating as if I’m your last option. 

Fuck life. I’m too ugly and too awkward to make friends irl and then online people treat me lol I’m their last option or some shit. I give up on making friends. Like god damn!"

More so for post-college / mid-20s and older people. - Sometimes I wonder if I'm not as lonely as I think, and that this is just what adulthood is like. It's weird transitioning from very social and insular cultures like high school and college, to workplaces where people are less prone to interacting with one another in an attempt to develop friendships. 

So when I wake up at almost 5AM in apartment, where only I live, and I feel alone, I also sometimes wonder if adults just don't really have friends in general. Yes, part of me would like a solid group of people to text throughout the day and go out for drinks. But then another part of me wonders if that's what people do once they've reached their mid-20s and settled down in their careers. 

A lot of adults in my life, my age and older, also seem to not ""go out"" much. My dad, for example, has never really had friends he went out with. He spent much of my life alone in his room.

So I just wonder if that's more normal than I think. And if I'm still using a college yardstick to measure my current social life, which is pretty barren. I mean, am I too old to expect that I'll still be texting friends throughout the day and going out for drinks biweekly? 

I really feel like I have no sense of what's normal for people in their mid-20s and older."

For now I live with my mom but I don't feel comfortable with getting a girlfriend or boyfriend because my parents used to tease me about girls. They still do but I've learned to deal with it better since kindergarten.

I really am just starved for skin contact. I don't know, it feels like I'm rambling. It's just that tonight I've got those pains from feeling lonely.

They're kind of weird because for me it's not like the pain of grief. It's like being nostalgic for a thing I've never had? It's a weird feeling but I feel it around my heart and its kind of like a cool warm feeling that's mildly uncomfortable.

Someday I know I'll meet someone nice but it won't happen anytime soon because I'm actively avoiding dating despite my lonely feelings.

But everybody seems to have their new group of friends you know. Maybe it’s my fault I ended up like this feeling forgotten, lonely. But I’m that type of person who will always be there for ANYONE. Ask me to do something, I’ll get started on it the second ask. Maybe I got too carried away with being lonely &amp; just focusing on my studies maintaining an A- gpa. I don’t freaking know. Christmas is approaching &amp; I just honestly feel lonely. Not that type of wanting a relationship lonely. I just want to gift people &amp; see them smile, catch up with their lives.

lonely,I don't know what to do anymore.,"I don't know what to do anymore. - Few days ago I got into an argument with someone who at the time I considered my best friend. We became friends 6 years ago and at the time we had feelings for each other, but we couldn't be together since I was graduating and she was still in school and planned to go to college out of town. Anyway as the years went by things got rocky with us, but we always seemed to bounce back. This time we didn't. I won't go into what the argument was cause it was personal, but it split us up and in her exact words she told me that's she's tired of me and can't deal with me anymore... So that was that, I told her that I have no hard feelings towards her and hopes she can find someone who can be a real friend.
Since all that happened I've been under alot of stress and depression from what happened to the point where I started to smoke cigarettes again and when anyone asks I tell them ""cause it's legal self harm and it helps me clear my head"" 
I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm faking my emotions when I talk to people and that I'm a problem for everyone."

But I’m terrified my mind will just go blank when I look at the paper and I won’t know what to do. That’s never happened. I always end up ok. And getting two more B’s won’t kill my career goals. I’m just terrified. My test anxiety has been getting so much worse with every test.

I’m scared that I’m not going to lose weight. I’ve gained ten pounds just binging for the past few days while I try to study. My stomach is constantly so full. But I still want to eat. I have to go home soon and everyone will see me. My measurements haven’t changed. But I’m heavier. And I can’t see my abs. I’m afraid my boyfriend will notice.

I’m scared my boyfriend will break up with my because I have a very low libido. My family has entrenched me in purity culture so much that I don’t know what’s allowed and what’s shameful. I don’t want to lose him.

lonely,I am incapable to enjoy sex with random people.,"I am incapable to enjoy sex with random people. - So basically this is comming from an experience at a club where said activity is condoned. I have my fair share of this and it only makes my depression dip into a whole new level. 
I thought that having sex was the key to medicate a little bit of my loneliness, but it only left me even more hollow than when I started, not only that but it also have left me feeling that im incapable and inadequate at performing during intercourse.

I envy people who are able to enjoy it to the fullest extent and brush it off like if it was the best thing  and still go for 3 rounds like nothing.

I am incapable of having a conversation with a stranger whatsoever, I try my best to get myself out there and be exposed on social events such as going to conventions, bars and clubs but I simply cannot strike up anything. 

Been fighting this feeling of incompetence for almost 4 years and to be honest, I don't know if I can get out of it or to be genuinely happy anymore.

Im sorry if this post is all over the board, its been a convoluted nightmare of emotions for the past month and a half and I have no one that I can trust to vent in this manner.

The best way to describe what I’m feeling is by saying i feel like I’m drowning. I’m depressed, stressed, tired, angry, sad, and a whole other bunch of stuff , and I have nobody to really talk to. I see a therapist who is more interested in my suicidal thoughts than this intense lonely feeling I have, and my gf likes to start pointless fights with me despite her knowing the shit I have on my plate. I haven’t told friends/family because I don’t want to be a burden, and I certainly don’t want the judgement.

But when conversation of them being together comes up or when we joke around I'll make comments about how I'm lonely or singal asf. Today I made a typical joke I usually made while they cuddle. I was laying in my hammock under my bed and she just hopped up and came and hugged me. I kinda just started tearing up and tried to hide it. I don't think they noticed.

Like a broken toy that needed to be thrown away. 
We all became separated as they started to smoke, drink and party more. I realized i started to be invited less and less, unless i basically begged for their time. Then they only started to hmu when they needed something like money, lifts, or free food. And of course being the big sucker i am i gave into their needs.
 I've been made fun of for being single and told I'd be forever alone. And tbh i feel like thats going to happen. Recently in the last year I've been mocked for being the only girl left with my virginity. 

Is it bad that I value myself? Am i supposed to feel ashamed because i dont throw myself at the first guy that tries to get in my pants?

Of course he doesn't have to be the dude i marry, but i at least want him to be right for me at that time. As time goes on the lonelier i feel, i just want someone to kiss me good night and cuddle. 

It would be nice to talk to anyone going through the same thing as me. My parents treat my issues as ""teenage drama"", and maybe in a few years it will be. However I'm really feeling at my wits end and i just want some normal friendships where i dont feel like im being used. Im from a very small town up in northern Canada, so its not like i can just go out and meet new people. They were literally my only options for friends up here."
lonely,i’m sick of it. this is horrible.,"i’m sick of it. this is horrible. - i think i screwed myself up. i isolated myself because i couldn’t get over being vulnerable. maybe that made me grow apart from everyone or maybe that would’ve happened anyway. it’s too late now. i have no one. i have barley felt any care and support in years, and people i used to be close with always end up leaving. if people contact me it feels like they just need something. it hurts listening to people and trying to help but i can’t find the same. and at this point i don’t know how i’ll ever get out of this. i don’t see myself not being alone in the future. i cant connect with people past surface level anymore. this is so, so horrible. i screwed up so bad, and i didn’t even realize it until it was too late. i make posts like this all the time but they’re just so pointless."
lonely,I just took a shower,"I just took a shower - And I want to make it the last one after I went to hookers. I usually went to hookers by night when I could pick up easily and people couldn't see my license plate nor my car so easily.

I go to another town to get them since friends and workmates from my town might see me. This time I went by day, and I got the ""full experience"" of seeing the face and body of the hooker I was paying for a long time.

I got to see the tired face (but not after she went wet) and the scars of her body. Stinking armpits and pussy and extremely hairy. I saw how her pussy rubbed against the backseat of the car and got disgusted of her looks. She looked so old and ugly and worked out. I was contributing to that.

I sucked her titty and some juice came out , kissed her, tried not to use her as a cum dumpster as she is. I treated the like humans. I don't know whether I'll get a disease from it. I even tongue kissed her. i didn't think ""how many dicks she sucked"" . I came in another street hooker raw because I wanted to know how it feels. It felt awesome. Who knows , maybe I'll get that experience from a girlfriend.

I don't know if I got something yet, I took STD tests after two weeks turns out I got nothing. I'll repeat them 3 months from now.

I went to hookers because of horniness and lack of experience. I wanted to see how a wet woman felt, I've been missing it for a long time.

But I'm not going anymore. I deleted the phone numbers and I'm not going to spend countless hours in my car searching for them, or talking to them and paying them.

I spent a lot of money but very good experience. Nobody knows I went there. Nobody. I ask my female colleagues what they think and almost all say it's degenerate. And people who go there are more degenerate for paying . If they only knew..."

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

lonely,Surrounded by people but alone and exhausted,"Surrounded by people but alone and exhausted - I live in DC, go to college and have 'friends'. I feel incredibly disconnected from a 'normal' life. Everyone in my major seems to have friends; I talk to one guy but out of convenience alone. Outside of class I go to the gym and cook and sleep. The friends I met to begin my college experience I've maintained out of fear of being alone. I visit them and hang out but I don't feel as if I belong. Even 'friends' that I've spoken to in an 'intimate' manner, I don't feel a connection with them. If they all disappeared tomorrow or I went to a different city, I would not be affected. I stuff my mind full of self-improvement/discipline/enjoyment content in my free time to make my situation as bearable as possible. At this point, it seems to be a waste. I see people doing similar things but I see them as less (must be projecting). I just feel empty. I know it gets better, but I'm tired of waiting. I just want to accelerate what should be the natural way of things, real relationships. I hesitate to search for intimacy bc I feel I need to be secure in who I am and what I'm doing before I lead someone on. The last gf and real connection I had was 4 years ago. Any advice to make real connections and mitigate the lack of attachment I feel?"
lonely,It's hard to stay positive when you're going to be spending christmas alone.,"It's hard to stay positive when you're going to be spending christmas alone. - I've always been a giver, but recently, I realized I have NEVER gotten a gift from anyone (besides my parents.) No one has offered to get me a soda, no one has ever done anything nice for me. The only exception was when someone held the door for me once.

No one ever wishes me a happy birthday or happy holiday, no one ever puts any effort or cares about me.

I try to stay positive. ""You'll be happy one day.""

It's a horrible feeling realizing that not one person would care if I died.

Some kid I know got hurt and almost died. He had multiple people go 4 hours away to be by his bedside. And I cried because I know if I were to be hurt, not one person would be there.

I am the stereotypical going to die alone in my house without friends.

I have 0 value to people. And people continue to tell me to be positive.

How can I stay positive when I have 0 friends, no one calls or texts me, and I'm going to be spending christmas alone?

I might kill myself on christmas. I've lived long enough. Does anyone want a video, maybe could upload ""fat loser suffocates."""

lonely,What I want for my future and what I want my future family to be like,"What I want for my future and what I want my future family to be like - Sometimes planning for the future makes me feel better about my sad life. It sucks right now but keeping an eye what I want and working towards it helps me feel motivated to keep going.

I wanna be rich or comfortably upper middle class. I want to own land and have a farm and have a cool custom gothic mansion that I design. I have never felt truly at home in any of the places I have lived in, and it always felt like a temporary arrangement (and often it was). I wan't something permanent and personal to me.

I want a wife. I will look after my health and appearance and I hope she would do the same so we could gracefully grow old together. We should be open and honest about everything, no secrets, no lies. If we ever run into a problem, I would hate for it to spiral into a mess of vindictiveness, spite or resentment. Hopefully everything could be worked through with a compromise in a loving and respectful way. Never yelling at each other (I don't yell and sort of shut down when people yell at me) or doing anything purposely cruel. I would want her to curious about the world, and be able to talk to her all night about our ideas, theories, interesting things we learned, and to learn things together because even when you're old there will always be more to learn. Before we settle down with a family it would be nice to travel together and just experience new things and new cultures. I would want her to be goal oriented and aim for success, and I would hope that her version of success is compatible with mine. I would want her to have a fulfilling job that she likes. I don't see minimum wage jobs like being a cashier as a fulfilling career so I think that would bother me if they didn't have any plans beyond that. Something like being a nurse, artist, scientist, or teacher or even volunteering time to help the less fortunate, it might just be me projecting my own values but I think those are the kind of things that are going to make a person happy in their career. If she wants to stay at home that's fine too, there will probably be a lot of work to do there as well.

I want a lot of children. I think 12 children would be cool. I would like to biologically have 2 or 3, preferably have both a boy and a girl but it doesn't really matter. I don't have much of a family so having a huge family that I create appeals to me a lot. The rest could be foster children or adopted or the spawn of my wife.

I kind of want to have my own farm aswell, growing flowers (because it's beautiful and profitable) and also livestock, like sheep (because they are cute and profitable) and someone also gave me the idea to get bees, and that would be pretty cool. I would like to have some teenage foster sons, both because nobody really wants a teenaged boy so they rarely ever get homes and also I imagine that they could help tend to the farm and could learn work ethic and learn to manage money. I think I would like to foster an autistic child as well because I know that children with special needs often don't get very good homes if they get placed at all and while I am high functioning, I still empathize with those less fortunate and I think I would be able to understand their needs better than a neurotypical parent. 

I would want us to eat dinner at the table every night with very little exception. I never really got to do this with my family, but I experienced it when I was in foster care and I really liked it. I want to put my future kids into stuff like ballet, piano, karate or like whatever they are interested in so that they can develop a passion for something because I think that's important. I wanna have an open and honest relationship with my future kids so that they never feel afraid to confide in me. I wouldn't punish them for the sake of establishing dominance, consequences would just follow behavior so they can learn that they can't just get away with bad behavior in life.

I would really like to enforce structure, partially because I had very little growing up, everything was very chaotic. I would want dinner to occur roughly around the same time every night but breakfast and lunch could have more flexibility because of school, work and other obligations. I would want to teach my future children responsibilities and independence like cleaning up after themselves starting at when they are toddlers, giving them a small allowance, maybe sometime like a quarter a week for 6 year olds because I remember thinking of that as a lot of money and they can learn to save up for things they want like a snack or stickers or something like that.

I would like to go out and do things as a family like go to the zoo, disneyland, see museums, go to art galleries, have picnics at the park, go camping. Going out once a month seems doable. Also doing things as a family like game nights where we play monopoly, cards against humanities for the teenagers, and stuff like that sounds amazing. 

Wanna teach them how to cook and everyone could take turns helping with cooking. I would want us to have healthy home cooked meals and practice meal prep (where you make a lot of food and then freeze it for later) to save time and money. But maybe every now and then we could get something like pizza and ice cream. 

I think TV, and electronics should be limited. Could do this by only having one TV instead of having TV's in people's bedrooms so that the television time can be monitored more. We could have a desktop in the living room too so it will be less likely for them to look up weird stuff and it would be used mostly for homework and related things. We could also have all the latest gaming equipment like virtual reality head gear and what not, and they could use it for as long as they want as long as their chores and homework is done.  If possible they will only get flip phones to use to call me or their other mom if they need to get picked up from school or maybe their friends parents if something was arranged with them. Basically a phone that can call and text but doesn't have any apps until maybe like 16, partly because by then they would be able to get jobs and buy their own phone anyways.

I also want to teach them about sex and relationships so they have a healthy view on it. I always thought it was weird that people lie to their kids where babies come from?"

It seems like every time I think that I have reached the worst and it will only feel easier from now, something much more painful comes along and life becomes many folds more difficult. I just can not win it, no matter how much ""learned"" I become in handling this pain. Every week brings a new wave of loneliness and misery. By now I know it never gets easier. It just keeps getting worse and worse until one day it takes your life. I am so broken at this point that I don't care about anything, life, goals, career, happiness! (what is that?).

Yes but what hurt the most was her reaction and what she did afterwards, I remember the next day of school a bunch of people stared at me and laughed, a lot of people I didn’t know but I knew were In her grade/friend group. Idk what she did or said but people everyday for the rest of 11th grade kinda just laugh at me and stared at me from a distance, no I wasn’t a weird kid or anything  I guess she just really didn’t like me, which was fine but idk why she had to go to extra mile and humiliate me like that, after that year my confidence never really fully recovered I still think about it every now and then  , it was seriously one of the worst years of my life, after high school I lost contact with a lot of people so my friend group had shrunk to a handful,  who are busy individuals, Im also a very private person and I’m really embarrassed to talk about my depression and loneliness with my close friends mostly because I don’t want them to worry about me, after high school I had flirted with girls but it never turned into anything I think my problem Is that I care too much about people too easily, it’s lead to me being used , I know I have a lotta love to give but I keep giving it to the wrong people and frankly it’s sucked me dry of happiness and hope I’m 24 btw I know I’m young but I’ve heard that so many times now I just ignore it as it doesn’t help me at all with my situation of breaking out of this rut I’ve been in for the last 6-7 years of my life, so I seek advice from this subreddit community, honestly if I don’t get a response that’s okay it was nice to vent this out after years of holding it in anyways."

I feel so down today as a result and I don't know what to do. Is a coffee buddy too much to ask for?"

lonely,I thought life would be different,"I thought life would be different - Title says it all. I’m married to my high school sweetheart and it’s true what they say. We’ve grown apart over the years, and it’s to the point where I’m not sure if we still love one another or if we just tolerate the marriage for our child. Well shit, I know I just tolerate if for my child. She works constantly, and I’m busy. So I’m busy with work, and I work alone,  or I’m home but no matter what I’m alone...It’s been years of this. And when I say she works constantly I mean she is gone as much as an armed forces member almost. I see my wife for an average of 2 days a month. When we have that time together it’s worse than when I’m alone. Nothing but arguments and palatable tension. We clash on everything. There’s no commonalities between us anymore. She doesn’t know me or understand me in any level. Deep down my soul yearns for freedom. I yearn to be loved and to love again. I yearn to feel contentment and peace with my life again. I yearn most of all to feel happiness. I don’t think I’ve been truly happy in many years. I feel so detached and alone. I wish I had made different choices in life."

It was honestly so nice to finally have someone who genuinly seemed interested in what i had to say and wanted to have a fun time with me. I wanted to ask for their number or something, but i was scared to do so. Now ill most definitely never see them again, and it hurts. I hate myself."
lonely,23 and running out of time,"23 and running out of time - I’m 23F, only child of older, conservative Christian parents, and I’m getting my master’s degree. I’m introverted and overweight/obese. However I have people tell me that I’m beautiful and kind, and I believe them. But it just seems like finding a social scene or making friends beyond a few people is next to impossible. 

I essentially just ended a 1 1/2 year LDR because my boyfriend (whom I met online) wasn’t a member of my church, isnt a US citizen, and my parents didn’t know about him until they found out (I didn’t tell them). Needless to say this was emotionally traumatizing but they basically told me to breakup with him because I didn’t really know who he is, isnt a member of my church, etc. He is the first guy that made me feel loved and seen for who I am, and we got along so well. But the truth is, I didn’t truly see myself marrying him (due to other reasons) so it’s probably for the best. 

I have felt almost my whole life, since I was about 8-9 years old, that making friends is harder for me than it seems to be for other people. 

I hear about other girls getting all of this attention from guys in real life, but I haven’t really experienced this except for a few that I would never want to date (they are great guys and I’m nice to them, but I’m just not interested). 

I know that being fat is a turn off for many guys, and even other people in general because who wants to be friends with the fat girl? Nevertheless I see overweight women with handsome boyfriends and plenty of friends. 

I am not autistic. I am not socially anxious now, per se although I definitely had textbook social anxiety throughout my teen years and through undergrad. 

My I met my first “real” boyfriend” my first semester of my freshman year of undergrad. He turned out to be a piece of shit and told me he was gay to make breaking up with me “easier.” (He later told me this and that it was a lie that he was gay.) 

With my second boyfriend, I made pretty much all the effort with him and he ended up throwing me away for someone else anyway. 

My third, well, I told you the story earlier in this post. 

I feel lonely in general. There are a few lovely young women in my program that I’ve become acquaintances with, and a high school friend that I’ve gotten back in touch with that goes to a university close by, but none of them seem to have the time to actually get together. 

All the people at my church are either old (60s-70s) or close to my age, but married with kids. They don’t consider me “one of them” because I’m not married. If I say hi to them, they don’t bother to try and carry a conversation even if I ask them about themselves and their families. 

A lot of the on-campus activities happen when I have to work. 

All in all, I guess I just wanted to know that I’m not alone in feeling lonely, and scared that I won’t find anyone interested in me. 

I’m confident “enough” most days, but I definitely can’t compete with these beautiful, fit girls I see on campus. Also I haven’t met any guys that i would be interested in. I don’t want to try dating apps yet because I’m still recovering from this recent breakup, but I guess I just feel like at 23, soon to be 24, I’m running out of fucking time to get married and find the “one.” I don’t want to be in my 30’s still single, and only have my desperate male counterparts available. I guess that sounds hypocritical but I feel like I’m missing out on what should be a normal social life and normal social development for a young woman my age. I feel like I’m just not quite normal. 

Like I said, I’m an only child, which makes the feelings of loneliness worse sometimes since I see others having these awesome relationships with their sisters and brothers, which is something I’ll never have. I’ve had friends that I’ve tried to make into substitute siblings, but that just ends up being too much for them and they don’t feel the same amount of affection for me as I do them. 

I just feel socially pathetic, I guess 🤷🏻‍♀️

I’m tired of older folks from my religious community telling me to just have more faith, participate, and talk to other people when that seems to have not helped anything. 

I was hoping to meet my future husband in undergrad. I’m waiting until marriage but I can’t help from time to time being insanely jealous of these married couples that get to have sex every day with the person they love while I can’t even find one guy to actually date in real life. 

I’m tired of seeing these groups of friends talking about how they’re “friends forever” or taking trips together and taking care of each other like family, when my “best friend” forgets to even text me back for weeks. 

Am I pathetic? This is definitely a rant and I try to keep positive most days. But I just feel extremely lonely sometimes and it just bubbles over into this sense of fear that I’ll be alone my whole life."
lonely,"I am bored, sleepy, exhausted, in need of attention, lonely right now.","I am bored, sleepy, exhausted, in need of attention, lonely right now. - So i feel soooo lonely right now. And idk what i am doing or should be doing its all in the air. When i was in school i expected college would be good so i waited for this time for long. Like really long and like pushed everything fun to the time when I'll be in college. Also expected to have a girlfriend. But now that i am in college i don't really like the degree i am doing and don't exactly know what I'll do after it. And COLLEGE ISN'T FUN TOO. Like its almost the same or worst as school. So now idk when exactly will i have fun in my life. And like along with that i don't really have anyone close who can validate me or could like give me enough attention to make me feel good about myself. (ik the thing about that you should not depend on others for feeling good about yourself but i just can't help it). So..idk
Hey, what's up?"
lonely,Maybe being lonely is better,"Maybe being lonely is better - This is not advice or anything, but this is coming from someone who has been through a few experiences. Having alot of friends? did that(although that was way back in like middle school so idk if it counts). Talking to people but still feeling alone? Been there, done that.. Having no friends at all? That's pretty much my life 
Actually having friends? Well that's what I'm here to talk about. I knows a lot of people on here are looking for a gf/bf, for me that's way too far a dream.
Anyways from my very little experience, no one is here to stay. It doesn't matter what they say people will leave you behind. You know what sucks even more than having no friends? When you think you finally have a friend and watching them slowly replace you with someone else. Watching the friendship slowly die and someone you really care about lose interest in you hurts like a bitch. Or maybe it's just that I haven't had a close friend for a long, long time idk. Friendly piece of advice, try your best to not  have just one close friend because trust me, it doesn't matter how close you are, at the end of the day people are living for themselves. And you might need someone else to go to. 

I was sad when I had no close friends (i still don't i guess), but guess what? Losing friends hurts just as much, maybe even more so."
lonely,I'm just tired...,"I'm just tired... - That's the usual response if someone says I'm looking a little rough. Most people accept it and move on.

All I want is someone to share my time with, a girl to love and hold and comfort. But I can't let anyone see past the mask I wear, because what they see could scare them away. I don't want them to see those times where I need to clutch my chest because my physically aches whenever I see two people holding hands, or kissing, or on a date. I just can't share how I feel, because I'm weak and I can't control it. I can't let them see. They shouldn't have to worry about me. I just want them to be happy. I'm just so tired, though."

I hate this trend of “I’m gonna disappear without any reason” on dating apps. I understand why some do it (need to avoid awkward conversations and potential harassment) but the vast majority of it seems to be emotional immaturity or insecurity.

Against my better judgement, I decided to message her on Facebook with this:

“ Hey X, I was glad that we matched and really thought we were hitting it off well. I don’t want to pressure you into doing anything you don’t want to, but I’m just wondering why you decided to unmatch me? I won’t take offense if you’re just not interested, but I enjoyed chatting and was a little confused. Thanks!”

I don’t think this is stalkerish and if she doesn’t reply, I’ll just move on like the other hundred times. An explanation would be nice though.

I dunno, maybe I need someone to talk it out with."

I’ve recently started talking to this girl and I’ve been honest that I have problems with abandonment and such and she says she gets it too- she’s had the same issues with being cheated on constantly. So we hit it off, she admits to liking me back and I think okay wow, this is going great, I just have to make sure I don’t mess it up. Lately though she’s been really distant, to the point of not texting me back until it’s been hours later, even though I know she’s on her phone (going live on Instagram, posting to Snapchat etc.) I don’t want to seem pushy so I don’t bring it up, and when she asks why I don’t text her more I start doing so. But it hasn’t changed, she still ignores my messages for hours. I know she doesn’t owe me a text back but I can’t help but feel that she’s lost interest. While I’d be hurt if she didn’t want to date me, I wouldn’t be upset. I’d rather know than be led on like this because it’s genuinely hurting me. I feel sad all the time and can’t help but feel as if it’s just going to be another name of people who’ve played me. I really like this girl and I’m too afraid of coming off as clingy if I bring it up. I feel like she texts me when she’s bored. What should I do?"

People have wanted to be my girlfriend but I couldn't put that on anyone when I'm currently a man, I couldn't see her like that because I wish to be the female, not the male.. the fact that I'll never be the female in a relationship just makes me feel so hopeless that I'll ever find love, the fact that after surgery I'm going to lose so many people I called 'friends'. Nobody messages me anyways so I guess it won't be much different except I'll get constantly harassed in the street and probably end up killing myself because who would ever want someone like me as a female, nobody..."

lonely,I have literally no one,"I have literally no one - Despite my efforts to reach out, it's like they pity me so they feel obligated to respond but it's always short replies no matter what. I'm on independent study and anytime I'm not working I'm just going on pointless walks that don't last long since I'm weak, underweight and out of shape and too tired to excercise or eat enough. Maybe I'm sitting around, listening to music, on my computer or sleeping. I sleep in until afternoon, sometimes evenings which makes me feel especially worse because I know I'm basically wasting my life. Holidays are hard when you have no one to go out with, obviously.

I finally felt like I got close with someone but that person, despite being kind, always seems to blow me off. Just recently, my whole family got tickets to go on a short trip but there wasn't an extra left so I made plans to hang out with this person, but they canceled last minute. My family just felt bad for me, like always. And I cant help but always apologize for it. I might as well apologize for my existence.

lonely,A loner with big dreams,"A loner with big dreams - I bet if you are on this subreddit is because you have felt lonely or you are currently wandering earth on your own.
I've felt alone all my life.
I don't know if it is because no one fits me or i'm too picky. 
I'm surrounded by people everyday. My family and classmates, but everyone seems so fucking far away from me, from the way i think, from the way i perceive life. From humor to sorrow. 
Like Robin williams said ""I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone"" 

My best friend got mad at me because i was in love with her. I lost her in every aspect, tbh she took a part of me with her. She was like the closest person i've ever had, but since she left me i've been withouth no one, not even a close friend, just random people. And i think it's gonna be a hard time to find someone to be that close. 
But i would really love to have someone traveling with me throught life's ups and downs. 
In college i feel very isolated, my classmates are inpersonal and in other frequence. 
And i can't figure out if no one wants to connect with people anymore. 
Everyone is on their phone, everyone is cold and moody. They call me weird, but to me they are weird. 
The other day i was in a comic store, there were two guys looking mangas, they took Berserk and didn't knew what that was. So in a friendly way i recommended that manga to them, i received for answer some insults and laughts. 
Then i said to the girl on the cash registrer: ""there's not a lot of polite people these days, isn't it"", she said ""whatever"". 
I left the store watching at my comics and asking myself: ""why these drawings act more human than real humans"" 
I was kinda dissapointed on humanity, and modern relationships. 
I dream every night woth a better world, withouth wars and suicides and killings. 
Withouth people being shit to each other. 
Withouth disconnection.
Death Stranding gave me this idea, of connection, reconecting with people.

My friends are also in college. One tried essentially cutting me off over something over a year old in order to rectify his relationship with his girlfriend. My other friends hardly talk to me.

lonely,My loneliness has become my comfort,"My loneliness has become my comfort - So, when I’m in a social situation I find it hard to drop my guard and let people in due to past experiences. 
On the odd occasion that I do go out I feel uneasy and just can’t wait to get back to my flat where I feel safe and I can be me. 
Yet I know the more I do that the worse the feelings in my head will become and the more uneasy and withdrawn I’ll become. 

Does anyone else have these sorts of feelings?"
lonely,Considering ending it all,"Considering ending it all - 20 years old and never so much as held a girls hand. I’ve done everything people tell me to do. Diet and exercise for several months to get in decent shape. Consistently apply skin medication for my acne. I’m still ugly and no girl would touch a guy like me. I can’t take an appealing picture. I don’t know how to ask a girl out and every time I’ve tried it’s terrifying. I’ll be seen as even more of a creepy loser than I am now. Every time I’ve deluded myself into thinking I had a chance with a girl it blows up in my face. Not that I deserve their affection, but it hurts not being wanted by anyone.
“Oh sorry, I don’t like you that way. Maybe someday if I don’t find someone better.” 
“Oh, well I was actually hoping you could set me up with your friend. You think you could do it? He’s really cute!” 
Cases such as these, or there’s all the other girls that each and every time I work up the courage to ask them out, I find out shortly before I say anything that they already have someone. 
I don’t care about sex. All I want is to be able to cuddle up with someone and hear them say they love me. To hear them talk about their day and for me to make them laugh. That’s all I want in life but I just can’t have it. 
I figure, if I’m so unlovable, if no girl could ever even consider being with me, what’s the point? Why should I continuing enduring any longer? If I can’t experience the fundamental core of what it means to be human, being fully and genuinely accepted by someone; why should I keep going?"
lonely,Fuck happy people,"Fuck happy people - Your'e all just so perfect and pretty on your Instagram or Snapchat but its all just fucking bullshit to hide the filth and loneliness you feel inside. You stare at your screens, worship them like gods. You eat into consumerist and political bullshit everyday like the sheep you fucking are. I have been ostracized my entire fucking life, because I didn't look this way or that. I like my jeans not ripped, I like older music, I like to run and do math. And for that unforgivable crime you punished me. You left me out in the rain while I begged for some form of care or friendship. But did you ever listen to my pleas? No. You just forget about me, like everyone else that has ever reminded you of the fucking monster you are inside. You stick with your friends and deep down you know you've become so accustomed to being one in a pack that you are nothing without them. You laugh at what they laugh at. You like what they post. Be cool or be cast out. You fear loneliness though you know you are as alone as you could ever be, and that fear keeps you there. That fear that is always there that would gut you down to the bone if you were ever separated from that privileged feeling of being better than others, because you are more popular or you have more money. You probably aren't even reading this because you don't even bother to read. You don't try to further your knowledge or help your fellow man. And its not fucking fair. I didn't want to be told to man up, I didn't want to force myself to learn guitar so I could take my mind off the crushing loneliness I felt, the separation I felt from my parents and those around me who avoided me like a plague. You saw it like that right? A PLAGUE. A SICKNESS. A DISEASE UPON YOUR OH SO CYSTAL CLEAR CONSCIENCE. Its just post this, feel good, date him, date her, break his heart. Its all the fucking same to you right? Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. ku.jbm86fofkujnbvky8u"

They only ever do this stuff when I'm not there, like I'm just their stupid burden of a ""friend,"" who's probably too soially inept and/or stupud to catch a clue that they just don't want me around them.

And when I am around them, they never do this kind of stuff. No movies, no going out, no friend stuff. The only thing they do is take pictures, and it's always the ones I tell them to delete, mainly because I they're always taken without warning. And they never delete them, even though I practically beg them to, and it makes me so fucking upset. It's like they use me for their personal entertainment, and when I try to reach out and do stuff that friends are supposed to do, they either ghost me or low-key mock me, like when one of them hinted at me being ""fat,"" and sometimes it makes me wonder if they just hate me.

It fucking hurts. I want them to stop babying me, and to stop treating me like an animal. I'm not an animal, I'm a human being. A living, breathing, human being, with ideas and opinions on many things. And they just act like I don't matter, like I'm just some random person that they've never met. And even then, they'd probably treat a random person a LOT better than they treat me...

At this rate, I'm probably just going to start ghosting them back, it's becoming kinda stressful to be putting in effort into one-sided friendship, especially if it's multiple one-sided friendships. I'm so tired, and sick, and emotionally drained from their bullshit. I just want to feel like I have friends, not like I'm just there because they pity me, or because they just don't know howto shake me off.I wish they could straight up just tell me they hated me, instead of play mind games like this. It's not fun at all, and I just wish they would respect me for once...

I'm sorry I really just needed to get this off my chest. At this rate, Reddit is becoming my personal venting space. But if this is the only place I can be allowed to express my feelings and thoughts, then so be it. No one else will listen, so why not just let it out here? I just want people to listen to me for once, insteado of talking over me, and interrupting me, and invalidating the things I like. I just wanna feel appreciated, like a person should feel...

TL: DR: My friends continue to make plans purposely excluding me, and it's starting to fuck with me. The fact that they also constantly make me feel invalidated is also fucking with me too, and I don't know how much longer I can put up with it..."

If all other needs are met, then why do we have to experience this  “pain” that drives us to socialize with others? We no longer need this evolutionary need for cooperation as the world has become less communal and more individualistic. Also isn’t any emotion a state of mind that one could detach from? In my case loneliness has caused me to be Mildly depressed, but how can that be if I never have attempted to socialize? I either accept loneliness as an unchangeable fact and get on with my life, though this steeliness doesn’t last very long. Or I feel depressed about my situation, but during that it causes me to be introspective. Which has lead me to ask myself why I feel depressed if I haven’t even attempted to socialize with anyone yet?"
lonely,Attempted to socialize....ugh it was awful,"Attempted to socialize....ugh it was awful - I tried. I really tried. I don't think I can do this.

So, I have talked about my loneliness on reddit before. You may have even read about me. I'm that 23 year old who hasn't had a single meaningful friendship since elementary school. I am still a virgin who has never been on a date or kissed a girl. I have never even asked a girl out because I have never flirted and am socially inept. I have even have an imaginary girlfriend as a coping mechanism for how bad I feel about myself when lonely in my studio every weekend night. I have had thoughts if ending it all before (before I found purpose in this new job I recently started that I deeply enjoy). 

Well...I tried ""just putting myself out there"". Since I recently started this nes job I was living in a completely new city, so I was hoping that maybe I could have a fresh start. Well...it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience. 

So one of my co-workers (who has been working there for some time and has lived in Pittsburgh for a while so he has a good social life) said that he and his wife are having a party at his place and anyone from my company was invited to go. So, I decided to just give it a try and just ""come out of my shell"". I was even feeling some confidence in me. I dressed better than I usually do, and went. 

I was the only person from my company that went. Everyone else were either old friends of the co worker or friends of his wife from medical school. I tried making small talk but to absolutely no avail, and every failure made feel more shitty about myself. Nothing I said sounded interesting. None of my jokes are funny. Just like in my college days, my high school days, my middle school days, and even for the most part my elementary school days...I was a nobody when it came to socializing. I was that awkward kid in the corner. There were many ladies there, but i wasn't even trying to hit on any of them. I just wanted to try and make a friend maybe (guy or girl) but maybe I was asking too much for myself.

Also I had a hard time relating to all the stories. They were talking about how they had friends that did this or a girlfriend that does that or a date that went like this or a honeymoon that went like that. I mean I don't blame them. It's not like they I know I am basically a zygote when it comes to a social or romantic life. And if they knew, they would want to get away from me. 

Also physically I felt insignificant. '8 and pretty much everyone was taller than me (some of them were in great shape). Even the women were taller than me. So yeah, I'm a total manlet too (when will I ever learn hahaha). 

So yeah, in some ways a social setting made feel like even more of a loser than I do when alone (at least when I am alone I can distract myself from those thoughts with stuff I like). I tend to look forward to working, because my job is the one thing that gives my life meaning because it's in an industry I love (space robotics....not NASA but they give us funding) and it had for the most part ended my thoughts of ending it all...but unfortunately not entirely, because outside of work I have nothing to do that keeps me feeling purposeful. Noone outside my kin really cares about me, and in order to grow as a person I have to grow outside of my kin obviously. 

So yeah. Here I am. I don't know what to do about it. And I am deeply ashamed to say it, but it does tear me up the more I realize this about myself. I feel like my ship has sailed. I feel like I am destined for this.

Sorry for getting melodramatic. 

Tl;dr I tried socializing and it didn't work out and ended feeling lonelier."
lonely,I imagine myself surrounded with friends.,"I imagine myself surrounded with friends. - When I'm home alone, I imagine myself surrounded like it's a party or an event going on.  Some of these people are real life people, that I imagine pouring drinks and roaming my house.  The other ones though, are completely imaginary.

I feel that if I talk more to the imaginary ones it will make me stronger since I won't need to lean on anyone to not be lonely anymore.  I don't think that it works though.

TLDR:  I imagine people because i'm lonely, lets talk \^\_\^"
lonely,sad,"sad - i feel awful complaining about my life because i know people have it way worse than me. i dont even know where to begin lol. my first serious relationship just ended, he dumped me out of the blue and said he wanted to stay friends then proceeded to ghost me, epic. i miss waking up excited to talk to him and always having someone there for me. being in a relationship was the first time I didn’t feel lonely. i have always been scared of commitment and i never open up to people so it really sucks losing the person i did open up to. for so many years i avoided relationships because i didn’t want to go through something like this. now i hate myself even more than i did before. 

i have no excuse to be lonely or sad, i am surrounded by friends yet i choose to keep my feelings bottled up. i dont want to burden anyone and i just feel like no one can really relate to me. all my friends party and live life stress free but im lame sober and boss level depressed. im in that loop of like not going out because im depressed and then being depressed because i didn’t go out, ykno? i let myself soak in self pity every day, telling myself there is no purpose of living. i have no willpower to change things i just survive by turning how i feel into a joke.

lonely,Nobody approaches me or makes the first move,"Nobody approaches me or makes the first move - M18 and I’ve never really been approached and asked for like my number or Snapchat or anything like that by a girl. I always have had to make the first moves and be the one to put myself out there. And I do, I have the confidence to put myself out there, although it gets harder and harder with each denial. I’m not an unattractive guy I will admit. Nothing incredibly attractive but I know that I’m not completely unattractive, so idk is it normal that nobody has ever approached me for something like that? And is there reasoning? Like do most girls just wait for men to make the first move and that’s why they don’t approach? Orrrr is it time I start reevaluating my appearance ? ;( 

Note: please please please don’t think I’m mad at women for not approaching me. Like I’m not throwing a tantrum nor thinking that I’m this amazing dude but for some reason women won’t talk to me. I promise I’m not like that. I’m not an incel. I do consider myself nice and I would like to think I have a pretty good personality though! But I’m not angry, I’m just kinda curious I suppose.

lonely,Trying to Find Peace in the Loneliness,"Trying to Find Peace in the Loneliness -   Hello, I'm an 18 year old guy and I just wanted to write my thoughts somewhere because I don't anybody to share them with. This year is coming to a close and I've reflected a lot on what has happened the past couple years for me. I've never been able to be very social because I've always lived in the same rural area and I don't get the chance to talk to people ever really. When I do I always just feel like an outsider because I never feel I have anything in common with people.

  My family has never treated me well, friends just come and go, and my ex girlfriend started treating me badly until I got her out of my life. I can't feel a connection to anybody and it hurts. Everybody feels so cold to one another and it's sad that there's lonely people when we're surrounded by people all the time, it doesn't make sense.

  I tried my hardest to make things work with people because I truly cared about them but you can't force things to happen. I always tried to understand and people would appreciate it but end up taking advantage and being so hurtfully manipulative. I realized these people really didn't deserve me in their lives so I just stopped talking to them and about all of them regretted it but they already had their chance.

  I finally realized I shouldn't put my self worth on how other people treat me because most people really don't matter in the end. I notice a lot of people really aren't that good and are incredibly selfish. It's been extremely hard to let go of past pain and even still I don't feel that great. 

  I've gotten tired of being so self defeating and letting other people get to me. I'm trying to do what I can to improve my own life without anyone's influence. I thought that I needed a relationship to be fulfilled but I don't really feel ready for that when the people my age are immature and I believe I need to just work on becoming the best version of myself I can be before that. As long as I focus on accomplishing my life goals and try to improve myself I'm sure someone that appreciates me will come around naturally instead of me ""searching"" for someone and that being my goal.

  I've had two dreams for years now. The first was to learn Spanish because I've always wanted to learn another language and it's the most common second language in the US. I think it's a really cool thing to be able to have a window to another culture and having that bridge of understanding. It would give so many opportunities to do things most people I know couldn't.

  My second dream has been to be a musician. I play guitar and I study music on my own. I've always been so inspired by music that I don't think I would be here without it, it's comforted me through the worst of times. I think there's so much beauty in listening to and playing music. I would love to make music that can do for other people what my inspirations of have done for me hopefully. 

  Sorry this was long, I just had a lot I was thinking about. I hope this didn't sound too stupid lol. Thanks to anyone that actually reads this, I know it was a long ramble."

lonely,I'm scared to be alone any longer.,"I'm scared to be alone any longer. - I've been pushed away my whole life, I've always felt completely alone.ll throughout my school life kids and staff were cruel, I missed out on every milestone a kid could have and grew up afraid- I waited an hour after school everyday for a ride because I was too scared to walk the four minute walk home thinking from the start of the day to the end that is was the day they were gonna follow through with what they said and kill me because boys don't act like that in Texas. My family pushed me away because I was shameful. 
I started transitioning when I was 18, dropped out of college to work and pay for hormones, started dating, I was going to live like I wanted to. I got my first boyfriend shortly after, I was so desperate to be wanted and not pushed away, I ignored alot of red flags and it eventually got worse, and became constant abuse. It took my nine months but I finally walked away, it would be a few more months before I felt enough self worth to stay away. I remember feeling like that same scared kid I was in Highschool. I started sleeping with my TV and hall light on (I still do) it would be years before I stopped waking up every hour to scan my room and check the locks, and another two years before I'd even think about dating again. 
At 19 my hair started falling out, chunks and chunks of hair would come out during showers. I was freaking out! I'm only nineteen and I'm chalked full of hormones, trans women start GAINING hair after starting HRT. I spent all the money I had seeing doctors, getting blood work and eventually saved up enough for a scalp biopsy (OUCH) results were inconclusive and I was getting the same answers from diffrent doctors . ""This SHOULDN'T be happening"" and ""it will eventually resolve itself as long as you continue hormones"" (it just continued to progressively get worse)
At 20 - 22 (I recently turned 22 last month) was when I realised it never ""gets better"" I found out last year I wasn't the only person my ex was abusing, he was also abusing a younger family member of his. I was 18 when my 28 year old ex pursued me, he took every opportunity to assert his dominance, age and strength over me. He made sure to constantly tell me that I would never be good enough for a life long partner. I didn't know his family beyond a few pictures, videos ane brief conversations. There was nothing I could have done to bring it to light, I had absolutely no clue but even the thought that this may have been going on while he called me his girlfriend makes my heart ache for her. I knew he was a sick individual for what he did to me, and to have done what he did to that young girl, his own family only solidifies how depraved he is and my inability to see that depravity makes me hate myself. 
Last April approximately two years after my first relationship I ventured into dating again. He was persistent, sweet and what I thought was the closest thing to a gentleman I'd ever get. He talked to me morning and night, called me during my lunch break, held my hand, opened every door for me and always walked me to my porch. I thanked him profusely for every little thing, I know to most it's just common decency but I had never been shown that kinda kindness before. It was a complete 180° the first time he got me alone.  He forced himself on me, grabbed me so hard I was bruised for days, I told him no, that I didn't want to, I wasn't ready but he refused to let up I said ok after what felt like hours, it hurt so much. I held myself after it happened and as he laid next to me, panting he said ""your first time's supposed to be special, huh"". How low he must have seen me to think him forcing himself on me made me feel special. He drove me home and I cried myself to sleep that night. I continued to see him, I felt the need to ""make the best"" out of every situation because history told me things don't get better. I asked him not to leave bruises on my breasts and waist but to him my request to respect my body was a throw away suggestion, he stopped using condoms after the first time. I spoke up once and told him to use a condom, he said no, just no, like I asked him if he wanted coffee or something and just continued. I've never told anyone that before. It made me feel disgusting, just something to use. He dumped me a few days later. Obviously it was for the best but I'd be lying if I said it didn't sting. 
I felt rotted inside, what was wrong with me that these men sought me out.
Shortly after I was outed at my faith based job, coworkers stopped talking to me, managment became unbearable, I had no choice but to leave. I was left unemployed and completely ran through my 401k and my savings, I put a great strain on what little support I had.
Then came August (my last paragraph I swear) my hair loss was at an all time high, I went from progressive thinning to losing about two solid inches off my hair line on both temples. I made an appointment with my pcp and begged for a prescription. She wrote me one and after a brief battle with my insurance I picked it up. After three weeks I began breaking out, boil like bumps under my skin, closed comedones and run of the mill pimples on my cheek and temple. I thought I could wait it out but it became so painful. I returned a month later and was given a topical cream, after three months with no progress I made another appointment with a dermatologist I was prescribed an antibiotic lotion, a chemical exfoliant and a medicated wash. After three weeks of this new combination and still no progress I emailed my dermatologist and was given a prescription for a powerful oral antibiotic for a month. It been two weeks and I'm at an all time low, my acne blankets my face and my hair loss is steadily getting worse. I feel like this is just another reason that I'm pushed away. I tried talking about it with family, how this is severely affecting my self esteem, how I feel disgusting and depressed and they tell me to get over it. That I'm being ridiculous. Even at my most vulnerable I'm being pushed away. I've felt alone my whole life but to be constantly pushed away even in adulthood hurts tremendously. My whole life people have looked at me one of two ways, like they feel sorry for me, looking away when I meet they're glance or staring back at me, wanting me to know they're disgusted with me and they'd think I'd be better off dead. I can't help but see myself that same way now. I feel disgusted with myself. I have one more doctor I can try and see, maybe two more medications I can try- both of which are not covered on my insurance but I'm terrified. What if she won't see me ? What if the medication is like all the others? 
I just can't take it anymore, after every obstacle I remind myself what I've been through and how I overcame it but I don't think I can do that anymore. I can't be pushed away again, I can't be told to get over it. I'm scared and alone like I was in school , like I've been my whole life and I feel like I'm going to be alone my whole life and that scares me more than anything."

I can join in but I usually have nothing to say, I end up talking about a subject or repeating myself, choking up when I try talking more in depth on something. I never really have anything funny to say so I always end up looking dumb to everyone. When I’m in a group with guys and girls usually the guys all pick something I do or say to laugh about and the girls join in. I get it I’m the quiet one and the one who isn’t capable of saying anything truthfully that would remotely be even funny back.

Afterwards I’ll have to get a job which will end up taking up most of my time working 9-5 and I’ll go home to nobody and still be alone.

We had planned two weeks ago to go biking tomorrow, but OF COURSE they went to a party today that I wasn't invited to (yet again the host(s) seems to have forgotten who I am even though I see them everyday at school, guess I'm not as ""popular""/valued as I thought I was ) and they probably got wasted so they cancelled...

I asked some other friends if they had time, but they had school work to do and I don't blame them for it. 

To add to the fire of loneliness, I'm still in pieces over my ex; even though it happened two months ago, and we're best friends now (hopefully, we don't talk that much because we live in different cities 1h apart), any song that even remotely talks about love or anything related, I spiral down to that part of my mental abyss and it's become so much worse after I started listening to Lewis Capaldi, because his songs resonate with me on another level.

Idk, I'm an absolute mess right now. I have a deadline on Thursday that I'm completely stuck on because I don't know what to do, and the one thing I was looking forward to got cancelled, because my friends forgot that they were going to do something with me and got drunk and high.

Should I just go out on my bike alone, or watch a show, or just sleep, or give my assignment a shot? Idk

I’m tired of hearing the same thing over and over again for years. I’m 21 years old and I’ve never been in a relationship before and it’s killing me. I hate being so alone all of the time. I’m tired of my family asking me if I have girlfriend yet or if I’m dating someone every time I go back home to visit them. I’m sick of hearing them tell me how great I am and someone would be lucky to have me because it really doesn’t feel that way. It hurts to see all of my friends go in and out of relationships over the years while I’m left alone. I just want to connect with someone and be loved. Why is it so hard to find genuine human connection? I don’t have hope anymore."

lonely,Feeling extra lonely tonight,"Feeling extra lonely tonight - It’s a slow weekend, although I’ve got a lot of work to do. Just don’t feel very motivated because I’m feeling so lonely. For some reason, having other people in my life make me want to work more...like there’s a purpose for it. Otherwise I feel like I’m just doing it for myself, and that’s no fun. Anyway, tonight I’m feeling extra lonely and having a hard time not going down the nostalgia path. The idea of distracting myself with something is depressing, because I’ll still be alone. I’m craving interaction. Thankfully, I’ll be going home for the holidays in 6 days and I’ll be around family. Being single can suck sometimes...but that’s my own fault for not putting effort into dating, etc."
lonely,lonely lonely lonely 🙃,"lonely lonely lonely 🙃 - Lately all I do is work and sleep, I don’t feel connected to any one anymore. I tend to close myself off from all people at times, and normally I am fine with being lonely, most of the time I enjoy being by myself actually. However, lately I feel like it has taken a huge toll on my mental health, I have become extremely depressed and miss having a connection with someone, or even having someone to talk to in general. I don’t enjoy anything I used to anymore, music, family, friends, socializing, I feel disconnected from it all, which makes it harder for me to fix any loneliness I have. I go weeks without talking to anyone, sometimes I don’t feel like a real person. My roommate (that I barely talk to already) is moving out soon and I am dreading how alone I will feel when they leave. What do I do? My anxiety makes it hard for me to talk to someone new and I am HORRIBLE at socializing and starting conversation"
lonely,Ghost,"Ghost - I used to have two best friends and we used to do a lot of things together, game nights, days out on our bikes, etc. I went through uni with one of them too and a few years later he took his own life. Now, my only best friend left doesn't talk at all, all my friends have moved ungodly distances away and no longer talk and friends I have that are closer only really chat if I message them first all the time. 
I didn't know where else to put this but all that above has made me a very lonely person with loads of love to give people. I have some Snapchat friends but I miss the human interaction of having someone to do things with or just casually chill out with.
Feeling like a ghost."
lonely,Daydreaming,"Daydreaming - I've always known that I daydream a lot, but recently I've noticed just how much. I spend the majority of the day, daydreaming, I just listen to music and imagine myself somewhere else, Before I go to sleep I'll lay in bed with headphones and daydream till I fall asleep when I wake up I will lay there for hours and just daydream till I have to get up, or when I'm off for college I just do it till I cant. Throughout the day, I'll multitask daydreaming and doing work, Ill space out on public transport or just when I'm walking.

I've noticed how unhealthy it is, but for now, I think it does help sometimes. Just thought I'd share because I found it interesting."

lonely,Finally writing down how I feel after all this time,"Finally writing down how I feel after all this time - 
I use to have to a big group of friends in primary school they were nice and good people to be around with never had any fights with them  we would hang out almost every chance we had. We would never stay in one spot at a time so we would always move around the place if one person was going somewhere the rest would soon follow I never paid attention to it at it first until one one of them said  “Every time I go somewhere everyone has to  follow” those words stuck to me and I started to think I’m I really just a sheep mindlessly following people around without doing what I wanted. Afterwards I started to drift away from the group and exclude myself from them it was the first time i was truly alone in the world and it felt great at first but I also felt empty at the same time. No one from my friend group came up to me and asked where I’ve been or anything like that which made wonder if I were one their friend back in the first place. 

This happened 4 three years ago and now I’m in my third year of high school I still see a lot of them here and there we say hi once or twice but never have I had a real conversation with any of them. Since then I have made an effort to connect with others as I feel I will be another sheep in the herd who doesn’t do what he wants. 

I think I’m just one of those people who is destined to be alone and can’t change in any way. No matter what I or anyone will do to help I won’t be happy."

When I would talk about dating he would say he wasn’t ready yet and that broke my heart which is what led me to stop talking to him. Ever since then I just have been feeling alone and unloveable. I started crying almost every day, and even now I cry every other day or so because I feel alone. I have friends, but I still feel so lonely and I don’t know why.

lonely,I made it to another birthday.,"I made it to another birthday. - As of today, I am 25 years old, which is great because I was so certain I wouldn't make it this far when I was younger (you know how depression is). 

Today just feels sad, though. My family doesn't like to celebrate my birthday because it's also the anniversary of my dad's passing, which is understandable and I don't mind, but I like to take this day to remember him, rather than mourn him all over again. 

The last time a friend got me a cake or any sort of gift was like 5 years ago when my best friend was more excited for my birthday than I was. That was before he got sick, though. He's gone now. I haven't really made any new friends since him. I don't know how. I haven't really wanted to. Haven't really felt ready to, which probably isn't healthy and I know I should move on, but I'll leave that problem for another day.

I'm usually pretty okay with celebrating alone, but today just seems so weird. Really cold. Really lonely. Really sad. Ah well. It will pass. I just needed to vent a little bit, I guess."

I dont have close friends. My best friend for 6 years (she was amazing) just stopped talking to me this year. Wouldn't reply to my texts. I saw her recently and she walked right past me laughing.. 
I feel like it stuck me with some sort of attachment issues (?). I stay reserved and quiet because I'm scared they'll leave like she did. She's not the only one to do this and it really hurts. 

I've been looking for a relationship and actively dating but no one seems to want to be in a relationship. It's hard finding someone to be intimate with, and not just for one night. 

Just today,  I was supposed to be getting drinks with a friend. I waited for an hour for her. No text, no call, no nothing.  I felt so sad and alone.  
When I was waiting for her, this cute guy walks in with flowers, for his girlfriend (my coworker). Such a nice thing to see but man... wish that could've been me. 

I keep blaming myself for this..

lonely,"Always feeling lonely in the end, what’s wrong with me?","Always feeling lonely in the end, what’s wrong with me? - Okay hey, so here’s the problem bugging me recently.
Yes, I have friends. And guess what, I have a good personal connection with them at that. 
Maybe I shouldn’t be on this sub, but I feel I truly belong here. 
Firstly what hurts me is that I hit people up on text/call way more than they do. This directly makes me feel like I’m the one who cares more, like they have busier lives and better priorities than me. 
Secondly what I’ve realised is that, when I’m texting someone or on call with someone I mostly do feel happy, then as soon as I stop talking five minutes later I feel lonely again. Like, okay, who’s the next person? Should I text this person now? It sounds like I am scared of being alone and am not comfortable with myself but that’s not true at all, I love being alone a lot. I think what I want is some constant security, maybe in the form of a romantic relationship (it’s been YEARS since I’ve dated) or someone I like to constantly give me attention. Yes I sound needy, maybe I am. 
I think what I want is someone to check up on me, to share things about everyday with, rather than party here and there, and have my friends hit me up once a week. My relationship w my family is good/okay too. 
I remember I used to think that “I just want someone, any friend to just hit me up” but I’ve realised even that isn’t enough. It does make me happy, but only momentarily. I guess I crave a lot of attention? Is that a problem? But doesn’t everybody? 
In the end I just feel like a lonely, attention-craving fool who cares more about having love and attention than anything."
lonely,Why does this keep happening?,"Why does this keep happening? - I just finished at university. Didn't get the degree but I'll probably be back for it in a few years after making some money. My point though isn't really about the degree but rather about the space and time period that I just ""completed"". Every time I get out of a setting, like leaving high school or a job, I drop out it so cleanly. So alone and left out of whatever cliques or groups and networks that I was apart of. I lose my friends from that setting. No one contacts me. I try my best to keep contact but eventually people just stop showing any interest in talking to me. I have no friends from primary school or high school anymore. I didn't have any friends from the moment I left those settings I suppose. Well, the year is almost up and I've been dreading it since my second year at university because I can't help but believe that the same will happen with all the friendships and groups and bonds I've made while at university. I started feeling alone at uni a long time ago despite my friendships and relationships. And I guess I'm just sad because I know what's coming. A new start. A clean slate. Just me. Alone."

I have lived 3 hours away from my family since I was 18. I had pretty much the same job the whole time. When I lost that job I realized how unprepared I was and how easy it would be for me to become homeless. I decided to move back home so that I would have a better support system. My mom said that I could stay in her camper rent free until I got on my feet. Everything was fine at first but then... 

She started constantly asking for money and running all of the gas out of the truck that I use to go to work. She throws fits if she doesn't get her way. I was giving her at least $5 a day and spending $80 a week in just gas. That may not be a lot for some people but i make $9.25 an hour... She decided that I needed to leave about a week ago. I thought that because I had family around and a full time job that I would be okay. Nope. The only place I could find is the run down motel that we have here in our small town. Today is my last day here because I have dogs and they dont really allow pets. 

I'm almost literally surrounded by family and I have nowhere to go. People that I would have done anything for, dont care about me enough to let me sleep in spare bedrooms, on their couch, or let my dogs sleep in their yard so that I can stay in this motel. I have literally never been this close to just giving up."
lonely,I wish I had a girlfriend,I wish I had a girlfriend - I am an introverted guy. I rarely talk to soneone. I have even less confidence when I talk to girls.

That is my only quality.Even though I talk to girls it will be like serious talks. I cannot change it. There were some girls in my life to whom I could open my heart but then again they won't love a guy like me. They are much more into smart guys. I am currently 24 and never had a girlfriend in my entire life. Now a days it is getting harder and harder to talk to someone. I feel like my entire life is being wasted. Please someone for a short relief  if there are any girls in here please chat with me. I am being so desperate.

lonely,A huge part of me is missing,"A huge part of me is missing - 34 m never been in a romantic relationship. I still have my parents, a friend and i'm very grateful for that, but i feel like i'm missing out on what really means to be alive, to have that kind of love, companionship, someone to share life with. How did this happen you may ask... 2 things: anxiety and poverty(can't work due to severe anxiety). If you'd see me on the street you'd probably think i'm normal, respectable even, which i find both funny and sad...

I want a family, a somewhat normal life and it seems less likely with each passing day. Of course, i don't really deserve such things in the state i'm in, but i've tried to get it under control and just can't, no matter what i do. I hope that if i ever do find someone, somehow, that would push and give me the strength i need to... be a functioning adult basically. Maybe i'm just dreaming...

lonely,People are so quick to suggest people to just abandon others.,"People are so quick to suggest people to just abandon others. - I see this all the time on Reddit. 

Parents are unfair? Move out! 

Friend is being weird or rude? Block him on all social media! 

Partner is acting differently? Dump his arse!

Even people who are friends with those clearly struggling with mental health, or attachment issues, are told to just abandon them because ""it is not OP's fault"". Of course it's not your fault, but you have a responsibility as a human being to help others. It's called being a kind person. I think this whole movement is a bad and selfish path for society. Its like if a relationship is not beneficial to you in some form, there is not need to keep it, to hell with other people. Every relationship will run into problems, bu there is no need to scrap it completely. 

Look this is not a hill I'm willing to die on, but I have dealt with abandonment myself and have been ghosted by people I thought were my friends; so it hurts to see this behavior been encouraged, and it reminds me of being on the other side. If you have a counter argument, I'd love to hear it, so long as you don't insult me beforehand (another thing Redditors are too quick to do, all your doing is putting me on the defensive). 

TLDR: People today are being encouraged to be too quick to abandon others, and have no regard for the feelings of others, just if the relationship benefits them personally. I'd like to hear counter arguments though."

It’s different than FaceTime, almost like Snapchat, but you do have to share your phone number with others to add them as your contacts. Just a thought, I started sending “Polos“ to my real-life contacts and it has helped with my loneliness."

I can't control how to feel anymore and honestly I lost all my hopes for a better future. I had many suicidal crises but lately I've been thinking this much more serious than before. I've became so lonely guys. I have a distant relation with my family. To be honest I don't even think my father sees me as a living, breathing individual. I feel like I'm all about my marks and school success for him. I used to talk with my friends about my problems but because of my family's ""school concerns"" I can't meet with them anymore and everything is stacking up inside of me. I feel so low. I lost my energy for everything. I can't paint, write and only books are keeping me away from feeling lost all the time. My girlfriend dumped me. All these shit started coming up suddenly one by one and I don't know how to deal with them. If I can reach a spot high enough to kill me right now I'd probably jump without thinking. Nobody cares about me. I'm looking at people and how they have this close relations with each other then I'm looking at myself and I just don't have anyone. All I wanted was some love you know. I'm not concerned with money, fame or anything material. My parents didn't care about me even when I was a little kid. I kinda raised myself. Started painting/drawing a little. Got attracted to books and started writing. I used to be filled with passion for art and literature. Then I thought to myself ""How many people are having my situation right now and how can I help them."". Decided to be a psychologist so I can reach up to people with problems like me. To show them they are cared by someone in this world. But all these dreams and passions are dying inside of me. I used to tell myself ""No matter how bad it gets, I know I won't kill myself because I have a dream. I will achieve that dream."" and I was so sure about this thought. But right now I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow."

I have little to no self confidence and am very introverted so I am bad at approaching new people out of the blue or picking up new hobbies/jobs as I’m afraid of failing. I am so picky who I spend my time and energy on. 

However, out of all of this, I am very very lonely and isolate myself in my father’s office all night long.

lonely,23 [M4F] Europe | Anywhere | falling in love the old fashion way,"23 [M4F] Europe | Anywhere | falling in love the old fashion way - Hi there everyone ,I’m 23 and from Europe. Looking to find that certain connection the old fashion way.  Just by talking and getting to know each other on a personal level. Yes looks are important but someone's personality makes them beautiful. Okay imma quit the corny stuff now. 

I would love to make everlasting friendships firs. And maybe even a relationship if it comes to that. I don't care how far away you are. A true connection survives all borders.

Something about myself:

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

My passion is cooking. And besides that I love to read, having conversations, grabbing coffee on a rainy Sunday, watching sports and play some games on my ps4. 

Hope all of you have a good day. Looking forward talking to you!"

lonely,I Don’t Feel Real,"I Don’t Feel Real - I lived with my partner every day for over 8 years. We’re separated right now. I don’t feel real without him there giving me feedback that I exist—head nods, conversation, compliments, criticisms, anything. I feel like nobody knows me and I’ll never been known or seen again. Like he took my identity with him. 

Somebody please help me learn to be real even while I’m alone.

I have been in therapy for a decade (26 yo f) for my dependency on others and disassociation and difficulty regulating my emotions. I’m still not even half way to where I want to be."
lonely,I don't want to keep on going,"I don't want to keep on going - I just don't want to suffer like this anymore. I don't want to deal with seeing how everyone has someone to talk to, how everyone has friends and how everyone is in a relationship. Like, even the ones who claim to be the loneliest actually have friends. I happen to be beyond lonely. I feel like I'm not human. That's why I'm always excluded and put aside. Cause I'm not like them. Even online. I got rejected again last week, as usual. That person made me have false hopes. My heart is still shattered since then. I just wish I was noticed, loved and cared for. That's what I wished for my whole life, but it just doesn't happen. At this point I think I'm not made to have someone, even someone to talk to. I'm made only for loneliness and suffering. Im 100% sure I'll be that type of forever alone woman with 10 cats that people make fun of. Im tired of creating persons in my head and imagining them love me. That's what I did my whole life. That's how I stayed sane until now. But not even that helps anymore. I'm a complete failure that doesn't have chance at anything. I don't even care about myself anymore. I started to eat unhealthy food with all kinds of chemicals again. I just don't care anymore. Every day I wish I had terminal cancer or that I get hit by a car. Every day I wish I die. There's really no reason for me to exist. I had enough loneliness and abuse in these 18 shitty years of my life, I had enough bullying, enough of me being a tool of fun for people. I'm drained and empty. I can't even think properly anymore, everything is foggy. I hate myself for my cowardice and weakness. I hate myself for still wanting the things that are impossible to achieve. I keep telling myself to stop craving friendship or relationship because I'm a failure and have no chance at that. If I had, wouldn't I have friends or a relationship by now? Yeah,now  I'm going back to suffer and cry because I'm miserable and I have 0 friends and I'm single. I just wanted to vent. Sorry for this post, it's too chaotic."

Physical appearance can only bring you so far,  one day or the other they'll find out how hollow you are inside and leave (rightfully so).
I really want to find love again but I know that it's going to end the same way the first time ended, if anything I've gotten a lot worse.
You gotta get your shit together before considering going into a relationship because otherwise it's going to end badly for you and you'll be more miserable than before."

Because in the end of the day, you just need someone to be there, you know? Just to listen to your stupid little things that matter to you. Yeah its stupid because to anybody, it doesnt even matter, but it matters to you.

The other day I found two cute squirrel playing together. I remember that I wanted to tell anyone how cute that moment is but I dont know who. Today, Im crying in my bed, wishing that someone is really there for me. But there's none. 

Because 'friend' is just someone who want some part of you and just ditch the rest. They just want something convinience for them. If I ever go back to that 'depressed' version of me, they can just told me that Im toxic and leave me alone."

lonely,I'm lost,"I'm lost - I don't know if anyone will even read this but i always found that just putting out there has helped me personally, and tbh i really need it right now. 
I used to be at university and had many friends and i wasn't in a bad place mentally even though for years I've felt this deep feeling of loneliness because i never have had a girlfriend or someone with whom i shared a deep connection.
This year i finished University and the downfall began, all the friends i have are now far away and at work, since I'm really shy and mostly keep to myself, it's hard to find friends. Now most of the time i fell completely alone, like i have no one on who to rely on, and even worse everyone i know is in a relationship which makes me feel like while everything around me is moving, I'm completely stuck on the same place.
I am lost at the moment. I don't know what to do or where to go. In my head I've thought for a long time that if i found a girlfriend or someone with who i shared a bond it would get better, but even that seems impossible to me atm. I feel like either I'm not good enough or undeserving of it, and my past experiences don't help either. I would love to belive when people say that things find a way, but from where i stand at the moment, i don't think so.
I guess we are close to Christmas and although i don't believe in wishes, i just wish i could find something to help me deal with this."

lonely,I have no friends and I got ghosted by everyone when I tried. Anyone else feel sad and discouraged while trying to meet people online?,"I have no friends and I got ghosted by everyone when I tried. Anyone else feel sad and discouraged while trying to meet people online? - I've never really had any friends until my twenties, always really unpopular. I had a few good friends for the last couple years but we had to stop talking because they all developed feelings at some point and didn't want to keep going if things weren't going to progress to a relationship. I'm really down about it because they meant a lot to me and I didn't feel lonely for the first time in my life. I finally met people that I clicked with and it was easy to be with them.

I tried to break out of my shell and meet people online, I actually talked to a decently large amount of people. I thought I was fairly friendly and normal but I suppose not because they all blocked or ghosted me. I kind of wish they had told me we weren't vibing because I would have understood and not been upset. I can be pretty boring but I really tried to ask people about their lives and expand on the short answers they gave. It would be nice to know what I'm doing wrong so I can improve and work towards making people less uncomfortable or uninterested but it's difficult. I understand that this is my problem considering how often it happened in the last few days, but I'm not sure how to go about fixing it.

I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub and it feels silly posting because other people have such serious issues but I wanted to get it out there and maybe see if I'm not so alone in this problem. I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and thanks"

He got with other girls and then he decided he missed me he came back and of course I took him back. I loved him so much. He broke up with me a while later saying that I was too good for him and he wanted to get with other girls. I would have killed myself if I didn’t have people that needed me. Now I don’t feel anything for anyone. People have tried. Roses, notes, poems, all the things I wanted from him and never got, now I have them and they mean nothing to me. I think I have lost the ability to love and trust."
lonely,Having suicidal thoughts,Having suicidal thoughts - Sometimes I feel like my life will only ever be miserable. When good things/people come into my life they always leave and this depression is a baseline i always come back to. I'm starting to feel like living long isnt even worth it and that it would just be a waste of time if im just going to have a miserable life.
lonely,I feel like I lose a little more of my ability to connect with people everyday,"I feel like I lose a little more of my ability to connect with people everyday - I don't know when or why it started or if I've just gotten especially bad in recent years but it's like I can barely connect with people anymore. I used to be able to at least make friends even when I wasn't ever able to find something beyond that but now it's like I can't even do that right. I open myself up and try to be honest but maybe it just comes across as desperation. Looking back I even wonder if all my past friendships were the consequence of circumstance and not because they gravitated towards me naturally. There were times I could put on a personality and that made me a fun person to be around but I don't know how to play that role anymore. Lately it feels like it's hard for me to talk, like I struggle to find words. 

Everytime I try dating it ends catastrophically.

If I can't correct this character flaw I have then I really just may as well just die. That sounds drastic especially with how I've just summarized my situation but I do really think theres no hope for me. 

The idea is that women typically have it so easy when it comes to attracting people but that's never been the case for me. I don't think I'm extremely unattractive or anything.  I attract sexual attention but rarely platonic positive interactions which I think says a lot. 

Really just feel like I'm trapped in a game I keep losing and I'm kind of tired. I'm posting this to vent, I don't really want empty words of encouragement. I want a painless death that won't leave me undignified."

lonely,I have been lonely for most of my life that I feel like it destroyed my ability to pair bond.,"I have been lonely for most of my life that I feel like it destroyed my ability to pair bond. - When I take the advice on learning to be happy by yourself without relying on a person seriously, I feel like I actually did manage to pull that off. But now when I try to date in my late 30's I no longer feel any romantic attachment to people. Because my brain can't figure out a reason as to why I would want a partner. 

I feel like I suffered some kind of psychological damage by being independent all my life.  I noticed it on some level but only recently have I been contemplating what I am experiencing. I don't think I am capable of loving someone anymore, like it was my brains way of coping with loneliness, by learning not to care if you're alone. But now I feel like I lost some humanity in the process.

I don't think there's anything wrong with relying on others and going through hardships together with a loved one, I think life is much more depressing if you do it alone and I regret taking the advice that was given to me.

lonely,I’m used to it,"I’m used to it - I’m used to it

It sucks to admit and it truly is depressing as fuck to say but it’s just the sad reality of my life. I’m used to having no one to confide in. I need therapy but I can’t afford it. I try to share my thoughts and feelings with the people close to me but they just make me feel like I’m constantly throwing myself a pity party. 

At this point in my sad existence it’s time to admit to myself that I literally have no soul purpose in life. I’m never going to accomplish my goals because I constantly stand in my own way of success. I have no one who really actually gives a fuck about helping me through this mental instability. My parents are assholes who don’t care about me. Even my boyfriend doesn’t care. He just tells me I’m being a bitch when I’m literally not doing anything to him. 

I really don’t see the point anymore of anything. I’ve been alone my entire life and even in a relationship I don’t feel complete. So I think it’s time to just accept that it’s just supposed to be me, and my cat cause she’s part of me. But really it’s always been just me, all alone, cause no one cares. And I don’t need to hear the classic “talk to me, I’m here for you” I’ve heard it enough. 

With all this said I just really don’t know anything anymore."

I recently moved to North Carolina with my parents because my mom got a new job, my dad wants to start a business, and I am here for college. I have found it very hard to adjust because unlike high school there is no one who lives near me and now that it is winter break I have no one. I contact some people from home, but it feels like nobody really contacts me unless I call them up or text them. It’s just I feel so lonely here I’m in this house and there’s no nostalgia to it and I told people I would try to visit my hometown and i don’t even know if I can. The thing is I just feel alone and no one is going to visit me so why do I have to do all the work to see others. I know life isn’t fair, but I can’t help, but feel like I’m in my own head cause I have no one to do anything with. I am also taking a semester off so now I will be stuck here with no friends nearby to pick me up and take me places or do anything. Even the friends I have made aren’t the greatest people my parents don’t like them and find them sketchy and I just don’t know what to do anymore man. It’s gotten to the point where I just live in my head and play video games while worrying about everything in the back of my mind. I’m 18 and I’m stressed out over what my parents tell me is nothing. I guess they’re right seeing as I’m living in their house with no priorities right now, but I just feel like there is more I could be doing. All of this has left me alone and sad and I hope maybe someone is sharing that experience or can just tell me it’s okay cause it really feels like all odds are stacked against me and i don’t know what to do.

People are talking trash on me and especially at school. I don’t know who to trust anymore and I want to start all over. I just hope I can stop crying and get some sleep. I really want to sleep, I really don’t feel like being alive. I’ve dedicated my life helping others and tried to create a sense of community because I never had one growing up.... the one thing I ever wanted in life is a group of friends who I can call a family and be apart of something bigger than myself.

My main client is supposed to only be 35 hours per month, but truthfully, I close to around 40 hrs per week on theirs account - on top of trying to keep up with my other clients, getting into school, taking care of my 3 year old full time and trying to find any time for myself (which is usually from about 10:30p.m. - 11p.m.)  I have no time for hobbies, friends, or any kind of self care at all..and forget about dating. 

I've burned myself out. I've been crying for 12 hours. I can't stop. I don't know how to get out of this. I need to make money to support my son. I need to get into school so I can make a better future for myself. I need to spend time with my son because he's only little once and the first 3 years have already gone so fast.

Asking any of my friends, over 10 people, to the company holiday party as a +1, I find that no one has saturday night free. This feels like a repeat of prom in high school all over again.

lonely,Does anybody here really likes Christmas???,"Does anybody here really likes Christmas??? - I might be wrong, but I feel like actually liking Christmas only happens to happy/cheerful/not lonely people.

Do you lonely guys aren’t big fans of Christmas too?"

If I already feel alone while having a loving family and a very few friends... I fear I will not be able to handle not having anyone.

lonely,I hate losing loved ones,"I hate losing loved ones - Context: I don't know if this happens to you but I usually leave loved ones ""parts of me"" so when I feel bad or need help I only look for answers in those parts again.

The problem is when those loved ones die, you can take someone's ""parts of me"" if you have a hurtful argument or just don't want to be with that person, but death takes you away Everything you left in that loved one.

Now that I explained how my way of approaching loved ones works in general, I must say that today I am a little more alone, my cat died and is not the first to do so.

Surely they expected a more shocking punchline or something similar but it was a strong loss for me and right now I have no one to talk to. I feel like I have lost an arm or a hand and those parts of me are never going to come back and neither is my cat. I'm alone and it's not just because my cat died but because I lost a part of me.

lonely,Why are you single?,"Why are you single? - This question right is something I'm always being asked. I have so many reasons as to why I'm single and as much as I'd love to sit here and type each one of them, but I'm too lazy and I want to talk about the main reason. 

I'm single because I feel like I'm not good enough. I'm sure that I could be successful in life and still feel like I'm not good enough to be in a relationship or the fear that some day they'll get bored of me and just toss me aside for the next. 

This feeling mostly comes from my surroundings and media. You see relationships failing because one lost love for the other or on cheated or one can and that's something I'm not willing to go through. I've been in relationships before, but I didn't take relationships that seriously. As I got older and more mature I began understand the importance of it. 

Ehh idk maybe I'm being too rational of it. I hope to find someone that can calm me of these fears, what do you think? Do you have similar fears as well or is there something else keeping you single?"
lonely,Just lost the only person to get me out after 4 days of knowing then,"Just lost the only person to get me out after 4 days of knowing then - Less than an hour ago, I fucked up really hard. I met this girl on tinder she was really chill and funny. I only knew her for 4 days and I already fucked it up. 

Basically I’ve had a really shit day, and a really shit life for the past month. I broke up with a bunch of “friends” really horribly and with someone I liked. This was meant to be different, I wanted to play the long game. Get know her slowly and surely until I felt comfortable with her. But I have too fuck it up didn’t I. 

I asked her when was the earliest she was free, she just said “Lol Idk”. This got too me, started spiralling out control with my emotions. So I told her what was going on, about how I had a shit day and just wanted to talk, and get too know her more. That was the biggest fuck up I could have done.

She said “Lmao sorry but I’m not in the mood to think about myself”. I totally get it, I’ve been there. Just my dumb ass had to keep going, saying that maybe WE had to be more comfortable with each other. Nope. She says she opens up a lot when in the mood. And that she doesn’t want too right now. I then tried to change the convo to something else. Tried to keep talking to her. But then she blocked me. 

It’s like being shot, just a lot more numb. I now feel even more shit than I did before. Fortunately I suppressed any feelings for her, i was just interested in her, and hoping things would lead somewhere. Not to sex, just a hug or cuddle. Now I don’t know what to do. I only had her on snapchat. Hopefully she’ll turn back around, but I don’t have high hopes. 

Everyone I meet or know I use as a punching bag for emotions. No one sends me messages first, and even if I do there’s a slim chance they’ll start a conversation. I want to be the punching bag, it helps me with my emotions and keeps them under control. But no one will do that for me."

lonely,Never gonna find someone,"Never gonna find someone - Ugh, here I am again.
Just had my friends explain to me how to find an SO. You know, they actually read my whiny bullshit and gave a piece of advice.

The guy said that I should act more confident. Trick myself into thinking that I'm cooler than I actually am and trick others of thinking so. Fake it till I make it. But, guess what, I'm already doing this! I couldn't do my job if I wasn't. Those who are close to me tend to think I'm strong and assertive. 
The problem is that he's got a gf, and he had one even BEFORE he started ""boosting his confidence"". The girls just naturally were interested in him. He lives with his gf now, too.

The girl agreed with what he said. But... she does nothing of what the guy told! She has little self-confidence, is overall ""weak"" in a cutesy way, not very sociable. And yes, she lives with her bf now.

I'm some kind of a mix between them. I'm snarky, kinda dominant and humorous in a dark way, like the guy, BUT shy and a bit emotional, like the girl. Aaand I've tried to accentuate those traits, too. Nope. No one is ever interested.

I have two other friends, who are single. One was asked out numerous times and just rejected. The other was in two lesbian relationships - now they're over, but still. I'm the only one who never EVER had someone interested in me, let alone asked out. 

The guy said I'm not ugly, btw, when I told him I thought I was, just that I look shy. But why then? Why does everyone out there seem to at least find someone, and I'm just constantly lonely? Could it be because of me hating myself - and if so, is it a reason or an outcome?.."

I beat myself up thinking that no one would ever do that for me regardless of how much time and effort I put into others. It sucks being alone, I wish people would go out of their way for me. I’m very independent but after a while it really gets to me and I wish that I had people to go to with my problems but every time I feel like I’m being a hassle. I’m thankful for this sub because there are plenty of people with similar issues  trying their best to stay positive.

I used to work at a very social place and would spend a lot of time with my coworkers but now I work a higher paying desk job that is great but I spend most of the days silent with very little social interaction. all my co workers are older and married with children so its not like they want to get together and hang out on weekends.

I know it’d be weird to just walk up to someone and start a conversation in the street because I get anxious if people even look my way when I’m walking. Just any way too meet friends would be nice. People to hang with and talk to. Just anything besides being in the house alone staring at my school work
lonely,Is my nationality/race really that big of a deal breaker when it comes to relationship?,"Is my nationality/race really that big of a deal breaker when it comes to relationship? - I am a North Indian, and recently I was rejected by someone I met on Reddit. She was and Asian too, and was open to my friendship but not a relationship. We reached to a position where we were both comfortable in sharing numbers (She was the one who offered the number but I was hesitant). I was okay with that but the issue was, the more I learned about her, and talked to here everyday, more I got infatuated with her.

After a month of talking for several hours everyday and being told by her that I am the *'most perfect guy that there can ever be'* on multiple occasions, I was baffled why she is reluctant for a relationship if I was really so darn good ? So a week ago I told her she needs to give me a reason for rejecting me if she don't find any fault in me. And after a lot of reluctance from her side and me standing my ground. She finally admitted.

""It's because I am Indian.""

I couldn't believe the girl I thought was an open minded and progressive person, will be so blatantly racist. My heart was broken and I felt like I was back stabbed.

This is when I started to look for somebody for myself on r/foreveralonedating. And 2 posts later I am noticing a very recognizable pattern. Almost all of the DMs I got in reply of my posts and all the posters I reached out to, ended in same way. The moment I mentioned my nationality, there was dead silence from the other side.

So please tell me honestly fellow Redditors. Am I really screwed because of one element of my life on which that I had absolutely no control? Am I destined be always alone just because people will judge me about something which I cannot change?

PS: I Know some of you might ask me to find someone of my own country, and trust me I would be glad if someone accepts me for who I am (shy, homebody, introvert more creative than money-minded) and I haven't found anyone and not for the lack of trying. Nobody likes my face in my country it seems."
lonely,Coming to terms with who I am,"Coming to terms with who I am - Last few weeks have been a blur of activities, school, and emotional episodes. Been having issues with dating and everything as well. In fact that’s probably where half of the issues I’ve been experiencing are stemming from. Was browsing reddit when I came across a post that made me realize who I am. It was talking about how some guys are considered “safe options”. Those are the guys who don’t have a problem with settling down and are looking for long-term relationships. It also talked about how girls generally look for those “safe options” later in life, usually starting around their late 20’s. 



How does this relate to me? I’m that “safe option”. And honestly, I’m ok with that. It’s not gonna stop me from trying, but at least I have a reason if I get rejected now. (Maybe that’s just me looking for a excuse for my failures, I don’t know.)




What I’m trying to say is that you may be like me. Try to find someone, but know that, if you’re looking for a long-term deal, you might be looking for a bit longer than other, and that’s ok."

lonely,"18M depressed and alone, really in need of a friend","18M depressed and alone, really in need of a friend - I never experienced highschool due to my anxiety and depression and in return was “homeschooled”. I would spend months straight in isolation with the exception of seeing a therapist once a week. This is something that really affected me socially and mentally especially in the years where I’m supposed to be developing myself. I’m mentioning this because I really am truly alone. Onto about me I guess? I love philosophy and psychology and in the years  of isolation I spent most of my time focusing on helping others and not myself (so I promise I will try my best to be there for you too!). I will spend hours talking philosophy as well, deep conversations are my favorite! Now of course I don’t consider myself a professional but I’m going to school next year to become a psychologist! Though I recommend a professional overall if needed haha. I love videogames and have been a pc gamer since preschool. I’m cool with playing whatever but lately I’ve been playing reach, wow, mw (don’t judge lol) and any single player games ranging from classics to current gen. I am a huge cinematography nerd if you want to watch some cool ass movies I’m your guy! If you want a feel for the movies I like most, my favorite directors include Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Ari Aster, Harmony Korine, and more. Now I don’t always need to watch a deep and usually depressing movie but they are favorites! I’m pretty open with movies though and horror movies are a big guilty pleasure of mine. I love reading but usually most of the books I like are because I watched the movie first haha. I love tv shows, pretty much down for anything other then super hero shows. I love all kinds of music, if you somehow come across my Spotify playlist it’s very bipolar to say the least lol. Lately though all I’ve been listening to is this playlist on shuffle https://open.spotify.com/playlist/06uleQlXodNca4LyyK09T0?si=-siBaKMnR7uOiJOGquHAjA.

I finished Year 12 over a month ago and not once have my friends messaged me or attempted to make contact, we tried to get us all to have a leavers party but they forgot and went and did their own stuff. This is the time when I started to feel so lonely because I knew they were doing things together due to social media, but for 3+ weeks ive been trying to get together and they don't respond or sat they're busy, which really makes me feel alone.

They're good friends, really, but it's stuff like tonight when they talk in front of me about how they're going to McDonald's tonight and ignore me, like I'm invisible.

So I act out, I do dumb stuff like pull a hat over my face and stare at people to be funny, but they either laugh then turn away or just ignore me. It sounds weird, it I love these guys but the more I see them, the more I realize I do t see them as much as everyone else does. My best friend hasn't said a single word to me this holidays until tonight.

Basically I just hate this and I hate how I can't talk about it and I just want to have a friend who doesn't ignore me and actually cares enough about me to want to actually hang out with me.

lonely,Does it ever go away?,"Does it ever go away? - I have never been in a relationship or been pursued by anyone. I've had crushes but none of them worked out because they were all straight. I've tried almost everything - dating apps, social events, being open to making friends first and not directly look for a LTR. The one thing I just can't seem to bring myself to do is to hook-up with someone. 

I have trained myself to not fall for anyone too deep because I have been burnt before. I have tried all that I can do to ""put myself out there"". But none of it works. I often convince myself (depending on my mood) that maybe the time just isn't right or that maybe I'm not destined for a relationship. I've tried to convince myself that it's not the end of the world and that there are tons of people out there who have never experienced romantic love/relationships and who have been single all their life and are seemingly happy and content with their lives. I tell myself that it's not unusual and maybe it's for the best even. But sometimes, I just can't take it. I have never known what it is like to be hugged or kissed or even looked at by someone, and yet I crave it so bad; like a drug that I've never even had. 

So I wanna ask y'all: does it ever stop? Do you  eventually ""grow up"" and stop seeking or craving love? Can you actually be content knowing that you're probably going to be single all your life? Like, do you ever get over it?

If so, then please tell me what I can do to set myself down that path. I do not want to long for something that I can never have."

It’s really sucks because I really want friends, but I just know they are going to be a distraction from everything else.

So you wonder... is it my fault? Am I a bad person? You start to relect, you lose confidence, you doubt, you fear and avoid others. You're not good enough maybe. You want to better yourself so you pick up hobbies and interests, you start to change, you become different. You talk to others, you laugh and one day you get invited to parties with collegues, finaly ! 

But you don't connect. They're younger and phone addicted. They barely talk to each others, they don't want to do games, they don't want to do anything. You go with them again. Again and again. Nothing happens. It's pointless.

You give up on them.

Some days, I don't care. I open up a book and let myself travel to another world. But when I look around me, I always see the same walls. 

""Put yourself out there they say. Live for yourself they say. If you're happy with yourself it's good enough.""

What? My sole purpose in life can be reduced to pay taxes and it's fine? 

I don't get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that I've got to live experiences. I've got to talk to people and thus, go out to do so. But where to god damn start. I don't even want a relationship. I just want people to care enough about me so I don't have to jump in front of the subway to finaly get attention."

lonely,Loneliness comes with being a loner,"Loneliness comes with being a loner - I've been a loner for the majority of my life, but it really never bothered me until this past year. I work, I come home, I sleep. I play video games on the weekend, and very rarely have a friend come over to chill. 

It's taken a toll on me. I'm not necessarily desperate for something like a girlfriend or a bestfriend to spend my whole day with, but it talking to myself is getting old and it isn't exactly easy to find good people in a society as horrid as ours is."
lonely,F4M 27 Looking for a genuine bond,"F4M 27 Looking for a genuine bond - I’m a nerdy person, who is honestly a tad asexual and prefers personality over looks. I find fictional characters attractive lol I’m a talker and want someone I can have a back and forth with. I love video games, but only really into Spyro the Dragon, Sonic the hedgehog, and Mario Bro’s. 


Not much of a PC gamer and don’t really like FPS or RPG games. I love cats. I’m physically disabled. I feel like I can’t relate with many guys, cuz the only ones I had were LDR, and it always ended badly on me. 

Looking for someone who is celibate like me and isn’t interested in NSFW. Jokes are fine tho.

I always get jealous walking through my school’s campus seeing people holding hands or having their arms around each other. Why can’t that be me some day? To be honest, I’m not really ugly and I have rejected a lot of guys who I just saw as friends. However, the guys I like see me as a friend. It sucks.

I’m honestly sick of people telling me that I have to wait cuz, yeah, I know that. Life’s boring so which is why I’m impatient. Not gonna lie it’s sorta alright being single but at the same time, I want to feel the butterflies in my stomach and to actually be with someone. Everything sucks."
lonely,Imagine,"Imagine - I dont even know where to start, no one ever has known my pathetic story but i gotta say it somewhere.
When i was young i grew up in a small town, both my parents were always busy so i guess i wasnt attended a lot to. I grew up homeschooled with some christian tutoring sessions around other christian kids but i developed like 0 social skills. My parents began fighting a lot mostly about money, 5th grade i was switched to public school at a small clique school didnt go great i got bullied a lot and became even more antisocial.My parents then got seperated and soon after me my mom and my sister moved out to the city.
For middle school i thought i was making some friends even though i still got teased a lot i had some people around me to sit with at lunch etc... then my sister started going to the highschool of my city which is a different system than my middle school. By this time my parents had officially divorced however things didnt turn out that simple. I decided to also go to thay highschool however things dont always work out great.
My older sister and i had been close when we were young but barely talked at this point, she also has social issues and apparently from her own mouth she trash talked me to her upperclassman buddies to look cool and funny.
Still with 0 social skills once i left my middle school all the kids id been around except for 2 had ghosted me. At this point i didnt really get things so life decided to get worse. My parents divorce kept going on my dad turns out to be an alcoholic and lied about a lot of money stuff even though he makes a good amount of it. My dad decided to hate my mother for whatever reason and kept sueing her and still is sueing her to this day.
The stress and anxiety from all this continues to worsen. Im now a junior in highschool, still no friends one kid from my old school whod id been hanging out with a lot ghosted me, the other we just kinda stopped talking. My sister is really fucked up and started fighting with my mom a ton. A month ago my mom took away my sisters phone and my sister freaked out and assualted my mom, i didnt know what to do so i called the cops... they came and seperated however for some dumb reason they sided with my sister and arrested my mom. My mom got off charges recently but still my dads gonna make a huge deal about this in court. He keeps sueing us about money stuff like why he shouldnt pay child support or basic health insurance or anything for college even though he makes good money. AND IT GETS WORSE, my dad started dating this rich twofaced scumbag who owns a fucking lawfirm, now there engaged and he has even more money and now a lawyer giving him help for free which is totally fuking illegal but no ones stopping him. Anyways still no friends having trouble affording basic stuff even though income wise technically i should be a rich prep boi, mom has ptsd and anxiety but shes already paying for help with that so getting me a therapist or meds isnt realistic

So that was a stupid long rant about how my life sucks honestly i dont expect much to happen i just want my dad to be a good person and stop making my life hell, i wanna find some friends and do soemthing with my life. Im such a loser frankly none of this would be a problem if i just faded away"

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."
lonely,The Disconnect,"The Disconnect - Hey. I am sick of the constant, piercing dissonance between my internal monologue and the physical world. I do not know what is to blame for this feeling. What you may see looking at me is a pale, long haired, goofy short guy. I do not take most things seriously. I developed this as a strategy to appear happy to the outside world. I crack a lot of stupid surreal jokes that usually only result in odd looks from people. I dress in a way that sort of makes me look like I try only a little. I do well in school without putting in strong effort. I am an extra. Hallway filler to make the school look less empty. I do not have many friends; I wonder if I actually have friends at all most of the time. During fifty percent of my lunches I just sit in a remote, empty hallway and listen to sad /mu core music. I do not think I am a quiet kid-I talk a good bit. But not really to anyone, just at any sentient thing that will listen. Most people think I am on drugs. While I occasionally drink and dabble in smoking some grass, I rarely am inebriated at school. I just act really goofy. Sometimes my eyes are red, but that is because I was crying. I usually play that off like I am high, because I feel ashamed for any one to see me at my lows. I am often crying for a variety of reasons. School causes me to have to a stress breakdown. I have no true friends. I feel void of any human contact. The only thing I have is the constant berating and insulting from the inside of my head. I just want a close friend. Someone to hold and cuddle. I tried sex with someone: It did not go well to say the least. The person I am inside is much different than the outside. I could not expose myself to anyone as on top of my stupidity, I am self-conscious. I do not think I am capable of being intimate. People may see an extrovert, however I am deeply lonely. I want one person to know me. I am such a self absorbed idiot."
lonely,Lonely but no idea why,"Lonely but no idea why - I’ve always had trouble meeting people because I was a shy ugly duckling kind of kid that moved around a lot. I always had small groups of friends i was super close with but they never seemed to last more than 5 years. I have a lot of acquaintances and people I know but I never feel like I can open up to them. 

I always got along better with guys but it always turned into something more than friends, even my closest of best guy “friends” who never wanted to be just friends. I used to make friends in college but after leaving my sorority and cutting people off from it I’ve felt so lonely.

I’m at a crossroads in life and can’t really tell anyone about it because those who know me I have to pretend to be alright. This is also a random rambling post I’ll probably delete."

I just don’t, and it really sucks since I don’t have any release. Even if I feel something, I can’t keep going because I start thinking about couples and being in and stuff. I really want to know what that feels like. Just the part about being close and having trust. I really need to leave my home town, it’s a bad place to be."
lonely,Unjustified feelings of loneliness,"Unjustified feelings of loneliness - No matter what I do I feel lonely. And I’m not necessarily a hermit. I have friends with whom I hang out with fairly often. When I don’t hang out with them I’m usually hanging out with my family. I started my first job since college so right now I don’t have any real tight work relationships but in the past for the most part I’ve been able to establish that. A year ago in college I was in a fraternity and a lot of clubs. I had a gf who broke up with me six months ago. I actively looked to form relationships is what I’m trying to say I guess.

However through all this I just have this gaping hole it feels like in me a feeling loneliness. Even if I’m not stereotypically depressed and feel rather happy or good some days this feeling persists. While I remember being depressed most of my life and in conjunction this loneliness it was never this gnawing. When I left the Marines to go to college It really started to feel stronger. 

And the feeling isn’t like depression it’s not stay in my bed all day. This loneliness is strong but dull it’s just a steady persistent nag that I can’t completely push outta of my mind. Even when I’m around people it’s there. It amplifies episodes of depression and just I don’t know makes life just a little bit less I guess. The worst thing is I can never really seem to tell my therapist why I feel this way. I know I shouldn’t I have a good family I have friends. I may not be the most extroverted but I’m social. I’ve had relationships in the past and I’m currently opening back up to dating again. I shouldn’t feel empty and lonely but I do. I’ve been in combat sure but I don’t have ptsd so there shouldn’t be anything wrong but it’s there.

So I’m left here unsure of why and where this came from. The only thing I know is that it feels like someone is slowly pushing a knife in my heart. I don’t know I just ultimately want to truly feel happy when I’m with my friends and family.  I just don’t want to walk through life alone surrounded by friends."
lonely,Keeping up the façade is exhausting and I'm not sure how much longer I can cope,"Keeping up the façade is exhausting and I'm not sure how much longer I can cope - I'm not very good at talking about/showing my feelings/emotions (at least, not irl. It's easier online.) so whenever I interact with people or my family, I'm always pretending to be happy or at least neutral. But when I get back to the house, after about 30 minutes to an hour, I start getting overwhelmed by how lonely I am.

Christmas (and my 21st birthday) are coming up which is fine, I like Christmas (mostly) but I don't have anyone *special* to spend them with. When I go back home (moved away for uni), my birthday ""plans"" will probably be me, my mum, my nan and *maybe* one of my friends going out for a meal. That in and of itself isn't too bad, I've never really been one for partying, it's the lack of companionship, I guess? (I don't actually know)

I've joined a D&amp;D group so every other Sunday afternoon should be better 'cause I can escape and stuff

But yeah, I don't know if I can keep doing this for much longer, I'm just tired of it all..."

I want to be able to open up to someone and be myself around someone. I want a best friend and be someone's best friend because i've never really had that - i'm only still friends with two people from high school and the one girl who i considered to be my best friend stopped talking to me and gave me no closure. I really want a strong friendship with someone who i can be myself with but once again, i have trouble connecting with someone on a more personal level. It sucks because i've always had friends leave me and at the end of the day, i'm alone. Who knows if the friends i have now will stay, if the same pattern continues then they'll leave too.

She is surrounded by all of her friends, who are smiling cheerfully as they’re happy to be celebrating with her. Walking through the library, I see a group of friends studying together. They aren’t even actively engaging with one another; they’re just happy to be in each other’s company. Instantly, I am reminded that I don’t have anyone to do those simple things with. I become consumed by my thoughts. Why don’t I have anyone to celebrate life with? Why doesn’t anyone enjoy my company? What’s wrong with me? It appears that everyone around me has someone, why don’t I?"
lonely,I had a dream recently of my former crush back in High School. It was the happiest I had felt in years.,"I had a dream recently of my former crush back in High School. It was the happiest I had felt in years. - I had a dream last night of my former crush back in High School. It was the happiest I had felt in years.

I’m afraid that I’m gonna sound like a huge creep saying all of this, but I have to share it with someone. 

So here goes: I’ve been real nostalgic over my hometown back in California recently, and as a result I ended up thinking of her as well. As a result, my memory of her worked her way into my subconscious and I fell asleep. 

It was a surprisingly peaceful dream, especially compared to the crappy ones I’ve been having recently. I don’t remember the events leading up to seeing her very much, but I do remember what happened when I ran into her... somewhat. 

She was as beautiful as I remembered her. She seemed happy to see me, and we hugged each other. She ended up offering me her shoulder to rest my head on. Just being that close to her, and the warm physical contact involved just felt so real and cozy. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that peaceful and content in a long time. 

It was such an amazing dream. The kind I rarely have. I haven’t really been doing well since I moved to tell you the truth, and a day hardly ever goes by that I don’t miss that place. 

As a result, my mind has been in a messed up place. So having dreams like that about happier times in my hometown and the people in it, are surprising, but very much welcome.

In that dream, I felt like things were normal again. Better than normal. I even tried going back to sleep as soon as I woke up, but sadly the previous dream didn’t continue. Just another one of my regular dreams.

I miss it all. I really do. I miss her, I miss my home, the friends I have over there, everything. I just want things to go back to normal, to tell you the whole truth.

Do I sound like an obsessive creep? A bit of a loser? Kind of pathetic? Somewhere in that ballpark, or no? I feel like I do and I really don’t like that.

I know it’s not healthy to rely on one person for internal happiness or whatever the term is, it’s just that this person in particular was one of the few people I met in school that was genuinely nice to me, almost to the point that it threw me off because I wasn’t really used to that. She was also very pretty and charming. I feel like what I’m saying doesn’t really do her justice, though. But thinking about her just brings back a lot of happy (and admittedly some not so happy) memories, and right now, I can’t help but cling on to the past, especially when the present feels like being in a pitch black room with no exit, or running down a dark hallway that never seems to end.

Honestly I really do feel like a creep for saying all of this, and I hate that I do. What do you think? Should I forget about her, or just find something or someone else for my mind to be preoccupied with? (Not in an obsessive way of course, at least I hope not) Or what should I do about this? Because I honestly don’t know how to get past this. A big part of me wants to see her again, but there’s another part that thinks maybe that isn’t a good idea right now, or even soon. I don’t know what to do."

lonely,"I'm trying to hard to escape the loneliness, yet it feels like I'm surrounded.","I'm trying to hard to escape the loneliness, yet it feels like I'm surrounded. - Dear reddit,

I'm trying to hard to escape the loneliness.

Something that I've always loved doing is travelling, exploring, and seeing/trying new things. Seriously, very few things in this world bring me similar happiness to finding a new secret place and exploring every little nook and cranny of it.

I used to have friends to explore these places with, but they never want to hang out with me anymore. I used to have an ex girlfriend to do photography and travel with, but she doesn't want me any more, and now she has a new man that serves as a constant reminder of what a failure I am.

Now I have nobody. Nobody wants to go explore with me. Nobody wants to go hike with me. Nobody wants to find these secret little beautiful places except myself.

I've been trying to make it work. Every time I want to do something, regardless of whether I'm alone or not (100% of the time, I am) I'll do it. Sometimes I get really anxious that I am alone, because I have anxiety that gets worse when I'm not around anyone else. Sometimes, I really do have a nice time doing whatever I'm doing and spend some time alone exploring. Or talking to my camera, the only person I truly feel will never let me down (the irony being that my camera's glitched many times since I bought it, letting me down and ruining a great cineshoot.)

From an outsider's perspective, you'd think I'm handling the loneliness extremely well. That I'm moving on from my ex greatly by always being out doing things and not staying in all day. 

It just hurts to get to the destination and realize that you're alone. You don't have anyone to share the memories with. You don't have anyone who wants to see it with you, who truly cares about you. That if you died while exploring, nobody would find out. Nobody would care. I may have my camera, but I don't have people who will watch my content. I don't have any ""fans"" or anyone who genuinely enjoys the videos I put out. I might as well be talking to a brick wall.

Just about every night, I go to bed and dream. I dream of travelling the world with the perfect girl. Someone who loves me and someone I love. Someone who'd rather go to Ikea than a fancy restaurant. Someone who would rather sleep in a van than an expensive house. Someone who'd rather go on a morning hike than sleep in. Someone who would rather just drive for hours than watch Netflix. 

I know she's out there, I just doubt she would ever want to be with someone like me. Someone so fucking annoying, stupid, depressed, and awkward like me. I just doubt anyone would want to explore with me. I don't care if it's a girlfriend or just a friend at this point, I just want someone to explore and see the world with.

I hope this makes sense. It feels a bit better. Last time I tried to do this, I fucked up the wording and it made me feel worse, but it really helps to write it all down, even if nobody will read it.

Love, anon."

Last night i dreamed about a girl i liked a lot back in high school. It was the most wonderful dream ever, ive never felt that emotions in my life, its actually making me tear up as i 'speak' right now... It was a fun little dream, of course, all good things must come to an end. Il tell you later what i dreamed about, for now its about who she is: A girl i met from my friends group, new addition to the group, we instantly kicked off and talked and had fun joked laughed and she was always next to me hugged me (that was giving me life energy i need it desperately im almost completely out) and we messaged eachother a lot when we were away and well it all started kinda dying out just as i was trying to ask her out, her intentions were clear and i was about to make it happen i dont remember the last time i was this confident I KNEW it was meant to be... Boy oh boy do i wanna travel back in time and just shout to myself not to hurt myself, because im undesirable and it wont work Needless to say it didnt work i asked her out on a date she rejected saying she was seeing someone .... if i was a friend she wouldve told me ""Heyy there look at this cute guy ive met"" instead ... she just confirmed my grim calculations I was on the verge of greatness i was this close ... She stopped talking to me because she found someone better, obviously, because im worst its easy to find someone else ... I fell so hard i flopped i felt like everyone is against me and the world just doesnt want me to succeed. In the dream i was dreaming of usual hanging out with her, i hug her for a whole minute and we talk calmly about our days at the bus stop while i wait for the bus yes she went out of her way to keep me company at a bus station at freezing temperatures, she is wonderful And in the dream she said i should follow her and be quick so i dont miss the bus, ""alrightyyyy"" i Said and followed knowing it will be something interesting. It was, she ran behind a building, hid behind a gate a hopped out to scare me with a heart shaped chocolates box ""HAPPY VALENTINES"" she said ""wait what its Valentine's day????"" (in the dream apperently not irl) ""what? how did you not know?"" ""i guess because its just like any other day for me, but seeing people happy and loved"" ""Today that changes !!! will you be my valentine??"" I gasped in shock, my heart beat increased i started feeling emotions in the dream !!! "" YEEES"" I shouted while surprised she also added ""I liked you for quite some time, will you be my boyfriend?"" I just hugged her and she kissed me and we went on to hug for a few more seconds. Why? because my heart started to beat faster and my body and brain were experiencing emotions ive never felt in my life, i could feel my real body i started phasing out of the dream in that moment i realized the depressing sad truth- love is for me, just imagination Ive felt the love stricken feeling for 3 seconds after waking up and immediately after that an explosive detonated in my gut, sharp pain, sadness, loneliness, monsters... I wanted to stop crying but it just made it worse, i wanted to go back to her warm hug but it just made me feel worse and worse and worse

i was borderline dead the whole day and still am, i want to fo to sleep

and never wake up

please put me in a dream with her, one so wonderful my brain doesnt wake up from

TL;DR
a friendly girl who was interested in me rejected me because she found someone else and now i feel like shit because i couldve got her love

so i dream love that i will never get, hugs and attention"

lonely,Can’t seem to do anything right,"Can’t seem to do anything right - As of late it seems like everything I do is wrong, whether its Uni, Family, Friends, or trying to make something of my miserable love life. Ive been cheated on 4 times out of all 4 of my exes, and I started developing mad trust issues. 5 months ago I met this girl, I thought she was just the perfect, most beautiful, and smart person I have ever met. As we got talking she said she also had issues in the past with her exes as-well, and so she wanted to take it slow. So we never started dating or anything but we both told each other we had feelings for one another. The first 3 months were bliss, as she got more comfortable around me we started just spending more and more time together. we would watch anime, and movies and just literally do anything we possibly could do with each other. She didn’t have many friends before, but I started helping her make some friends. Problem is these last two months she spends all her time with her friends and we barely share a single text message in a day. Shes always hanging with her friends, and I miss her so much, I never got the chance to told her that I fell in love with her, hard. Im happy that shes happy, because end of the day thats my priority, but where does this leave me? Why am I always the second choice? Why am I the one thats always left behind?"

lonely,Extremely tired of a monotonous life,"Extremely tired of a monotonous life - Seriously. All I do every day is go to school, come home, do my hobbies, or sleep if I get tired. It’s the same in the weekends; no one to do anything with. I like school because there I am surrounded by people, but even there I don’t have any friends. What’s so wrong with me that causes my inability to make just one friend? I have mild aspergers and ADHD as well; I really wish I didn’t have that.

I swear, if I don’t change my surroundings soon, or my life in general, I might as well just go crazy. Days don’t even feel separate anymore; they all just feel like one chain of time without any difference in it.

I want to move away and find a life for myself. Where I live now I just see old friends, old friends I have known since I was a kid, and the same buildings. I hate seeing them every day— them talking to each other while ignoring me completely as if I never existed. I would like to move to the countryside, or maybe another city or another country (I live in Europe). I have always wanted to do that. The thought of living in this same city all my life and in the same one since I was a baby, and the one my family has always lived in gives me the creeps. I want to experience something new, but I feel impossible about it— I get moderate grades in school, but not good enough to get into a good university I think. What if there is no future for me, and what can I do to make things better? I want to live and I want a life, but suicide often seems like the only possible solution. Is there anyone else in a similar situation even?"
lonely,What does having a best friend feel like?,"What does having a best friend feel like? - Throughout my time reading through posts on this subreddit, I’ve seen that many of you have had a falling out with people who used to be your best friends. Unfortunately I can’t relate to how you guys feel as I’ve never had the opportunity to make a best friend. I do have some friends but I’m never their go-to. My only experiences are when they talk to me because they need something. The only feeling I ever get from the friends I’ve had is the feeling of being used and thrown away.

I feel like I’m standing at the start of a racing track and I can see all my friends already halfway finished with everything they want to do.

It may be sad and a little morbid but I appreciate this subreddit and r/depression as they show me I’m not the only one like this. It’s nice how even though everyone on here has their troubles, we all can band together here. It is nice to see.

My friends, co-workers, even my husband have this image of me that doesnt feel right. Like I'm not being my true self. I can't quite put my finger on it and I can't quite explain it. 

I suppose it's my fault. I'm not a trusting person and I never have been. I dont like opening myself up to people. It makes me feel exposed. I'm in my mid 40s now. Maybe something will change. Until then I can just keep distracting myself with the internet."

I can’t seem to make friends well anymore and I don’t get exposure to people other then the 3 people I work with daily (they’re all older and have kids). 
My boyfriend is a drain cleaner so he isn’t home during the day when I’m home and sometimes he isn’t even home yet when I get home after work. 
I just find I’m getting lonelier. I feel like no one cares about me. My family is also out of the picture. 
I try to not think about it and get lost in my work because it’s something I love but that’s only half my day. 
It also doesn’t help that my boyfriend is always playing league (league of legends where a game can last up to an hour maybe) when I get home and plays until he comes to bed after me.

lonely,I've just realised I've never had a best friend,"I've just realised I've never had a best friend - So I had someone I used to call 'best friend'. We've known each other since kindergarten. That's a lot of years (we're 20yrs old atm). Some people tought we were sisters (I don't understand why, we don't look alike, I have brown eyes, she has blue eyes, her hair is light brown, mine is darker brown, but whatever) and some confused us (teachers used to do that a lot lol). That's how close we were.

You'd say we're still really close, right?

Not at all. We were friends indeed, but also rivals. We were the best in our class and always competing with each other. We've always been ambitious. I myself wanted to see this competition  as a friendly one, but she wanted to be at the top so bad that she felt satisfied while bringing me down. Ironically I ended up first on our high school graduation exam, and not her. From what I remeber she never congratulated me properly. I would've been happy for her because I didn't expect myself to surpass her... I actually felt bad for doing that.

We go at different universities now and we don't see each other that often. She is totally fine: she made new friends, she has a perfect boyfriend... I am rather alone and struggling to make genuine friends...

I ask myself if she really saw me as a friend or just as a rival. Because she seems like she doesn't care about me anymore. I did care for her. She insulted me or treated me badly so many times, but I didn't mind it, because she was my closest friend. I could've found someone else, but I just knew no one could have been like her. That's how much I cherished her.

I'm not saying I didn't do anything wrong, I'm sure there were times when I didn't act like a true friend, but it was out of anger most of the times... because of how she treated me...

I don't mean to badmouth her with this post, I just felt sad because she is no more my best friend, yet somehow she still has that place and it feels like she will have it forever... I'm not sure she feels the same towards me..."

1. Set up a bed on my balcony and try to give myself a romantic night staring at the stars.

2. Solo travel to SF and figure out where the social events are (just not sure what to do exactly)

3. Make steak at home and play video games while eating that.

lonely,Always getting ghosted by extrovert friends,"Always getting ghosted by extrovert friends - I don't have a lot of friends, at most two close ones and a couple others I sometimes hang out with. With the exception of one of them, everytime I ask to hang out with any of the others, they either ghost me or reply with short, curt answers, like they're not interested or can't be bothered with me. It's not like I ask a lot either. There are times when we go months without speaking to one another. And I get it, they're all much more extroverted than I am with loads of friends and bigger social circles than I'm comfortable with. Because they have more people to spend time with, I feel like they don't think of me very much or don't prioritize hanging out with me the same way I do with them. It just sucks to feel like the only person invested in trying to make a close friendship work because the other parties are busy with their other, larger groups of friends and just don't seem all that interested in spending time with you."

You have days where you convince yourself that you're fine, just to realize in a matter of hours that it's all lies that you tell yourself to sleep at night. Being in solitude can be peaceful but too much of anything can hurt you in the end. Some times we just need that one person we can call and talk to for an hour about our life and all of our problems. People say you have to love yourself before others can love you but in reality, you can't love yourself in isolation. Life is such a paradox."
lonely,Am I going to be forever alone?,"Am I going to be forever alone? - Its sucks being single when it's not by choice, I feel so alone and lonely its sucks always being the single cousin and the third wheel, spending the weekends all by myself and no one to talk or hang out with because everyone is busy with their bf/gf/spouses and partners. Being an introvert doesn't make my life easier, I've been fighting all my life to keep myself positive that my non existent love life will change. My family says at 25, it’s about time I accept that I may never meet someone special, but something inside me still believes that he exists, he is out there, that I'll know instantly who he is and we'll definitely be together.
​
​I want to know all the things about him. I want to know how he looks like, I want to know what he loves the most in the world and for him to share it with me. I want to know what buttons I can push, how he’ll react when he is edgy and when the line is drawn. I can't wait to learn his favorite color, his favorite music, his life goals, the things he wants to do, the places he wants to see. I can't believe that I may miss out on becoming intimately involved with someone as I've never had this kind of love before. My mind longs to know someone with passion and to discover this world with him
​
​I don't want to miss out to be one of the cheesy couples, hand holding and all, never get the chance to try going on some scary rides (where I can bury my face in his chest if it gets too scary). I want to find someone whose happiness is going to become important for me. Is it too hard to find a man between 26-33 who is single and looking for someone special too, I just feel so hopeless with constant failure to find someone, it's so demotivating and soul sucking really. At this point I just wish my heart would give up and become numb because going through rejection and ghosting is taking a toll on my confidence something a few years to build up. I know love isnt easy but at this point I just need someone to love and be my best friend, I have waited for years now, I wish the universe just would finally give me a chance to experience it."

I'm a medical marijuana patient but that's not really a hobby unless you enjoy just dropping hundreds of dollars on all kinds of smoking stuff.

I even try to apologise if I am somehow boring and try to end the conversation if it's boring to the other person, but when they say ""no, it's fine"" they don't continue the conversation, instead I try to continue the conversation, but it's met with the responses like: ""cool, ok, fine, neat etc."",and even when I try to change the subject of the conversation it's still the same result.

So my conclusion about this is: WTF BROTHER?
Am I cursed or sm shit?

I genuinely want to have a good long interesting conversation, because my day to day bs is silence solitude and general loneliness all day every day.

Pls tell me I need/want answers about this. If need be I will elaborate further on my type of ""personality"" so pls just tell me what am I supposed to do. If not then I will just become a hermit and fuck off into the mountains to live with goats and cows in peace and harmony untile I die."

Who I can call on discord or send a message to and ask to hang out without feeling foolish. People tell me they like me and that I should stop feeling like a bother, but I’m no one’s go-to anymore. There’s really something special about being the first person someone tells about something silly that happened at work or something has changed in their life and I want that back. Not having someone like this anymore leaves me feeling empty and unnecessary. I’m lonely when I have friends, but when I have someone I consider my best, someone who I can always go to without ending up apologizing for my existence, it really isn’t so bad. Things feel better. Sad days end up feeling valid and happy days end up amplified. I miss that. A lot. Thanks for reading."
lonely,New friend turned down my lunch invitation. Made me start overthinking and my lonely feeling came back hard,"New friend turned down my lunch invitation. Made me start overthinking and my lonely feeling came back hard - New friend turned down my lunch invitation and my lonely feeling came back hard. Any advice?

I(24M) am doing a two-year degree in japan and this semester it has been quite lonely. Im holed up in the lab, I dont live in the dorm anymore, and I have no classes with the other international students. Most of them are short termers (6months to a year). I have made no friends since October, when they arrived.

Two weeks ago I was sitting in a bench in a packed cafe, when a nice (23M) European dude, doing a medicine-internship thingy for four months. I enjoyed the conversation and when I shook his hand before  we parted, I said “was nice talking to you.” Which he replied with “was it?” it a surprised (not rude) voice.

He accepted my fb friend request and I asked if hed like to join me for lunch. He said he has a full day but thanked me for the invite. That was a big step for me, as i think i probably have mild social anxiety. 

Anyways it upsets me how I made a new friend and hes going home soon. When i got turned down i started overthinking, wondering if he was really busy or of if he wasnt interested. Was I the only one who enjoyed the conversation? 

Now I just feel so lonely and pathetic. Any advice on how to get out of this funk?

Thanks

lonely,To those who's friends make you feel lonely and worse,"To those who's friends make you feel lonely and worse - this is to all those lonely people out there who stick with a toxic friend group who makes you feel shitty, because you think they're the only ones who can tolerate you. for the last 5 years I've been with a pretty toxic group of friends, because I thought noone else could tolerate me. I've had one or two close friendships outside of them that have helped me grow as a person, but I never seemed to be able to apply my growth around these people. so, I realized I needed to leave to better myself. I've only spent a few days away, and let me list some cons and some pros I've found.

Con:
the loneliness does get worse - seems obvious enough, I went from 2-7 people to talk to and play with every day to 0-2
more bored - same as above pretty much
Pros:
Im less toxic - my friends hated who I really was, so I acted toxic around them because they were toxic and it's how I got them to like me. unfortunately this started rubbing off on my other conversations, and was part of the reason I couldn't get friends outside of them. no longer is this a thing
I feel like I can be myself and breathe again - I used to walk on egg shells, try my best to perfectly plan everything I say to weave a web of lies and intrigue just so they wouldn't lose interest in me,but now that I've chosen to leave them, I can be true to me, and not feel ashamed
after just a few days break, I feel like I can talk to some of the less toxic of the group about who I really am - some of my friends are pretty understanding, and I feel like now that I've gone a few days without any toxic input, I don't have any toxic output to give. this means I can talk to my friends how I want to, being nice, stuff like that, and not care.

overall, is it worth it? yeah. even if it's only been a few nights, these nights were my loneliest of all, and I seriously nearly cried once or twice, which doesn't sound like a big deal, but I haven't cried outside panic attacks since I was younger than 10, I don't remember the exact age. but I feel like I stand a decent chance now, of meeting people like me and not scaring them away with the toxicity my friend group imbued in me. I feel like I can go out there and meet nice folk and not feel like a worthless, hateful piece of garbage. 

Take it from me, if you stay where you are now, it probably won't ever change. if you decide to take this plunge like I did, but you need someone to talk to while you're going through your friendship withdrawals, chat me. I'll try my best to be there for you.

Love from me to all of you wonderful folks"
lonely,having friends is rare,having friends is rare - why does it feel like having friends is becoming such a rare thing its almost impossible to find people who will stick by you? people who will actually care about you when it feels like the world is against you? people who would do anything to make you feel safe and loved and listened.

lonely,All alone,"All alone - I (24F) feel lonely all the time. I don’t really have friends. I consider myself as a “background friend,” always an after thought, never anyone’s favorite or anyone’s go to person. I never get invited anywhere. It sucks. 

I thought when I went to college I would make life long friends there but that wasn’t the case for me. I was on a sports team and we hung out all the time in school/over the summer but I guess we were not really friends. 

I think because of this I make bad decisions when it comes to guys. What I mean is that I tend to like any guy who’s attractive to me and shows me the slightest amount of attention. It’s like I’m trying to fill a void of not having any girl friends but I don’t think that is healthy. 

Now I kind of feel like I’m too old to make friends. Everyone already has their friends :("

He said sometimes very very impactful to me. He told me “Dude! Are you serious? you’re wasting your life at home doing nothing, these times are never substituted in the future”
I really don’t how I feel about this but I am sure it ain’t good"

Why is the hardest part of the role is connecting with others - I couldnt believe the offer i got to intern at one of the biggest tech companies in the Globe. Im a couple of weeks in and im doing ok with the work given. Sure it can be challenging at times but I never thought it would be the human aspect that would be by far the most difficult for me. I try my best starting conversation, and i absolutely pushed myself during the orientation and chatting with fellow interns. Its starting to get very discouraging seeing the other interns in my group continue be friends with interns from other areas. Some will visit eachother and have lunch together. I failed to do that myself. It makes me wonder if there is genuinely something wrong with me that i cant see. The effects of lonliness are creeping in. Ill continue to try my best and connect with others as i dont believe in giving up, its just hard not to quit right now.."
lonely,M23 People like me but I have no friends and my relationship is in ruins,"M23 People like me but I have no friends and my relationship is in ruins - Everytime I open my messages app on my phone it just feels like a battlefield of texts from people I don’t care about and work related stuff. I have no friend, no one to text me to see what’s up or just to chat. But at the same time I don’t want any friends bc I feel like I have to identity myself to someone when I’ve been fighting to keep an identity as me for so long. Growing up I was always the bottom guy on the totem, always the one left out of games if there were an uneven amount of people. Always the one who would be pushed back behind when walking in groups of 3. I tried to get away from those experiences so much that I maybe block friends out. My relationship is long distance and I only see here every couple months and it makes me feel like an even bigger outcast and loner. I don’t have friends and my girlfriend lives a thousand miles away. 

I see people in their clicks already and I don’t know how I’d even try to implement myself in that and at the same time I don’t want to be around any group politics. Maybe I just haven’t met the right people, and maybe it’s a good thing I have held off. But I just don’t know what to do my relationship is in ruins and makes me feel stupid but I love the girl to death and I don’t have any friends. At the same time whenever anyone sees me in person it’s a great interaction, they are smiling, I’m smiling. People get happy to see me and that’s that. I feel like nothing outside of that. I feel like I’m even some what of a person people look up to in my community. 

How do I make friends with these people. What mindsets should I change? I don’t want to get married and have no best man. I have no one :/."

I made a list of reasons why I should not and it’s a fine list like I won’t. But I got like 7 things and idk I wish I had more. I don’t want to text my friends bc the ones that I truly trust I don’t want to change my relationship with them. I feel like if I tell them I had suicidal thoughts they’ll just be scared for me and treat me like I’m a very breakable vase or something. It’s 1am and I have a test tomorrow but I don’t want to sleep, bc I just can’t deal with all the thoughts in my head. It’s like a tornado of shitty stuff going around in my brain and I can’t stop it.

I was and am working through mine through counseling and therapy. I see the changes in myself and yet you, the person I love and trust the most, tells me I have not changed at all and that you have been unhappy again for a few months. I talked to tpu may times about communication and asked if everything was okay. I trusted you when you said we were doing much better. And now I'm alone. Just before Christmas you dumped me. No communication, no discussion, just done and get your shit out.

lonely,Wishes,"Wishes - Recently, I played this wish game with my therapist as sort of an experiment. I got three wishes and the only thing I couldn’t do was wish for more wishes. I only had one wish though. To fall in love. I know that sounds cheesy, but it would be nice to be able to share more than a friendship with someone outside of my family. I repel people because I have depression and anxiety but I’m on an antidepressant now. I just wish one of the people that I liked would care to notice me and talk to me, and not run because of the way I dress. Or act. Someone told me this today: your face and clothes are so sad and depressed but you have really pretty eyes. I’ve gotten this complement a lot since I was a kid. I’m Native American and German so I can tan and I have dark hair. But you would expect someone who looks like me to have brown eyes. That’s not the case. I have a gold ring around both of my pupils, then a green ring and then a blue ring on the outside. My eye color changes when I look at different colors and you can see many different colors when they’re in sunlight. All that being said, no one, not even my mom or therapist can look me directly in the eyes while I’m also looking at them for more than ten seconds. I think it scares a lot of people off. People usually have two reactions. 1. They turn away really fast and act like they weren’t looking. 2. They stare at my eyes like a weirdo and try to catch glimpses of them. And for some reason people can tell when I’m looking at them or in their general direction. And vice versa goes for me. Three guys that I have liked, at some point, I feel like I have caught them looking at me and I usually meet their eyes. This kind of makes me uncomfortable but really I’m actually kind of glad to see that someone isn’t afraid to see what my eyes hold. I know that seemed trivial but I have no one to talk to. Thanks for listening if you got this far."

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."
lonely,Does anyone else find it harder to make friends in real life?,"Does anyone else find it harder to make friends in real life? - No, I’m not suicidal or depressed, though I was formerly those. I don’t think it’s because I’m very ugly because I’ve posted my face on another account in r/rateme, most said I don’t look too bad and looked cute I suppose, just need to shed some weight and grow my hair out. (I’m a Female.)

But I’ve noticed that I tend to get along with people online than in real life. I’ve been making friends online since as a kid, and had fun chatting with them about games and arts mostly. Nowadays, I’ve gotten some friends from Discord too and they all seemed nice to talk to, even when you don’t have common interests at all. I guess the only problem are timezones.

However in real life, it’s really difficult to make friends. A lot of people here really like the most generic things that I really couldn’t relate or try to talk about. People here that I’ve observed tend to have an unhealthy obsession over Kpop or League of Legends. I mean, yeah I can still make friends with people with no common interests but in here, some are also quite cold and tend to be.. cliquey. I kinda felt like an outcast because I have really.. niche interests. (I like 80’s aesthetic, vampires except Twilight, Sims and GTA Vice City/San Andreas.)

And I even attempted to make friends on my first day of Tertiary school. I tried to ask about their day to the two girls in the elevator, they gave me strange looks and nodded awkwardly. My texts were ignored when I asked my classmate about their day and wished them well. No thank you or anything. And another girl I’ve attempted to make friends with walked out on me the day after we had lunch together without saying why. These lead me to missing school for a month due to my self-esteem and former depression. 

At my last resort, I’ve even tried making friends in a Weeb club (Was a weeb before.) but instead, people are still cliquey and this one dude even tried talking to me so I don’t feel left out. Left the club because I got out of my weeb phase and wasn’t interested in anime that much anymore.

Anyone felt similar?"

I am a conservative in a pretty liberal school, enjoy things like meditation and other eastern practices that people have made fun of me for liking, I don't really party or like spending a ton of money hanging out, I also read a lot in school and for some people guys make fun of me for this too (no clue why. Literally so many people read but these kids at my school make fun of me for it).

lonely,I'm very lonely and I have no chance of finding a partner due to my religion.,"I'm very lonely and I have no chance of finding a partner due to my religion. - My religion is very important to me. I converted in my mid 20's (about 3 years ago). I believe it with everything in me.  We make up less than 1% of the population of the united states. I want a life partner who shares my beliefs, who can grow with me towards God. I don't ""have"" to marry someone my brand of christian but I do want to. If someone is going to share my life then we need to have the same core values and thats just not going to happen if they arn't already a member of the church.   


I""m so tired though. Ive got friends, Ive got family, Ive got hobbies, passions, career aspirations. I'll be honest, I'm a damn good catch in a lot of ways. Ive got flaws but I think I would be a good spouse.   


I spend so much money flying all over the country to go to get together and conferences, and basically anywhere where I might actually run into someone my age and single. I'm not ""desperate"" . I'm not looking for ""any"" woman who meets some checklist. I want to meet someone who I genuinely click with, but I can't even find someone who meets the basic criteria of sharing my faith.

lonely,I have no friends over the Christmas break and I'm not sure what to do with my time.,"I have no friends over the Christmas break and I'm not sure what to do with my time. - I guess this is kinda an odd post. I guess it's kinda a rant with a bunch of problems I'm facing. My first semester of university has ended. I made no friends, and as a result have no friends. 

There was a girl I talked a lot with, we used to walk to the bus together, we sat next to each other. We shared a lot of interests, and she was pretty shy which I guess I was sympathetic towards. Anyway, I asked her out for coffee and she accepted, we spend 2 hours there talking and I think it went alright. I guess at the time I kinda thought of it as a date while she did not. I then ask her if I could ""take her out"" to see a movie and she says she is too busy, essentially rejecting me. Afterwards she seemed to be kinda avoiding me, so I essentially told her about my intentions, and that I really did not mean much by asking her. I also told her I had Asperger meaning I struggle with these things. We then agree to be friends and things kinda go back to how they were. 

It's now the end of the semester and I texted her a bit about exams but it kinda evolved into a conversation. She seemed to reply quickly and with long responses. I then friend her on snap-chat, and thank her, but she does not reply to my text. She also kinda ended our other conversation quite early, and maybe I'm overthinking this but I feel like shes kinda avoiding me. My current theory is that she really only saw the friendship out of convention due to being in class together and did not want much more than that. I'm really not sure though, I don't really understand people. I am used to being ghosted and having friendships not last long but it still hurts none the less because I now have no friends over Christmas break. Maybe I'm overthinking this though and should just text her being honest and asking her what her intentions are. She told me shes socially awkward herself so maybe it's just that, I dunno.

Anyway, that was a long tangent but right now I don't have any friends, and even if she did want to be, she's leaving for the break I couldn't really do much with her anyway. 

I am seeking therapy, due to my problems with loneliness and having Asperger for the first time over the break so maybe I can sort things out there. But In the mean time I'm not really sure what to do. I feel unproductive and useless sitting around on my computer all day playing video games and watching YouTube. I could get a job but it would be inconvenient and I imagine I'd hate working in retail. I used to have hobbies, mainly involving game design, 3d animation etc, but I kinda ran out of time for them thanks to school. I also never really enjoyed them that much as I always found them frustrating. Besides, I'd still be sitting on my computer all day. Its not so much that I'm bored, but I feel lazy and unproductive, I'm not really doing anything with my time. I used to exercise a reasonable amount but school kinda got me out of the routine, and I could do that again, which might help."

And I just left like I have more in common or more of a connection with the emptiness of the solar system than here. The dead silence of outer space. It just felt familiar and weirdly comfortable. 🌎 🌝"

lonely,End of loneliness is far away,"End of loneliness is far away - I get these hits of crippling loneliness whenever I think about the future. It's like I always need to do X before I can not be lonely anymore but there are so many X's and the years are just going to go by. I'm always thinking ""well maybe I'll get a good job next year, start dating then?"" But then something else comes up in that diseased brain of mine. Shit like ""I need to graduate, see a psych, see a dermatologist, a dentist, an urologists (genetic lottery sucks). I need to workout, get better clothes, move out (in this economy)"". And it all takes money too, so I better get that job. I hope it's not all about the money though. 

I do all that and then I'm twenty five or twenty eight, or thirty three. I finally hop on tinder or whatever they are using in the future. But at that point I have decades of zero experience. Texting, talking, flirting, fucking. Experience is going to take some time too.

I hope people are going to be patient. 

I'll probably get better at writing meandering monologues about misery, maybe sell the script to Noah Baumbach. That's a silver lining.

Anyway I'm just slow cooking in pointless fears but I can't help it. The future scares me. How are you doing?"
lonely,Is this all there really is to life?,"Is this all there really is to life? - I’m lucky enough to say I have a house and family, and I’ve recently made a good friend, but it all feels so shallow, when ever I’m having fun with another person out of nowhere I think “ is this real?” or “ it’ll end soon and be nothing more than a memory” then it no longer becomes fun anymore. 
I have no one I can personally speak to about my thoughts and it’s just kind of lonely. I end up faking an illness so I won’t have to leave my room, and I waste a day of my life. 
I’m sure that I don’t have any forms of emotional issues and that pretty much everyone has probably felt like this, and that just makes me feel worse because if that’s all there is to life then what’s the point when I can just distract myself with the things I enjoy for as long as I feel like or as many times as I want.
When people mention the conspiracy of a matrix-like situation it makes me think that there could be something more real than this, that there could be a life where it wouldn’t feel like I’m watching it though a TV screen.
If any one read this rant of mine I really appreciate that you wasted your time reading all this crap, so thank you."

Whenever I post anything in this sub I always get those generic answers like ""find a hobby"", ""go to place where you can meet people with same interests as yours"". I already have interests and go to places. I play (only at home but it still counts), I concerts where I see plenty of people who have same interests as mine. 
For some reason my parents want me to find a girlfriend (and I also kinda want to  tbh), they think that anyone would find me attractive. My friend told me that his mother said that I'm a ""pretty boy"" or some shit (my parents are friends with his parents) and it made me laugh my ass off. 

I try really hard not to look like I want to find a relationship because I don't want people to think I'm desperate but deep inside I feel strong desire to find someone. The only time I had an interaction with a girl who listens to same music as I do was when I bough some stickers at a gig and some girl just want to see what do they look like And that's it. 
I know I should just give up but my tiny brain doesn't let me do it."

It's especially hardest around the holidays when I see groups of friends having Friendsgivings, Halloween house parties, or just studying together during Finals. I just want to have a solid group of friends to hang out with + do stuff over the weekends \[I understand that part of college is okay with being alone, but I am alone most of the time or hanging out 1:1 with people every once in a while\]. Does anyone else feel this way?

Also, I am only experiencing this in college :( Over the past few summers (during internships and travel abroad experiences), I have made solid groups of friends but for some reason I have not met any ""groups"" in college that I fit into. What do you think is the difference? Is it because I go to a huge college/don't interact/come in contact with the same people as often? Is it because I just don't connect as well with these type of people at my college?"

We'd gush about various anime and geek over epic moments.

lonely,Lonely and angry.,"Lonely and angry. - I think I'm starting to become angry and bitter as a response to my loneliness rather than just sad. 

I guess it's a natural progression of fight or flight, I've never felt like giving up and I never have if anything my persistence in the face such overwhelmingly negative results is quite admirable, however as the hope is fading instead of getting sad or despondent I can just feel myself getting angry. 

I don't really know how to handle it, it's not who I have ever been really but I can definitely feel it bubbling under the surface.

Its not just the people rejecting me either, I'm feeling annoyed at all the people who told me getting a better job, going to the gym, finding a hobby, spending more on clothes etc. Would help me.

I took all the advice and none of it has made a shred of difference if anything i feel like i'm further away now than when I was just working in retail. Expect I have less free time to try and meet women.

I'm basically growing old bitter and alone and it's not through lack of effort. I think I've followed so much advice and made so many sacrifices I cant really bring myself to say it's my fault anymore because I'm not sure it still can be."

I was working on an important project for college and one girl, she on purpose told me all the wrong things and other one (who I thought she was my friend ) didn't want to help me even though that would mean I was going to fall the class. I didn't, I worked all by myself for 3 days only slept for 2 hours a day. 
I was alone before that, and I am now even more but now I have to act all strong and put together even though I am broken and all alone."
lonely,"A feeling of emptiness, of nothingness","A feeling of emptiness, of nothingness - I've always been a lonely person, but now it's getting worse. It was hard to deal with other people, but at least at school and at college you HAD to interact with the others. After that, when you're basically on your own, it gets harder and harder. There are days when I don't say a single word. Sometimes I talk to myself, but I haven't anything interesting to say. Even to me I'm boring, I guess.

Since I'm not good with dealing with other people, chose to work from home thinking that would help but it didn't either. Tried a lot of things: Going to social meetings, to several churches, to bars, to parties. Find like-minded individuals. Nothing. I'm not a good functional human being. I'm not someone other people wants around. I only have a cellphone to listen to music. I had an MP4 before but they stop selling those. I have whatsapp installed but I haven't received a new message in eight months. Every time I try to start a conversation only goes for a few lines. Try to ask for their lives, only got single word answers, or an emoji.

Nothing motivates me these days. Not food, nor music, videogames, or even sex (Which was kinda scary at first but now I don't care). I have tons of stuff I'd dreamed of having in my teenage years, but now I don't care about anything of that. I don't know what keeps me getting up every morning. I have to produce to keep a living, but it's getting harder and harder to find the motivation to do it. Last year I took a very drastic decision but that didn't work either, and I'm still here. The only thing I really look forward to is sleeping time. 

I know I'm the problem. I've tried every suggestion people has given to me: Psychological help, go out more, find new interests, but nothing has worked.

I just wanted to express myself somewhere. Peace."

All the people that I'm friends with only talk to me if I contact them first or we see each other on campus, and I don't think anyone has ever hung out with me. Every time its always someone else that want to hang out and I just tag along with the group. Its like in sitcoms where they always have a group loser for everyone to make fun of so that they can feel better about themselves, but it's something that happens in every human collective so I can't really be mad about it. Maybe my purpose in life is to be an npc waiting on others to want to do something. I just feel like even in my own life I'm barely a secondary character."

I start crying alone, silently on my bed. I wasn’t even someone who cries easily. 

I just want someone to love, and someone who loves me back. I have good friends and family of course but that’s different. When my friends tell me about their relationships, I just feel jealous and upset, I end up being angry at myself for feeling this way. I can’t genuinely be happy for them just because I can’t be happy myself. It’s fucking selfish I know lol. I feel like an asshole and I really want to be glad that everything’s going well for them but I just can’t when I think about how they have something I want so desperately.

I moved to my current city 5 years ago, had a few friends at university but the relationships drifted away as I failed my first year of my degree. I got a boyfriend and was with him for around three years and spent all of my time with him and his friends and felt pretty content. Flash forward to this year and I have neglected all of my personal friendships, broken up with said boyfriend and thus lost all of the friends I had been seeing for the past three years, started a new job and have a few nice colleagues that I will sometimes go for a drink with after work but nothing more. Been seeing a new guy for six months and have the realisation that AGAIN I only have him and his friends - when he ends it with me I will be back on my own with no personal meaningful relationships. I can’t spend time by myself without having dark thoughts about how meaningless my existence is, I am fine when I’m at work but any other time is spent staring at the ceiling feeling pointless. The new boyfriend is super supportive and his friends are amazing but they are HIS friends if that makes sense. I don’t know how I’ve got to the age of 23 and I don’t have anyone I can spend a day off with or talk to about my life. Some times things feel okay but ultimately they are not okay. I don’t feel irrational but also I think that when my current boyfriend ends it with me I will just end it all because I’m sick of being dependent on one person and he doesn’t deserve to be responsible for my happiness."

My mental health has been really improving for the past 2 months but now this and some other shit is destroying all of that improvement and i think that i might relapse.

I really thought that my life and mental health was starting to improve. I really did but looks like it was all temporary.

I just want to hug someone. I want a nice genuine hug that lasts a few minutes and not one of those that last a few seconds and they barely even touch you.

lonely,Hi friends 😊,"Hi friends 😊 - Hey, rather I'm in a state of loneliness or on the other side of it I side with you all and not disconnected from neither review. It is this way it's because I believe that infinite Spirit or God created me this way. The truth is is that we are never alone in the feelings of loneliness stem from being disconnected from the love witch brought you forth which is still waiting on you, on us it will always be waiting on you to read to reconnect until we do so. So what song is I say blessings good morning. Interesting think about this group to me is that we all have someone 2 Express how lonely it could be sometime I trust me I do understand just think about the person it's in solitary confinement maximum security facility who doesn't have the opportunity nor the luxury of expressing how lonely they are. No one to text no one on no social media to post about how long the dark the rooms that they have to stay in for 23 hours a day while we sit out here and talk about feelings of loneliness, emagine 23 hours of day of your life and that situation that would have me rethink everything. I know that feeling as I woke up with it even this morning loneliness and depression and just not feeling like I want to be here or but I had to remind myself I am not the thoughts in my head would rather I am the result in manifestation of love that created me. Although it's good to vent but expressing constant discontent about life it's not going to change it all your thoughts change your reality.

Another thing I noticed, we're so easy it so quick to look at groups of people who look like they're friends and so lovey-dovey but you don't know where next month next week or even yesterday looks looks like whatever for them all you know is what you see before you can you see something that you want in fact plenty of them experienced feeling lonely even though they have friends and soulmate so whatever. I'm just parked here and seeing a little I woke up early this morning feeling weird and not my usual self. But I know what that comes from so in my weirdness I tend to nowadays Express thoughts of gratitude and appreciation to God at least it self if those things that you feel I'll tell you I'll tell you got some gratitude everything else should be easy.

lonely,Feeling isolated that I can't go on,"Feeling isolated that I can't go on - I was ghosted by my old clique. I tried to make amends but they just didn't want to see it or solve it. I soon gave up and become the same old person I was in secondary school. I made new friends and interact with classmates. However nothing seems to click as we have different wavelengths. 
My new friend has lots of friends which I can't connect with due to cultural differences and language barriers. They use their own language to speak with each other. When I am around, I would find myself struck in a some sort of an alien conversation. 
I felt lonely and outcast everywhere. I can make small talks and jokes. However, the other doesn't seem to join in. My new friend is friendly but I can tell she felt bad depending on me for answers. I taught her how to do tutorials but she doesn't seem to learn. She told me she has no interest and just have a hard time studying. I don't believe that as I can see a potential in her if she studies. 
I can get annoyed by her. She tend to ask me questions and want to see my answers. I have a feeling our relationship won't last long. 
I tried to be close as she is the only friend I have in the class. However I don't think I can get on her level. It may be some negative feeling but I can see and feel it.
School is becoming unbearable for me. I want to quit and join another course. It felt like I was stepping on eggshells. I would see my old clique there and feel obliged to run away. I tried to tell myself, ""if they don't care about me, why should I care about them?""
I am able to get through the two months before exams. However, by the time the holidays are coming I realise how alone and isolated I am. Everyone is happily engaging with other people. I tried to go with the flow. Sometimes it was successful and I feel accomplished. 
However, the lingering void in her heart can't be filled. Ever since my clique pushed me out, I feel more alone. There are days where I would cry and just buried everything inside me. 
I can't take it anymore. I feel like I should just disappear and nobody will notice. 
My exam grades are not going well and I am losing my hope. People kept telling me to keep moving on and someday I would find real friends. Having a positive mindset is what helps. However I feel like my strength is gone. Even after trying to make friends, I lost them in the end. I just don't know what to do... Everyone here is connected but me.

I know logically that appearance isn’t all that important, but growing up I was the ugly girl in a small town and my peers were cruel and judgmental. I can’t remember a time when I didn’t hate how I look, and it’s affected my social life for as long as I can remember.

I’ve lost interest in most everything and I struggle to connect with others; I avoid people a lot because I fear I’m boring or weird. I haven’t even tried dating since I broke up with my boyfriend last year. I don’t go out or have fun. I’m not making any meaningful memories. I’m taking an extra year of university but it looks like at this rate I’ll have a degree with nothing meaningful to look back upon.

I just don’t know what to do. I’m fighting so hard against everything going wrong in my head but I never seem to make any progress. I’m taking antidepressants and on a wait list for therapy and I’m eating well and doing everything I can to maintain a routine, but I feel so alone and unwanted by the world at large.

I used to have friends online at least, but I isolated myself from them so completely that they have no interest in talking now—which is understandable. And I have one friend from university but we’re not close enough that I can talk about this with her.

I’m deeply isolated and feeling lower than I have in years and I have nobody to turn to. I’m scared I’ll be like this forever and I can’t cope with it. I just need to feel like my life matters to someone."

Every now and then I’ll have a good time, I’ll be surrounded by people who actually feel like friends. They’ll be accepting and fun, they’ll seem to like me just as much as I like them and I’ll like them a lot. But it doesn’t last, it never does. Bc positive experiences with people are one time things for me. People don’t like to stay in my life, they don’t want to hang out with me more than once. And if we do end up all getting together again, it won’t be the same. It never is. Because they’ll like me much less and it’ll show. It always happens. But I guess, all I can do is enjoy that I got to experience joy and safety for a little while. I just hate that it has to end."
lonely,Still needing help,"Still needing help - This is an old post. I'm still looking for advice.  


 It's quite long since it spans about eight years, but I'll try to be brief.   
 

I  have this friend that I met in college. My school experience was downright abominable, so I started latching on this new social circle  and the first years went well, all things considered. Still, I've had my  fair share of faults and my depressions acted up in those years. I have attempted suicide twice and this friend that was sort of ""the leader""   of the group, was the first person outside of my family that I spoke about this. It was and still is a very touchy subject for me, but, back then, I valued this kindness. The other one stuck with me and I thought  the world of him, as well.  
 Until,  years, later, he mocked me for it. He used the most traumatic  event of my life to make me feel like shit and then ditched me the  moment I tried  to call him and at least talk about this stuff.  Literally sent me a  text where he said ""we didn't work out"" and  basically ghosted me. I've tried to talk to my other friend, the first one, and others of my social circle in the hopes to have at least  someone stick with me, and see my side of things, but alas, it didn't  work out. Slowly but surely, I was ostracized. The one thing that made  me swear off everyone else was the time I saw on Facebook the photo of a  graduation party I wasn't invited to. My two former friends were there.  I talked with the graduate that  basically told me she didn't want to  make a fuss, so she called the other guy instead. That was the moment I  decided to cut ties with every  one of that social circle.  
 I  wanted to give one last chance to my other friend because I thought he was better.  He once said to me that he was on my side and we'd still  be hanging out. It was a lie: If there was a thing I cared about in the  world was watching the new Star Wars movie (It was The Force Awakens,  to give you an idea of the time frame) with my friend. They all went to  see it on the first day without inviting me...But inviting *him*.  
 I  talked with the offending friend when he finally tried to make amends a  year later, and I accepted his apology, even though, in my heart,   things had changed. He left town for another college and I haven't heard from him since. Nor do I want to.  
 The  other one is on thin ice. I didn't forgive him for his cowardice and the fact that he lied to my face, only receiving a half-assed apology.  It was like he had no idea why he did me wrong no matter how much I've explained it to him. We are civil to each other, but I don't particularly care for him. I haven't in all the time that happened no  matter how many souls searching I did, nor did I forget his indifference.  He once said ""That's how things work in social circles"": I  still think  it was bullshit.  
 My first friend,  the one that I met, and I are aspiring writers.  I've written a few pieces for the theatre, while he works in commercial, and wants to expand to television. Despite involving me in several failed  projects  (I'm no Hemingway, but every idea he had and insisted on never  stuck to the landing, mostly because he's repetitive and trashy. So am  I, but in a  different way.) he never once tried involving me with the  ""right crowd"", the people that ""matter"" if you catch my drift. We don't  talk much and I try to keep my distances since he feels like a dead end.    Until recently: We've started working on a web serial with another  writer, and so far it's been miserable. He has no idea how to direct a   project, the story is even trashier than before, I feel my creativity constantly stifled, not to mention he's never satisfied with anyone's writing, including his own. I've hated this project ever since it started and I'm trying to finish it as fast as I can. Still, I don't know what I will do after this. If it has success, we may be stuck,   working together once again. If it doesn't, I'll be left on my own,   while he tries, again and again, leaving me behind.  
 I have no idea what to do, except wallow in my resentment."

So I just gave up because if every potential interest I a have is just think of me as just a friend when I am get to know them and with the fact that I rarely talk with my mom, dad and my brother who is right next door but every time I try to talk to him I just annoy him and so I just gave up and my mom always in her room sleeping(because of her meds) and my dad moved out.

It has been a really lonely, difficult time making friends in this small/medium sized town where it feels like everyone has always known each other.  I’ve always been SUPER social and confident but lately I haven’t been feeling that. I had a great network in my old city and that makes it even harder. 

We have been joining a church group in hopes to getting more connected. My fiancé was working tonight so I went to their Christmas party on my own. 

I can’t say it was ALL bad, I chatted to some people I knew, but by the end after I circulated to everyone I knew I just had to leave because I didn’t want to be clingy on the few people I knew. I tried going to groups I haven’t met but it was clear they didn’t want to talk to me. Those who did I feel we’re just waiting for a natural time to leave the convo and be with their friends.

lonely,Single for 22 years,"Single for 22 years - Hey so I’m mostly just posting to see if anybody else can relate to me because I kind of feel like a loser. In fact I made an ult just for this post lol.

Like the title says I’ve been single for 22 years. Not only that but I’ve never had sex or gone on a date. Man I haven’t even had my first kiss lmao. I know that I’m not bad looking and I’m in decent shape so it’s not because of anything like that. It must just be because of who I am as a person? But I’m just a regular dude that goes to school, has some hobbies, goes to the gym, hangs out with friends, and goes out drinking every once and a while. I’m not really a club kind of person though.

Most of my buddies are in long term relationships and all of them have a shit ton more experience than me. They try to help me out too but no luck so far. I try using dating apps but I’ve never actually met anyone in person from it. Seems like a lot of people just use it for validation rather than actually using it as a way to meet people. There were a few that I thought could lead to something and I got excited to meet them. But when we started deciding on a day for a date I would get ghosted. 

Throughout high school I had a few crushes but again nothing really worked out or they just wouldn’t feel the same way that I do. Then when I got to college it kind of was just the same as the rest of my schooling where I would have a crush but it just wouldn’t work out. So I decided that maybe I should focus on myself and class so that I can set myself up for a better future. And I’m doing that but man is it fucking depressing. I feel so lonely. I obviously know that I have friends and family there for me and I’m very grateful for that but it’s not the same as a romantic relationship. I just want someone to love me you know? Like can yah boy just get a date 😂.

Now being 22 years old I just feel like I’m really missing out and I find myself losing a lot of hope. Maybe I’m not meant to find someone? Maybe I’m not good enough? Maybe there’s something wrong with me? Idk where I’m really going with this but hey there might be somebody else out there can relate lol.

I dont exist anymore. People just seem to not notice I'm alive. At my age 34 I'm not sure how the hell to meet someone. I'm not a drinker so bars are boring to me.

I also open up to them but they don't really care, they just say ""i hope you get better"" or ""im sorry"".

lonely,Loneliness is a plague on my soul,"Loneliness is a plague on my soul - All my life I have had trouble making/ keeping friends. I’m not a bad person but I am awkward and socially inept. I was homeschooled just me and my sister, and up until like 13 she was my best friend. Then she was 14 and changed. She hated being around me, distanced herself from me and abandoned me. I always had a hard time making friends I would get excited being around people (due to not having much contact with people outside of family and church) this excitement would turn to annoyance and goofiness. I had one friend through all this. A boy 3 years younger than me, he has stuck close and has been my best friend for close to 13 years now. I have better luck in the social aspect now but I still have an overwhelming sense of loneliness I have “friends” but the romantic pursuits have always lead to heartbreak. The first relationship collapsed after 3 years due to both of our immaturity in relationship, the second was due to her cheating, and the third was due to her falling in love with someone she had friend zoned. I’m 26 now and I have only ever had 3 relationships.
My loneliness stems from a lack of friends, and complete lack of relationship.

TLDR: I’ve struggled finding friend for a long time due to a reclusive childhood, and still have trouble connecting with people today"
lonely,Struggling to figure out how to love myself instead of trying to find someone to do it for me.,"Struggling to figure out how to love myself instead of trying to find someone to do it for me. - Just joined the group and it would be nice to get this off my chest. 

I'm a 24F and I've struggled with mental health issues all my life. I've been in therapy for years and take medication to help treat it. I work really hard and have worked my way into a fantastic job. I have a good relationship with my mom and sister, and a close friend. I have some acquaintences I go out with every once in a while. I always do what I can to laugh and make others laugh, and just treat people well as much as I can. I don't think most people realize how lonely and hollow my life can be. 

I've always looked for love in all the wrong places. My first relationship lasted from when I was 16-18 and it was really toxic, we were both terrible to each other. I slept around a lot after it ended to try to find some sort of freedom, but it made me feel terrible about myself so I kept to myself for the most part until I met my next boyfriend when I was 20. 

Once again, it was toxic and we were terrible to each other, but he was physically abusive and manipulative. I left him and started taking better care of myself. My life really transformed for the better. 

I met my next boyfriend at 22. I did everything I could to treat him well and love him, because after all, I had grown a lot from my past relationships and knew how to express love in a healthier way. But history repeated itself. He was a skilled manipulator and was a genius at gaslighting. We broke up and stayed friends until I found out he had been cheating on me the whole time we were together. 

It was a huge wake-up call. I'd been trying my whole life to find someone who would make me love myself, and was trying to find love from the exact same types of emotionally unavailable men. I kept to myself and did a lot of growing up and self-reflecting. But over time, I got really lonely. I realized I needed experience actually dating people and figuring out what I liked. It was gruelling and not even worth it most times. 

Then I met my most recent boyfriend in March of this year. He was so kind and had a great heart. I think I knew from the beginning I didn't love him and wouldn't ever, but he was the first truly kind person I ever dated. We had a lot of good times together and he taught me a lot about healthy relationships, but as time went on, I realized I would never feel happy and fulfilled with him. We ended things on good terms in October. I never miss him, but I always wish him well and know he'll make someone really happy one day.

For a while, I had been excited to work on loving myself so I wouldn't feel so lonely and so I could maybe, one day, attract someone I could fall in love with. 

Then, not too long ago, the loneliness set in. And here I am. I just feel trapped. I know I need to keep learning to love myself and things will work out, but in the meantime I'm still really really lonely. I'm a human and I crave physical affection from another person. About a month ago, I met up with a stranger for a hookup, something I told myself I'd never do. I knew exactly what I was getting myself into, it was safe and a good time, and I knew I'd never see him again. I didn't regret it. I was sad afterwards, not because I felt dirty or like I did something wrong, but because it was over. This past weekend, I was out at a club with a friend, got drunk, and went home with another stranger. We connected, it was a good night. The next day he asked for my number and told me he wanted to meet up again this weekend, but I know I won't hear from him. I didn't even want to date him, I knew that would probably never work. I just wanted someone to think I'm pretty and give me cuddles every once in a while. 

I guess when it comes down to it, I feel trapped with my loneliness. I have a lot of hard work ahead, but don't know how to soothe myself in the meantime. I struggle to make friends. I know a relationship isn't a good idea for me right now and won't be for a while. I don't want to keep hooking up with random people, there's plenty of safety concerns. Dating apps are just the worst and only make me feel shitty. I've been thinking a friends with benefits situation would be nice, but even if I knew how to find someone who would be up for that, those situations seem to just end in one person catching feelings and getting hurt, and that person would probably be me. I guess I just need to come to terms with the fact I'm going to be alone for a long time and make my own peace with it. 

Can anyone relate? 

TLDR: been looking for love in all the wrong places most my life and don't know how to come to grips with the reality I'll probably have to be alone for a long time until I can learn to fully love myself."
lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

This is a question for older redditors who have spent their lives partnerless and living alone.

How do you cope?

I’m settling in, and want to learn how to not go down any slippery slopes in terms of mental health and being a danger to myself. I’m introverted and have social anxiety and have spent a lot of my young adult and adult life in solitude, but I’m not emotionally built to be alone and without a partner and so this has been quite difficult for me. I’ve dealt with a lot of depression, anxiety, self-loathing, and general feelings of loneliness and lack of love and having a person for many years. 

Unfortunately, that’s how it’s going to be for me. So I want to learn how to live this was from now on, but in a healthier manner."

I suffer in silence because in reality no one actually gives a shit.

I was betrayed so badly that I can never be the same, nothing will. Thinking things were bad in my 20s that was nothing compared to now. -    I have nobody to talk to in real life, nobody to share happy things, sad things, any things. I do live with someone but they may as well be a brick wall. They get angry at me for everything and take out their own insecurities onto me, insulting and demeaning me and then acting nice for a bit to reel me back in. He threatens me with homelessness every time we get into the dumbest arguments. Arguments that never mattered with other people, it would not come to that. Yet he is convinced it is everyone else, he is perfect. 
 
  So, no support, family gone, I cannot even write what happened it is that bad, for me it is. I think about jumping in front of the train a lot. Or taking every pill I can find. Jumping, hanging ect. The saddest part is that I do not want to die and none of this had to happen this way but my mom married a sadist who sucked the life out of us, then other mismanagement family wise left me alone and not knowing what to do. 

  People think if you do not speak to your family it is you who is the problem but when half the people left are narcissistic and out for themselves only and abused you it is hard to keep in touch after a while. There are a few I need to speak to but I do not have their phone numbers and the abusive stepdad does but I am not speaking with him. He would withhold it from me anyway and it would just be yet another thing he has over me. The stuff he did was unimaginable. Maybe I will write about it maybe not"

Fast forward 10 years and I know what reality is.  My city is full of morally depraved nutcases, my career prospects are dismal at best.  I threw away a solid life in a profession that's admirable to chase my dream of being a starving artist.

so I've had times in my life where I felt incredibly lonely (and still sometimes do) and I know how painful it is. I wanna help people that are struggling with this and just cant seem to connect with others.

So I had this idea: a chat app where you get matched with a random person and get a question to talk about that encourages deep talk (e.g. ""What do you want to do before you die?"")

The goal would be to always be able to jump on the app and get at least some of that deep contact one craves when lonely. What do you guys think about this? Would you use it? Do you think it could work?"

Looking to find that certain connection the old fashion way.  Just by talking and getting to know each other on a personal level. Yes looks are important but someone's personality makes them beautiful. Okay imma quit the corny stuff now. 

I would love to make everlasting friendships firs. And maybe even a relationship if it comes to that. I don't care how far away you are. A true connection survives all borders.

Something about myself:

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

My passion is cooking. And besides that I love to read, having conversations, grabbing coffee on a rainy Sunday, watching sports and play some games on my ps4. 

Hope all of you have a good day. Looking forward talking to you!"

The problem I see is that after a while, all the new ppl I speak to, minus one who’s in another country and whom I can’t see at all irl it seems, starts to lose interest. 

I mean like, I’ll send someone I used to be friendly with or still kinda am, a msg. Asking a clear *question*. And I’ll get left on read.  Like isn’t just not answering a question considered ignoring someone? Message unopened when I can see they’re online. My ex said she want to remain friends, now she doesn’t answer calls, texts or IG messages. 

Eventually, people go off me. And I HATE it. I try my BEST to try and do good by people. I understand people don’t owe me shit. I just obviously get hurt as fuck when people start to blatantly disregard me, in that they won’t even bless me with a fucking reply.

I don't feel like talking today, 
Feels like you're drifting away,
No matter how much I pray,
I fear you're not here to stay. 

I just miss you today,
You're slowly losing your way,
You fall in deeper each day,
You say you're finding your place,
I wish it was in my embrace.

Oh how I long it to be,
Just you and just me,
Oh baby I wish you could see,
The damage you're doing to me.

Each day I watch as you drift,
I feel your gaze start to shift,
Away from my face,
Your minds in a new place,
Somewhere I cannot give chase.

I see you smile at your phone,
In the dark all alone,
Where does your mind go and roam,
When you're in bed all alone.

Are you still thinking of me,
Or are you now thinking of he,
Where does your heart want to be,
Nothing left,

But to wait, 



To wait,



And to see."

I even moved a continent away to start fresh. Here I am still feeling the same way with just different scenery.

lonely,Unique life circumstance creating soul-crushing loneliness due to lack of meaningful social connection.,"Unique life circumstance creating soul-crushing loneliness due to lack of meaningful social connection. - Sorry in advance for this dump/rant, but I have to get it out.

To give some background:

I’m a 22 year old guy who dropped out of college to pursue my passion for permaculture, aka regenerative agriculture. I have one very close friend (like a brother) who shares my interest is and currently working with me to start our farm in the spring. 

Basically I think the lack of meaningful social connection is a result of returning to nature, the countryside, and leaving city and university life (and inadvertently all young people) behind. Farming is a full time job and you are married to the land. As someone who came from an upper-middle class family in the suburbs, this radical life change has quite literally left me in the darkest place of my life.

While I’m working towards my goal of providing people with quality local food, and rebuilding our over-tilled, chemical-laden dying soil, I’m lacking the basic human social connections to feel happy in day-to-day life. The average age of the farmer keeps getting older and the younger generations are not interested in hard farm work. This trend is crushing my morale. 

The culture is so polarized... and I’m someone who falls inbetween. I’m not hardcore religious, so I can’t fit into those exclusive groups (I worship nature and my ancestors, which is perceived as satanism) and I really don’t enjoy mindless drinking on the weekends with superficial people. Not judging, just my experience.

No one seems to give a fuck about the people that put food on their plates. And as a young person, this lifestyle couldn’t be more rewarding and isolating at the same time. I’ve noticed this problem has begun to take a severe toll on my mental and physical health... I greatly fear the challenge of finding a significant other who shares interest in the lifestyle.

I’ve made the closest connections in my travels abroad, but they are finite as I must return to the farm. It makes no sense to return to university because I’ve been presented with an outstanding opportunity to manage land with the skills that I already have from independent work/study. 

I think I may be better off accepting this, than fearing and suffering the never ending loneliness."

I want to be able to tell my ""Christmas girlfriend"" that she looks beautiful everyday especially before we are going on a date. I want to know the feeling of going on a date at a 4 dollar sign restaurant and making out afterwards. I want to be able to go on long car rides with her and talk about life and random stuff.

Like we’re still together but not talking to her is so hard. The amount of times I see something that I want to send her or tell her but I can’t bc I don’t want to make her even more upset with me. It’s so hard. I just want her back but I know that I have to give her space. The amount of weed that I smoke has more than doubled in the past 2 days. I know it seems crazy but she’s the only constant love that I get in my life so not having her is so hard.

I dont really know how to be anything else. When I don't know what to say or get anxious I make a joke. Or I get really exitable and end up annoying people. I really want to be a better, less irritating person. 

I'm always anxious afterwards and before that I've irritated people or done something wrong. Usually after any long social interaction I'm filled with anxiety for hours. I feel like I'm a bad person who unintentionally upsets people even when I cant pinpoint a reason why. 

I think that's a large part of why I'm lonely. It's like I naturally put distance between myself and others, And my anxiety makes things worse."

Idk connected I guess. Like when I was with him I felt so warm and like I was at home If you get what I mean. But yesterday he admitted that hed lost feelings for me. And idk
I just dont know what to do rn
Inside of me theres still this one voice that keeps telling me that this isn't real, I'm still denying it internally, but deep down I know this is happening. I've been crying my eyes out since I got up at 7 and all day at school. It was quite embarrassing but ever since yesterday I didn't feel like I'm real anymore. I'm the opposite of popular and everyone just kept giving me weird looks but I didn't even care anymore. I cried for 6 hours straight just to come home and keep crying and idk, idk what to do anymore. I want to tell myself that it's going to be fine but ik it wont. I've never been able to develop any sort of friendship I guess he wasn't only my boyfriend, but my first and only friend and the first person I ever cared about. I dont blame him though, he seemed pretty sad too and its better he just told me than if hed keep me while not actually loving me idk if he's ever going to read that, probably not, but I just wanted to say i still love you and i always will even though u feel different now.

lonely,My plan for the future.,"My plan for the future. - I’ve got three “friends” currently. One is on her way out the door by her choice, and I don’t think even she knows why. One is a bit of a mess, drinks and parties, I don’t know who I am to him, I think just an oddity really, a bit of entertainment when he is bored. Finally the last one is mainly alright, but a bit arrogant sometimes, I’d let this slide normally.

None of these friends ask how I’m going, or ask me to hangout. One lives about a ten minute walk from where I work every day. I know he doesn’t have much on. One said once to me that I’m one of few people he’d actually want to see again. Most days he comes to the university I work at...he has never even said hi. He knows where at the university I work, that I have a really flexible schedule, that I’m there any day, and that I would move mountains to say hi and chat for a few minutes. And one sent me a text asking me for help with enrollment for our common uni course. She hadn’t contacted me in weeks and didn’t ask how I’m going. Just asked what she had to do and didn’t talk at all afterwards or during that tiny conversation about anything else.

I’m giving these until New Years. That’s it. After that they are strangers in my book. I’m pushing everyone away and starting over again.

A few days ago I met a guy with a PhD in applied mathematics and he had done his post doc in Mexico before moving back home. It was awesome to meet someone who I could talk to about things I love, and know that they are interested and actually understanding it. To also hear him talk was great, as he knew volumes more than I do, and I learned a lot when we spoke. He asked me if I wanted to come along to a club Christmas party, and said if I want we could hang out and chat about math. This is the first time in a long time I have been invited to something by someone other than my closest support/therapist like friend. If all goes well at the Christmas party, this dude, and my support friend will be the only ones to survive the cull.

But neither of them go to my university or are in my course. I have no one to see everyday. No one to talk to during the week. I get along well with my lecturers and (somehow) share mutual friends with them from outside uni, so I get to catch up with my friends on the occasion they come in to see my lecturer that they know. They happily let me know and invite me.

I’m going back to plan A, the plan I have had most of my life. Push people away and spend as much time reading and doing work as possible such that I never get a chance to think about fucking lonely I am. I tried so fucking hard this year to make friends. So fucking hard. My last message was a week and a half ago or something, and it was the text about enrollment. I came into the city during the school year when people asked me for help with math or said they were around and bored, all just for human interaction. I pretended to already be there but on a walk to make up for the hour train ride. I made it clear I that I was free to hangout. I forced myself out of my shell and did what I saw people with friends doing, hoping that I would make true friends. It didn’t fucking work.

It won’t be hard. I’ll slip back into my old ways just fine. After this I’ll be more skeptical of people, I’ll have less trust, I’ll probably be more selfish and try to do things for myself as opposed to doing everything for others. People who need my help can fuck off. I’ll sit by myself instead of asking if I can sit with someone or saying “wherever is fine with you” if I’m ever asked where I’m going to sit. I’ll stop talking in such a social manor that has always made me feel fake and uncomfortable, even though people prefer it over “old me”. I’ll be short and to the point. I’ll call people out on the obvious shit they are trying to pull on each other and me. My feigned patience for the non genuine people will disappear. I won’t give in and let my desire to appease people in the hopes of seeming friendly override my desires, You want to do the calculations part of the project? Fuck off. You’ll fuck it up like you did last time. You want to design part of the model plane? Fucking cute. I’ve designed and flown these things for nearly a decade. I LOVE aerospace. You said you picked it because it was the most elite engineering and sounded cool. There is no such thing as the most elite form of engineering. That’s arrogant, and to pick it because you think that makes you a rock bottom piece of shit, You know fuck all about planes. You have shown you will learn fuck all about planes. You can pick the tail number. You will not fuck up my grades because you want to do something in a group project that you are not capable of. And Chloe, you want to come to the hidden little part of the university every morning and rest by my feet, and then let me do they same, and then suddenly stop talking to me? Fuck you. You tell me that you trust me most out of everyone at uni, tell me you are trans, and then decide never to talk to me again (for some reason) when I tell you that my feelings for you remain unchanged and that I still think you’re amazing and you’re still my best friend, only to then message me a month after you ghost me, for enrollment help and then ghost me again? FUCK YOU. Either tell me what is on your mind and be honest or fuck off.

And finally, I’m am not fucking dr. google. You came to see me every morning before math tests and tutorials not because I’m you’re friend but because you have no drive to learn and thus have no fucking clue what you are doing, so you come to me, and ask me how to do what we are do everything we will be doing in the tutorial. And I know this is the case, because the one fucking time you knew what you were doing (though I would call a 60% “knowing what you are doing”) you didn’t even come say hi. You just stood outside the class room instead of coming to where we usually sat together and hanging out with me. You cannot come to me, use me for what I know, and then disappear and expect me to play along, at least not anymore, fuuuuuuccccckkkkkkk yoooooouuuuu, Furthermore, say goodbye to reading my answers during these tutorials so that you can pass.

I’m doing things for me for once. And it involves kicking you up the ass and out the fucking door.

In summary. I effectively have no one. So I’m making a change. I’ll still have no one. Am I some pariah but I just don’t know?"

She kept on making jokes about it and all of her friends left because they though she was getting annoying. Me and my cousin stayed with her in the party.

lonely,Romantically Poor,"Romantically Poor - Or ""Fakir Asmara"" in my language, is a situation where you are poor, not financially, but romantically.

I always envied someone that can easily get girls to talk to them and even easily get a girlfriend. I'm so romantically poor that even my old and so-called best friend took my ex not even a month of us breaking up.

I have been thinking, why can't I get a girlfriend? I mean I'm surrounded by people that can get one as easy as flipping a bowl full of soup but why can't I? Though, I don't have any contact with some of them anymore.

It feels lonely this couple of years. I wonder if I will end up being alone. Coupled with me being surrounded with people that don't even care about me, its going to be a tough road even looking for a friend.

Since I have a good looking little bro, I don't have to worry about my parents won't see a grand kid in the future. If I ended up in that situation in the future though, I will be a bad son but good yet ugly uncle... I hope.

And by the time I'm old, I will be alone, sitting inside a house that can fit more than 2 people."

Theres nobody who will long to be with me, nobody who will pine for me, and that's unlikely to change. Will be alone until I die."

lonely,Struggling with my singleness,"Struggling with my singleness - Hey guys, I just need to rant. I like keeping myself anon. Lately, I have just been sad and feeling really lonely, romantically. Its just so hard when the people who surround me are getting married, growing their families or going on trips with their SO's. I feel lonely not going on dates, spending time with that special someone, and most importantly, the *lack of time spent being* ***little spoon.*** Since a very young age, I have been a hopeless romantic, and it hurts me to feel like I am not good enough for anybody. It hella hurts my ego. Being single makes me feel like I am not handsome enough, like my personality is trash, idk.. like my hard work in school/work/other life ventures goes unnoticed. I guess I just crave having that PERSON romantically who is a best friend. it is just so cute to me. I always dream about cuddles/traveling/inside jokes/ just being in a relationship with a person that I can GROW with. 

What I don't understand is why I feel like Im not given a fair shot in the dating pool. I go to a four yearUniversity of California, I am ambitious, not only with school, I work and have a job. I am pursuing a music career and a I have 200 thousand streams worldwide with my music. I eventually want to go to grad school and get my masters. I lead a bible study, and I am very intentional with my relationships, often trying to put myself in positions of mentorship to others. I would like to think of myself as caring. I just don't know what I can do different. I am ready to give off my love and receive it also. Im tired of hearing  ""You have to be happy with yourself before you can be in a relationship"" or ""you just have to wait"" or "" it comes when you least expect it"" lol. I feel like if I am too passive with dating then nothing will happen. I am content with myself, but of course it would be nice to pour into someone and get poured into romantically.

So I don't know. It hurts and I get lonely. I often think of what the hell is wrong with me. Is there something wrong with my personality? Am I just not good looking? Am I not enough (even sometimes) These are things that often cross my mind when I think about singleness.   


Sorry yall. just had to get this off my mind. Sorry if I came off prideful, but I just needed to get this off my chest."
lonely,"Just a teeny rant: ""Maybe I shouldn't look for a relationship at the moment..""","Just a teeny rant: ""Maybe I shouldn't look for a relationship at the moment.."" - So I'm 18, a black girl about to go back to community college. (I previously dropped out of my old junior college bc I had a mental breakdown and I was depressed from loneliness yikes)
I'm starting to think maybe I should stop thinking about boys. I took this comment my mother said to me personally.
She said I should work improving myself and my life. Like unrolling in college, getting a job, improving my looks with skin and body care, and honestly...that doesn't sound too bad..
I already have alot of problems when it comes to boys. 
• I think about sex alot and love isn't just sex, it's more that.
• I like personality but I feel like a I put looks on a high scale too. Like I wanted a guy that's good looking and has a good personality. Which I very rare.. not like I'm worthy enough for a good looking anyways
• My type of boys ( lanky toned white, latino, and asian boys) would generally not like me. Knowing me a black girl, men usually dont like black women bc of that dumb stereotype.. ik not everyone is like that but that's rare ngl...
Plus there's the fear of losing my partner in any way. What if they cheat? What if they get bored of me and fall out of love? What if it's not real?
Like idk if I could handle that at this age.
I also struggle with texting I will forget a about a comvo or I'll fall asleep then I'll feel really bad.. 
I cant flirt or talk to ppl on General and I have low self confidence/self esteem so yikes..
So I think I will put thinking and trying to talk to guys on a box on the shelf tbh.
Plus I wanted to lose weight and become more active too so that takes a while."

lonely,Been feeling lonely lately and it got worse,"Been feeling lonely lately and it got worse - New friend turned down my lunch invitation and my lonely feeling came back hard. Any advice?

I(24M) am doing a two-year degree in japan and this semester it has been quite lonely. Im holed up in the lab, I dont live in the dorm anymore, and I have no classes with the other international students. Most of them are short termers (6months to a year). I have made no friends since October, when they arrived.

Two weeks ago I was sitting in a bench in a packed cafe, when a nice (23M) European dude, doing a medicine-internship thingy for four months. I enjoyed the conversation and when I shook his hand before  we parted, I said “was nice talking to you.” Which he replied with “was it?” it a surprised (not rude) voice.

He accepted my fb friend request and I asked if hed like to join me for lunch. He said he has a full day but thanked me for the invite. That was a big step for me, as i think i probably have mild social anxiety. 

Anyways it upsets me how I made a new friend and hes going home soon. When i got turned down i started overthinking, wondering if he was really busy or of if he wasnt interested. Was I the only one who enjoyed the conversation? 

Now I just feel so lonely and pathetic. Any advice on how to get out of this funk?

Thanks

I haven't made connected with anyone in over 6 years now, and it worries me. This, of course, resulted in my being single for that long because I don't know how to talk to people and make new connections. I also have zero motivation to keep in touch with people I already know. Because it's like what the fuck would I even talk with them about. I'm socially broken, and that makes me feel horribly lonely and I have no idea how to fix it. I crave intimacy everyday but of course I'm ugly as fuck and have the social skills of a rock so no girl will ever want to be around me for extended periods of time.

lonely,How to focus on hobbies and interests,"How to focus on hobbies and interests - I have had this problem of being unable to focus on things due to my inability to find romantic love. More specifically, when i try to do things i have enjoyed in the past, such as read a book or play an instrument, i get distracted with either thinking about how much i hate being unlovable or daydreaming about being in a relationship. This is extremely problematic because my main reason for life being worth living is being able to unconditionally enjoy these kinds of activities. My being unlovable is due to being unavoidably ugly so im not looking for advice on how to get into a relationship (not saying that for sympathy, just to describe my situation). 

Has anyone experienced this and/or know any solutions?"

I'm sitting here, crying and crying. The depression feels like it reaches the darkest depths.

And now it's basically time for bed so I don't get to really talk to anyone. I reached out to a couple people, but I guess they were too busy to talk to me. Sucks when there aren't responses.

I feel like I've got nothing going good in my life.

Nothing to look forward to.

I don't even look forward to sleeping. It'll be painful, tossing and turning, trying to stop the tears. I don't want to go to bed feeling so sad."

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."
lonely,It hits hardest when they ask for an emergency contact and you don't have one.,"It hits hardest when they ask for an emergency contact and you don't have one. - No kids. No parents. No siblings. No gf. I'm making it but this is getting old.

I just turned 31 and I'm single. My mother was abusive growing up and eventually stopped taking her medicine and bolted a few years back. My father left when I was younger because he didnt' like my mom . I reached out to him when I was 27 but he didn't want anything to do with me. Turns out he is a homeless, alcoholic, drug addict womanizer. He didn't like me because I "" wasn't rich and didn't have kids."" I make a pretty good salary because I recently started working a government job but it would not be enough for him anyways.



I have chosen not to have kids because mental illness runs in my family and I can't bring a kid into this world that would suffer like I have. I do hold it together tho. I have very little extended family but they arent the best. The only ones I was close to was my grandmother and grandfather on my moms side but my grandad passed away last month. I try to keep close to my congregation but I feel they dont understand me.

I recently had a major health scare an the doctors are trying to work it out to figure out what happened. But sitting in the hospital made me realize I'm so alone. It just sucks sometimes. I have to stay strong but I just had to tell someone."

And we’re not talking like intimate like what they’d be like in bed. Like intimate as in what they’re like with their SO or girlfriend/boyfriend for example. I probably sound crazy lol.

lonely,Can't socially connect with people anymore,"Can't socially connect with people anymore - I'm not technically alone. I have a partner, 3 best friends, and some friends that want to hang out with me but I feel them all slipping away. Because of my behaviour.

I lost my whole family and a year-long friend-group due to being raped by my own partner last year; and although they only know him through me; they chose his side and ended contact with me saying stuff like ""What you say he did is not acceptable and I end every contact with you"".  I live in a small village. He is from anther country. And moved back to that country. But I am shunned now in this village. Only 3 procent of the people I meet daily akwnoledge my excistence; the rest activaly treets me if I'm not even there. I can say hi; they activaly act like they don't see me; which is really awkward in an elevator...

&amp;#x200B;

Even though some people want to connect with me; I often don't have the energy. Daily someone has to remind me how I am a lieing atttention whore and shun me. It makes me afraid to go outside. I also have to cancel plans with my partner/friends due to that. And that causes friends to fade away. I can feel them thinking that I have cancelled so much that they think I have no interest in them :'( 

It's not that I don't trust people anymore. I trust my partner and friends in liking me as compagny. The being shunned for no reason costs me so much energy; I often have to cancel plans. It also keeps me up at night; which results in again have to cancel plans. I want to move; but I can't ATM financially because this also affects my work. I sought help; but help is not working since I am stuck in the same situation. I can seek help; but I will still meet people/new employers that heard through the grapevine that I make up rapes for attention.... 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if someone was in the same situation."
lonely,Being cruel to people is extremely cathartic.,"Being cruel to people is extremely cathartic. - Lonely, friendless freak like the rest of you here. I spent the first 26 years of my life being nice and sweet to everyone but I was still ignored and treated like garbage by everyone. I've come to realize that treating people cruelly is incredibly satisfying. Here are some things I've done so far:

* Put half drank coffee cups in the book return slot
* Torn down posters put up for guitar lessons, lost pets, classes. Try to see if you can find every single one in your neighborhood.
* gave people the completely wrong directions when they asked me.
* someone asked me if I liked their performance (I was at a bar that was doing a talent show), I told her it was very bad and I was surprised she even felt like she was ready to perform at a crowd. The smile dropped from her face immediately. 
* made huge messes at restaurants, complained about how awful the food was and not left any tip. 

Anyone else do shit like this?"
lonely,i'm done,"i'm done - i'm sick of trying with people and having nothing happen. i don't expect anything from random people i just met, but when people make it seem like they wanna be around me and that they actually like me, it hurts realizing that they actually don't. i tried to contact a therapist a couple months ago after being told to set up therapy with someone in their office. after leaving three voicemails and not getting a single response i just gave up. i'm sick of putting in effort to make my life better and trying to improve myself. i feel like maybe i have trauma but i don't know from what, exactly. i can't stand even the thought of being touched by people, especially men. i've never been abused physically by men (as far as i remember) but i have always been mistreated by people, men and women. when i was in middle school i was bullied everyday, online and at school. i tried to get help. i reached out to multiple people, adults who i thought would care. i reached out to people who are supposed to be my family, teachers, i reached out to even the bully's mother and i thought she would do something. i was wrong because she told me there was nothing she could do. i was called a freak a lot but that's the least of it. i was told that when i died they would have a party on my grave. i was given weird looks. i remember hearing people talk about me behind my back. anyway i don't know why i hate being touched so much but i'm repulsed by it with certain people and all men especially. i HATE when men touch me and they always seem to get in my personal space, including men who are probably in their 50s, 60s, or older. i'm so sickened by it. i can barely think about this stuff without feeling extremely angry. an older man who i work with recently pressed his arm against mine and asked me if he was too close or however he worded it. he said it jokingly with a laugh and i kinda laughed uncomfortably and said he was too close. talking about this stuff physically hurts and i feel as if i have a fear of being touched. it might not seem like such a big deal to people but it's a huge deal to me. i've been hurt by so many people even when they didn't seem like they would hurt me. i can't trust anyone. i have lots of boundaries too (not just physical ones, emotional ones too) and maybe people sense that or something and just don't wanna get close to me. i don't know honestly. i'm just sick of trying. i know this post is all over the place and i don't expect anyone to read this or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

i'm just sick of this. i don't see the point in anything. but i'm also sick of being nice. being nice gets you walked all over and i know it from experience. i usually am nice to most people but if they rub me the wrong way or do something i don't like that's it. i've always been mistreated by people so whenever someone does something i don't like i stop being as nice or associating with them in any way. i have so much anger and i know it's an issue i have. anyway that's it i guess

I have just seen the terrifying video of the parkland rampage where you can see corpse. I am a pretty sensitive person and have already seen videos from ISIS because I pressed links. Now I am very disturbed and since I do not have anyone to talk to I must probably solve the problems with myself. I can not stop researching videos because these videos shock me on the one hand but also fascinate me. I think it's blatant how a human life can be wiped out by a shot. I need your help, because I can not get these pictures out of my head and it oppresses me."

I can handle myself daily but the only thing I can’t do is be someone else who can hold me. I just want to find that again. I thought I wanted to be with someone doing the same things as me, (things were just so boring sometimes with my ex) but now I really know that it’s the care that I feed off of. She totally cared for me. I guess maybe I thought she didn’t care about the things that make me happy. Now I’m alone seeking for 2 things I don’t have, compared to the 1 issue I thought I had in the first place."

Hey guys,

I suffer from depression, anxiety, ADHD, and Seasonal affective disorder. This time of year, something that helps me is trying to give back and to show others how we can fight this. For that reason, I am going live tonight on my twitch stream [twitch.tv/spidermojo](https://twitch.tv/spidermojo) in an effort to help people for a couple hours! I would love to share about my depression and my goals and how I am working to get on track with them.

lonely,Honestly I need a hug or something at least,"Honestly I need a hug or something at least - I have depression and right now it's very bad. I have no emotions left and I fell empty inside. When I get home from school I'm lonely all the time, I ask my ""freinds"" in our server on discord if anyone wants to play and no one respond even if I type @everyone which alerts everyone in the server. Idk what to do, I look for other people to play with but Im so socially awkward that I cant barely talk to people I don't know (I'm a gamer if you didn't figure that out yet). This isn't even a big part of why I have depression, this just scratch the surface but I don't feel like talking about that here. If anyone wants to talk with me or something I would really appreciate it. (Sorry for my bad English, I'm from Sweden)"
lonely,Rant,Rant - My days are so long and lonely. Everyone thinks because I’m young and somewhat attractive that I am having the time of my life. Wrong. Complete opposite. I have grown to being used to not speaking for days at a time and have somehow lost the only few people I had left in my life. Having a long day and no one to talk to or something exciting and no one to share with is breaking me. This has been going on for years. Being this lonely is starting to kill me slowly inside. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would even be sad if I didn’t exist
lonely,Just Sad,"Just Sad - I’m just posting here to get some things off of my chest. I don’t feel like I have anyone I can really go to because I’ve vented about this so many times to so many people and it feels like at this point I’ll just be annoying if I talk about it anymore. 

I was seeing this guy for about four months and it ended pretty abruptly a little over a month ago. Trust me, I realize that four months isn’t a long time which is part of why I’m so upset I’m not over it yet. I didn’t think I’d be with this person forever, but I didn’t think it would end so soon. I’ve never been with someone that made me happier. I could 100% be myself around him. I’ve never laughed as much or been as happy as I was when I was with him. Towards the end I could tell he wasn’t as invested in me as I was in him so I broke things off. At first I felt fine, but as more time passes the more I miss things. I don’t think I miss this person as much as I just miss having someone I can completely be myself with. Someone that I can laugh with and share happy, loving moments with. I’m really struggling to move past this one. I just feel so lonely and I want that connection back. I’ve been on dates since, but every time I go out nothing feels the same. The connection I had with him was there from the very first date and I’ve yet to experience that again. I just miss him and I miss feeling happy with someone and falling in love. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you. I know this will pass in time but it’s been a few weeks now and I just feel more and more defeated with each day. Hopefully things will start to look up soon."

I’m so used to having someone to come home to, talk to all the time, I’m just having like a withdrawal, I suppose. I have a couple platonic friends but I just feel like such a huge thing is missing. I know I should be using this time to “find myself” and be comfortable or whatever. But I just miss having comfortability with someone. I hate cooking for one. I hate sleeping alone. I want to just be here and do nothing with someone. This sucks."

My life feels so outa place rn. Yet everything is actually kinda good.
I just feel stuck in one spot, alone. Trying to move onto the things I want and can achieve, but I really want to feel that security again. And that’s the only thing I wanna do is be with them and just love each other. As petty as it is, I just want someone to take care of me rn."
lonely,What should I do now that my creative outlets no longer help me cope with the emptiness?,"What should I do now that my creative outlets no longer help me cope with the emptiness? - I’m a musician. Normally when I feel really alone I will pick up my guitar and put my emotions on the fretboard. For the most part this has been a very helpful way for me to deal with the loneliness and I have created something in the process.  But recently this has only made me feel worse. It’s like there’s no point in writing something because I have nobody to share it with. I only play guitar and haven’t been able to find anybody willing to start a band with me. I’m completely alone. No friends, no nothing. I would give up music if it meant I would have somebody in my life that genuinely cares about me. I’m just so fucking tired of being alone."
lonely,"Even after finding connection, it wasn't what I thought it was.","Even after finding connection, it wasn't what I thought it was. - I remember being constantly alone for all my life up until a few months ago when I found what I *thought* were some genuinely good friends.

However, what I've found from getting all of the things I desired - human contact, attention, friendship - was that it's nothing like I and many others think/thought of it. It all feels so fucking fake still, I felt better when I was able to be alone with my own thoughts and online friends instead.

Am I just a cunt? Most of these people didn't wrong me in any way - I just can't take everything around me feeling forced and fake and ingenuine. Thanks for reading."

Not sure how I got here but hey why not give it a shot? I'm 23 from Europe and currently working full time. I've had relationships before but it never really felt genuine. I don't care where you are from so ldr isn't an issue for me. 

I've always felt a bit out of place with my peers. Probably because I had responsibilities at a young age that I shouldn't have. So I guess that's why I'm here. I'm hoping to find a good loyal and trusting friend and maybe eventually more then that but you can't pick who you fall in love with right? 

When it comes to hobbies I'll list a few down here. We don't have to have them all in common but it will give you an idea!

- Cooking (Expect many pictures)
- Reading (No not ebooks) 
- Listening to podcast ( Sucker for crime and    mysteries)
- play some games on my consoles
- having discussions (like those ones who go on for hours)

Anyway, looking forward to hear from you

Please pm when interested"
lonely,Ever just look back on that one embarrassing moment?,"Ever just look back on that one embarrassing moment? - Throwaway cos family uses reddit.

I'm  and over a year ago I joined a my new school and had the most mortifying moment of my life that crushed my confidence. 

I was already close with some of the people there so I was easily introduced to everyone. I had actually dated someone who was widely considered one of the most attractive girls in the school (no flex). 

As I sat down to have lunch with a large group of about 10 people some dude just immediately said ""this is the guy that dated \[her name\], must've had zero options"" and his neighbour responded with ""pretty sure she only dated him because she felt bad for him"" and an.

No one said anything for a while as I turned into a tomato then returned to normal conversation . I left the group embarrassed and hiding tears. That moment led me down a dark path. I just wish I could look past it.

Is that first thing people think when they see me? Am I that unattractive? 

Really needed to get this off my chest as I can't share these troubles with anyone else. Thanks for reading stranger."
lonely,why do i feel like i should be ashamed of being alone,"why do i feel like i should be ashamed of being alone - whenever people notice how lonely i am, i'm overwhelmed with a feeling of being vulnerable and pathetic, for most people someone my age should be going out with friends and doing dumb things like getting shitfaced at a bar so they always try to reach out to me as if they're trying to get me out of this misery. honestly, it really hurts my pride to have my parents see how isolated i am from the rest of the world.

loneliness sucks, it really does, but i'd much rather be alone than go interact with people i have nothing in common with, who just want to show how compassionate they are because they feel bad for me. it doesn't work like that, and people i actually want to be friends with won't even look at me yet i still can't get myself to that level. i know i'd just be even more lonely if i went along with being associated with people who feel bad for me."
lonely,I don’t want to run out of distractions,"I don’t want to run out of distractions - I just got my dream job and I haven’t cried like I just did right now in years. I cried because I realized that this job did not fill this void I have and that realization kills me because I don’t know what will. It pains me to accept that every moment I spent living is just completely numb and I feel so lonely for not having normal feelings. Like everything I feel is just a watered down version of what I’ve felt before. Brief moments of happiness are always fleeting and just inches away from my fingertips, followed by nothing. Got to look forward to the next thing and distract myself with that.

lonely,I feel incapable of making lasting real life connections,"I feel incapable of making lasting real life connections - Growing up, I've had toxic friendships that lasted throughout most of my school days. 'Friends' that would just use me for food or money and then expect me to just be a silent follower to them. Like a lackey. Due to them, I've basically learned to just sit quiet and not bother interacting because who would listen to me? I'm just the girl that nods and grins, always listening to their problems and pretend mine doesn't exist because it's all about their drama.

Now I'm an adult and working and people occasionally speak to me, trying to get to know me, and I'm too awkward to continue or reciprocate, basically isolating myself from my peers because I'm so used to people not caring what I have to say or if I was even around.

I've made some good online friendships but it's not the same. There are so many days where reading their words on the screen isn't enough. Where their smiley emojis and eagerness to voice chat isn't enough.

I just want an unconditional friendship where I can finally open back up again. Someone I can call and talk to whenever I'm in a depressed mood. Someone willing to go to the movies with me or even just chill on the couch with while we play video games or something. 

I just want something real and not be desperately clinging to my virtual friends, waiting all day and night for their 'Online' light to come on. I can't be selfish like that with them. They have school and work and family. I can't rely on them to temporarily fill my lonely void until they have to go offline again.

But I don't know what I'd do without them and I'm scared of what would happen if something happens and there's no way of knowing. I hate that I need them this much because I have no other friends."
lonely,Fuck I’m lonely,"Fuck I’m lonely - Fuck I’m lonely

I’m a 19 year old girl who has had a couple relationships and gets an okay level of interest, but fuck do I feel unloveable. 

I have PTSD from childhood abuse, which makes me anxious and freaked out sometimes. It’s getting a lot better, but it’ll always be there. My father instilled in me that I’m worthless and that love only comes with verbal and physical abuse and that I was a mistake.

I also have body dysmorphia, so basically I feel super irrationally disgusting in my skin. This was a result of a period of extremely rapid weight gain that had to do with a health issue I have. I pretty much watched my clothes not fit and my face sink in and my body bloat up. I feel very uncomfortable in my skin, sometimes to the point where I feel like never leaving my house, or where I want to pull my hair out and panic. It feels like shit. Before the weight gain I felt attractive, and I’d do anything just to get that confidence back. But instead, I’m stuck in a body I don’t feel correct in.

I find myself getting humiliated a lot. It started in high school after the weight gain, but I get a lot of negative attention just for being both 6’2” and overweight.

The thing is though, I love myself. I am an incredible person, and even though I’m sensitive and a mess low key, I have the biggest heart, and even though it breaks easily, I am at the core, a beautiful person. 

So, I take dating seriously. I am a romantic and I want nothing more than to love. I just feel like I’m never going to find someone anymore. I think that I’m just too much to handle. My last bf made me feel like a huge emotional burden, and I loved him fiercely. I gave him everything and he just loved to knock me down and made me feel like all my insecurities should be insecurities. Dating since him has been rough. I find guys telling me I’m great, but they don’t want a relationship, or some other excuse. I find that I’m decent looking enough to fuck but not to take on dates or see about a romantic connection. Or I’ll meet guys and even though they saw my pics, get super turned off by my appearance. I’m kind of at a loss. I hate to feel like there’s something wrong with me, but I feel just not good enough, it eats at me.

lonely,I'm lonely and venting this using my throwaway account. Hope someone reads this,"I'm lonely and venting this using my throwaway account. Hope someone reads this - I'm 22 years old and lonely. I'm not wealthy and live with my parents. I'm broke and don't have a job. I feel like I'm totally unwanted because I have nothing in my life, I'm tired of being depressed all day. I don't even have my own private room; have not seen an ocean or snow in my life; have not traveled outside my city; never had a road trip ever. It's not that my parents can't afford, it's just that in my family I'm always the one who doesn't get anything that I want. I don't blame them tho they're not financially well stable and I get it. I'm hardworking student and trying to get a job. In my life, I don't have friends or a girlfriend either, I often feel like I'm unwanted and unloved and that my life is just insignificant. My mom curses me that I'll never achieve what I'm dreaming for, my dad just doesn't value me. Am I even that bad? Or what did I do to have such a worse life? I have never ever been loved and admired in my life and this just makes me feel sad. I only imagine and dream of having a rich family and living in luxur; having friends who invite me when they hang out; a girlfriend who actually loves and cares for me and waking up next to her and hug her before I start my day; touching myself while talking to my own imaginary girlfriend. I had a girlfriend who basically just dumped me after 3 years of relationship, just because she was rich and I wasn't. These all made a huge impact in my life which I can't explain, as a result I barely speak at all and stay quiet all day; don't feel hungry; don't go out; don't laugh; don't cry; depressed but can't even cry. I hardly speak more than 20 words in one day. I'm depressed all the time, and always daydream of being with someone who's taking care of me and loving me; a good mother who doesn't get drunk and actually cooks something good for me; have a family dinner together etc.

This guy I went out with, first date was great and he even said he felt a connection. We met again for a second date, I thought we had a great time together. Until it was time to go home. I texted him because he was so quiet he replied and said I didn’t seem to be into him or the whole dating thing.

I was feeling sick and wasn’t as cheery as he would’ve hoped, I guess. But I didn’t really say anything that would’ve make him think that I don’t wanna see him again. We spent the night at my place and we cuddled while watching some shows. 

I was starting to really like him, and now I was dropped just like that. This may sound pathetic but I don’t care, this feels like a breakup. It’s been two days and my heart still feels heavy. I care too much about people, whether they see it or not. Maybe I should be more expressive to let people around me how much I care. I’m going to admit that I can be perceived as a cold person, but I’m trying to change that and it’s a process.

I sent him a message explaining my side and why I might’ve acted that way. He didn’t reply. 
 

I know what is meant for me will not be this confusing and complicated. It’s just that dating for me is exhausting already and I wanna keep my head high and my heart open even though these situations happen all the time, and it cuts deep when you really truly care.

I just need to vent because I have no one to talk to. Thanks for taking the time to read."

lonely,reminiscing,"reminiscing - sometimes i look back to the time i went to elementary school, and can't help but think i'd go back to that time in a heartbeat if i could.
i know i sound like an old man when i'm barely even 18, but i really miss when i used to have nothing to be concerned about besides beating the elite four in pokémon platinum. now i'm ugly as shit, have no friends, never had anyone interested in me, have crippling social anxiety and everybody thinks i'm a weirdo. miss when i used to have that last bit of charisma, miss the small, old school in my hometown, miss my group of friends who have forgotten about me because of the stupid things i've done when i was growing up as a bitter, angry, edgy little shit who desperately tried to hide the inferiority complex i was slowly developing with a fake-tough guy façade. i used to be such a happy and extroverted child, just what went wrong? now i can barely look people in the eye, hide in a corner and live as quietly and away from the spotlight as i can, and people don't like it. they try to take me out of it purely out of shallow compassion, but i don't need that compassion. i just want to find somebody who understands the fucking weirdo i am, and won't just try to involve me in something just because they feel bad for me. i hate how vulnerable loneliness feels like."
lonely,"i never show my interest towards anyone due to my fear of it not being mutual, and it's taking a toll on all my attempts at a social life","i never show my interest towards anyone due to my fear of it not being mutual, and it's taking a toll on all my attempts at a social life - apologies for the very long post, i hope it's still readable enough.

in front of others, i tend to be the stoic, apparently uninterested and very quiet type. quiet to the point it looks like i dislike anyone who tries approaching me. the only way one can get me to say more than two words is striking up a conversation about anything i'm passionate about, and so far only one person has been able to do that. 

he's one of the coolest people i know, and i wished i could be friends with him for a long time. the thing is, he's exactly the same type of introvert as me, so i had to gather up all my courage and made sure he didn't hate me before making the first move. i'm really glad i did, because he turned out to be way less intimidating than he looks. we even hung out a few times, although we're still barely friends due to my crippling social anxiety and feeling like i have to walk on eggshells because of my fear of messing something up. sometimes i really can't tell if he thinks i'm okay or an absolute idiot because sometimes we just don't talk for weeks. 

this time, he didn't say a single word to me since two weeks ago and i don't know why. i was sick during that time, so i had to skip quite a big amount of school days and that contributed to the lack of interaction. at first i thought he was mad at me for whatever stupid things i said (not sure what) but he doesn't seem that mad at me and i'm pretty sure about that. though i still can't figure out how to fix this, considering i have 0 topics to talk about and i only ever speak up if i have important things to say. i was thinking that maybe he thinks i'm avoiding him but then i realized he wouldn't actually care about that. what the hell do i do?"

I’ve only had a few relationships before, all serious and long term. I hadn’t seen anyone in years and a guy I found incredibly physically attractive flirted with me all night, and we ended up sleeping together. It was incredible, raw, passionate. He called me the next day to make sure I got home ok and briefly chat about the night before saying thanks/bye, which I appreciated. He did mention something about catching up again, but it’s been 2 days so I honestly don’t know if he’ll actually follow through. I find it really weird thinking I may never see him again and have no clue who he is. I knew perfectly well what I was getting into and I have no expectations of it becoming anything - but I think the experience of such a stimulating but somewhat hollow night has left me emotionally confused. Maybe I just need tome to process it. Has anyone (M or F) ever felt like this?

lonely,Uproar over my last post,"Uproar over my last post - Recently I made a post about texting response time and I got messages saying I was getting ‘killed with downvotes’ (i don’t see them but if people bring it to my attention then it has to be addressed.). 

The funny part about it is, there’s one focal point I was trying to make. We all have lives, literally everyone gets busy. But if you delay a response to someone with consideration and an actual reason, it helps. A handful of people agreed with me when I said that if we just got a little briefing beforehand, it wouldn’t hurt at all. The ignoring doesn’t hurt us, what essentially eats at us is the incessant wondering as to *why* we were ignored in the first place. My point being that communication is key. I honestly don’t care what people think, if we are friends, you OWE me consideration and respect. And the fact that people think wanting a little assurance is entitlement highlights the very problem we are trying to address. Everything is a repeated cycle and the people in the comments who think their own *friends* aren’t entitled to a response are part of the problem. I don’t care about the downvotes — that post has helped me identify a lot of shitty people. There are people who joined this subreddit just to hate on others, people who aren’t even ‘lonely’ and just literally want to hate on the people here — and I was able to locate them. Win-Win situation. If over 500 people can come together and grieve a probability and even pacify each other in a completely serene environment bereft of judgement and prejudice, my purpose is fulfilled. 

This sub is a safe space. Or, it should be. A few people in the comments of that post were telling those who agreed with me to get lives and hobbies. We’re *lonely* people, that is why we are here. If we had these things you speak of, we wouldn’t be posting on this sub, would we? 

My point is, don’t judge other people here. Especially if you don’t relate to their struggles. There are some comments that were made that made me wonder why the user is even *on* this sub. To beat up lonely people? I don’t get it. 

All I have to say is, communicate. That’s literally all it takes. Be a better person. 

And lastly, if you think that as someone’s friend, you don’t owe them the slightest bit of respect and consideration with your actions. Then I have nothing to say to you. A lot of you seem to think this way, makes me wonder if you would keep the same energy when *you* start getting treated like that. 

I will continue posting my struggles as a loner here and whilst criticism is welcome, I will no longer engage it. This is a safe space, not a courtroom, so don’t judge anyone. We’re all here because we need somebody. And as long as I’m able to reach other people like me and we end up feeling better about ourselves, the incentive will remain. 

To each their own.

lonely,It never ends,"It never ends - Every day, I do my schoolwork and then watch TV.  Because I have nothing else to do.  I have one friend who I consistently talk to, and I'm worried she's getting tired of me, but she's been participating in the conversations, not just giving half-ass replies, so that's good.  I try to keep them 50/50, but sometimes I just have to rant.  I just can't lose her because I'll have no one left...

It isn't fair to her, but after my girlfriend left, my friend and I started talking more, and I fear that I'm kind of filling the void by talking to her more now since I used to talk to my girlfriend throughout the day.  I truly only have platonic intentions, although I will admit that she is very attractive both emotionally and physically, and I would not be opposed to trying to be more than friends if she asked.

I'm Yet to get a driver's license so I can't really go many places. I've watched a couple of my friends relationships fall apart or turn sour in the past month and that just adds to my anxiety. I never had any luck in high school and the few girls who I thought I may have had a chance with have all turned out to be lesbian. Three times my wish of a girl approaching me first has happened and each time has been comedically bad. The first two times was girls with mustaches, and the third time was with a girl who would end up making one of my best friends suicidal and I was too oblivious to notice she was obviously coming onto me.

It hurts. It fucking hurts beyond repair. What am i supposed to do now, with a bleeding hole in my chest and eyes that won't stop crying tears of memories… what am I supposed to do without my best friend. I wasn't enough, he didn't just leave he completely and carelessly replaced me, like I never meant anything to him, like I was nothing, and at this point I too think I am nothing, just a lonely invisible broken man with no hope left. I really loved him more than anyone in this world, I cared so deeply about him and I never upset him, and I always tried with every ounce of my body to make him feel happy, loved, cared for…. But apparently I wasn't enough. I was, and still am, ready to jump in front of a speeding train for him. Without a second thought. I give up. I genuinely genuinely give up. I'm done living. I lost everything. I have no one else. I give up. I'm in so much pain. I can't stop crying. It hurts."

lonely,My home is my prison of solitude.,"My home is my prison of solitude. - I'm tired of living in this boring old house by myself. Well actually I live with a couple of old folks. But it basically is like living alone but with the added ""benefit"" of being pestered on a daily basis by people who ""care"" about you. The silence is deadly and overwhelming me with a hatred for the place I cannot quell anymore! I hate my family (what little I have left of them, anyway), I can't stand the one friend I have who is kind of a sperg, lol. Sometimes I have stupid arguements over and over in my head with the same relative (let's say stepmom) of mine until I go insane with anger. I used to fantasize about doing horrible things to her a lot, which I would never really, do. The worst thing I would ever do to someone would be never to talk to or see them again, honestly. I've just lived with anger my whole life pretty much and I'm burned out. Tired of wondering who I care about is going to die next. 

Tired of feeling like the only people left of my family aren't worth a damn to me anymore and should do the world a favor and join my dead kin. I didn't even go to my uncle's funeral a few months ago because I just don't care about anything anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself by now is simply out of compassion for those who I know will grieve my passing as well, but I'm running the risk of getting to the point of not even giving a fuck about that anymore. Even worse, I sometimes think about how killing myself would be the ultimate slap in the face to them!

I hardly ever go anywhere because I don't know anyone and am too depressed to feel like it's worth it to go anywhere, except for once and a while I'll just hop on my bike and just go somewhere until I get bored and eventually come home. Every time I keep saying to myself ""This'll be the last time I come home."" ""This time I'll just wander off somewhere and go wandering like a tramp."" Sometimes I just go to bars or something similar to have drink so I'll feel relaxed enough to try engaging someone in conversation; anything really. I'll chat with anyone just to feel some human interaction. It's always temporary, though and inevitably like some spell or curse of solitude has been put on me I always end right back where I started. Right back here alone in this room where there is nothing and no one to comfort me. Nothing but the sound of my own thoughts. I wonder if I'll die here one day alone, and will there be anyone left to check if I'm alright?

I don't want to be here anymore. I want out."
lonely,20 years lonely,"20 years lonely - I've had clinical depression since I was 10 years old. I'm 20 now and just started getting medicated a little under 2 years ago. I'm not suicidal anymore which is a big win, but I'm still not happy. I've always been a very introverted person, and the depression really made it worse. I used to think that my depression was making me lonely, but it's obvious now that I need someone. I've never really had a friendship. Sure I was nice to people but I'd never reached out outside of school or work and nobody has reached out to me.  I've never so much as held hands with a guy before. The closest I've come to a romantic encounter is when the guy I had a crush on hugged me from behind for no reason when I was still in school. I'm pretty sure that was on a dare because he and a bunch of other guys were laughing. 
I've just hit the point where I dont know what to do. I'm in a rut. I'm not motivated to do anything other than staying alive. I dont even know how to describe this feeling. I'm terrified that nothing I do in life will matter, but I know that if I just had someone I could hold onto I would feel ok. I'm terrified that I will never be happy. I remember when I first took my medicine and I cried because I felt happy for a few minutes and I had forgotten what that felt like. I've been running on that high for months now but I'm crashing and I haven't felt it since. It's gotten to the point where my dad is trying to get me to find a man. But I moved out to a new town after HS bc he wanted me to live with him and with no motivation I dont have a car or my license. All I do is work, go home, and sleep. It's even gotten hard to cry. Maybe my body has just decided it's pointless."
lonely,The loneliness is getting too unbearable.,"The loneliness is getting too unbearable. - Dear reddit,

I hate seeing couples.

I hate seeing people smiling and holding hands and hugging and being intimate with each other and just living together.

I know how selfish it is, I just can't help but feel envy that these people found someone to love, someone to hold, someone to share kisses and memories and stories and hopes and dreams with

I can't help but feel envy that others have someone to fall asleep next to, and someone to wake up with, and someone to talk to throughout the day, and someone to look forward to seeing when you get home.

Someone to share laughs, memories, struggles, gifts with

Someone you can let your guard down around, with no fear of judgement, and be your true self without holding back a thing.

Someone who sees what you want and wants to help you work towards that. Wants to work towards that with you. No matter what they think about it, sees that you have a goal and turns that into their goal as well.

People keep telling me to get out more, and just do things alone, and spend time reflecting on myself and improving myself, and being the best version of me that I can be.

It's great to do stuff and be out of the house, but it hurts going to all these places I've wanted to visit and explore without being able to share the experience with that special someone that will never be by my side.

It hits differently when your smile turns into tears rolling down your face as the beautiful mountains and forests in the distance turn into another reminder of how you'll never find love, how I'll never find love.

Maybe I'm crazy, but if I'm crazy, then I'm a crazy lonely idiot.

With love,

lonely,Ghosted by a Guy I Really Bonded With Over 7 Months,"Ghosted by a Guy I Really Bonded With Over 7 Months - I haven't really talked about this to anyone and it just feels heavy tonight so I want to talk about it. Sorry for the wall of text.

I don't have a lot of people close to me in my life. I have acquaintances and I think people like me well enough and I like them well enough, but there havent really been any people that I just click with and feel like I can talk about anything with. At the beginning of this year I made an R4R post just saying that I was looking for some sort of connection, friends or whatever, and got a decent amount of responses, but one led to a really close bond that I frankly wasn't even expecting to actually happen when I made the post. We just instantly were able to so easily talk to each other and our personalities meshed so well together and it just felt seamless. Over the 7 months that we got to know each other we really bonded and we quickly fell into a routine where we had long text conversations throughout each day, spoke on the phone every night, and spent most weekends playing games together for somewhere between 5-8 hours most sessions. We became incredibly close and I really felt like I had found someone that I was supposed to find. We never actually met in person because he lived in Europe and I lived in the US, so I was already aware that the likelihood of things working out was probably small and the first few months I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and him to ghost me, just because that's a common experience I have had with any guy I even slightly connected with where they seem to really like you up front and then, for seemingly no reason, decide to never speak to you again one day. This never happened with him and I began to let myself relax and get attached to him because I knew clicking with someone like this was rare for me and I wanted to pursue it and at least try. 

He was a smart guy, 31 years old, stable job, and I just thought he was mature while also being more emotionally intelligent than I had experienced with other people. I was constantly impressed at how open he was and how eager he was to seriously talk out any issues we had and I just thought he was a really good person who I had truly integrated into my life. Not one day went by where we didn't talk.I leaned on him for emotional support at times and he leaned on me and I was so thankful to have him in my life. He often told me how important I was to him and had told me before that he wasn't going anywhere. 

Towards the end of August, he just... stopped speaking to me really. I had graduated college in May and been job searching, and had recently been interviewing for a position that I felt I had a good shot at and he was so supportive of the process and asking me for updates on it and wanting to know all about it/tell him when I knew whether I had gotten the job or not. I thought I was going to get to go through this whole process with him on my side and then one weekend there were a few unanswered texts from me, which hadnt happened before and when I reached out he just told me that he was sorry he dropped off the radar and was dealing with some stuff, which I believed and told him to deal with and not worry about it, focus on himself if he needs a few days or whatever,  He told me he would get something on a specific date out of the way and give me an update. The update never came. I send a couple of short texts just expressing concern over this time and Two weeks later I get:

""Sorry, honestly not been great. I know I'm off the grid but that's the case for everyone- friends and family too. I don't mean that as an excuse but I do want to emphasize that I'm not singling you out and ghosting you. I hope you're doing really well. I apologize for all of this.""

That was the last text he ever intended to send me. I replied to it with concern and asked what was going on, but he never replied back to that, though I could see that he was online many times after that. Finally, end of September I just send him a text saying that I'm really hurt by all of this and that he never even told me properly that he didnt want to speak to me anymore, that I felt tossed to the side with no explanation and he sent me a short formal text just saying he was as forthcoming as he could be and it's not just me, it's everyone. That's the last time I heard from him and I still don't know what happened. 

I just wished that I hadn't have let myself get attached to him like I did. I really clicked with him and cared for him and then all of the sudden it was like he didn't want me in his life anymore. It's been over two months and I'm a little better with it now but I'm still so sad that I just lost that person I bonded so well with and told everything to and I don't even know why I lost them, nor did I get a proper goodbye. I find myself wondering what he's up to, if he went on that trip he had planned, etc. and I felt really sad initially that he had kind of become my pillar and I didn't have him around when I went through this life change recently. I got that job and moved to another state where I don't know anyone and I found out right about the same time that he disappeared so I never got to tell him and him disappearing kind of compounded the loneliness that I feel since I don't have anyone here. I just miss him and I wish he hadn't cut me out like that."

I want so badly to have someone. I’ve never had a boyfriend before, or pretty much any attention from guys I was interested in whatsoever, and I’m way past losing hope. I’m actually done trying. I get my hopes up too quickly and before I know it, my excitement has gone down the drain as yet another guy didn’t reciprocate. The holidays are coming up and I’m dreading them. All my cousins are in relationships, some even married with babies, and I’m single - STILL - and have no idea what to tell people when they ask me why. I’m glad there’s other people around me that are happy but I don’t wanna see it. It just makes me kinda mad and irritated with myself.
My friend always seems to be in a relationship, and she asks me all the time why I “don’t have a boyfriend by now”. She says, “Quit pretending like you can’t get any guy you want!!” But I really genuinely cannot understand how you maintain a connection with one to even get to that point. 

Long story short, I’m going to bed tonight feeling sadder than ever, worthless, alone, and wondering when it will be my turn."

When I was with someone I slept easily in a bed, any bed because they were there. I don’t know what’s wrong with me."
lonely,Going alone.... Again...,"Going alone.... Again... - There's this guy I had been talking to for a while now and I really really liked him. He lived a little far but I didn't care. Every day I saw him made me so happy. I asked him onto a ""date"" to see the new star wars movie with me. He said yes and that was probably the happiest moment of my life. That is until a few days later he stopped texting me consistently and never talked to me again. I tried getting in contact with him but every time he'd just answer pretty much saying

""Oh sorry I've been really busy :\""

Even though I follow him on social media and see his new posts with all him and all his friends. Also keep in mind he'd only send a text once a day so it'd take a week to finish a conversation... I finally just put my foot down and asked him if he's still seeing the movie with me, in which he replied the same thing he always does

""Oh sorry i might be busy"" even though before he seemed so excited to see it so it didn't seem likely that he'd just flake.

Yes I have realized the fact I clearly did something to scare him away, but everytime I ask he insists I did nothing wrong. I don't buy that for a second but whatever I guess.

So besides the fact I'm heart broken I scared away the single coolest guy in the entire world and I don't even know what I did wrong. Now i wasted extra money on a second movie ticket and I have nobody else I can see it with. I don't have any friends and my family members are a bunch of batwings. So I guess I'm going to the movies alone... Again........




On the bright side this movie will probably be so bad that I'll completely forget i was sad"

That’d all be cool if she didn’t show up at my work today. I saw her drive by in her car past my work and park.

lonely,Memoir and feelings from my broken heart (Vent),"Memoir and feelings from my broken heart (Vent) - Good people of this sub, I just want to tell you about a memory that my mind can't let go and the feeling that have been revolving in my insides.
My ex, when she broke up with me, she told me that she felt her youth was wasted on me, that she wanted to experiment and live. I understand the feeling to a degree but I can't help myself, I feel hurt.
I gave my everything; countless sleepless nights, many poems, a good amount of kisses and hugs, all the love in my heart and my every last breath of life in myself to make her happy, to help her not commit suicide and at the end I just wasn't enough for her, I wasn't the girl she feel madly in love with, I was just a boy that she used to fill her void, maybe she loved me for a while (an almost three-year long meanwhile). At least she's happier and alive with a good girl, that's something.
But I can't deny that I was hopelessly in love, head over heels kind of love. I thought that my path was developing my passions through my love and now I feel that I've lost my path and myself with it.
My mind can't stop beating me with that damned phrase as her voice sounds on my head saying it. I can't forget her, her smile, her passions which where similar to mine, and her smile, the true one. I've tried to let her go with my memories of her but they are tied deeply within my soul., maybe because she was my first true friend.
If I want to stay alive maybe I just need to suffer with these thoughs until the time comes, I just hope that I can stay sweet, I don't want to grow bitter. I want to love someone as much as I loved her but I don't want to hurt someone for not being her, for the moment my heart is still hers and I can't do anything about it, neither she can, so I'll just wait.
I just have to live and maybe if I hang long enough on my silver thread somone else, maybe a friend will come, I'll just hold myself as my fingers bleed. I'll try. I wan't to try, I want to stay  here but my body is starting to feel numb, I hope I can stay.
I hope that the moon shines bright tonight, maybe the gaze of it can alliviate a bit of my pain and give my fingers a bit more strenght.
Good luck to anyone else whose heart suffers, my best wishes are for them. I know that this post turned weird, but thanks for reading it, I'll take a stroll under the silver moonlight, I hope  it helps. And my dear lonely souls, I hope for your happiness goodbye for tonight"

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

I have my main core best friends but I'm missing that extra something. I feel really lonely inside, and it's been this way for a couple of years now. But because of this loneliness, I'm getting too attached or clingy on the chances I do speak to girls who I like, because they don't know how much theyre helping me internally. It's happened 3x where I'm forcing them away. I don't know how to combat this and it keeps reoccurring which is worrying. I don't know how to change or improve so I can stop damaging my social life.

lonely,She radiates beauty in every way but her heart and attention belongs to someone else.,"She radiates beauty in every way but her heart and attention belongs to someone else. - Every moment I’ve spent with her this past semester has never been anything less than extraordinary. Everything about her is intoxicating; her smile, her brown eyes (the freckle just to the left of her iris on her right one), her dark brown hair, her beautiful hands, her goofiness, her laugh, her artwork, her kindness to every soul she comes in contact with, her ability to dive deep into conversation and discuss feelings and insecurities without any fear of feeling judged or scrutinized, her ambitions and goals, her openness to life and trying new things, her empathy, her hugs, her perfume, her lips, her style... I could go on.. But her heart belongs to another. I’m sure he’s a great guy or she wouldn’t be with him. I’ve met him. Shook the hand that gets to hold hers. He seems genuine and kind. 

Our art spaces were right next to each other in the studio all semester. We spent countless late nights working on art, introducing each other to new music, sharing techniques and inspiring artists. We connected on so many levels. We’re both divorced. Both have no hard feelings towards our exes, it just simply didn’t work with them. She’s 25. I just turned 33. Both of us had great paying jobs that could’ve easily turned into careers, but our passions for art and the desire to teach it one day led us back to college to finish degrees. 

She invited me to come be another roommate at her house which she owns. (I moved in my parents’ basement to save on rent, but it cost me my social life) She’s talked about how great it’d be to set up creative space in her home so we could create together more often. She’s talked about how her dogs and my dog could live together and we could take them on adventures. I want so badly to take the offer...

But I couldn’t bear the thought of him coming over, then we all say, “goodnight,” as they close her door for the evening as I close mine across the hall, my heart in my stomach.. imagining the intimacy they get to share. I just can’t do it.. I couldn’t handle that. 

I wish I were enough. I long for the beautiful relationship we could share. She’d never feel the way jerks have made her feel in the past. I’d support her through it all, creating together for the rest of our lives. Maybe I’ll have a chance one day. Maybe I won’t. My heart is hers and she doesn’t know it. I fear the end of our beautiful friendship if she knew. So for now, I have to let her go and be lonely, but enjoy the wonderful relationship I have with her in the present. I only wish for her happiness, even if I’m not the one that gets to share it with her.

lonely,23M. Don't know how to express myself,"23M. Don't know how to express myself - I can't be myself because I feel like I don't have a set personality. However I act in public is just however I'm feeling at the moment. Sometimes I envision myself being very social, and sometimes I want to be known as quiet. The sad part is I'm actually quite attractive and in good shape, and when  I'm intoxicated I am genuinely very funny and personable. Even at 23, I'm very nervous talking to women, and have no real experience with casual conversation besides when I'm drunk.


I've never been in a relationship because I don't know how to open up to people, and even if I did, I don't know who I am. I'm 23 and dropped out of college twice, mostly because I just couldn't get comfortable around people consistently.


I know that I can get better, and I know I have it a lot better than many people on here. I'm very hard on myself. I tell myself I don't care what others think of me, but I obviously not only care, but obsess over it.

I've been to therapy before but I didn't really know how to express how I'm feeling. Like I said, I'm aware of all the good things going for me, and I should really take advantage of it.

We hit it off immediately and talked every day about literally everything, from our lives and our depression to stupid memes and jokes. Once we talked for 17 hours straight. We said we'd never get sick of each other. We said we'd meet up one day. Now we're barely talking and can't even get through a conversation without pissing each other off. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, I started talking to a girl from my school. We got super close, super fast. We spent hours talking about our days and sending funny jokes and cute animal photos back and forth. Then I fucked up, did something stupid for a stupid reason and now we're barely talking either.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks ago, I met someone on r/MakeNewFriendsHere. We clicked so well on our very first conversation. I loved it so much. I wanted to know him better, to be good friends, but now he's gone and I don't know what happened. Maybe I did something wrong. Somehow I always do something wrong. If you're somehow reading this, I'm sorry for not messaging you back. I had work to do but I shouldn't have ignored you. I should've been better. Should've been there for you while you were still around. I care about you and I really wish you would come back. I miss you. I'm so fucking sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

What's wrong with me? Why can't I ever keep a friendship for longer than a few years at most? I wonder what it's like to have one of those super close friendships that lasts for years and years, where you tell each other everything and trust each other with your lives.

I split up with the person I was dating for of about 4 and a half year's while it was an ok relationship i knew deep down that i was not being myself but you know when you're like i will be this super guy and just be perfect but in the end you realise this is not you and people around you who are close notice your not happy. But i messed up a relationship in my early 20's now late 20's because I was so stupid to see what was in front of my face at the time. I will never forget this women for as long as I live but i moved on from that but it made me in to a better person. but now I'm back at work and smiling but it's all fake all the time I just smile and do my work and deep down it's just emptiness or people say aww you're always happy always smiling but they have no idea  I love my auntie and uncle pretty much my mother and father to be honest with out them during this time I hate to think of where I would be , but they want me to go round at xmas but I just cant face it being fake and unhappy i get upset that i dont have a family of my own or anything like my brother, everyone at works ask if i have a special women so forth as they seem to think I'm a very cute young man they may say it but i don't feel that way at all and i get it from my family also but now i don't see anyone anymore i got rid my Facebook and other social media and changed my number also i don't go out with my work colleagues anymore even if invited if I'm forced to in a way i go for like half a beer and say I have to go the only people that know the real reason for my leave are HR but now I just go home cook my food eat and sleep which i cant even sleep longer than 3 or 4 hours now as my mind is always reminding me of things or I'm over analysing every aspect of my life  saying what if i did this or that.

lonely,How do I stop obsessing over someone??,"How do I stop obsessing over someone?? -  I've met someone who I really relate to, we have alot of things in common and we talked non stop. Now I can barely get a reply back from them and it's absolutely devastating to me.

I don't have much friends or anyone who texts me at all but I lose all interest in talking to anyone but said person. I really want to talk to them but I feel like a bother having to double text them or ask to hang out.

It got to the point where I know what time they wake up typically and I anxiously wait for them to reply to my message even though I know it won't happen. And it destroys me inside because I know they probably rather talk to someone else. They told me it's fine to spam them if they don't reply but I feel they're just too nice to tell me to f off.

This obviously isn't good for my mental health at all but I don't know what to do. I really like this person and I have literally no one else to talk to. I feel like such a creep and a loser and my mental health is going down the drain more everyday."
lonely,Can anyone relate?,"Can anyone relate? - I moved to another country with my family, I’d say I’m close to them but I crave relationships outside my family. I miss my friends back home and still talk to them but I feel like I can’t relate or connect to them anymore because of time zones and just having different lives now. I feel inadequate whether it be at work or uni, I’m that awkward person who craves meeting new people but shies away from social gatherings. I really feel like I can’t connect with anyone so I don’t approach people. I can’t shake or overcome this feeling of not belonging anywhere outside of my family, and that makes me feel super lonely. Add to this the fact that my siblings are all doing fine with their social lives and tease me about not having friends in the city, I wonder if something is just wrong with me. Even some of my childhood friends living in a separate continent than their families are doing fine so I feel ungrateful for yearning for something outside of my family as if it can’t be enough. So does anyone relate to this? Is there anything that I can do to stop feeling this way? 

Sorry for the rather long post."

Basically it feels like everyone likes me being around but no one actively wants me around. I've moved to a new city just over a year ago and there isn't a single person who's tried to talk to me, including family, I haven't got a horrible family we're just not close. My whole life I've always had my younger brother, we wouldn't talk much but we always understood each other. When we were young we were abused by our older brother which has lead to delayed onset ptsd. Now though I can't speak to my younger brother, he tried to sexually assault my room mate when I brought her for a bbq and i just can't forgive him. I'll be honest this is only the tip of the iceberg, I'm not looking for sympathy just a friend if anyone would like to chat, I'm not the most talkative or even able to think of a response sometimes but I can promise I'll find you more interesting than I can explain."

Everyone else uses me to boost their self-esteem and confidence by throwing insults, making stupid comments about me and the like... I've come to the conclusion that humanity sucks. People suck. They only care about themselves, despite the fact that I do everything I can to help other people, and I never remind people of what I do for them. I was raised better than that, it's just rude. Nobody gives a shit about me... nobody checks in on me, makes sure I'm doing fine. They only care about themselves. I was always told what goes around, comes around... but despite all the good I try to do with community service, helping others when they're down... none of it has come back around to me."
lonely,The monotony of my life.,"The monotony of my life. - Here’s a perspective that sheds light on how isolated I feel. I thank anyone who takes the time to read it. It’ll mean so much to me. 

Here is my daily routine:

My alarm goes off 2 hours before my work shift. I then lay around for 30 minutes and then get up to take a 30-45 minute shower in which I sit down in said shower and look at all my notifications and check the weather (I live in Alaska and I need to know how cold it is to dictate what I wear and if I need to warm up my car). I then spend the rest of the time getting dressed and grab something easy to eat which is usually just lunch meat and a yogurt. I then fill my back pack with a soda, v8 juice, and fruit juice and take a yogurt to go. At work I sit at a desk and check my email for company updates and customers requesting supplies and I play on my phone until I have a customer. My play-on-my-phone time is usually watching YouTube for music and video games and sometimes an inspirational video. I do this for 8 hours and I spread my backpack food over the course of that day. After work I head home, take off my shoes (which are laced shoes that I turned into slip ons) and take off my layers and my pants. I hate wearing socks and prefer to walk around the apartment barefoot with a t shirt and my underwear. If I feel gross I will take another shower otherwise I pour myself a drink like whiskey with coke or a coffee with cream and sugar and then microwave a TV dinner. After that I turn on my tv and check to see if my online friends are on so we can play Destiny 2 together. If not I go to YouTube to see if I haven’t missed anything or to put on a gameplay video of the games I love. If nothing is there then I turn on Netflix to see what I can find. If not there then I rotate to checking if my online friends are on then to YouTube and then to Netflix. I repeat this behavior until it gets late or until I find something I like or if my friends hop on. I then fall asleep and repeat this Monday through Friday as since those are the days I work. On Saturday, I wake up and immediately take a shower for 30-45 minutes and then turn on my PS4 to repeat my game, YouTube, and Netflix trifecta until it’s late or something sticks. On Sunday, I wake up, take my 30-45 minute shower, and get dressed in comfy clothes. I go to the laundry room in my apartment complex and start the wash load. I then set a timer for 45 mins and then I leave the apartment and go grocery shopping and collect my mail for the week and then when I get home I put all my groceries away and then rotate my laundry. I then set a timer for 50 minutes and then turn on my PS4 and repeat my game, youtube, Netflix trifecta until my timer sounds off and then I get my laundry, put it all away or dump it on my bed (depending on my depression and loneliness) and then return to my trifecta until it’s late or I find something I like. And then the week restarts and I repeat the process. 

Some random things that sometimes changes my routine:

On Saturday, if there is a movie I’d like to see in theater I use the Regal app to preorder my ticket and I always buy a matinee. I’d do my normal morning routine as if getting ready to work (wake up two hours before, 30-45 min shower, etc) and then go watch the movie and then return home to proceed with my PS4 trifecta. 

Sometimes if I have a craving I’ll go out to eat once a week (usually on Saturday) and I always go somewhere I never been to. 

This is the blueprint of everyday. Yes in all the in between moments I talk to my coworkers and I talk to waitresses/ waiters and the people who work at the movies. I talk to my online friends when we get a chance. But still I feel completely lonely, isolated, and depressed. I have broken many routines and I done many spontaneous things in my life to reach out and meet people and try to find that one meaningful connection but nothing sticks. I’m 29 now and I’m no different than the old man who has outlived all his friends and family. I feel lonely and no one really cares to get to know me. I just want a real connection and I honestly feel it’s too late for me. I’m not exactly bad looking but I think my problem is that I’m awkward and weird. My face looks unapproachable even if I’m in a great mood. Just a constant resting bitch face for a dude. So my “aura” or “vibe” or the impression I give is that I’m someone who can’t be interrupted even though that is further from the truth. I want to be interrupted. I want my life to change for the better if that means a connection is involved. I just wish I could be seen despite my isolation."

lonely,It’s my birthday today.,"It’s my birthday today. - Hi, I’m 25 today.

Throughout this year I have made a few mistakes that made me lost some people in my life, one of them my ex which I’m very much still in love with.

I look back at circumstances in my life, the current situation, and how I feel. I felt I understood things too late. Be it love, life purposes, what matters.

I’m in my room, alone and not a single person wished me. Quite rightly so, I deserved it. I don’t think I was ever a wonderful person.

The loneliness is unbelievable and sometimes it makes me think if there is any purpose left. I feel extremely detached and as though I have outgrown every single false hopes that my family or internet gives. Like you do feel death isn’t such a bad thing after all if it came early. Since it’s inevitable.

It’s amazing isn’t it, to feel the loneliness, the emptiness yet pain. To embrace it. It’s such sadness but in a beautiful way."
lonely,Another wasted 3 weeks with a Tinder date?!,"Another wasted 3 weeks with a Tinder date?! - Some context: here in my Eastern Europe country, women literally see Tinder as a ""get married"" app.  98%+ of the female accounts you will see over here are along the lines of:

* looking for a relationship
* looking to get married
* I'm NOT going to have sex with you (whatever the hell that means)

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, right?  But it's so crazy difficult, it almost feels like a lottery.  Fitness trainers, doctors, video chatters, lawyers, financial _experts_, etc.  People who I can rarely establish a deeper connection with, as I'm a bit more of a nerdy type, enjoying spending long hours programming or playing video games.  Being 5' 7 doesn't help at all either: here you will get judged a lot harder for it, almost immediately being subconsciously rejected only because of your height (I wonder if they would think the same way if they could notice my dick at the same time they noticed my height!).

So with the last date:  I only started with knowing that she's pretty (looking back, she is better off without writing anything in her profile, actually).  We hit it off in the first days, somehow enjoying talking to each other.  One week passed, we'd messaged each other frantically each day (finding out about each other, jokes, couple memes, etc.).  Then December 1st was closing in, and I proposed I'd drive to her town so we can spend it together.  She was clearly not having it and excused herself for not feeling well and put me off with ""let's meet next Saturday"".  I accepted: maybe she was genuine.  Next Saturday was yesterday and she started ignoring all my texts as I remembered her about it, throughout the whole day.  Made me feel like a complete idiot, I've no words to even describe it.  I stopped messaging her and moved further.  I don't care if she writes back - this is unacceptable.

So yeah, back to square 1 now, but I'm still optimistic.  It's only a matter of time before we find each other and hit it off in the cheesiest way possible.  Every breath that I take will be just for you, as well as every inch of me.  Surprised and disgusted?  Well, don't be.  If you haven't heard of a romantic and horny hard-worker before, you have now.  And it is only death which can stop me from finding you and cherishing your beautiful soul and body for the rest of my life!"

At least I have memories of previous fun filled New Years celebrations, right? But I know it’s going to be the same this New Years, alone again. I’m getting really anxious because I don’t want to celebrate 2020 by myself. I feel like this New Years is even bigger (I guess since it’s bringing in a new decade) therefore I should be celebrating accordingly. I just wish I had someone, anyone, who wanted to celebrate with me. Holidays and loneliness don’t mix."

lonely,Loneliness,"Loneliness - I have never felt this lonely before eventhough I never had really good before and was bullied alot. But since the past summer the feeling of loneliness came. I might have realized when we were playing truth or dare with only truths with my friendgroup. I had asked my ex that if I she had the change to choose me or her current boyfriend, which one she would chosen to date. And she answered her current one. I cried a little. But since the fall and school starting I've felt more and more lonely. I have a lot of friends and I'm quite social but I mostly feel outcast. And it doesnt help that I have had crushes on few guys in our school and everytime I develop a crush they get into a realtionship. That happened like 4 times. So after that both my loneliness has risen and my self-esteem has lowered. Also it feels like everyone is in a relationship and Im not. I have talked about this with few of my friends so they know the situation.

So does anyone have an idea that might work to feel less lonely? (Guy 17, Finland)"

lonely,I don't think my crush will ever return my feelings. Maybe that's okay. Vent/Rant,"I don't think my crush will ever return my feelings. Maybe that's okay. Vent/Rant - My crush is a girl and I am also a girl. She's never really been interested in anyone beyond fictional characters, (she's a bit of an anime/gamer geek). The fictional characters she's interested in though are all guys. There have been a few conversations that gave me some hope that she might be at least somewhat attracted to her gender but it might be wishful thinking. Plus her family is catholic so I'm not sure if they would accept it.

We've been hanging out a lot recently and that fills me with so much happiness that I cry a little bit when I get home. I'm not even sure why exactly it's just a little overwhelming maybe and it feels like to just release some of the emotions I've had to hold on to throughout the day. Of course we just hang out as friends, often in a group but  I grew up without a single friend due to a number of reasons  so honestly having people to spend time with feels really nice. 

I still feel a little lonely even among them sometimes because the friendship doesn't really go beyond memes and what not but I am making an active effort to get closer to my new friends. I sometimes wish I could tell them about some of the stuff I'm going through but I don't know if they would care or if I should burden them with that. They might think I'm too much of a downer and decide to cut me out of the friend group. I don't want to lose them though because I have always wanted friends.

I develop crushes easy. Maybe I just mix up my feelings of appreciating someone's company with romantic feelings? And my sexual feelings are just all over the place in general so naturally it would bleed over to this as well? It's fine because I have a very big bottle that I shove all these feelings into, and only let it spill a little when I'm completely alone. I think writing this even feels more like I'm writing in a journal, since I am just alone under some blankets listening to the rain, it doesn't really feel like I'm sharing something with someone but it also doesn't feel like I'm wasting my breath just talking at nothing. Posting stuff like this is a little therapeutic. I used to post things to vent but I like the way reddit is formatted a little better. 

I will probably never tell my crush how I feel about her, and eventually my feelings will fade and I'll probably focus my romantic attention on someone else and develop a new crush. I'm not really in the right mental state for a relationship right now anyways, I need to work on myself a lot. I think I have found an aesthetic that works for me, and can style my hair and dress in a way that flatters my skinny body but I have no idea what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like. All I have to go off is a series of awful/abusive relationships I have been in and what I have seen with my parents where my mom emotionally and physically abuses my dad, me and my brothers. I made the mistake to center all of my will to live, goals for the future and self worth around one person because I thought that was love, but it was just unhealthy and set me up to be even more devastated when the people I held so highly and basically worshiped turned out to be not very good people. I want to work on making friends, doing well in school, improving in art and music, and moving towards my goal for the future, with or without someone by my side. 

I need to not let myself become so obsessive over one thing or one person because it makes me neglect working on my goals. Even though I'm probably no good for a relationship right now I still want to meet people that could potentially one day be something. I think that's fine? I think that will also help me not get too hung up on somebody that I know will never see me in a romantic light. I want to appreciate them for the good friend they are, but my mind is a little clouded with loneliness and sexual frustration. 

One day I really would like to find somebody to genuinely care for me who I can spend the rest of my days with. That person is probably not going to be my crush. Not giving up entirely on her, but also not going to be putting all my bets on her either."

lonely,Lonely for years and it hurts,"Lonely for years and it hurts - Hello everyone. I'm making my first post on here, since I'm in a struggle for years now. I'm not even twenty and that loneliness is haunting my for years now. It's painful. I'm not even at fault. Just because I still live with my parents, since I'm still pretty young and have no own income yet. Basically I'm not allowed to talk with my friends on discord, like I used to a few years ago. Now I'm just always getting mad at myself whenever I see that my old friends can enjoy all these fun things without me. The worst part is, that I can't form new friendships, because school is a pain and I lack the ability to find time to do things with friends. I'm also scared about getting scolded, whenever I do something like this. 

So at this point I'm almost giving up hope. I'm even ready to end myself any time, since I see no reason in life as is."

Sometimes if we have an argument he would not talk to me for hours or days, that means spending those hours and/or days talking to nobody because he is all I have and he is my only friend.
During weekends my loneliness gets unbrearable. I do feel lonely during week days as well but since I will be mostly at work I sort of think of it less.
The more time passes the worse it gets, all I do is crying. If I try to go out and visit some place it is also quite boring because I have to go everywhere alone.

lonely,Is it ok to be a loner?,"Is it ok to be a loner? - I spend a lot of time to myself and I like it that way. I am constantly busy with activities and clubs as well as a full credit load in college, which is probably why I really value my alone time when I can. However I think I might spend a little too much time to myself. I never go out with friends, I only see them at school or at events for my clubs. I eat all of my meals at school alone. I live in a house with four other roommates and I barely see them. When I come home I go straight to my room and I rarely leave. I feel as though I have a really had time making friends and connecting with people. I actually don’t have any friends in any of my classes, which makes choosing a seat the first day of school and group projects difficult. When new people join my clubs, I feel like I have a really hard time connecting with them. It just takes a lot out of me to be a friend to people as I don’t like to go out or leave my room after a long day of classes, homework, and extracurriculars. 
But with all of this, I feel lonely. I feel like I have no one to talk to. I feel like I keep all of my friends at such a distance that I can’t go to them when I’m feeling down.  If I never make the time and effort to be with them why should they have to listen to my problems on a Saturday night? I feel like I’ve detached from a lot of my close friends and while we still love spending time together when we see each other, I feel like it’s not right for me to tell them how I’m feeling when I’m not emotionally or physically available for them if they were to need something from me. I’ve even stopped posting on social media because I feel like I have detached so much from everyone and I don’t want to bother people with my life. It’s hard to even make this post because I don’t want to draw attention to myself. 
Is this normal? Is it ok for me to be such a loner and spend all my free time to myself? I am really busy with school and extracurriculars which has set me up for a lot of success, like job offers and getting into grad school, so I don’t regret all the things I do, I do often think about what my social life would be like if I didn’t have a full credit load and had evenings and weekends to spend time with friends. Am I a bad friend for not clearing up my schedule to spend more time with the people around me? I’d appreciate any advice I can get. Thank you."
lonely,Idk,Idk - I’ve had friends most of my life but recently it feels like we’re drifting away simply because we don’t have similar interests anymore.

But I don’t wanna be disappointed so I never try. And with the new people I meet at my jobs and stuff I don’t know how to initiate hanging out or getting to know any of them better.

lonely,Where do they sell interaction?,"Where do they sell interaction? - So...I’m unhappy.

I’ve never actually ranted about this entire conundrum to anyone but this sub feels like somewhere I can air it out to people who won’t judge and maybe people who can relate. 

I’m out of high school and I have no friends. Online or IRL. Judging from the title, I’m unhappy. 

In 2018 I graduated from high school and right after that my girlfriend moved to New Jersey and it totally broke me. Considering I had been dating her for two years at that point — and everything we went through as a couple — it shattered my being. I couldn’t even live. Moving on, I met a girl. She seemed perfect, loved comic books, discussing stuff, video games and everything. She turned out to be a narcissist. Now the thing about narcs is that 90% of the time, they are very influential people. I met this girl on Instagram — and I realized she knew almost all my friends from high school. Including my ex-girlfriend. Long story short, our breakup was nasty. We had so many fights, where she would insult me and completely disrespect my way of reasoning and then POST the disagreements which her goons would then agree with her, making me look even more stupid than I already feel — it was terrible.

After that, I was completely... broken. People who have had run-ins with narcs know how this is. I didn’t even know who I was anymore — she made me hate myself. Then I realized she started getting closer to all my friends and was spreading BS about me to them — all the while I was on my own trying to regroup, I didn’t even speak about our split at all. 

Then after that I realize all my friends start to switch up on me. It’s like, they valued the opinions of the popular girl over someone they went to school with for six years, some, a decade and more. 

We text, they leave me on read and just...disappear. I haven’t spoken to anyone of them in almost half a year and it’s crazy that none of them even remember me or try to check up on me. Then there’s the one that told me my dysphoria was irritating and blocked me. 

Basically, all my friends left me because of the narc and as a result of that, I don’t know how to interact with people anymore — most people I text fade away after a week or two. It’s so absurd that at this age, I have absolutely no friendships active, and I’m not even exaggerating. 

I’m really unhappy, ugh."
lonely,I feel lonely when I'm surrounded by people who care about me.,"I feel lonely when I'm surrounded by people who care about me. - A little but of background:
I'm in a friend group of 11 people, but this story only deals with 8. And in our group there are two relationships. The first is between two people we'll call E and A. I'm very close friends with both of them and they are two of my favorite people. The second are J and M. I'm kinda close with J, but she seems to get annoyed by me for being ""judgy""(no one else says this to me), and no one is very close to M(except for J) and that's because he doesn't seem to care a whole lot about the rest of the people in the group.

Now the story:
Tonight, one of my friends, W, asked if anyone wanted to do something tonight. F, S, and I all said we would. J said she would be willing, A said she would be busy until 7, E said he was busy, and M read everything, but said nothing. So F, S, W, J, and I all got together and F, S, W, and I all thought it'd be fun if we went downtown and played music on the street. J didn't want to and said we could go do that and she'll find something else (A said this too, but over text). So The three guys and I all drove downtown and found a spot we thought was good. We were just playing whatever and some people even donated, which was a surprise. I didn't play too much cuz I'm not the best at trombone and I just got my wisdom teeth out last week. We were really getting in the groove until J, M, A, and E all showed up on a double date. J was joking like ""hey play something for us!"" and we had just finished a song, so we were trying to get another. She continued to criticize our set up and how we weren't doing everything (so much for me being the *judgy"" one). E at least came up to me and complained about how he was planning on doing homework but he got roped into the double date, which cleared up why he said that he was busy. 

The whole encounter just irked me the wrong way and I didn't know how to feel. I felt angry that none of them tried to figure out something else for everyone to do together because if felt like they didn't need the four of us that went to play music. I also felt lonely because I get lonely a lot due to the fact that I've never had a serious relationship but nearly half of my friends have. I hate these nights where I go home and I know that the people who I'm friends with are living the life that I want to have, but it feels like I'm doing something wrong or I'm not good enough to deserve that kind of relationship.

I'm also worried that J and M are distancing themselves from the group and that M was only part of the group so he could date J.

I get lonely very easily, even when I'm surrounded by people who love me. It feels worse that when I had no friends at all because now I feel guilty for still feeling this way."

lonely,Birthdays and moldy cake,"Birthdays and moldy cake - Hey hey, I've recently had my birthday and I've done some thinking. I know it may sound strange but it feels like everywhere I look the world is telling me life is short. In TV shows, books, movies, billboards. Its kinda surreal. I've been feeling a bit better lately in the fact that I still don't really have friends but material things have given me more joy than usual. I used to think I was depressed but now I think I'm adjusting to being alone. High School is, as always, torture, but now I think I've been building skin if that makes sense. I'm becoming more confident and of my own person though I still am indeed alone. Which is what I want to really talk about.

&amp;#x200B;

Loneliness- its a strange thing. Our brain suffers from lack of contact with others even if that contact may hurt us in the long run. I think its a bit of a sick joke really. You were born this way or that, and now because of looks or personality you are shunted. I'm not going to lie and say that assholes shouldn't or aren't going to be alone but I am going to speak my mind. Im not a big statistics guy, but from my view people in general are lonely. Even those with siblings or in popular friend/social media groups seem unhappy. Think about it, 30-40 years ago, to quote Austin Powers: ""Love was free in the 60's, baby, yeah!"". And god was he right! Just 40 years ago the fucking military flew out to Woodstock not to drive the hippies out, but to give medicine! And food! To support the cause of friendship and happiness, at the government's expense no less! But now with subreddits like this growing every day I think we are in an epidemic. A disease of loneliness  and it spreads everyday. I think we do it to ourselves, but in that I think we can find happiness. Not just with ourselves, but with others like us who have been forged through pain and hardship. r/lonely now has 92,300 members with more joining everyday in some hope of contact with people who know the pain they have gone through. And I hope to whatever God is up there that we unite. The internet has separated us, turned us into sheep who eat into consumerist bullshit on the daily as we scream for more, more, more. Gluttony and greed is killing us, but there has been improvements. Subreddits like this are growing, medical technology is advancing, and war/political stress is generally at an all time low though it may not seem it. And so I say to all you lonely hearts out thee, Stand Strong! Life is short guys. And I realize I may just be one man screaming into the void but if not, let us stand together. As humans, as people, not the social media-obsessed, gluttonous and insensitive sheep that the world makes us out to be.

In simple words we need real men and woman, and by this we mean: real people. I'm gonna follow the example and I'm  here to talk with ANYONE.

To an extent, I do enjoy my alone time—it’s a chance to decompress after a long day of waiting tables. But that longing for romantic attachment never goes away and the older I get, the more terrified I become that I will actually be alone forever.

I’d say I’m decent looking, a little overweight but still fairly confident, and quite social (though parting/clubbing was never my cup of tea). On paper, there doesn’t seem to be any *significant* reason why I’m not able to find anyone other than having no idea what to say or how to “flirt” when I’m interested in someone so I assume that is the issue (obviously I don’t consider myself otherwise perfect).

How so many people just naturally know what to say just boggles my mind. It feels as if I missed that day of class and everyone has a secret pact to hide the solution from me.

With no romantic or sexual experience, it makes growing as a well-rounded person really challenging because such a large sphere of my life seems to be missing. I know we all walk different paths in this life and thus shouldn’t compare our location on our own path with the location of others on theirs, but this feels so terribly wrong. How can I reasonably expect myself to form realistic relationships with no experience to draw upon? Even such a thought is a deflating endeavor.

lonely,Am I right to feel a bit confused here or i’m just imagining things? Please read below...,"Am I right to feel a bit confused here or i’m just imagining things? Please read below... - This girl and I know each other for a while now, we get on well in real life but on the internet she would ignore my texts, even though I only ever asked her about assignments and stuff regarding college. Anyways I managed to get her number (asked her irl) and sent her a text about class which again she would ignore. 

After a while I felt a bit disrespected and would completely blank her in real life when we see each other. You can tell she would look my way to say hi but I wouldn’t even give her eye contact. This continued for a few days, and one other time I felt like I overdid it because we were talking in a group and I was flirting with everyone in the room (mostly girls) without acknowledging her, and you can tell she was visibly upset. I felt bad, so the next day I greeted her and sent her a message saying that this is our last year in college and I don’t want you to have a bad impression of me, I wanted us to be talking and become friends etc. This time she called me on the phone and was really nice to me, saying that the reason she wouldn’t respond to me or any other guy she knows in college over text was that she has a boyfriend. I made sure I was understanding and told her no problem and that I would delete her number. All was over on a good note, right? 

Well to my surprise she texted me out of nowhere a few days ago telling me that i’m a great person and that if I need anything for classes etc she would have no problem replying. All this after a few weeks ago we supposedly cleared the air and everything was cool and especially after she wouldn’t respond to my texts about class previously. Why would she suddenly be so open now? 

Don’t worry i’m not deluded, she most likely hasn’t broken up with her bf and I haven’t even re-saved her number, but I asked a female friend and she told me that maybe she told her boyfriend and he was okay with us texting about class, which I find confusing. Why would he be suddenly be okay with her having my number and asking about class if he literally isn’t okay with anyone talking to her over text? I mean if he was initially worried that I would start the convo with questions about class and escalate from there, why would he stop worrying now? It’s just a strange situation imo. What do you think?"

I participated last year because my high school friend visited me. But this year I couldn't invite anyone to visit me. 

I literally bought a super cool sweater and did my makeup and bought more alcohol yesterday to just cry in my room because no one's invited me to join them and no one I've asked to join has responded as per usual, so here I am alone. 

I literally don't know how much of this loneliness I can take anymore. And a special fuck you to all who told me I'd be an idiot for transferring colleges just for a better social life, because it's days like this when I'm depressed as fuck because it's not financially viable for me to transfer.

I feel like making new friends is impossible ahd that nobody is out to be friends with someone like me.

And you know what? I think im ok with that. If no one wants to be around me or talk to me, then fuck em. They dont deserve my time anyway. In fact, if nobody wants me anymore, then whats the point of trying?

I want to completley dissapear from this earth. Im planning on faking my own death. Then, i will get a motorcylce and travel the United States or hell even the world without anyone else bothering me, telling me what to do, and telling me how to live my life. And if I die of hunger, thirst, or other ailments in my journey, then nobody will care when Im gone. That is how I want to live my life for now on. Its not about a long, sucessful life for me.

I don’t know why, I might be a bit clingy but I am generally just unintrusive. Sending a text has become a nerve wracking experience as I sit contemplating what I think I said wrong or some stupid thing I said two weeks ago. This is the third time this year, someone I honestly thought was my friend, just straight up avoids me and ghosts me. I thought they were all kind people but maybe not. 

Am I doing something wrong!? It’s just so fucking difficult, here I am trying to build a social life from nothing, with my blood, sweat, and tears and what do I get from it!? I have no idea what I’m doing wrong, I have no idea what the hell I’m doing at all!! I’m so sick of thinking it’s my fault, contemplating everything that is wrong with me. How does this come naturally to people!? How do people have so many close friends, and relationships!? I’m not exaggerating when I say I literally find nothing else as hard, as communication, and maintaining a social life. I’m in university, getting good grades, I’m not very shy, I smile a lot, I exercise a healthy amount, etc etc. But for the love of god, I have no clue how to get a friend...

Please, if you don’t want to talk with someone, just be honest, don’t be rude, but you have no idea how being just totally ghosted feels, it’s awful."
lonely,A little everything about my life,"A little everything about my life - (i'm not a native english speaker, sorry in advance for any horrorgraphy mistakes)

I'm a 28 year old male, graduated medic, even kinda good-looking, but lonely AF practically all of my life.

Since I can remember (6 - 8 year old) I've never had any significant friends, when I was at elementary I basically always was alone, I can remember that when I was at home and the phone ringed I've always run to answer hoping being some school partner to invite me to his home or whatever, never happened.

At mid school same thing, just add some bullying to my person. When there were ""team works"" I'll end up most of the time alone cause no one wanted me in their team, if there was a ""party"" or something similar I never was invited at all.

At high school I actually got some good friends that took me into consideration and always invited to hang out and so, to this moment, the high school has been the happiest moment of my life, but as soon as it ended and we all went to university and I being the only one who went to med school, we all took different paths and I and quickly went back to the same isolation.

I could never make a single true friend in all of my years of career, everyone had so much fun, hangin out, getting laid, had some boyfriend/girlfriend, I didn't.

Since a few years my days consist of the same routine: wake up, go to work, go back home, stare at my computer screen, sleep, repeat. No one ever invites me anywhere, I do invite some people from time to time, but I know it's gonna be a negative answer or I end up being ignored, but hey, at least I try.

I want to kill myself since about 10 years, but the only reason stopping me is my mother, the only person that truly cares for me and the only person that I truly care for, if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't even mind having a phone since basically she is the only person to text me or call me, she often asks me why I don’t go out or have a girlfriend, I always say to her that I just like to be alone (I don’t want her to know that I have no friends at all and not a single women wants nothing to do with me).

The only things that used to give me some joy were my hobbies: playing videogames, reading books and my growing collection of manga, but not anymore, I just keep doing them to kill time, not because I actually enjoy it.

I’m in a point of my life that I just can’t feel anything anymore, not even sadness, frustration or despair, I’m kind of a robot, doing everything in automatic, waiting for the moment that I just stop working.

I have thought of going to a psychologist but I don’t think it will help anything, I’m a sociable person and people tell me that I’m ""cool"" and so, but even so no one want to interact with me, so I don’t see how it'll help me get friends which is my base problem, what am I supposed to do?"

lonely,How to survive being alone?,"How to survive being alone? - I found this sub not even 5 minutes ago, but I assume there are people here who are like-minded, so I'm asking for opinions. I will start with some background on myself and my life;

I grew up being bullied constantly, and as a consequence of that I became spiteful towards humanity as a whole. I refused to speak to almost anyone, and whenever somebody said something to me my first thought would be ""Oh, these morons again..."". The truth was I was hiding my inferiority complex behind this anger and hatred, trying to avoid facing my greatest fear; social interaction.

Fast forward to high school, and I was the happiest I have ever been. I liked everyone here and I was a little bit popular in my age group, and I got along with almost everyone. I finally felt like I had poeple to speak to on more personal matters, and I was contempt with my life, for the first and last time.

Now, all my friendships seem to be very temporary. Almost always, I, trying to be myself, or somebody else, trying to start s***, will break off these relationships. I know that this is because I didnt make friends at a younger age, and so I have nobody who has been through the thick of it with me, but it still hurts to see someone tell lies about me, or stir up discontent beetween me and those who I consider to be my friends. Recently, my friendship with a person ended very abruptly after I commented on one of their posts that they were beautiful, and that person said that I am wierd, and that I should ""fuck off"". I was shocked to read this, I dont see anything wrong with what I did, but then again I'm not caught up with social standards, perhaps it was wierd.

In any case, I have chosen to stop trying to make friends, knowing I will lose them. It is from this decision that my question stems; how do I become enough for myself? How can I go throgh life alone? There must be somebody out here that has achieved blissful loneliness, someone who has accepted their conditions and moved on to achieve things in life. I am asking that person to help me if they can."
lonely,"just rambling, I hate the holidays because I'm alway alone","just rambling, I hate the holidays because I'm alway alone - For context, I've (22F) been struggling with BPD + generalised mood disorder for about a decade now. I've always been surrounded by people, I was pretty popular in school and university, but I've never been anyone's first priority. I just lost my 2 good friends. The person who I'm really closest with is my boyfriend. A few months ago I made a friend and we confided to each other over a couple drinks that we've both been very lonely and we feel like we bonded with each other very quickly, we even consider each other our best friend now.

Even with my boyfriend and my one (new) best friend, I feel very lost and empty. I try to not get too clingy to people in my life while at the same time fearing abandonment because of my distance I keep between myself and others.

I have never kept a good friend for longer than maybe 3 years. I really want to keep this new friend in my life so I don't just have my boyfriend, but I feel like I'm walking on eggshells because of how anxious I am after my 2 other friends just abandoned me.

I don't have anywhere I'm really going with this. But I do have this festering dread building up about the holidays approaching. It's always 2 weeks of being completely alone. Everyone goes home to their families, and I have no one. I get very very very depressed every year around this time because I'm submitted to watching the people I know  enjoy their time with family while I sit alone in my room and watch the time slowly go by.

Anyway, if you also get lonely around the holidays, I'm sorry. Because I know how horrible and long it feels"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 34M. I have been feeling isolated lately. I had a great job that some would dream of but I recently quit because it felt like it was eating my soul away. I went back to college to pursue another degree/career but lately, I have really been feeling really lonely. Maybe one reason is I haven't had a GF in 10 years or so?? I was completely okay being by myself for a while trying to figure myself out. I've tried online dating but to no avail. Apparently, I'm not photogenic enough. I'm not sure if not having someone to share my life with is my main source of loneliness or having the wrong career.

 I go to the gym every day and I run quite a bit so I can get my mind off the loneliness. I'm in great shape. However, I can't stop to think that my world is pretty lonely. I have a few friends that I hang out with and have a very supportive family that I can depend on but I still feel isolated from everyone. Does anyone have any experience similar to this?

I think of times where I actually had friends. Everyone I know is mentally fine, they’re not lonely, they have a dog, or anything - just one friend to talk to online. I have no one, I just want someone to care. I’ve tried to talk to so many old friends and even new people, none seem to care and end the conversations.

lonely,"Isn’t it like, real hard to be a man ?","Isn’t it like, real hard to be a man ? - I’m not gonna pretend we have it harder than women but I feel the particular difficulties we face as men are rarely brought up. 

We have to be confident, showing our emotions is a sign of weakness. We have to stay strong in the face of rejection. We’re taught to suppress our emotional pain even though we feel it just as much as women do. 
Women may be biologically built to be more social so that helps them as they grow strong links with their friends as teenagers, based on oral communication, but still, conditioning is huge in that regard. 
If we’re depressed we just need to suck it up and we don’t have as much support as women do. 

As a man, nobody cares about you. You have to earn people’s interest and respect through your actions, whereas women have an intrinsic social value. We are made to believe we’re disposable and worth only what we do. 
Most of the time nobody gives us compliments or show any desire towards us. 
Oh and we’re supposed to know how to fight or run the risk to lose the respect of both sexes if the situation arises. 

It’s ok for women to treat us like shit in the dating scene. Women will laugh at men, ignore them etc just for asking them out. Probably considering that it must be easy for us to do so. And we’re in general treated with much less kindness than women. It takes a huge amount of courage for an average man to date. And dating apps are the most depressing thing for us.  

We pretty much go through life unnoticed. 
We have to live up to high expectations. 
Women often make us out to be sleazy and gratuitous (in my experience women talk about sex just as much if not more than we do). We fear being creep-shamed, or worse, need to be extra careful around children. We also often worry about appearing threatening or making women feel uncomfortable. 

Please don’t get me wrong, I love women and I’m not saying they don’t have their own shit to deal with : financial inequality, name calling, slut-shaming, being patronized, molested, over sexualisation, body image issues (which is something that we, too have to face) and general misogyny. But what I’m saying is that women, even the most pro-equality, don’t grasp how little society in general cares about the average man. You sometimes make us feel we’re so privileged and in some areas we definitely are but please open your eyes to our reality. You may be objectified for sex but we are objectified for our utility. 

I post here because more and more I feel that being a man plays a major role (maybe even seminal) in my almost life long depression and that men (in a very general sense, obviously there are exceptions) experience a unique level of loneliness. 

I’m not saying all that out of bitterness and resentment for being ugly or invisible to women,  on the contrary I’ve often been told I’m handsome and they seem to appreciate my company but I do suck at approaching them as I guess deep down I’m terrified by them as I’ve always put them on a pedestal and felt insecure and inadequate as a man. so yeah, I’m extremely emotionally and sexually frustrated. 

Sorry for the rant and the possibly bad English. I just feel like screaming and crying and fuck my life."

lonely,Just another post about being lonely (and sad),"Just another post about being lonely (and sad) - I feel like I’m always the one taking the initiative to talk to my friends. The only time people message me is if they need something from me. And I’m so starved of attention from others I almost always comply with them. 

Every Friday and Saturday night I sit bored as shit in my house. Hmm I wonder what my friends are doing??. I open Snapchat to see if people are doing something. And what do you know, 4 of my friends are all together somewhere. They invite me to events and parties just enough so I still stay around. It hurts because I use to be invited to everything people did, and often had to reject parties and events because I was too busy. Now I take every opportunity I can to hang around others outside of uni.  I just wish I knew what I did wrong that pushed me away from everyone. I keep telling myself I’m fine to try and stay positive. I never realised the extent of my alienation from my friends until my mum asked me “why don’t you go out anymore. You use to be out all the time. Now you only leave the house for uni”. 

I just finished my uni exams and I have 2 and a half months of holidays. Idk what I’m going to do.  My friends planned overseas trips. They only invited me when another person had to cancel, but by then it was too late to book plane tickets. 

It’s strange to me. They act completely normal when I’m around them; Like we are close friends. But it’s like they forget who I am once I leave. Do they hate me? Idk it could be true or it’s just some inner anxiety that’s built up in me.  

I don’t even have the support of my own family. I feel alone even around my own family.  I feel different from my own family. It just feels like there’s nobody I can really talk to. My best friend from high school is probably the closest person I have. We have deep convos late at night about life. We both have a pretty rough family situation and can relate emotionally on a lot of levels. But he never messages me just to ask how I’m going. I usually do about once a week and send him memes and jokes we both find funny. 

I wonder what would happen if I disappeared or died all of a sudden. Would people care. Cause it sure as hell seems like I haven’t made a single dent in anyone’s lives except my parents. My death would just be a financial burden. I don’t like to sound nihilistic but sometimes my mind just falls into that natural state where nothing in this world means anything to me. 

It doesn’t help that I lost my job from no fault of my own. Then in search for an internship which I was told by HR I was guaranteed, I was rejected last minute by the VP of the firm because it requires ‘too much paperwork’. And now I can’t even get a Christmas casual retail job over Nov-Jan because all the applications are closed by now. My uni marks are slipping  despite me putting in more effort each term. I went to a counsellor and was told “maybe you just aren’t good enough” after a 2 month wait list. I don’t even know what to do anymore."
lonely,This has been one of the worst weeks of my life. My wheels are spinning and everyone I know is moving forward.,"This has been one of the worst weeks of my life. My wheels are spinning and everyone I know is moving forward. - Little background. 

I’m 36.  I’ve been divorced for 5 years.  My ex wife has been my only real relationship. She was emotionally abusive the entire time and destroyed my already low self esteem.  

I’ve been largely ignored and rejected by women my whole life.  They love being friends with me. They don’t want to date me. 

So. I’ve been single for 5 years. Haven’t had more than a 2nd date in about 2 years. 

So far this year. My best friend got married, my other best friend has his first child Sith his wife. Another close friend bought a house with his wife and child.  My ex wife had her first child.  I found out two days ago, another friend is now expecting with his wife.   None of these people have any time for their sad, single friend with their new lives and families. 

I just injured myself two weeks ago, so I’m in a sling for weeks.  I was getting into better shape. But that’s now out the window because of my shoulder injury. 

My landlord is selling my apartment and gave me 30 days notice to vacate.

I don’t have a new apartment lined up yet (i have applied for one.  Just waiting now)

I’m sad, alone, hurt, profoundly lonely and i don’t even know where I’ll be living next month.  

I’m also having some financial and business issues.  

Essentially. Everyone i know is flourishing while my life is crumbling around me."

It was like she was the reflection of my mind. I don't remember being this much excited to go to school. I was so happy that i even thought this wouldn't last long. That's what happened. It didn't last long. She moved away to a different city. It's like 200 miles from where i live. We still text. But i wish i could see her. I last saw her in September,  when she came back for some work. She is my only friend. I'm afraid, one day she'll stop texting me too. I hope she doesn't forget our times together. I wish i didn’t miss her so much"

lonely,Funny Revelation After Watching The Good Place,"Funny Revelation After Watching The Good Place - Spoilers ahead, everyone! Also, I haven’t watched season 3 yet, so please use tags if you spoil it in the comments.


So, there’s this recurring bit where &gt;! Eleanor trues really hard to be a good person, and she changes over time, eventually getting over much of her selfishness and misanthropy. She has repeated setbacks, but she makes progress. !&lt;

After watching the show and thinking about how lonely and shitty my life has been for the past while I realized something: Eleanor’s situation isn’t perfectly analogous to mine.

Because I’m not trying to learn to be a good person, I’m trying to learn to be a *person*. 

I can’t connect with people on a deeper level at all. The surface stuff is fine, but the next step is just missing. For reference, I have only had one SO, and she’s literally on meds for her psychotic behavior now. I’ve been part of one good friend group, and they had a safe word for when I was misreading social situations. 

What kind of freak would want or need classes on how to read a weird look a friend just gave you or on whether or not that girl who paid a scrap of attention to you is interested? Me. I’m that freak.

And I literally cannot talk about this to anyone else, or I will become lonelier still. Reaching all time lows, going boldly where no loner has gone before. How do you tell someone you don’t know how to be a human being?

lonely,Rejected twice this week and spending Christmas alone again this year.,Rejected twice this week and spending Christmas alone again this year. - What can I say? I’m feeling really inadequate these days. Just when I though things were going good with a guy he ghosted me after three dates. Today found out another guy who was a long time crush finally moved on with his life and has a girlfriend now.  Feeling low. When asked by a customer at work if I had anything to look forward to this next year I sadly couldn’t think of a single thing. Don’t know if I’ll have enough energy to even have a solo Christmas or if I’ll just bury myself in my sheets and sleep all day. I haven’t had a Christmas with other people in years. Still hurts having another one alone again.
lonely,I just don't understand why I can't find anyone,"I just don't understand why I can't find anyone - I'm a very closed off person--normally. I decided that I want to become intimate with someone and open myself up. Everytime I've opened up in the past I have ended up hurt by it. I don't have any truly intimate relationships/friendships and most of my interactions are very surfaced level. The only instances of true intimacy that I have felt were felt during sex.

I had started talking to a girl that I have known for a few years who I knew found me attractive and we were close enough to have emotional conversations. It only made sense to try and pursue a relationship with her. She would be close to me and then not, cycling through these stages. Most recently she had been very close to me and I created a bond with her that I haven't felt in years. And then she pulled away, but hard. 

I opened myself up to her and allowed myself to be ""real"" with her. I feel so broken by it and I hate it. At this point it isn't even about her, I feel as though everytime I become attached to a girl she pulls away from me. It seems that each girl who abandons me does so with a callous disregard for my existence. Sort of as if I was never a factor in their happiness. I don't know what I'm doing wrong and it hurts, I feel so bad about it. 

I know that women tend to find me very attractive, I've been described as sweet, and most people think I am funny. Abandoning all my humility, I feel that I am pretty damn close to the ideal guy. Sure, I have my problems too, but not to the extent that I feel like I am not worth dating. I just don't want to be alone. 

I feel used and rejected. I don't even know what I want to hear from you guys. I just want to feel better."
lonely,I've decided to not to talk to anyone anymore,"I've decided to not to talk to anyone anymore - Unless I really have to (in school for example). I can't talk to people without feeling uncomfortable. Talking to people (even online) makes me feel bad. I feel like they hate me and when I ask them if they do, they say they don't but I'm pretty sure they're lying. 

I haven't had any friends for a while now. It made me really sad at first but I got used to it and now I can't even image myself hanging out with other people. It's better that I'm alone. I can't hurt anyone and I can't be hurt by anyone. 

I've started to leave people just because I'm afraid I'll hurt them or they're gonna leave me. People replace me easily. I'm not important to anyone and no one is afraid of losing me. It hurts to know that I need them so much but they don't need me. 

My ex friends ruined my self-esteem and that's why I haven't made any new friends. I'm too afraid to talk to anyone because I'm scared they find me annoying. I've tried to socialize but I just have to accept the fact that I was meant to be alone. 

There has to be something wrong with me because if there wasn't, I would have friends. People would want to talk to me and they would notice I exist. I don't think my ex friends lied to me. They were honest and let me see how bad person I am. I'm not someone people want to talk to. I'm not someone they want to be friends with. I'm someone they try to avoid. 

I've learned that when people say they don't hate me, they don't really mean it. They really hate me but they think it's better I don't know that. When they say I'm not bothering me they just want me to go away. They say they're there for me but I'm just a burden. 

That's why I won't talk to anyone. I'm not even sure how long I'm going to keep going. I have no reason to make friends when I might end my life soon. I just wish my ex friends knew how much they hurt me and how much it would affect me in the future. But I don't blame them because they didn't know. I never told them how much they hurt me."

lonely,"I miss my old friends, but not my old life.","I miss my old friends, but not my old life. - I’ve had a hellish first quarter.

My first best friend started to have feelings for me, didn’t feel like coming out, and abandoned all contact. Now she blasts rainbow makeup and pro gay slogans like she’s been hired by leprechauns for advertising. I miss her a lot, and I loved her to pieces, but now... I just... can’t. She’s MLM-hun type and it just rubs me the wrong way.

My second best friend assaulted me at a party once, and took a long little trip down boozy drugsville. He also held me down and taped a mask over my head and blew smoke into the mask when I didn’t want to smoke weed. I... honestly would have rather been assaulted again. I couldn’t hate him more, but I miss “8yo him”.

My third best friend is the father of my child. There are times when I miss him so fucking much, I’ll call him up when she’s having a nap for bullshit reasons. Like... college homework. And he plays the guitar for me to just keep me company. Mind you, I can barely get ahold of him to talk to our daughter, let alone just me. It really hurts. We had a crappy relationship, and a bad falling out near the birth of our child. A part of me hates him... but I love him too. It makes me cry to think about him.

My best friend now is my current partner. I love him to the absolute moon and back. He can be a dickhead too, but he’s still an amazing person. But... he’s my only friend now, and that’s unhealthy. I feel the need to distance from him BECAUSE he’s my only friend, but I feel like that would hurt more than it would help.

When people say nice things to me, it makes me want to cry. I had an acquaintance today tell me “she’s always loved who I am”. I cried for half an hour, because I had no idea people even KNEW me, let alone loved me outside of my partner. But all I know is that we worked at a Dairy ... Shake when we were teenagers. She knew me when I was happier. Nicer. Naive. Not a jaded, depressed, lonely woman crying on the couch because someone said “hey. You’re adorable, and awesome, and I like you as a person.”"
lonely,My Thoughts on Loneliness and Natural Selection,"My Thoughts on Loneliness and Natural Selection - In case you're not familiar with natural selection, the basic principle is this: the more successful you are in your environment, the more likely you are to survive and pass on your gene by reproducing. This increases the frequency of ""positive"" traits and decreases the frequency of ""negative"" traits in the population. 

I have been thinking about how this may apply to my life. I feel lonely due to my lack of social connections with others. Or rather, I am not as connected as I would like to be. I have no friends who I can see in person and I have never dated or been in a relationship. This makes me frustrated and sad because I want to think that I deserve to have the ""normal"" social lives that many other people seem to have. You know, having friends who they can talk to about common interests and frustrations. Having some kind of dating success like a high school or college boyfriend/girlfriend. And then of course getting married and starting a family. It's not some privilege reserved for the elite. It's common and very widespread. You don't need to be super smart, good looking, or incredibly nice and selfless to do it. Otherwise it would not be very common.

But then when I think about this in the context of natural selection, maybe it is not a bad thing. I mean if I die alone, without ever raising children, then my socially unsuccessful genes won't be passed on. I won't be polluting future generations with my genetic garbage. I would just be getting what I deserve because I am simply not appealing or not good enough for other people. I guess it won't be so terrible if I let my negative traits pass away with me. My brother has a longtime girlfriend and some good friends in his life. He will probably continue my family lineage. Maybe I just had bad luck with the genetic lottery. Perhaps all of the rejection I have received in my life is a good thing because society doesn't want people like me to populate the world in the future. That's not to say that I can't enjoy my life and do good things in my lifetime, but maybe I should stop deceiving myself with the idea that someone could fall in love with me and would want to have kids with me. But these are simply my thoughts about myself. I think Social Darwinism is heartless and don't believe that others should be treated like that by society. But I think that I deserve it because I can' t demand that I be treated with compassion and understanding in spite of my shortcomings. I don't know, I have been going through kind of a rough time lately.

If you have no friends and/or no significant other, I am not suggesting that you don't deserve to have a full and happy life. You should go try to form those meaningful connections you desire and you might just succeed! You never know when you might meet the right person who will accept and appreciate you for who you are. This contradicts with what I have been rambling about, but maybe I am so disillusioned with my failures that I can't view my own life with that kind of optimism."

I asked if she wanted to get food sometime, she said sure but it’d have to wait until January “school, family she said” which I’m really not worried about but idk :( maybe I’m just so lonely that the thought of company with a girl that literally has the most amazing smile and eyes is just really nice to envision.

At first I would make jokes about killing myself, then that lead to thinking about not existing anymore, and so on and so on... now I’m at a place where I can actually do it. I don’t have anything anymore. I can barely remember things now, think properly, or enjoy things, not even my interests. My health is gone and I can no longer function because of it. I never had a family, they’re a huge cause as to why I feel so bad now. I’ve never had genuine friends, only surface level friendships. I’ve loved people but after being hurt so many times I’ve realized that love isn’t real. I don’t think it’s possible for me to be able to form real human connections. Maybe that would explain the lack of friends I have in my life. But the most important thing I lost was hope and once you lose that it’s game over. I have no hope life can get better for me anymore and I won’t let myself suffer anymore by believing in such delusions. I’m just waiting until I have everything and for the right timing so I can successfully die in peace.

All I do is study at the library and hang out by myself when I want to eat. The only interactions I had are the ones in my lecture and are because people want the answers so they can get full credit. I have a nice features(I’m not unattractive at all), am super nice and hard working. I just want someone to care. Someone I can hang out with. Not necessarily a boyfriend, just a friend. I didn’t even had my first kiss because I was bullied my whole life. I’m so desperate that I get excited when a guy talks to me even if it is to take my homework answers or to understand a concept he doesn’t get. I think the only thing keeping me alive is the dream of going to med school and becoming a psychiatrist to help other people who are struggling  with mental health."
lonely,"It’s been a week, but it doesn’t feel like it.","It’s been a week, but it doesn’t feel like it. - It’s been a week since I’ve talked to her about everything, but it doesn’t feel like a week. It feels so much longer. We used to talk everyday, but now it’s just been super lonely. My friends have all been tryna be there for me, but it hurts no matter what. I just want to hear from her again, but i know it’ll be so long before then.
To fill in, i confessed to my best friend of how I felt, and she left before I could finish speaking my mind. But that’s my fault, i was never good at my emotions. We used to talk everyday, had shows we watched together, gifts we shared with one another, and helped each other through our own personal lives. Her smile is honestly something spectacular. She has the dumbest jokes, and every time she sang it always makes me smile. Then she’d look up every time and say “haha sorry” as i reply “encore” or “no I love it.”

This week there was a lot of firsts for me with my emotions:
It’s been so long since I’ve actually cried aloud, and for three days straight i couldn’t stop crying. Going to classes was harder on me than anything with the weight of the week.
I found myself at an empty chapel, talking about everything. I grew up catholic but didn’t continue with my faith. I still don’t honestly, but it was quiet. No one was around and I spoke aloud. I talked about my stress of finals, my anxiety of her leaving me to cry, and how I missed her so much. I kept looking around like I was looking for her, but she wasn’t there. I ended up sitting there for at least an hour. Half speaking my mind, and the rest in silence.
She still important to me in my life. I always try to keep hope that she’ll want to talk, but I want to cry at the thought that she may never want to hear from me again.

I might just use this community to vent how I feel at night for a bit as I always feel the lowest at night. Until my loneliness goes away. Also thank you guys for your support on my last post, I really do appreciate it. That’s probably the lowest point I’ve ever been in my life, and I’m glad people i didn’t know wanted to be there for me. That makes me a little less lonely❤️"

lonely,My friends and family love me more than I love them...,"My friends and family love me more than I love them... - I’m 19, a sophomore in a liberal arts college studying a major that I know I will soon transfer out of. I tend to be referred to as the isolated artist by friends and family, yet I have many friends and my whole family loves me very much. 

I am not a sad person and laugh a lot. 
I spark interesting conversations when the chance allows it and I am, maybe, too ambitious.
I have passions for things like nature, creativity, and learning, and my biggest worry is myself.

I am often praised for my accomplishments but I feel as though everyone loves me more than I love them. 

I sometimes wish I was born uglier so people didn’t expect me to be the person they expect me to be.

Friends don’t expect me to join them when they go out clubbing, yet they still ask. When we do go out I have fun, but often feel like I’m wasting my time with momentary pleasures, wondering constantly about the legitimacy of the fun I am having: The drugs and alcohol simply making uninteresting conversations and nights seem as though they aren’t.

I think too objectively and I have something wrong to say about literally every single person in my life, including my parents, grandparents, cousins, and even my dog for fucks sake. 
This is not to say I don’t love them, because I do, but the only people I can’t say something wrong about are strangers.

The good weighs the same as the bad because I have no faith.

These people love me so much, yet so often I think to myself that if it weren’t for the context of our relationship, we would probably not talk.

I often wonder how I met my friends, and deem it accidental, but who the hell do you not meet by accident? 
My objectivity doesn’t make sense to me, yet it entirely does, but plagues my thoughts.

Sometimes someone interests me in a certain way and I’ll find myself constantly searching for what is wrong with them. Those who I haven’t found something wrong with, I probably haven’t spent enough time with.

My best friends are all people I once hated for entirely rational reasons. My two last best friends, one of which was my girlfriend for almost 2 years, I now see as relationships that were started in hatred or fear of something, or love for an artifical pleasure, like smoking.

I often tell myself that the reason I draw is because I am entirely dissatisfied with reality, yet I very much love my life. I know I am very selfish and privileged, and even saying that, I am weighing my goods and bads the same. 

I love dreams, and I have made myself believe that this is because real life feels more fake than the world inside my head. 

How can I know if I should fully trust this feeling, or constantly fight it? Do I become who my body is telling me to be (a lonely artist, who searches endlessly for self fulfillment) or do I mold myself to care more about others and pleasure myself with things that feel meaningless?

I don’t know and need something, or someone to guide me towards a better version of myself. I think of spirituality, but even there I can’t help but see an incurable selfishness. I know I am depressed, but have gone through the rollercoaster and seen it in others that I can hardly call this a depression. 
It’s something else and I don’t know what it is..."

But I became a bad friend, start replying to messages, stop hanging out because I was spending all of my free time with my boyfriend. We broke up several time, and each time  I had less friends to go to.

We're still together now, but I have absolutely no friends. I'm social, I talk with people, have a few work acquaintances but I lost my best friend, she moved on.

i’ve made a knockoff(or alt) account that i made a day or so ago for this purpose. 

we could talk about, 
•ourselves
•things bothering us; like a place to rant and get things off our chests without ratting each other out to our “real” friends
•things we like(for example, i like frogs)
•share memes 
•etc etc. 

sometimes internet friends who we don’t know irl(usually the ones we don’t even know their full name to) are more reliable than our “real” ones:)

i don’t expect this to blow up, so i’ll probably be able to fit like 5-10 people in it-first come, first serve. i don’t want to make one so big that people are left out. 

just message me if you want to be in it! please-don’t put your instagram username in the comments to protect against spam and save your privacy. make an alternate account that is, by no means, connected to your main one! anonymity will keep us all safe. 

thanks:))"

lonely,I don't know how to fill this void in me,"I don't know how to fill this void in me - Maybe the best way to start this is a backstory about me (sorry for the long read):

I am a 23 year old guy. I moved to the USA from India when I was 2 years old (so I am a u.s citizen and westernized in every way other than the fact that I can speak Hindi and eat Indian food more often than the average American).

I have always been a loner. I tried to be cool and make friends in elementary school but I would always get teased and bullied. It was worse in middle school. So, in high school, I became quieter. I was still teased, but not nearly as much, because I would just keep to myself, assuming nobody would want to be my friend and that I would just have to deal with it. Well, as a result, this led to me being totally socially awkward and underconfident into college as well. I should also add that this whole time I have been having a porn addiction. I went to a good Engineering college, but I had no social life (like 0 friends) the whole time and an awful GPA (literally just enough to graduate but I failed so many of my major courses. I literally barely made it). Of course, you gotta have a good GPA to get internships and to get a full time position, companies look at your experience (I had no internships other than this research thing I kinda did at the university).

So, when I graduated last May 2019 with a bachelor's, at 23, I had the following:

1) no friends
2) never been on a date or any form of intimacy with anyone 
3) I was broke and lived with my parents because I was unemployed



Obviously, I was thinking about ending it all (my professor said I should speak with the college therapists because he thought I might have depression. Maybe he was right but I never have been one to care about my mental health. I just tell myself to stop being so pitiful and deal with it). I had 0 confidence in myself for a whole 6 months as I made futile attempts searching for a job. I ate so much that I became medically obese.

Anyways, something really good happened for me recently. I got a job. A job that is damn near my dream job. Like it works in the exact industry that I have dreamed of working in since a young boy (but gave up on thinking it was just a fantasy) and it pays well (not 6 figures or anything but still pretty solid). I have been working for about a week now. It's a ton of work (more than 40 hours a week for sure) but I really enjoy it even when i get mentally exhausted. 

But here is the thing, despite having this great job, I still have this void in me. I think it is because I still don't come out of my shell. I still hate myself on some level. My team's director invited me to go out with some of the employees for happy hour and walking around downtown. I told him maybe, but I dont think I am going. I think I am just going to lay in my room being a loner as always. I just assume the worst. I have tried going out with people, but I always just end up being kind of left out because I am afraid of involving myself in anything because I never feel like I am truly welcome. 

And of course, I do want intimacy. I just think I will be one of those few people that will have to die without it (some people just go on without some things) but it makes me sad thinking about it. I do want a girlfriend, but I have never asked a girl out because I am too damn self-conscience (my body, my lack of a exciting personality). But I am a 23 year old virgin who has never kissed or dated so I feel like my ship has sailed since obviously women my age would want a a guy with experience (sure, there is that 0.001% that would be cool with it, but how on earth would I find them and, since there are so few, chances are high we might not even be compatible). This will probably sound dramatic, but I feel like genetic waste with a worthless manhood some times....not all the times...but some times.

One thing I am working on is getting some hobbies. I will have to work some more to get the funds to do them, but that shouldn't be long. But here is the thing. No man is an island. I really was hoping that this lovely job would completely fill my void, but it hasn't. Because it's the weekend now, and I am back to my self-pity shit. Also the place I live in and work is a crowded downtown area, so I am just a loner in a crowd. I don't know how to build relationships, platonic or romantic, with anyone. I'm just ""cool"" to be around occasionally I guess.

Anyways, I feel like I am rambling now. So basically I want to know how to get out of my shell and stop feeling pathetic."

lonely,I just need advice.,"I just need advice. - Today I really noticed how lonely I actually am. 

I’m almost 16 and I do online school and I have been for about 4 years now. I haven’t had any irl contact with people outside of my family for a while until yesterday. Other than going to stores and what not. I have no friends, like at all. 

I’m not very good at meeting people. I have really bad social anxiety so it’s hard for me to try and talk to people I don’t know. 

Yesterday I got to meet someone I was really interested in. We cuddled and stuff like that for a little while. Then he had to leave. He said he loved me and would think about dating. 
He’s acting kind of different tho. 
After he left he said he was going to sleep for the night. But I noticed on the snap map he was at a restaurant. I know it’s probably weird to check his location but I was curious. I didn’t ask him about it. 
After he left he started taking a lot longer to respond then normal. I feel like I did something wrong. I would ask him if I did and he said no but he’s acting different. So now I’m just worried I screwed everything up. 
It made me really think about how lonely I am. The hour or so he was here was the happiest I have been for a really long time. But I’m scared it won’t happen again. 
What do I do? Any advice is welcome."

I don’t even know why I just can’t bring myself to do it. Even when one of my friends asks if anything is wrong I immediately deflect without even thinking about it. It’s just so natural. I had someone in my life who I felt I could talk to a while ago but we have drifted apart unfortunately. She was the last time I really felt I could be open with someone. I met someone else about 2 years ago who almost got to that same point but one day I just shut down and I don’t know why. It felt like I had a hole in my chest and I shut her out. I hate myself for doing that. But around all of this I still have friends and family so I don’t feel like I have a reason to be lonely. I talk to people sure and that should be enough right?

lonely,"""Texting first"", and how to talk to people","""Texting first"", and how to talk to people - I see posts about not wanting to talk to people because you have to text first alot. I'd never really experienced this until recently, and i immediately realized what I was doing wrong.

Successful texting is an ongoing conversation about whatever you two want to talk about. Not one person asking question after question. Not a hello wyd how are you good bye. Successful texting is when one of you falls asleep then continues the conversation in the morning like it didn't happen. If you have short bursts of small talk texts with people that end in a goodbye and have to constantly start up again, you're doing it wrong. 

That's probably why you constantly feel like you're ""texting first"" because you're probably also the person who let the convo die in the first place. Think up a topic and discuss it. That topic will naturally lead into other topics and you'll think of things you'd like to talk about while you talk to each other. If it doesn't, *that person doesn't want to talk to you or about the topics you like*. There's no such thing as having a friend who you always have to text first. 

I've never understood that part either. How could you fw somebody who doesn't want to talk to you? Like most of my good conversations leave me hungry to talk to those people even more, and likewise for the other person. If I have a bad conversation with somebody, I sure as hell won't be ""texting first"" because we both know the conversation sucked and we don't vibe. 

And it's weird to me to see r/single or r/lonely making posts asking for people to text to ask them stuff to get to know each other. You get to know a person not by asking people directly about them, but by discussing a topic and reading their reactions to certain things. The way a person is flows out of them when they speak passionately on a topic they care about. 

Find a person who cares about a topic you care about and talk about it with them. Then if they feel the same about the topic and respond to the way you feel about the topic positively, you've just made a friend who you can talk to about that topic. Find at least 1 person who shares feelings about all the topics you care about and boom ur not lonely anymore. Then you are free to find people who feel the same way about multiple topics, then you find that one special person who feels the same about all the topics. That's your best friend, your wife, your husband. 

Sociology isn't rocket science people. The real problem is when there are no topics you care about at all. Don't simply identify with this. Prove it. Get into every topic known to man before you claim you care about nothing. Most people who say this have tried 5-7 popular things and don't like those things. Maybe ur a person who likes things that are different. There's a ton of people like that, don't trip just be who you really are and find those people."

lonely,Wheres the line between avoiding a person and excluding them?,"Wheres the line between avoiding a person and excluding them? - Obviously its your personal choice which people you wanna hang out with and which not. If you try to make plans with a person and they turn you down thrice in a row, that's fair enough and that's their free decision. But at the moment everyone from my class is kind of collectively avoiding me. People make plans after school and on the weekends to go out to eat, parties and such. The thing is that none of them really want anything to do with me (My social skills aren't that great) and so i'm generally not getting asked to join anywhere

I understand that its no one else's responsibility to become friends with me or to include me in their plans, but that's exactly the problem. If say you've got a group of 30 people who all get along with each other really well, but each one for themselves decided that they don't like that one specific person, then that ends up with the person being excluded and not having friends, if that was their intention or not. I know it wasn't in my case, the people i'm talking about are some of the nicest people you can imagine, it just seems that each of them individually chose to not want to talk with me and that turned into them as a group just pretending i don't exist and avoiding basic conversations with me"

lonely,How to get over an obsessive crush with a flirty friend when you're already lonely as hell?,"How to get over an obsessive crush with a flirty friend when you're already lonely as hell? - I'll try to make it short but I'll probably fail again. TDLR at the end.

Anyhow, I turned 30 a few months ago. I've only had one real relationship in my entire life. It was abusive and it ended up with her committing suicide. Honestly my child and teen years were awful. Slowly but surely it turned me into a broken constantly depressed person.

I somehow found a job a year ago. One day a new coworker came to start working there. I grew a crush on her. A big one. We grew closer over time and she's become a friend. Honestly she's my best and only friend nowadays.

But I'm obsessed with her. Literally. And I have been for months. She turned me into an even bigger wreck. 

Whenever I have days off it hurts because I know I won't see her. We see each other after work sometimes but nothing happens because supposedly she's not into dating coworkers. Might be a lie obviously, and this creates another shitty situation because I'm done working there in 3 months. This means I won't see her on a daily basis anymore. This means maybe she will make a move on me but most likely she won't. So I'll just be stuck with not seeing her anymore. 

We're completely opposite on many things. I'm a rather conservative and quiet guy and she's exactly the opposite. She's even bisexual which is something I never found attractive. Politics wise we also disagree on many things, but I never talk politics with her because I'm afraid of losing her if I start being honest.

Unlike her I'm lonely as fuck and I have been for so long now. She has a really wide circle of friends and people she has casual sex with. It hurts. It makes me think like a bad person. I wish she was as lonely as I am. I know it's an evil thing to wish to someone you love, but I cannot help it.

She's the only woman who has been giving me attention for so long. I know she likes me a lot, but it's in a friendly way. And the way she is and the way she behaves with me hurts so much.

When she talks to me about what she's doing in her free time it induces a cognitive dissonance inside my brain because as I said I'm fairly conservative and frankly stuck up but she's not at all.  She's also had many life experiences, much more than me even though she's younger, and I wish I could have lived a life like her but I couldn't because I have always been lonely and abused. I wish I could share my experiences with her but I don't have any.

There's also the problem of sex. I didn't have much sex in my life. I'm really inexperienced about it. She's not at all. I've even lost confidence because I spent so many years without having sex at all. I don't even know if I actually have a sex drive anymore.

At work and with me she sometimes has this weird mix of friendliness and flirtiness. She gives me cute nickname, says I'm cute, wants me to tell her that I like her, she playfully acts like we're actually dating each other and she says she finds it ""funny"" that other people believe it. Other coworkers and customers (we work in a shop) have told me we were cute together and that we would go well together. Some ask us if we're in a relationship when we got out together sometimes.

And it hurts as fuck because I know she'll never be more than my friend. I also know I wouldn't be as much into her as I am right now if I wasn't so fucking lonely. I don't even know why she spends time with me because my life of isolation and depression has made me a very boring person. I don't understand, and sometimes I'm afraid that she's actually being friendly with me out of pity.

Deep inside there's this little voice that tells me that this girl isn't for me and that she would and is already bringing me a lot of pain and unhappiness. 

Hell, I've been obsessed with her for months like I said earlier. I can't stand my days off work (won't see her again until next tuesday... already feeling like shit) because I'm alone and I can't see her.  I don't know what to do. I should just stay friends with her and that's it. I shouldn't be into her. She should be a cool friend that I should keep but that's it. I should love another woman.

But I cannot because I'm so fucking lonely and I have no one else in my life. What should I do? How to get over her? How to be at peace with my state of loneliness? I just want to work on myself and become a better person but I cannot because I'm lonely and because I'm so unhealthily obsessed with her that it prevents me from doing anything constructive in my life.

TLDR: Developed a crush on a coworker. We became friends with time. I'm obsessed with her even though we're completely opposite on many things, which creates a strong cognitive dissonance in my brain. I know the two of us would never truly work or that it would be an unhealthy relationship if it did. She playfully flirts with me sometimes and says it's funny to pretend that we're actually dating and that people believe it. I know I should get over her because she brings pain and unhappiness in my life but I cannot because I'm lonely as fuck and she's the only person to actually give me attention. I'm lost."

I connected with an old friend and I fell kinda hard for him. But in October everything started to fall apart, and now he's not talking to me anymore. Later that month I started dating a different guy, and I lost my virginity to him before he cheated on me with one of my best friends. Now I've been avoiding any sign of a relationship because it's not worth the pain and distress right now.

I miss the first guy, my old friend. For the sake of the post I'll call him David. I miss the physical contact and shit but more than that I miss the friendship. I live close to him so I see him all the time but he's very cold toward me. I've tried reaching out too many times to no response but I can't get over it.

Now there's a new guy, Owen. I've realized, to my horror, that I like him way too much. He's from a very close circle of mutual friends so I spend a lot of time around him and we have a lot of the same interests, although I met him fairly recently. I think everything this person does is purely adorable and I love to be around him, but I'm very afraid to go for it given the circumstances.

I can't tell our other friends how I feel because I'm afraid they'll tell him, and I don't want to tell him because I can't risk pushing him away and ruining another friendship if he doesn't feel the same way. I want to believe he drops hints that he likes me. He's kinder to me than he is to our friends and he talks to me a lot about his past relationships. But idk.

I feel very alone right now, even though I'm surrounded by a lot of good people. I'm going through a lot with my family and I miss the way things were before David and I fell out. I also feel like this connection that I have with Owen is rare in my life and I'd rather protect it than crush it trying to be with him. But what if this is a good chance for a happy turn in both of our lives and I'm being blind?? Advice?"

Not knowing how to swim, I began to drown

My last breath I remembered your final words to me,

""I'm sorry. Please move on""

I died that day.

As I took a sip from the holy grail, I choked and gasped

I lay there, dying a thousand deaths of bleeding hearts

Quick to realize 

My Elixir had turned into VENOM

My Ecstasy into Poison

A poison so potent that it killed my soul

And I dare not ever fall in love again."
lonely,i liked this girl but she has a gf,"i liked this girl but she has a gf - i just feel pretty sad at the moment, almost in the down feeling of being lonely? you know that feeling when you find out they're dating someone? i saw them together with their gf, laughing with each other in the school hallway and they are happy together. i'm happy for her though!"
lonely,I saw my Ex today.,"I saw my Ex today. - My Ex-girlfriend/ best friend. I saw her at Wal-Mart I avoided going to  Walmart for that same reason, I knew I was to see her there cause that's where she spends her free time (there's isn't much to do here) I had to go for ink for my printer and as I made my way to the aisles I saw her she was in men clothes section of the store and she looked at me and our eyes met but she didn't say anything and neither did I. Not a smile not a nod to at least acknowledge each other we we're  strangers. That makes me sad cause how did 2  people that's spend a lot of time together 2 people who had inside jokes and deep conversation become strangers."

I don't want to hurt people but I also don't want to get hurt, cheated on and betrayed on...it just completely destroys my trust in all human beings. Most of the times, I just yearn for a lover to hold me tight and not let go and; sometimes I'm reminded of the fact that a female should be able to stand on her own, independantly without anyone to rely on( relying is not bad but I want to be independant). So, I'm in a dilemma forever..."

lonely,"38, last single guy among my friends, mental health and body image make me want to give up on dating.","38, last single guy among my friends, mental health and body image make me want to give up on dating. - I can’t call myself forever alone, since I’ve dated and been married once, but being at my friends’ wedding last weekend kinda reminded me all over again that my depression and anxiety always tank my relationships and that I’ll never have what all my friends have.  
  
I see a therapist regularly and take medication. I work out 5-6 times a week (and still can’t fit in my clothes or most cars). Christ, I even quit drinking last month. So I’m working on myself, but the fact is I’m lonely, but I know that the next depression episode is right around the corner, and no woman wants to deal with that, even if they claim to in the beginning.  
  
Does anyone else deal with this? I don’t want to give up, but I feel like dating has kinda given up on me."
lonely,Am I greedy for not being satisfied with what I have. (M),Am I greedy for not being satisfied with what I have. (M) - I have plenty friends and I’m well liked amongst the people who I socialize with but something in me feels empty. I’ve never had a romantic relationship with anyone and everyone always compliments me saying people are crazy not to like me back when I get turned down or that I’m an amazing person and while this is beyond flattering I just feel like it’s slightly hollow or it only extends to a certain point of just platonic compliments. Am I being greedy or ungrateful for this because I feel I should just take life as it comes and count my blessings but I just feel unsatisfied a lot even though I love my friends.

He gave me some basic physical contact/touch and i am so fucking touch starved that now pretty much the only thing that i look forward to is meeting him again. - As the title says i met up with an online friend (actually it was 3 friends but this story is not about the other two because nothing intresting happened with them) and we went to watch a horror movie. While we were watching the movie he held my hand a few times but only for a couple of seconds and i rested my head on his shoulder and it was so surreal like i actually still cant believe that happened.

Then when we were supposed to part ways with eachother we hugged for like 30 seconds straight and it was so fucking awesome. I could feel his hands on my hips and his head was resting on my should it honestly felt like a dream (i did hug the other 2 online friends too but those lasted only a couple of seconds and were very light(?)).

And also when we were walking around he would randomly bump me and just i dont know i havent had that much physical contact with someone in a single day for who knows how many years.

I have never had a boyfriend nor have i kissed a guy before but im only 15 and im not ready for a relationship yet but these basic things made me so fucking happy."
lonely,Breakup,"Breakup - My (now) ex girl and I just recently broke up. We were in a long distance relationship but it was a very mutual thing.

Whats the easiest way to get over something like this?"
lonely,since we're throwing stones,"since we're throwing stones - for every guy who just wants sexual intercourse there is a girl who just wants to paint herself innocent and complain endlessly about her destructive emotions. you've gotta admire that these people are perfect for each other.

there are two sides to every story: the unwanted attention you receive from me is the attention I don't get from you. who has it worse? who uses who? who's wrong? what's right?  is something burning?

we come together when we laugh and manage to forget our differences, or when we are able to forgive each other and enjoy what makes us different. we drift apart when one fails to comprehend the other's nature.

I'd give anything for us to trade lives for a while but then maybe that would defeat the purpose. idk"

A lot of that is my fault, I don't really try, because Ive always felt negative about my appearance etc but I'm trying to overcome it

I have been on a dating app for a bit and getting a lot of matches, it's making me realise that maybe I'm not as bad ive always thought

but because I've always been so alone and devoid of female attention and affection, I just end up ruining it somehow when it comes time to speak or meet. I always find a way to fuck it up

I struggle to be the same funny, charming, charismatic person I am over text sometimes in person, I wish I could just talk the same way I type and think sometimes

It's made me worry a lot in life. Will I ever find someone who wants me for me? give me the loviing I crave and need? Will I ever be able to be who my mind knows it can be? I want nothing more in life than to find someone for my life

I've cried myself to sleep a few times in the last days because it's getting to me. I've only just started dating really for the first time in my adult life and It's so fucking hard, I feel miles behind most of the women I want to date. 

I'm going to die alone"

I don't have any friends outside of work and those drinks were my only social interaction - which in itself is pretty pathetic.

I’m just in this situation where I rent a room with people I know and now I’m getting this feeling that I’m a nuisance around here even though I keep to myself and I’m quiet and never show my face to anyone so they can forget that I’m here. I just feel like a bother, like they wish I was gone. I am trying to find another room but it gets more expensive closer to where I commute to work and I just feel like so ... all that’s in my head is that I’m a bother. I thought I was likable and to have that feeling turned around hurts in a way. It’s just been on my mind for a couple of weeks, maybe a month. I don’t know where to go, I feel so unwanted here. 

Another thought on my mind I’ve had is how I really don’t know where I see myself in a year. My girlfriend is nearly done with her college to do what she wants and I’m just at a simple tech desk job. I just feel this stress too, I don’t know why. Just wanting to vent all that out. I feel stuck, useless, a bother to others."

After high school I went to college met people but I had to work didn't grow up with money dad had to work 2 jobs 6 days a week to support us. So after high school I worked full time and school full time. Worked graveyard shifts during weekends so no going out. I had my son at 20 and quit school worked 2 jobs at 1 point. 

We split after and I would only see my son on weekends so I would work all week and not go out weekends to spend my time with my kid only. Didn't socialize or anything.

lonely,"Does anyone else feel like they're better than others, yet they enjoy companionship and you don't?","Does anyone else feel like they're better than others, yet they enjoy companionship and you don't? - I've seen COUNTLESS examples of men who are not as physically attractive as I am, and on top of that, they have the personality of a wet paper bag. Yet these men enjoy companionship and love and for me it's something that is ""unrealistic"". I just don't get this, and it pisses me off to no end. I really am not trying to insult other people, but facts are facts and often times my looks and personality are just better than others around me yet they enjoy things and don't. It's just not fair. Not knowing WHY is perhaps the most gut wrenching thing. If I was hideously ugly and a mute, I would understand. But I'm far from it, so why? Can anyone else relate to this?"
lonely,Been starting to think it's best that I stay alone (Long rant),"Been starting to think it's best that I stay alone (Long rant) - **Social skills**: Pretty bad, can't compliment people without feeling gross afterward. Can't hold onto conversations with people I just met (sometimes words won't even come out). Short temper I guess? Family branded me it ""Anger Issues"" and I just accepted it, I guess. The tone of my voice gets people to think I'm worked up when I raise my voice just a bit and they tell me to ""Calm down"" (leaves me beyond confused and annoyed when people tell me that).

**Friends**: They tell me that they like me, but I feel that it's only because they know my sister that they felt they **had** to befriend me. I don't understand why anyone would want to tolerate my bullshit? I brought this up one day, they assure me that they like me but I feel that they're just lying to make me feel better. My friends never take me seriously too which is the most frustrating thing ever.

**Family**: I just know I'm the outcast so I don't even bother. Nobody comforts me when I'm angry or frustrated and the only thing I get is ""calm down"". I like to comfort them and encourage them to rant when they need to. Sometimes I try to help them look on the other side

**Relationship**: You can tell that's never going to happen based on this. My self-esteem is shit (but I still do respect myself and my boundaries) and I'm just an overall bitch and toxic. I don't want to hurt anyone unfortunate enough to catch feelings for me (which will never happen anyway lmao).

&amp;#x200B;

I prefer just staying alone at this point because I believe it's for the best. I understand that I'll have to interact anyway (and I will still do it to the best of my ability) but going beyond acquaintances is just not possible for me anymore. I'd rather just lay back and develope hobbies n' shit in my own bubble away from people. I stresses me out anyways having this constant fear of people laughing and talking shit about me because I couldn't do my only responsibility of staying my own lain."
lonely,Every day is a burden and I am considering suicide,"Every day is a burden and I am considering suicide - I am so lonely. I wish I had a significant other or a friend to tell me everything is going to be ok, that I don't need to give up and kill myself. That I don't need to worry so much about my future.. I just crave attention. The lack of human contact is depressing. At least I have a family, but will I just live with my mom forever? without ever having my own house, my own money, my own life?

Everything seems so uninteresting and boring. I'm just so tired of having no motivation to chase my goals. I feel like I once I had the potencial to have a good life, but somewhere on the way I lost my purpose. I'm still young but I feel like I've missed out on so much already.

I hate myself. I hate my inability to live a normal life.

Guess I'll just listen to sad music, drink alcohol, masturbate to porn, and cry myself to sleep tonight like every other day. At least I get to feel something.

My mind is so broken, I'm just a piece of trash, a sad excuse for a human being.

I'm a talentless loser. Even If I wanted, I couldn't be succesful in any career or job. I'm too slow, too dumb.

This sub is nice to chat with other people in a similiar situation, but it's also just an illusion. It's not like anyone here cares about me either. Every single day I think about comitting suicide and I really feel like I'll do it in the next few days. In a way I feel kinda guilty for having those thoughts cause I really think this earth is amazing, I hate myself for wasting my life like that but I think it's the only way i'll feel at peace with myself, though I admit i'm scared of death, I'm scared of the emptiness that will come after. but I'm also scared of the emptiness I feel now, while I'm still breathing yet unable to feel true joy and enjoy it to the fullest. I guess 2019 is my last year. I'm crying as I type this, I just wish things were different, I wish I was much more than I am now

Currently in my room now and I can hear my roommate and his girlfriend laughing and being flirty. We have very thin walls and I can hear every single thing they do ; every laugh, kiss, giggle, moan, squeaking bed , I HEAR IT ALL. He’s a really cool guy but for the last 6 months, his girlfriend has been coming over to our apartment almost every single day.

lonely,Why is it this way?,"Why is it this way? - I’ve been wondering. Am I in love with this girl and her personality because of her past and inability to show me love back despite her words, or is this some cruel joke the Universe has decided to play on me? I can’t believe both of our chances at happiness together was ruined by some fuckstick jerkoff two years older than her who never even thought to treat her with respect. She’s made it clear she feels the same way I do, but wont seek me out, touch me, or say anything remotely romantic to me. She’s the closest person to me that I have but I still feel so isolated. I can’t believe I’ve invested myself in this person when I don’t see any outcome in which I’m not second guessing myself all the time or freaking out because I think they’ve lost interest in me."
lonely,Feeling isolated after big move,"Feeling isolated after big move - This is my first time posting. Just curious to see if anyone else has gone through what I'm going thru right now or has any advice.  

A few months ago I moved 3 thousand miles for a new job. I left my family and friends to a very isolated and cold place. There are only old &amp; retired people living here. I tried making friends. I got a gym membership. Only 90 yr olds lifting weights or girls just staring at me coldly. I have gone out exploring like hiking, running, etc. Everyone just stares at me, I feel so out of place here. I'm so homesick, and miss my friends. I haven't had a real human-interaction in months. My job is very isolating by nature, not many co-workers.  And the work is solo. I feel like quitting and returning home. Part of this is my fault, because I knew this job would entail isolation but I never realized it would cause me to feel lonely. I feel comfortable being alone, and am easily drained in social situations. But for the first time in my life I'm craving real human interaction and long conversations. I'm tired of small talk and going home after work with no where to go or to hang out with. I'm just lost."
lonely,Far from okay,"Far from okay - I’m staring at the ceiling of my hotel room. I’ve got work in the morning, but sleep is slipping from my reach. The bed is bigger than usual, but I’m trying my best to take up less space. If I could fold into myself and disappear, I might just feel better.

It’s cold outside. I’m normally from warmer climates, and being on the road for my new job is something I’m still not used to. I’m not sure I’ll ever be used to it. Who knows... this is my fourth attempt at finding a career. I think I’ve made a mistake.

My family isn’t near. Even if they were, they’re distant and disconnected from me. It’s been years since I had a friend I could meet in person. The handful of internet friends I made has slowly separated from me. I have nobody to call, I have nothing to do.

I’m unhappy. I’m isolated. Dating apps bring no matches. Attempts to find new friends online go sour. I no longer have time for hobbies, and my skills are becoming dull from disuse. I question myself daily, I have no self image, and I can’t figure out who I am or what I want.

I’m 26, and not sure of what I am. For the last several months, I’ve said that I’m not living past 32. There’s no point to it. There was one point in my past where I thought I had it set. But it was so temporary that it feels more like a dream than my own story. I’m not better off alone in life. I’m not alive when I’m alone. I have nothing to live for without others. Too bad nobody’s around."

I don’t know what to do and I don’t know who to ask, so here I am crying for help to strangers on the internet once again. I am so lonely, I have been for the last 5 years. It’s not because I’m shy, I have acquaintances, but nobody who’s close, or I would call a friend. Everyone I try to progress, platonically or otherwise, kinda just leave me at some point. I did recently make a friend for a while, but I doubt It’ll work out.

No I’m not fed up with life or something, I’m actually quite happy most of the time, and really are when things go well. Despite this I am so very lonely. I have a bunch of aquanrtnces, or people I talk to at school and even text outside of it sometimes. But no actual friends. Nobody who’s going to last once the semester is over. Nobody who’d ever invite me anywhere. People I’ve tried being friendly with seem to literally avoid me and try to ghost me.

I’m very doing well in school, I’m pretty social and not very shy, I exercise a healthy amount, I have hobbies and interests, but for the last 5 years, no friends. I try to get advice but all I get is, “join a club!” I have been in clubs and once again have made aquanrtnces but no friends. I have also tried going to things like DnD, but It never really worked out.“work out, join a gym, improve your self image!” I’m not so basement dwelling loser, like I said I exercise a healthy amount and I am doing well in school. I have also tried seeing a councillor but to no avail since she pretty much told me the same stuff. Maybe I’m just not a nice person, but I really don’t think I am, and even Hitler had friends.

I honestly wanna just give up and stick to trying to date, but that is no easier. I have done so before, both times I did not make it past the first date and they kinda ghosted me afterwards. This semester is over so it’s too late to try again till next semester, and I’m not very outgoing, so I’m not sure how to meet people outside of school. I’m also too young to try online dating, not that I’d want to anyway.

There was a girl, I nearly made as a friend recently, but I doubt it’ll work out. Essentially I tried to date her, but she wanted to just be friends. I’m happy because that’s honestly what I was looking for. We get along with each other, and text quite a bit, but I doubt it’ll last, and I honestly kinda think she only talks to me out of sympathy based on much of her behaviour. She never instigates conversations, and sometimes seems to end them awkwardly mid conversation. Despite this she replies quickly, writes quite a bit, so I don’t know. We used to sit next to each other in class, walk to the bus together, and talk when we saw each other in the halls back when school was on, but I must have been to clingy or something. Even if I am overthinking, it’ll never develop into anything more than texting about school. I could ask her out to something, (platonically), but she’d only accept out of sympathy, and I don’t want that. 

I’m not looking for sympathy. I want advice and help. 

More info in case your curious. I’m a  with Aspergers in my first semester of university living off campus, and I’m studying history, something I have always been very interested in. During middle school my parents divorced forcing me to move across the world, not exaggerating, 4 times over. This kinda meant I lost all friends I had, and learned to not get too attached to people, which really did not help during high school, where I was depressed and alone."

lonely,One of my closest friends ghosted me,"One of my closest friends ghosted me - Or at least, it's incredibly likely that she has. Me, her and two other of my friends were all extremely close. We were each others main friends. Then suddenly, two months ago, she stopped talking to all of us. We just assumed she was busy with school, since she started back around that time. But tonight I found out she's still active. She changed part of her Discord bot profile as well. She just isn't speaking to us. She also still pays for Nitro. As well as this, I just noticed tonight that one of her Discord badges changed.

She just ghosted the three of us, without warning. We've known each other for almost 2 years. At least we know she's okay now, but it's upsetting to know she just left us without a word. Like the friendship meant nothing.

Guess I'm down a friend."
lonely,Lonely after losses,"Lonely after losses - I'm lonely.

I married my best friend in 2014. It took a lot for us to get to that point. We were friends, then best friends, then moved in together, then moved to a new state then got married. The marriage didn't work out and ended up getting divorced in 2018. Not too long afterwards my mom got sick. I moved back to my home state to take care of her and be with her. She fought like hell but lost her battle. I moved back to my new home state afterwards and have felt lonely since.

Just don't know where to go from here. I'm horrible at meeting people and just feel like loneliness is what my life is destined for."

Lmao they don’t realize I’m an introverted asshat who barely has human contact. My schedule is waking up, hitting the gym, going to class, come back home, play videogames, work and sleep. I see everyone else’s Snapchat stories of people eating together, partying having a good time while I’m just always alone. I was pretty social freshman year but eversince this January, depression’s been kicking my ass. I see all my friends from freshman year around campus, we make eye contact briefly but neither of us says hi or anything. Girls look at me and smile but I’m too dead to do anything but keep my mug face. Nobody texts or calls other than classmates asking about work. The only people I talk to are my roommates, and even then I wouldn’t consider them friends as we don’t actually hangout or do anything. Idk what to do anymore it feels like everything’s going downhill. I can’t take living these meaningless days anymore, there’s nothing that gives me happiness or joy. Any advice or just feedback would be much appreciated. Or just someone to talk to, it’s been a long time. Thanks in advance"

lonely,Sad day of firsts,"Sad day of firsts - I had never felt like crying in the bathroom at work... til today.
I had never felt like cutting myself... til today.
I was actually kinda coasting along this morning, but I went to a therapy session in the early afternoon and in it, I realized how alone in the World I am right now. In summary, my therapist handed me some really tough pills to swallow - my ex-wife is someone toxic, from whom I should not be close, that much I knew, but my so-called friends are only around when there's something in for them. And she's so right, a therapist wouldn't take me to such conclusions if she didn't think I needed to see it, and I trust her.

Then I went to work right after it and, boy, it was hell not to cry in front of my colleagues. After 3 PM, I work alone in my room, but people come and go to bring me and ask for things. I managed to discreetly cry a little, but tried to bottle it up til I got home. I just couldn't. When I went to the locker room to get changed to go back home (I go by bike), I broke down. Spent 5 solid minutes crying inside the bathroom. I came out not giving a flying fuck if someone saw me with a face full red and drenched in tears. That moment in there, if I had something to cut myself, I think I just might've done that.

Sorry for the venting. I just need to say it somewhere, because it hurts so, so bad to have nobody to call in these situations and get someone who cares to listen. I have felt like ending my life repeated times today, but that I know how to manage on my own, since I have already tried it many years ago and failed. Now I'm sitting at home, trying to cry myself to sleep, so I get to see tomorrow."

lonely,"Trying to Squash Down Feelings, Not Working","Trying to Squash Down Feelings, Not Working - i don’t really know which kind of reddit board this would go under, but it’s about being lonely still. 

my first major relationship was when i was 16 (early 2011) we got engaged and thought we would be forever together. then i moved with my family, from New England to the South. we broke up in late 2015 due to various reasons (one of them being that we were both very stubborn and couldn’t quite agree on some things) , and i thought i wouldn’t be able to find someone else again just last year (2018), but i did. but then we broke up as well (largely due in part to their familial problems, or at least thats what was told to me. but i know i probably did something to mess it up and they just didn’t want to say) 

i’m 25 now, i have a new crush on one of my coworkers and it seems they might like me/flirts with me, etc. but i just can’t tell, and i can’t take the ifs and maybes. i don’t even know if i want to try. i used to be content with the idea of being a single woman forever, surrounded by cats and doing my own thing. but now that i’ve had a taste of really enjoying time with someone it’s really hard to settle on that kind of future.

i don’t really know what to do to get out of this kind of funk, and i don’t know how to pep talk/push myself out into the scene, in order to take risks and try to find someone who will enjoy me for as i am, and so that i can return the favor to someone who is looking for the same. if anyone has any advice about trying to move on from this kind of situation (the longing and immense dread pitted in my stomach about being alone forever) it would be greatly appreciated.

if not though, feel free to say whatever you want about all this, and point me in the right direction of the correct reddit board for this kind of post."

lonely,My best friend is a plant,"My best friend is a plant - My ex broke up with me in the middle of 2019 and since then I've isolated myself and cut my shitty friends out which is all of them.

 The only thing that gets me through the day is the thought of smoking a zoot at the end of the day. 

Its almost like a buddy who motivates me to keep pushing through and not give up because of one hurdle.

I spend all day by myself and I prefer it, but only feel like that because I'm just used to being alone. I work in an office by myself, come home and spend time alone again. As soon as it gets to around 10 I'll go for a zoot and I just feel like I've been given a big hug.

Its a dangerous habit to fall into especially if you are dealing with some mental difficulties and self medicating really does not help in the long run but I'm tired of losing people close to me, I'm scared of kicking the bucket on this one that I'll fall back into my deep depression. I really hope I can find some good friends that make me so happy I don't need to smoke my friend anymore.

Once again on the way being nice to everyone I always end up with fake friends and even family.
This isn’t my first rodeo of people being like this, this is the reason I stopped expecting anything from anyone.

Someone told me that it’s okay to expect something from someone but thats honestly the worst advice to give. 

Now im here feeling terrible for what?
I rather be lonely than expect shit from anyone.
In those years being “lonely” I lifed to the fullest and never felt sad.

Ever been so deep that you wish you could stop from going deeper? 

Ever looked around and notice people around you caring only for what they face that day and what is to come tomorrow? Is lonely an idea or a feeling?

Why do we have to have feelings? In the end your life would come to an end and regardless what you believe in would you remember your successes and failures?

 In all honesty i am probably tired and emotionally depleted so i am gonna sleep and reboot the system.

But once and a while somebody comes along and talks to me all the time!! Wants to hang out all the time!!! and triggers my need for belonging and feeling important and I eat it all up. I savor it and completely forget about the inevitability of them hurting me 

And then it happens. They realize I'm not the Perfect Friend and they kinda just forget about me. And then I start getting left on read more and more and I figure ""Oh yeah"" and stop trying to about talk to them because I'm officially that one buddy that sends a good meme every now and then cause that's all I'm good to keep around for. IF that.

Gotta remind myself that I'll never have what I need from people and I need to be completely independent and never rely on anything and can't ever get my hopes up. Ever."
lonely,"It takes time, but things do get better.","It takes time, but things do get better. - How many of you have asked God, the Universe, or just yourself, “Why does no one love me?” Are you free of chronic depression but nonetheless wonder sometimes whether life is even still worth living? Is every social encounter with a happy couple knife twisting in your stomach? Well all those things describe me and that’s the reason I started coming here. 

However, one night I had a moment of perfect clarity. My emotions completely evaporated and I saw myself through “eyes unclouded” to borrow from Miyazaki. I asked myself “why” again and this time an answer came back: “Because you are not worthy of love.” That took me back a bit because I’m a romantic and have always believed that love was unconditional and something that just happened. I was always told that I was a good person and, therefore, someone would love me. Those beliefs were lies and I discarded them without compunction. I started to draw plans...

I made a covenant with myself. If I forged myself into the best version of me that I could be and I was still not worthy of love, then my life would be forfeit. Grim, sure, but life or death stakes are the only stakes that made the commitment feel more real than some dumb New Year’s resolution. I would focus on three “pillars”: My physical appearance, my mental conditioning, and my “spirit” (this covers becoming more worldly, bold, and creative).

Months later and I’m down over 100 lbs. and bristling with muscle under the 50 remaining pounds I need to lose. I quit my job and found one that let me go back to college to finish my education in medicine. I have made many bold moves in life including asking out a few women that I have been interested in and going on some fun dates (no love matches, but great times to be sure!) Hell, I even finished a novel I was writing.

I know that whether I find love or death along this path it’s a much better use of my time on this planet than moping and appealing to the void.

I intentionally wrote this post to sound like a self-improvement ad. There is no product but there is a philosophy. To borrow another phrase:  “apathy is death.” Put all your chips on the table and play. When people start smiling at you it feels so damned good. Is it the change in your body? Is your sharp and confident mind showing in your actions? I can’t tell you for sure, but life just tastes better when it’s not rotting. Cast off the false world of fairy tales and destiny and come with me."

I hate that I can't be myself!! All I wanted to do was be close to this fandom community about this series that I like, but there's people in that fandom community that hate my guts and keep 'digging into my past' and they keep linking to posts from literally 2008 as 'evidence' that I'm a bad person. When I explain that they are huge troll posts I made over 10 years ago on GameFAQs, they joke by saying ""I murdered someone years ago, but that's okay, because that was awhile ago!!"" to counter-act what I say.

I feel really bad!!!!!!! I have no friends offline, I never have, my only friends are on the internet, but now no one likes me and the haters keep following me everywhere and telling me about how my entire life is being documented by KiwiFarms and they listed my full name (and middle name) and birthdate on the kiwifarms post and it keeps going on and on."

I've never been the type to put myself out there, meet women, date, get to know a girl, create a bond etc. I've always just thought women found me ugly or not something they want, but I finally overcame that low self esteem and tried

Hit it off with this one girl, we message great. Then she wanted to call and it felt very different I don't know why. She was so attractive and I have low self esteem still from being lonely and single for 15+ years. Maybe she could sense it, I don't know

Anyway she tells me the next day she didn't think we were compatible so thats the last of it. It hurts so badly that I doubt I'll ever find anyone. I wonder if my inexperience and loneliness for so long is going to leave me to be lonely forever

I've been at college two months and people have already decided they hate me for practically no reason. Sometimes people just totally ignore me when I talk to them. I literally have one friend and have never had a boyfriend. Again, I thought I'd get a boyfriend in college but everyone already seems to be dating someone else. There are no clubs or anything where I can go and meet more people.

I don't generally get along with people my age because all they want to talk about is how they love vaping and ketamine and how ""so and so got the clap because a guy fingered her fanny at a nightclub"" and I don't drink or do drugs and have never been intimate with a boy so I never know what to say, so everyone thinks I'm innocent and therefore boring. When I try to talk about hobbies or films/TV shows they always find a way to loop it back around to drugs, parties, sex or how hot someone is because any other conversation topic seems to bore them.

 People my age despise me no matter how hard I try to fit in or be myself. I always thought I'd meet like-minded people at college, but it's just like school except less violent. I've always been ridiculed, hurt, ignored, threatened and/or excluded by most people my age, and have never ""fit in"" anywhere. I think my life might always be this way."

I'm in my twenties and have never been in a relationship. The one and only time I ever kissed a person is more than 10 years ago. I don't know how to initiate that kind of intimacy and it feels like I've missed the train because I was an incredibly ugly, unsociable guy in my teens.

I've got some friends here and there, but they don't go out to parties anymore because all of them have SOs by now, mostly I'm left alone during the weekends.

Just my 2 cents. I'm just feeding my narcissism and I know that playing the victim won't help, but I just wanna talk. Sorry for anyone who goes through this stuff."
lonely,I’m so tired.,"I’m so tired. - I see everyone walking around campus with their friends or their SO, carefree and happy and it just really emphasizes how alone and worthless you really are. If people cared about you or really liked you, they would at least text you. After a while you begin to ask yourself “what makes them better than me?” “Why do they get happiness and fulfillment and I don’t?”

I’m not mad at them like Elliot Rodger, I’m just jealous of the fact that they have someone that cares. I’m tired. I want it to fucking stop. Every time I go outside I’m reminded of how much of a nobody I was, am, and will be.

They wanted to know how many subjects were in the course we next year. After a long time in silence, that's it. Maybe they don't remember that I got a cool job? I used to always ask how woolworths was going. And she liked being asked. I prompted them by saying ""let me check when I get to the office"". Nothing. Not a thing. I tell them how many subjects (which I already knew the answer to before getting to the office) and that's it. Haven't heard back.

I’m 20 and a female and would love to have a female friend around the same age I can get along with. I love talking and listening. I just feel like everything personal I would want to talk about in a friendship is too much for anyone who knows me irl.

I don’t mind being alone but I’d be nice to talk to someone else so I’m not thinking about my life problems so much. Even just for a moment I’d like to just talk to someone and get a healthy distraction from my thoughts. I think I’ve become so accustomed to being lonely that I actually feel unnatural when I’m in a social setting. I want to try and make friends but I get anxious and worried that I will disappoint them. For why, I don’t know. I don’t like this at all. Is this normal in college?"

I’ve been drinking a lot more than i usually do, i can’t make connections and i am lost...I’ve already had issues but she gave my life purpose and now i have nothing...i work, i come home and drink till i pass out, i get up i got to work and repeat....i knew it was gonna take me a while to get over my relationship, we were together for ten+ years but i thought after a year i would be doing a little better...but no, i feel like i am actually doing worse...but what do i know??

lonely,I just want to go out,"I just want to go out - I just want to go out. I'm always asking my older sister if we can go to the beach or take a weekend trip to the mountains if she's down and has money. She always says maybe one day, but it never comes. My sister rarely hangs out with me because she's out on a date or with her coworkers, or with her ex girlfriend (they're still friends). I sometimes can't even hang out with them for whatever reason. 

I have a best friend but we rarely get to hang out because I'm in community college and she has work/hangs out with her boyfriend, whom I don't like because he's a piece of shit. I could hang out with this guy who I've been talking to for the past 5 months every single day, but he's busy with work and lives about 10 miles away. He doesn't have a car and I don't really like my family in my business, especially when it comes to guys. 

I got caught hooking up with a guy about a year ago and my parents installed security cameras inside of my house facing all the exits even though I was 18 at the time, I'm 19 now. I feel trapped. 

People don't really talk to me at school unless I'm dressed in revealing clothes or in a group assignment. These two guys asked me for my number once, but I'm pretty sure they just wanted to hook up. Don't get me wrong, sex is great, but I just want friends. Or just *a* friend. 

Someone who I can go to the beach with, or a skatepark for hours with. Someone I can blaze with and they can listen to all the things I have to say when no one else does. I have a lot of things I have to say, random or important. Talk a lot too. 

Social anxiety is a big factor of my loneliness. I can't walk up to someone and compliment their shoes or outfit, I normally talk to people when I don't understand homework. Those conversations never last long. 

I once thought I could have a real friend. I met him on an app called MeetMe, he was 30 years old, 31 now. We ""dated"" but that was a big mistake, then after I realized (I was in denial) that he was probably a predator. He probably fed off my loneliness too. So I distance myself now, analyzing people so I don't get hurt again. A ""best friend"" who secretly hated me because of my anxiety. I'll admit, I'm naïve and do sometimes fall for people's fake attempts at a real friendship..just to get in my pants, or whatever sick mind games they want. 

It just sucks. Do I look mean and unapproachable? No one talks me and sometimes guys just wanna hit, but I need more than that. I dress cute sometimes and I draw. So why doesn't anyone wanna know who I am? I'd be a great friend. A great girlfriend if given the chance. I have so much love in me."

My trust issues have caused me to be cold and mean at times. The main problem is that everyone has less time (like jobs and college). I’m hopeless to do anything because I’m the ""annoying"" one that they don’t seem to want to bother hanging out with if there isn’t another one of us. I'm bad with communication and even worse at being a friend. 
We used to play video games 2-3 times a week but now it’s a treat if I get them together once a month. They get along with each other but almost seem like they’re avoiding me. How do I get close to them again without seeming too annoying?"

They would probably do nothing. They would move on quickly. They never really cared. If they did, they would actually treat me like a human being. I just want someone who cares. Someone I can trust.

miss having someone I trust around.

It's me constantly racking my brain mid-conversation about what I should say that causes me to feel so exhausted by social interaction.","[20 M] I've been an introvert all my life, but now I'm admitting to myself why: I don't understand how to be social. It's me constantly racking my brain mid-conversation about what I should say that causes me to feel so exhausted by social interaction. - Introverts are defined as people who lose energy from social interaction and feel refreshed by being alone. That's been me for my entire life. As a result, I have only one friend, have never been in a relationship, and feel incredibly lonely most of the time. This past year in particular, my loneliness has made me really sad and crushed my self-esteem. 

For the past few weeks, I've been trying to go out of my way to make new friends at my community college, and it's made me realize something: I don't know how to be social, even when I want to be!

The reason I lose energy when I try to be social is because I'm constantly trying to force myself to do something I fundamentally don't know how to do. What comes naturally to most does not come naturally to me. When I try to talk to a person, it's so different from how I see other people talking to each other. Other people make jokes, insightful observations, funny comments, and ask relevant questions that come to mind immediately as the other person talks. They sound genuine and engaged. When I talk to people, especially girls, nothing comes to mind. Sure, I get nervous, but I feel like it's more than that. Everything I say and think feels forced, and it feels like my brain is running in overdrive just to keep up the charade of normalcy. If words did come easily in a conversation, I really don't think I'd be an introvert. 

And I don't even have any disorders! No autism, no aspergers, I don't even have ADHD. I have no excuses, just... I don't get it. How does everyone else do it?

If I can't figure this out soon, will I be lonely my entire life?"

lonely,Life of a sheltered homeschooler,"Life of a sheltered homeschooler - I was homeschooled from the 1st to 12th grade because of my parents religious beliefs. The last time I was in a public school was kindergarten. I spent the majority of my life lonely. I woke up, did my school work on the computer, gamed on the computer for the rest of the day, then went to bed. I was probably on a desktop 8 to 12 hours a day. I never had friends growing up because I was never in a situation to make friends. I try to tell some of my online friends on discord how awful it was and they tell me I would've been grateful to be homeschooled if I knew how much bullying goes on in public school. Maybe I would've been, but the brutal isolation brought me to many mental issues that I didn't know how to deal with. Gaming with online friends probably got me through it all. I go to college now and it's not much better. I do talk to people from college but it never goes anywhere. I never see or talk to them outside of classes. I don't know if its because I can't socialize properly or because I'm that weird homeschooled kid everyone tries to avoid. I spend my days in silence, like nothing has changed. I wish I could be a normal person."

lonely,WhatTheFuckEver (obviously a rant lmao),"WhatTheFuckEver (obviously a rant lmao) - so i should be studying for a final rn but since it's my last one i don't really care. and that's the reason that brought me here today actually. bc i don't care anymore. not like on no su\*cidal shit or nothing bc i've passed that stage but on some jeez what the hell am i doing w my life type shit. when i analyze my life i'm so ... unhappy. like there are days where i'm laughing my ass off, sides hurting, tears flowing and just living la vida bonita and then BOOM! God or who ever the hell is upstairs be like ""yeet bitch you thought."" and it just gets really fucking annoying bc it conditions you to think, ""omg don't get too happy now, you don't want to get this feeling taken away from you now."" and shit. but honestly at this point i'm just over it i guess. like i'm really not having a good time here. i don't want to be that bitchy bitch cry baby that complains about minor inconveniences in their life meanwhile ppl are fighting abuse, disease, etc. etc, but DAMN can i get a fucking break from this stale unseasoned life? 

anyways i'm actually starting to care about this final so imma wrap it up so i can study lmaoossjssksjk. but no fr in all seriousness it's really crazy how life is. like some days you don't want to be here any more but then again you don't want your life taken from you bc you actually haven't DONE shit w your life yet. and i guess in a way it's ok. like don't stay in the same low ass place forever but at the same time growth isn't rapid nor is it exponentially linear. you will have fucking bad days, yes oh God i've had my share of bad times. like a couple days ago i really wanted to end my shit bc i had FINALLYYYYY gotten an interview w a software company that pays their interns really well. and for someone who has the coding skills less than that of even a 7th grader, a bitch was PRESSEDT. but yeah basically my dumb ass had slept through the countless phone calls that were attempting to reach me. i called, and emailed, and prayed, and apologized my ass off but them bastards still ain't say nun back. actually lemme shut up bc they're not bastards. they prolly very nice ppl but i was just mad in the moment. still am. but shit like this happens all the time. and shit prolly happens for reasons. so honestly i just wanna say that if you're anything like me (which you'll probably will be since we both on reddit wasting time when we should be doing something productive \*COUGHS\*) then you'll get this: it doesn't matter champ. it doesn't matter that your familiy dynamic is horrible. you don't have not even one relative to call and console you when shit go south? doesn't matter. do Christmas songs and other holiday time periods give you a feeling of emptyiness and make you choke up and wanna cry bc you don't have that bond w your relatives? doesn't matter. no boyfriend? no girlfriend? no this, that, or the other? doesn't matter. crush not even looking in your direction and acknowledging that you're an amazing person that deserves the world? THIS ONE REALLY DON'T FUCKING MATTER CAUSE FUCK THAT PUSSY ASS DICKEHEAD ANY WAY!!!! \*clears throat and adjusts tie\* or maybe you're crush does acknowledge you but pisses you tf off bc they just be playing w your head and giving signals so mixed you woulda though they was learning sign language (amazing language btw you should learn it). that shit really don't fucking matter bc imma tell you right now that i have a crush who fits the description and he doesn't do anything but belittle me and throw shady hints like a lil bitch would so why do i even give him my valuable time? i shouldn't bc guess what? he doesn't matter (peep how i said ""shouldn't well he does, but just not to me. and fake friends shouldn't either. if you're the ""popular loner"" who's friends w everyone but isn't really FRIENDS w anyone, baby i get it. i really do. but that shit really. does. not matter. i already know i'm going to be the one person who gets--yuck i can't even say it--married after all my 'friends' and even then won't really have any one to invite to the wedding bc you know, like i said no pity relatives either. i already know that i won't have the fanciest car, or nicest house, or fattest paycheck--at least, i won't have all this shit if i k\*ll mys\*lf. so in order to get somewhere near the shit that DOES matter, you gotta put aside the shit that don't, and focus on you. focus on getting better, getting healthier, getting wealthier for YOU! there are sum point sum sum billion ppl &amp; counting on this earth. some of them may matter to you, but in the end you're the one that goes in the coffin alone. so anything you do, make it matter for you!

last thing imma say is this. those hella billion ppl i talked about? yeah that big ass number? they've all been through something before. 9 times out of 10 they found the solution to it either by doing something or learning a solution that someone else used to get out they tough times. so do that. read a book. watch a video or something. chances are you'll improve your life little by little and learn that this life shit does matter."

This seems more like a distraction to the problem rather then a solution to it, as I am someone who followed this advice and am still alone.

lonely,"I have had no friends, for the last 5 years, and I’m not sure what to do.","I have had no friends, for the last 5 years, and I’m not sure what to do. - I’m sorry this is a really long post, but it’s a complicated issue, and I hate the same useless responses from people who don’t understand the situation, when I don’t write enough. 

I don’t know what to do and I don’t know who to ask, so here I am crying for help to strangers on the internet once again. I am so lonely, I have been for the last 5 years. It’s not because I’m shy, I have acquaintances, but nobody who’s close, or I would call a friend. Everyone I try to progress, platonically or otherwise, kinda just leave me at some point. I did recently make a friend for a while, but I doubt It’ll work out.

No I’m not fed up with life or something, I’m actually quite happy most of the time, and really are when things go well. Despite this I am so very lonely. I have a bunch of aquanrtnces, or people I talk to at school and even text outside of it sometimes. But no actual friends. Nobody who’s going to last once the semester is over. Nobody who’d ever invite me anywhere. People I’ve tried being friendly with seem to literally avoid me and try to ghost me.

I’m very doing well in school, I’m pretty social and not very shy, I exercise a healthy amount, I have hobbies and interests, but for the last 5 years, no friends. I try to get advice but all I get is, “join a club!” I have been in clubs and once again have made aquanrtnces but no friends. I have also tried going to things like DnD, but It never really worked out.“work out, join a gym, improve your self image!” I’m not so basement dwelling loser, like I said I exercise a healthy amount and I am doing well in school. I have also tried seeing a councillor but to no avail since she pretty much told me the same stuff. Maybe I’m just not a nice person, but I really don’t think I am, and even Hitler had friends.

I honestly wanna just give up and stick to trying to date, but that is no easier. I have done so before, both times I did not make it past the first date and they kinda ghosted me afterwards. This semester is over so it’s too late to try again till next semester, and I’m not very outgoing, so I’m not sure how to meet people outside of school. I’m also too young to try online dating, not that I’d want to anyway.

There was a girl, I nearly made as a friend recently, but I doubt it’ll work out. Essentially I tried to date her, but she wanted to just be friends. I’m happy because that’s honestly what I was looking for. We get along with each other, and text quite a bit, but I doubt it’ll last, and I honestly kinda think she only talks to me out of sympathy based on much of her behaviour. She never instigates conversations, and sometimes seems to end them awkwardly mid conversation. Despite this she replies quickly, writes quite a bit, so I don’t know. We used to sit next to each other in class, walk to the bus together, and talk when we saw each other in the halls back when school was on, but I must have been to clingy or something. Even if I am overthinking, it’ll never develop into anything more than texting about school. I could ask her out to something, (platonically), but she’d only accept out of sympathy, and I don’t want that. 

I’m not looking for sympathy. I want advice and help. 

More info in case your curious. I’m a  with Aspergers in my first semester of university living off campus, and I’m studying history, something I have always been very interested in. During middle school my parents divorced forcing me to move across the world, not exaggerating, 4 times over. This kinda meant I lost all friends I had, and learned to not get too attached to people, which really did not help during high school, where I was depressed and alone."
lonely,I feel lonely but I think I can handle it,"I feel lonely but I think I can handle it - The good news is that I no longer feel anxious to be heard, there was a time when I didn't know what to do, the bad news is that I still feel lonely, I've realized 2 things, one is that I like anime and visual novels because they are ridiculous situations but nice in terms of what you would like to happen to you, sometimes it's the same in movies but I get to hate movies that pretend to be real but life doesn't work that way, I've seen lately stories of a person who is alone and from nowhere someone wants to talk to him and they become friends and know more people that want to know him/her, that's why they call my attention, the other thing I've realized is that in reddit there are many people who feel the same, I have tried to use meetup to meet people but the bad news is that in Mexico is not so popular the app, I have also tried to go to other events where many people gather but I don't know what to do in those moments, I only see everyone talking to their friends and I'm alone, I can try to talk to someone who is alone but sometimes they just say short answers and I don't know how to continue the conversation if we may not even share any interest, sometimes there are interesting people on Reddit who want to talk in the moment but then we stop talking, it's partly my fault for not knowing how to interact with other people, I don't want to be annoying for the other person and I don't want to depend on them either, I consider myself a good guy although I can be weird, I don't know if that's why sometimes I'm not interesting for other people but for favors, sorry if it's a long and complicated text with bad english, I don't know how to order my ideas and I have many things to tell, and I don't have many people to tell, even if you don't want to talk to me, thank you for being a witness of my thoughts"

lonely,Hi,"Hi - Today’s my birthday lol. But anyways, I have been feeling extremely sad lately. So I would be sitting in class, doing my work and stuff, then BOOM sadness overwhelms me. I feel like I want to cry but I don’t because I’m in class. While all of this is happening, I feel this aching feeling in my heart. The weird thing is that this all started a few weeks after I started high school. All of my friends went to another high school because the boundaries changed. We also don’t talk a lot like we use to in our groupchat that we have. Lately, I also have been sitting alone at lunch because I have no friends. I actually try to talk to people but they end up ending the conversation and we never talk. People only talk to me only when they need help on an assignment because my classmates think I’m smart. At this point I think I’m a loner and I’m happy to be one. On the weekends I’m usually playing video games by myself. Im better off alone. Lately I have been crying more than usual. I’m your happy girl, always optimistic, but that has changed. I’m feeling really sad. Still optimistic but always sad. I honestly don’t even know what to do anymore to be honest. My mom is in the hospital, and I feel really bad because my dad is working two jobs to pay everything. I’m stuck. I don’t feel suicidal in all by the way, I don’t even think of trying that because I know it would hurt my parents, a lot. Especially in the situation that we are currently in. I’m 14 years old and I know that I should enjoy my life but it’s hard when there is always a knot stuck in your throat. I have never been diagnosed with depression but I don’t know if this is depression or just your normal sadness knocking at your door."

lonely,Warning to women on this sub,"Warning to women on this sub - This is going to sound harsh and I know a lot of men on here will be offended even if it doesn't apply to them:

If you mention that you are a woman on here, or any sub for that matter - be ready to be flooded by guys offering you to talk (just to be there for you ofc!).

But make no mistake, a sad majority of them just want to see your picture and get their rocks off. They'll feign interest in your pain and say they relate to you but they'll find a way to turn things sexual. 

I have experienced this over and over on reddit without fail and this sub seems to be a breeding ground for guys looking for lonely women to prey on. 

I may be lonely and a bit depressed but I know predatory behavior when I see it so this will probably be the last post I make on here."

I have nothing going for me in life, I cling to all my friends and no one wants me around, i care too much about the people in my life when I'm expendable to everyone. Social anxiety, I always say the wrong thing, my jokes aren't funny,  I like video games. Basically I'm trying to focus on the ""lot of free time"" and ""clingy"". I always want to talk to the people I care about and no one wants to talk to me. If I could have someone who cares about me and wants to talk to me more than I want to talk to them, I think we'd have a lasting friendship. I get along better with females  (I'm male though). I don't just like talking to women cuz I have a hidden agenda. Idk if this proves anything but I'm 24 and never been in a relationship. That should tell you how much of a player I am... I just don't want to feel alone every second of every day anymore. It's affecting my work, sleep, thinking at all, etc. I'm rambling now. Please someone talk to pathetic little me"
lonely,Anyone else feel like the universe is conspiring against them sometimes?,"Anyone else feel like the universe is conspiring against them sometimes? - I get the fact that weird coincidences happen but some things just seem so bizarre that I can’t feel like it’s just a coincidence anymore.

So there’s this girl that I’ve known since elementary school and I guess we were kinda friends maybe? She would randomly appear and disappear from school but we would occasionally talk to each other. Since then I have become a depressed and anxious wreck so I’m incredibly embarrassed for her to see me like that.

Anyway I had seen her earlier today and I believe she saw me as well, but she didn’t say anything so I just assumed she probably didn’t want to associate with me. Afterwards I went to Walmart and for whatever reason I’m just thinking to myself that I hope she doesn’t happen to be there so I can avoid that awkward situation. Of course out of the corner of my eye there she is. I feel my face going red and my heart rate speeding up as I try to remain calm.  I try to avoid eye contact but none the less she approaches me. Then she said something but I couldn’t make out what it was and then she walked off. 

So yeah I have no idea what that was, now I’m stressed about whatever it was she said and I’m sure I probably looked like an idiot standing there with my face completely red. I don’t know it just seems like things go completely wrong for me anytime it can."
lonely,Thinking of her,"Thinking of her - When you have a crush on your friend who everyone knows is terrible at replying back and too scared to text first because you feel like a bother to her but you aren't hiding your feelings for her, took her to eat a couple times but idk I feel alone when I'm waiting for a text back but feel like I'm bothering by texting."
lonely,Bad reaction to saying no,"Bad reaction to saying no - On a throwaway account so please bear with me if I’m breaking any rules. I am a 25yr old woman, and I’ve never been in a serious relationship in my life. I’ve had small meaningless relationships whilst in school the ones where you go out a few times, kiss and that’s it. Whilst in college I “dated” two guys but was too scared to let it go to anything serious or the next step. It hasn’t bothered me until tonight. I went out with a friend I’ve known for a few years and to be honest in no way have I been leading on but I know if the topic ever arose he would ask me out. And tonight he did, and I quickly deflected saying I don’t feel comfortable at this stage in my life for anything serious. After goodbyes I immediately felt this wave of nausea that has not subsided. And it’s hitting me now that after all these years I’m truly alone and cried whilst brushing my teeth. All of a sudden I have these “dark” thoughts in my head and I don’t know how to calm down. I’ve been fine with my life, I have a stable job and loving family. I like the routine I’ve set for myself, I have a hobby I like but I do think of relationships and guys once in a while. But why am I scared, why did I get such a repulsive reaction. And to be fair, I don’t think it has to with the guy whatsoever given that I’ve had these scared thoughts about the guys I’ve gone on dates prior. I felt the need to vent since I’m mid breakdown and I realized I don’t feel comfortable telling my closest friends or my sister about these insecurities. I genuinely feel scared, alone and depressed. I do know I need to calm down because this is not the end of the world but why does it feel like it is for me."

lonely,last day seeing this boy I liked,"last day seeing this boy I liked - I battled depression for the past 3 years, suffered family problems, trauma from high school, and failed community college twice. As a 20 year old I became a shut-in with no friends, and no savings(i spent all of my $3.5k life savings on community college but ended up still failing all my classes, after I lost my financial aid due to a 1.5GPA).
This semester, even though I dropped 2 classes in and end and became a part time student with no job, wasting another~$600 and I was so depressed I thought about dying(My family is dirt poor so money is a stressful thing for me). But I finally got courage and began talking to my classmates, with the help from counseling and therapy. I ended up making acquaintances with a kinda cute boy. Well, today was the last day of class this semester, aka the last time we see each other. After I bid him farewell and said""Well it was nice knowing you"", he jokingly said, ""Well not before we go on a date sometime."" My heart definitely fluttered from the cuteness.
I also made a friend from another class, and we promised to hangout during break. It was the first time I had a friend in 3 years. I really feel that  I'm slowly working my way back to society. :)"
lonely,"I want someone to care about me, because of me. Not because they have to","I want someone to care about me, because of me. Not because they have to - Over the past 3-4 months I’ve been getting lonelier and lonelier. I suffer from depression and anxiety, however I’ve overcome them in the past few years. But with those problems being to fade, new ones have come to light, and that’s loneliness.I’ve always known about it because of all the Ads at Christmas saying that old people need a place to eat or just die from it, but I never knew it would happen to me. 

It’s been very hard for me over the past few weeks/months. I have a few online friends, but non of them message ME, I always have to say something first, and even when I do it just ends up us talking about me me me. And I hate it. I want to hear about someone else’s problems, and try and be able to help in anyway I can. Plus many of those friendships are fading fast, and I’ll probably never hear from them again after New Years. I asked some of them if we’d want to meet up and have some drinks, but my goal is just to have a hug. 

I do have my parents and they’ll always be there, I know they love me. But I’ve grown numb to it. They’ve had to love me because I’m their son. I just need someone to just like me for who I am, not because I want them too or they have too. But just be there wanting to listen. 

I’m not asking for anyone here to for fill these things, I just wanted to tell my story."

lonely,Is it...?,"Is it...? - I think i've reached the point where's i don't have any reason to live anymore. 

My whole day is just work, house chores, sleep repeat and it's like that every single day in my fucking life... 

My depression is growing stronger each day and my social anxiety doesn't help either.. Literally all i wanted was to find love.. The saddest part is that i will never experience this feeling. When i was younger i thought that it will come to me eventually and i should try to make myself happy, feel better but the reality hit like a truck.. I wasted the best time of my life to find someone who would accept me because of my social anxiety.. But.. Would it really matter? Being ugly stops any attraction towards a person even if both of them had personalities and interests that match 100%.

I think it's finally the time to end it once and for all, to stop being burden to everyone around me.

I don't have strength anymore to keep fighting, to keep myself positive.. To not fool myself that everything will be okay one day..

I am getting older, not younger.. Every passing day is harder to swallow than the previous one.. Everyone around me have someone.. 

I'll never experience love.. I'll never be with someone  who actually cares about me, who would love me for who i am not who i pretend to be.. I tried to be someone who i am clearly not.. I tried to approach, I tried to talk but all i got was rejection..

And that's why i will never be happy.. 

And that's why it's the time to do it.. 

Being forever alone is something i will never accept.. Something that i never wanted..
I am dead inside already.. I am an empty shell that do what it has to do to survive.. And nothing more, I fucked up in every aspect of my life.

I deserve to die."

lonely,I’m so lonely and confused,"I’m so lonely and confused - I’ve probably made a hundred posts to a bunch of different subs about my problems. I even tried ask reddit, but nothing came of it. I’ve never dated anyone, I’ve never kissed anyone. I’ve had sex, and for a while I was obsessed with trying to have sex again. My first time didn’t go so well, so I thought I deserve a second time. That’s not really the problem, the problem is I think I ruined any chance of a relationship, or that I’m in a place where a relationship would be detrimental to me or my partner. I always bring this up, and I’m sick of it, but I have mental health problems. There are a lot of people out there who are worse off than me, but still I’m struggling with it, so I gotta try to get better. I have this really bad problem where I can’t read myself, I can’t tell how I really feel or what I’m really thinking. People use this all the time to their advantage. if you know me for long enough you can see when I am a little bit slower, and that’s when I’m confused and I don’t know what’s happening. My mom and my dad use this to tell me that I’ve been wrong this whole time. I’ll go to doctors, then I get confused and they make me believe I did the wrong thing. It’s hard to explain, but this is why I got obsessed with getting laid. I convinced myself that all I wanted was sex, and that I don’t want to be in a relationship because I don’t feel love. I was on every dating app I could find, desperately trying to find a guy for a hookup. Nothing ever happened, and time and time again I was flaked. Pretty soon all I was getting were bots and sugar daddies, and even they were running thin. I stopped using the apps, and I realized just how over saturated with sex I had become. Every now and again I get confused like that, I forget what love is. It’s still a vague concept, like a math problem you just stare at because you don’t know where to start. When that happens I think about hugs, real hugs, big warm hugs. It’s been so long since I’ve had a hug. A real hug that meant something. When I forget how to feel I think of hugs, and I cry. I’m crying now, just writing this. I don’t know how I feel, I’m just lonely. Even if I met someone, I’m not sure I’m worth it. I can only wonder what it’s like to fall in love. I used to think I had crushes, I wish I have so bad. No, I never had. I had close friends, and I pretend I fall in love, but it’s just a joke, gone in a few minutes. Is that a crush? I don’t like it, it’s not a good feeling. It feels like a lie. I want to write forever, write everything I feel all the time. I’m scared, not of what I’d write, but of how little I would write. Some people stick in my head. Strangers I’ve only talked to online. They are so much more popular than me. Is that the right word? Does popularity end when your out of school? They don’t need to be attractive, they’re just the type people like. I wish I was that type. I have so many friends, met so many people who are that type. I’ve never dated, all my friends have but not me. They tell me “dating is bullshit, you’ll just get your heart broke”. I always get my heart broke, I take pills for it. Pills don’t do much you know. They replace chemicals that are missing in your brain. They don’t fix your thoughts, only you can. I try so much, I’ve done so much. I’ve met people online, people who are more sad. There was this one guy, just a kid in college, his first year in a good college. He was, or still is, terrified of white people. I talked to him, I love talking, I live falling down rabbit holes. I talked to him about his life, his emotions. He didn’t speak English well. He moved from Vietnam to China, then from China to America. He didn’t speak English, he never learned Chinese, he could only speak Vietnamese. Well, that’s the only language he was fluent in. His class mates took advantage of him, copying his homework knowing that he could t speak back. He was so afraid, yet here he was. He was talking to me. Who am I? What do I look like? I talked to him all night, I wanted to tell him everything I know about being social. I studied that, being social. I worked hard to find the things people like, and to copy that. Eventually I found that he was really receptive to analogies. He was really good at chemistry, and I knew enough to convert socialism to chemistry. I felt proud, he took my advice. I never talked to him again. I’ve met lots of guys who were nice to me. They were so kind and gave me such good advice. It was strange, they were looking for sex, and ended up teaching lessons. I learned to not trust those people. You have to coax knowledge out of people, you can’t let them give it to you. At some point, I got a bunch of guys telling me that I’m too young, that I should find a boyfriend first. I never got those again. There was this one guy, he was really nice at first. He told me everything he knew about gay sex. I asked him the question of course, but he was more than happy to answer. He told me what to avoid, and what to do. It was not new stuff, but still helpful. I never met anyone outside of the app, I tried really hard but they just didn’t like me enough. This guy, he turned from helpful to obsessed. He started suggesting coffee dates. Suggestions turned to demands. Suddenly he hated me, he called me names said I was stupid and stuck up and naive. Maybe I was, I don’t know. Guys would stalk me for months. I never did anything about it. I loved to talk, to learn about people. I like to explore them, see how they worked. That was dangerous, very dangerous. I met some really twisted people. I met a guy who wanted watch me have sex with a 13 year old. I met a guy who kept asking me if I would cook and eat him. I loved rabbit holes too much. Even then, I made it past them. They stopped talking to me. Some guys still hung on, I tried to talk to them. They only wanted sex, and so did I, but then they wanted nothing. There were these younger guys, my age. Guys my age never liked me. I don’t think any of them haven’t blocked me. I would whore myself out to some guys just to talk to them a little longer. They always left. Guys my age were too popular. What was I doing? I deleted the apps, all of them. Now I sit in silence, constantly checking my phone for new messages. I never get any. When was the last time someone texted me? One texted me yesterday, he moved away. I though he forgot about me. No, I’m the person who likes to talk. I love to talk. I always message people, in desperate hope that they would talk to me. I’d talk about anything, I just wanted to talk. I’m counfused, I don’t know what I want. Is that what a relationship is like? Just talking? Wouldn’t I just bother them? I wish I went to peoples houses more. When was the last time you went to someone’s house? I always feel uncomfortable, I wish I didn’t. I see friends spend time together, I wish I did. I used to, I would always do things to get people to spend time together. To spend time with me. How much is a friend worth? I would go broke because I spent all my money on my friends. My family told me they were taking advantage of me, and that my heart was too big. Maybe that’s why I always broke it. My parents would ask for money, to buy things and they’d pay me back later. I didn’t care about money, I always got rid of it. I’m confused. I’m so scared. I’m moving away. I’m living with strangers when I move away. I’ll be so lonely. My friends will all be gone. It’s my new life, I don’t want to mess it up. But I’m confused. I don’t know what I want. Did I do the right thing by quitting my job? I need the money, but I’m quitting next week. I already said I would. My mom said they won’t hire me back. I’m failing school. I want to write. I’m insane. I got all the help I can get. I need more help. That’s why I make these. I’m begging for help. I have 3 pill bottles, I always run out. What did I do? I’m confused. I promised myself I’d get better? Am I better? I’m so confused. I’m screaming, nothings coming  out. I hear my voice inside. I can’t stop thinking. I hear the door close and my dogs breathe. I feel the bubbles in my stomach and my numb finger. I’m so lonely. People say they’re there for me. People want to help. How can you know me? I want you to know me. I don’t know myself? I want to write forever. Text limit. Please don’t do this to me. No I’m fine, I’m just a little worried. I stopped watching porn and just look up videos of people kissing. I watch tutorial on how to have sex. I cry. They make me feel lonely. I’ve lost it. I’m failing school. I work full time. I workout, when will I like myself? I’m overweight, 10 pounds. I need to lose 30, but 10 will work. I’m not obsessed am I? My parents tell me I’m obsessed. They say if you have mental problems you can go to a clinic. Quite white rooms. I can’t go to war, they don’t accept people with mental problems. I want to write forever. When will I die? People say “god is dead” but was he ever alive? When I’m done I’ll stop feeling lonely, I’ll just go back to feeling bored. Writing most of the day, I have a newspaper story to do. I have a c- so I’ll pass if I turn the story in. I’m avoiding my problems. I’m scared that if I feel in love, I’d get confused. Can I ask someone to take care of me? To help me when I lose my mind? Is that fair when I’m always crazy? Do I have a big heart or am I confused? Teachers used to say I had so much potential. They said that to me but I never heard them say it to other kids. They choked back tears when they said it. I spent most my time in the hall, making the clock tick and the walls melt. Who’s for me? Where’s for me? Where is who is for how and who am I? Please help me. Don’t read this just talk to me. I want to talk. I don’t want to be alone. I’m never like this. I’m confused. I don’t want to be alone forever. I’m not the guy to fall in love. I can’t love. I have isolation tendencies. I depend on my friends so much. I’m glad I have them. When I get mad I cry. I don’t get mad anymore. I just want to write. I’m the kind of guy who pleases everyone. I deleted all the apps. I want sex. That’s all I want is sex. I want to keep writing. When will this end? I have a bottle of NyQuil, I like to drink it. I live with my parents so I can’t host. L, young and dumb. That’s what I always called myself, young and dumb. I cried the day after my first time. I smoked a cigar when neither of us finished. He says he never finished when he fucks. I feel so bad for him. I want to help. When you have anal sex there’s always the possibility of some poop. Use lots of lube. Don’t wash your guts out. When I get lost, I just make a decision and stick to it. I shaved my beard when I lost Kezri to sam. I shaved all the hair on my body. I liked how I felt, so smooth. I’m not crying anymore. I’m 19. This guy said I looked underage, I just shaved. He said I looked like a lesbian. When my face was hard to see they liked me more. I don’t know what I’m saying. Disney is gonna be hard. I hope I meet a guy there. I don’t think I will, I’m a naturalist. In writing there’s naturalism and romanticism. I’m a naturalist. I believe that life isn’t perfect. The rope doesn’t snap after the watch ticks. You wouldn’t know that. Anyways I’m getting off track. What can I do to know who I am? I don’t know if I want to date, or if dating is fair. Have any of you dated? What’s it like? I ask my friends and they all gave me different answers. I liked them, however bleak they were, but they didn’t say much. They told me it’s not worth it. I wonder if that’s how the feel about me. I"

lonely,Advice for a 20 year old?,"Advice for a 20 year old? - Hi everyone! I’m new here and I admire how supportive everyone is in this subreddit. You are all great people and it’s important that you do not forget it.

I’m a 20 y/o guy and on the better looking side (really sorry if I sound immodest, don’t want to be a dick). I go to a good college, I have internships at top financial firms, I was a football star and popular in high school and etc. but I am still having trouble finding a girl nowadays. I understand that I am young but it is troublesome to not have someone caring for me. One of my biggest flaws is that I have severe social anxiety around women in certain situations. I can be flirty and talk well but when I am put in a situation where sex may be invoked I get anxiety (I cannot talk and leads me to vomiting).

I had the ideal girlfriend in high school who was hot, smart, aligned with me religiously and politically, and very caring. I self-sabotaged our relationship due to this anxiety. She talked me into getting medicine for it so I did but that drew side effects of depression and suicidal thoughts. I was put into an institution for awhile and I have since been feeling better but that social anxiety still occurs. I feel like I am too focused on work/school to have the luxury of having someone there for me at the end of the day.

I don’t know if anyone has experienced similar things but it would be great if anyone can offer advice or anything really. Thanks so much."

lonely,Opinions about hook-up culture,Opinions about hook-up culture - Idk about you guys but I think hook-up culture has ruined modern day dating with apps like tinder and bumble. I've just noticed nobody really takes the time to really get to know each other anymore when a new match can be right around the corner. Am I the only one missing those sort of romantic gestures without feeling the pressure to do some netflix and chill?
lonely,im feeling so suicidalsdasdgafhaj,"im feeling so suicidalsdasdgafhaj - im a teenage girl. (btw english isnt my first language). (and i always just joke about my problems but i'll try to be serious lmao) i used to be the funny kid. i was literally known to be the loud one and was always laughing. and when i was kid i had a lot of friends. it's crazy how mental illnesses can change u. it all started when i was like 13 years old. the usual- had bad thoughts, got tired easily, lost my interest in things, started self harming and had a lot of panic attacks. didn't go to school that much anymore and i lost many friends. i mean we were just kids, i can't blame them. who wants to be friends with someone who just ignores and is so down all the time¿ i mean i still had ""friends"" in school. but after school days, after all that pretending to be happy i just went home to cry every day. so i never really hung out with people outside school. of course because of that i wasn't really invited to anything. i just became the person people little bit talked to at school but they wouldn't ACTUALLY be my friend. that's why i feel little bit bad about whining how LoNeLy i am, cus i've still always had some people around me. but i still feel so lonely. 
i feel like i don't even exist. i drown my thoughts on watching some netflix or youtube or just scrolling through internet. every day for hours. i can go weeks without seeing anyone and sometimes during that time i literally forget how to interact with people lol. i still have two friends but they both live kinda far.  and i have some internet friends since i literally live on internet. i know many people don't have ANYONE and i know i should be very grateful for those 2 irl friends. and i'm trying.
i've been in this depression for few years now. i always think that some day it's gonna be better, but every year it just gets worse. now i'm at the point where i see nothing when thinking about future. i don't care about anything. i have no interest in anything. i feel like i'm just forced to be here and i don't see the reasons why. i'm so done that most days i can't even cry. i often have the urge to grab pills or knife. i'm trying SO HARD not to do it but every day i feel more hopeless. i'm almost starting to accept death. it doesn't even scare me anymore and i feel so ready. but at the same time i think WHAT IF i could turn my life to something else. what if one day i could enjoy my life again or love someone again. i'm slowly losing all those hopeful thoughts. and yeah i would've never thought i'd write my problems somewhere like this but i don't have anyone that i could seriously talk to.

sorryy this was probably too long and full of meaningless shit lmao"
lonely,I was finally invited to something but I just felt really awkward,"I was finally invited to something but I just felt really awkward - Ive always had trouble with being social and I eventually got used to being on my own and having no friends or anyone to talk to. I’m 24 now so when you live this way for that long you just adjust to that lonely lifestyle. I’m also scared of being seen by people as I hate how I look, how I sound and how I generally act towards people. I am kind but that’s all I really have going for me. 

Anyways I will get on topic. I’ve been working at this office job for more than a year now and I have been trying my best to talk with people and get to know them and just trying to be involved for a change. I’m not very good at it and never know what to say so sometimes there are awkward silences which makes me feel worse and hide away for weeks until I get the courage to do it again. 

Today I was invited to a little Christmas get together for a small meal with only a small handful of people. I was a bit shocked but I happily accepted, however I got really anxious and while everyone was talking I was mostly just sat there listening. I did try my best to join in but people started to seem disinterested in what I had to say, which is quite common. I felt awkward the entire way through, and after a while we said our goodbyes. Now I can’t stop thinking about how bad I fucked up, but even if I had a redo I’d still fuck it up. 

As I’m typing this I just now received a message from the person who invited me and they said “thanks for coming!” Maybe this is all just in my head? I don’t know 😑"

Some days worse than others and other days I’m kinda ok. I’m always sad. I feel lonely not necessarily in company. But in being understood. No one has every understood me. I tried to open up an infinite amount of times with an infinite amount of rejections. My life has become a walking nightmare. Not that of terror. But in that of nothingness. Deafening emptiness and silence. I know not what else to do. You can name it and I have done it. Few people have entered my life and chose to stay. They are empathetic but few care enough to dive into this turbulent ocean that is my soul. I feel like I’m too much. I value depth to such an infinite depth. I feel so alone. I’m an enigma and I can’t do anything about it. It is wrong to force people to see me. To just see me. I want to be seen. Even just once. Please see me.

lonely,'Morality' of making friends as a lonely person who has an SO?,"'Morality' of making friends as a lonely person who has an SO? - 1) It is not that I don't have friends. But the ones I have here, we don't text and I feel excluded coz we don't text, I mean we hangout and stuff but that's it? I feel close to people via communicating often.

2) I text my SO but it feels like a one sided convo, not that he isn't trying to put in effort to talk, but it's not something natural for him to share about his day unless I keep probing. Everyone tells me to breakup with my SO but when I tried, he said that I am 'going back to old habits by giving up the relationship instantly'. 

3) Me and SO have this ongoing 'quarrel', basically I met someone new who has a gf, but my SO keeps saying that it's weird to be having 'useless banter' over text with this new male friend (i didn't initiate, it's the other guy who does, it's stuff about the weather or just random ongoings with life). SO says this guy might have ulterior motives because of the 'useless banter', and doesn't understand why I continue the convos despite this. I explained point 1 to SO but he still doesn't understand. 

It's currently day 3 of no contact with the 'new friend', I'm not dying, and instead focus more effort into my existing relationship. But i think about it a lot, and I have thoughts of caving in because I get along well with the 'new friend', cos of similar hobbies. It's like things I know my SO won't be happy for me because he can't relate. Idk if  i should reach out again, but I already told my SO that I wouldn't do it :( My SO said that he gave up on telling me not to text but I just shared with him that the new friend wanted to go over to my place to just chill and order food but i said no, and now he's convinced that this friend just want sex with me despite having a gf.

lonely,Overreacting?,"Overreacting? - My SO and I usually are in communication 24/7. If it’s not texting, it’s Snapchat. If it’s not Snapchat, it’s random phone calls. Monday night he left me on read. Understandable as it was close to the time he usually goes to sleep. He did not text me at all yesterday minus a text asking if we could meet for a drink which I answered no to seeing as it was very late. Today he responded to my double text (I was the last to text last night and sent another this morning), but has been very dry. This coupled with an intense wave of depression that hit my starting Sunday morning has left me basically unable to function correctly. The loneliness I feel is almost unbearable. It’s only been a day of minimal communication and I am already feeling distance. Why am I so needy? Is this neediness? Is it an appropriate reaction during a time of intense depression?"

Yes you are right I don't know what you have been through. I cannot go through what you have been through. Being so strong through that you already have achieved wonders :). 

As for me I have my share too. It's hard things doesn't get easier does it. But it is what it is. We cannot really fight against the flow of energy. If it's pulling too hard just try to let go rather than resist.. again easier said than done. But when we keep resisting we lose other oprtunities to grab the forces that is coming towards us.. recently I realised it. Life is beautiful there are people out there who cares for you more than you can imagine. There are things out there which you can explore. Just be you! And you will know what I mean :) I would like to share what happened to me and why I am really hopeful and want to share the good vibes with you all.

lonely,The difficulty of making friends as an adult,"The difficulty of making friends as an adult - I'm 28m and despite finally reaching a point in life where I'm not constantly worried about money I feel more lonely than ever. Recently I had to distance myself from my old group of friends because of their substance abuse and broke up with my now ex-GF due to other stuff, so I've suddenly ended up having very little human contact.

I've tried to be active with my hobbies, attending irl stuff related to them as often as I can but my evening shifts and other things often get in the way. I like the people I meet through my hobbies but basically never talk to them outside these meetings. 

So, despite having theoretically a rather active life I don't really seem to talk to anyone in my day to day life. When I get home I don't usually have anyone to talk to, even online. I can't deny that sometimes it's very unmotivating to do anything when I can't share it with anyone. And being home just feels very bleak.

The worst thing, however, is that I often feel that things won't get better anymore. These hobby related acquaintances will eventually leave too once they find something better to do. I have no idea where to even meet people otherwise. I have a three day weekend coming up and I'm terrified of it because I have absolutely nothing to do and I know the loneliness will creep up on me then. Even on a larger life scale I have nothing to look up for, just going to work and then going home to be alone."

lonely,My coworkers didn’t celebrate my birthday,"My coworkers didn’t celebrate my birthday - There are 6 of us employees. I was hired several months ago and in that time we have celebrated 3 birthdays, and we are talking custom birthday cakes and decor, and lunch ordered from a favorite restaurant of the birthday boy or girl. A signed card. Even if the person being celebrated took their day off, we celebrated the day before. The most recent bday was last month. They have always been semi-surprise celebrations.

Everyone knew it was my birthday today, because I am taking the day off and it came up in our staff meeting last Friday. My boss asked me into their office on Monday, and asked what type of food I like. 

Needless to say, I didn’t pack food yesterday and looked forward to the little lunch. I live far from family, so that was going to be really my one celebration this year. Especially now that I’m 27 and birthdays are supposed to be less of a big deal. 

Well I sat at my desk. My boss left the office around 11. I figured it was my semi-surprise, maybe to pick up the lunch mentioned earlier in the week? But by 2, they still weren’t back, I was really hungry, and just decided to go get food. I came rushing back in case something was happening. 

My boss got back around 3, so I held out for maybe something at the end of the day. No comment from my boss, business as usual. 5pm comes, 2 coworkers verbally wished me a happy bday by this point, and I packed up and drove home. 

Today is my bday, and this morning I’m trying really hard not to be so disappointed. Missing out on a celebration for an unexplained reason seems to be stinging more on the actual day of. 

I know its important to be professional, acknowledge it’s just a workplace, and move on. Lots of people don’t give a crap about their own birthdays, much less anyone else’s. I know that. I don’t want to bring it up tomorrow because I don’t want to seem bitter or make people feel guilty. But I am bitter and definitely feeling much less appreciated now. 

I definitely got my expectations too high, but nothing? No card? 

I’ve been looking forward to my work party since I saw how all-out my office goes months ago. It’s making me go all introspective and question my relationships, which is not what I want to do on this quiet solitary birthday. 

I guess I just wanted to vent. I wish I was a person that didn’t care about their birthday. I’m glad I took today off."

lonely,Am I turning Insane?,"Am I turning Insane? - So I have been particularly isolated lately. I never had much contact with people (most of that because of my parents strict religious views and their influence on me), the only contact I really had was when at school, which I have been 2 days each week for the last two years (Swiss apprenticeship system), but since my only two friends have left me for my rival which pushed me out of my group this summer I feel really isolated. 

I have always had a great imagination. But lately I have started to talk to „myself“ in my head pretty often. Most of the conversations I have are between me and „myself who pretends to be person A“. It‘d start with me looking forward to some future day where I could talk to person A, and then I‘d imagine what I could talk about with them. And that‘s where I just kinda... start talking to „myself“? At one point I‘d get aware of the fact that I haven’t actually been talking to person A, but to „myself“ instead. So I‘d wonder if something was wrong with me, and usually even start talking to „myself“ about it..

So my question is, are other people experiencing similar things, and should I be worried about myself? Am I turning Insane?"

lonely,Forever is only a second.,"Forever is only a second. - ADD &amp; PTSD have completely ruined my circadian rhythm. I don't want to change that, never have. But if you combine that with loneliness, like on a soul-crushing level, this shit is starting to make me go bonkers. Here's the thing, I'm married, happily. I have a good life, minus being isolated due to a disability. And I mean isolated. I'm catered to and cared for, but there's no one up at night, and that's when I'm at my best in every way. My spouse isn't backward, the way I am.   


So, check this out: Throw a friend in the mix right? With the same 2 diagnoses. They're there with you until sunrise, laughing at nothing, playing music, talking about life and how our anxiety is a piece of shit, and it's fucking platonic, man. And you're in love, but actually platonically, and that's a really special thing; to you, anyway. Fast forward and then you get best friend rings, like the magical duo the two of you are, and the word ""friend"" has a depth to it, like never before. And you just get a break from living in your head, for the first time in twenty-six years,  


You're together 8-9 hours a night for around four months if not longer - because insomnia/ADD makes lying down feel like you're in restraints, especially if you're in a wheelchair, and currently, need help transferring. We just vibed, man. We did. And it was magical. Then this person says they're moving soon, after Christmas in fact, which actually means they'll miss your birthday.  


And so now you're clinging and pleading with anyone who'll listen, ""Please, keep my friend around. This one's pretty fuckin' dope, God."" And you just never know, and you still don't. Then you're shaking your fist at the sky because you weren't supposed to care or feel any fucking thing at all. You've had trauma in your head for so long you don't really mind the fog, and loving anything means eventually mourning its death or departure, and you knew this. Lived by it.   


  
BUT WAIT! There's more!

&amp;#x200B;

The shit was so good, it made the fear of loss fucking die. That has not happened; not once. And then you're breathing, and seeing, and accepting, not living in a state of resistance.  


And then, you're ghosted. Dropped. After all that time, and you don't why. This is the 2nd person you've ever put faith in in your entire life, other than your spouse. And they're just fucking gone and you're fucking neighbors. Not really, but it only takes like 3 minutes to get to their place, but they're too nonchalant to want you over.   
 

And now it's been close to two months, no call, text, nothing. One or two, but everything starts to fade. And they've changed. They're cooped up and coping, and they get angry that you blow up their phone because you're worried, and you give a fuck whether or not they're staring at the ceiling thinking too hard.  Then the abandonment trauma goes in full swing and they don't fucking get it. They've chosen to be numb, only this time, they're numb to your feelings, too.  


Forever is a second, guys. Forever is gone. Please help me close this fucking door, y'all. It's so fucking heavy. A friend has never meant that much to me, ever. And they were probably lying, but you KNOW for a time, they weren't. Now you're just stuck figuring out which ones were real or which ones were fake, because you can't fucking help it, and your spouse is affected too because they also cared for this person. They, too, wake in the night not knowing how to help you heal.

AND MY MARRIAGE WILL ALWAYS COME FUCKING FIRST.   


IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE, AND WE FUCKING LOVED YOU.  


YOU DON'T GET TO HURT MY SPOUSE.   
I LOVE YOU, BUT SHAME ON YOU.

NO MORE.  


Still, please help me. Someone human, help me."

(The NLN is a requirement for my college program I want to get into.) After that went into a deep depression. August I got into a horrible car accident by myself on the highway. Should’ve died tbh in that accident. A lot of things go through my mind that night of the accident. After that happened I went into a deeper depression where I didn’t want to see anyone or do anything. It was the icing on the cake. I decided to take a semester off from college and focus on my mental health. Last week I took my NLN again for the 7th time. Failed again... I feel like such a failure and I don’t think me becoming an x-day will ever happen cause I cannot pass a simple fucking test. 

This upcoming spring I wanted to go back to school but have zero motivation to do so. I don’t know where I’m going in life or what to do from here. I’m very unhappy and I feel like I don’t have purpose. I feel alone and i feel like I can’t talk to my mom, best friend, or anyone cause I feel like no one is truly going to get it. 

Sorry for my long ass post."
lonely,I broke up with my girlfriend,"I broke up with my girlfriend - My family hated her. They said I could do better. This killed me because I am so close with them. Our relationship wasn’t going well anyways - I didn’t feel the passion, the intimacy, the drive...but she’s my absolute best friend. My ultimate person I talk to, she knows my past.  I didn’t feel she made me a better person or a better version of myself when we were together. 

So I broke up with her the other night and I feel so bad. I feel so lonely. I feel like I have no other friends and that I can’t talk about my emotions. I wish she was the right one, I wish it works out. I’m feeling so lonely without her company and I just don’t know what to do."

Sucks. But expected it."
lonely,LAST CALL FOR LOVE M4M,"LAST CALL FOR LOVE M4M - LAST CALL TO BE MY LOVE

Published December 3rd, 2019 

To Who It May Concern and To Whom Will Help.

My name is Paul Anthony Bergen-Wayman. I am a gay boy who needs a mate. For the past 8 years I have cried reclusively, and have become more than broken, I have become fractured as my 20's burn away crying &amp; surviving. Without sharing my life with him, I am living a life or romantic deprivation. This chapter of my life needs to end.

Using a combination of dating sites, forums, events, and both online and offline communication, I haven't fallen in love no matter how friendly and affectionate I was.

I have been deprived of so much due to not having a SO. I have dropped out of college, I have disassociated from organizations, I have been terminated from jobs. I have been deprived of countless simple pleasures being just one boy of two. I have been deprived of normal human activities and a career path. Due to a series of circumstances and bad directions my true self is now buried under a overburden of despair and despondency.

I am done with platonic relationships, and have given up on the insanity that love will just happen when I least expect it, or that one of my plattonic gay friend will blossom into a boyfriend. Crying for romance has become a daily affirmation. My friends know full well that I cry for love and I need love.

There is nothing to live for if I'm not monogamously coupled. You will not change my mind on this. I am dead set on being a SO to another male. Denying this is existential fraud, and a violation of my true essence.

I have cried enough. Each Christmas, I yearn to make out with him under the mistletoe, and each Christmas I have been deprived of this and countless other simple pleasures.

Last Call. If I don't consider myself monogamously coupled by December 24th, 2019, I am going to truncate my life. I will disappear into the night to end this deprived, miserable experience. Eight years of searching for a boyfriend and false starts, flings &amp; dates will culminate in a dead body, an idea, and the worst Xmas present imaginable - if I am not monogamously coupled by Christmas Day 2019.

Where is the minority who know what they have before it's gone? Where are the gay males also crying for love?

Most importantly, are you going to help my cause?

Update November 18th, 2019:

Having no mate to look forward to after a hard day at work / school, and being deprived of the love other people are sharing all around me doesn’t affect?

I have lost friends because I hit on them, I have lost the will to improve myself without a mate (ive frozen personal growth because years of outward improvement has not closed the deal).

You are only seeing the snapshot of me today after these 8 years of deprived loneliness. I can assure you that you would feel very similar after 8 years of deprivation.

You can see my other posts on reddit see that internet preservation is #2, that is the only other thing worth doing. Love is #1.

I was courted by a Sex and Love Addicts Anoumous Group, how can I be addicted to something I’ve never had?

I know what incel behavior is, I have done my best to run away from that up until now. I am not looking for benefits, a sugar daddy, I want his body and mind. I will live with him under the bridge or in a homeless encampment. I need his embrace. I need this bitcrushing to end.

Also, I tell myself everyday “I deserve him”, “I am a beautiful, extremely intelligent guy that deserves another beautiful, extremely intelligent guy”.

Like an extremely desperate employer who hire anyone who meets the bare minimums (trucking industry), I’ve become the same way, I’ll take anyone to start and then upon finding a more compatible &amp; loving guy, Fire the lesser.

I look at people making a difference in the world, and think “they have love”.

What else do I have to lose for not having his love? 10 MORE YOUNG YEARS? My Digital Life &amp; Legacy? My legs? Do I have to be gangraped, beaten and crippled before love?

Need a litmus test? If the UN signed a pact that prohibited me to have a love, I would still fall in love with him. The desire for his love is so strong that I will go against global superpowers. Liberty or Death? How about Love or Death!!

I keep my word. December 24th will be my last day alive without him, so I don’t have to endure another Christmas of deprivation. I have 3 PAINLESS ways to terminate myself, as I have had enough pain. If you are going to help me close the deal you have until December 24th to do it.

Let’s get my story on the News. MSM is always looking for LGBT stories. If you are a journalist, I am worth it. My story is worth putting your career or standing on the line."

After awhile my insecurities take over and I think that I'm not good enough for anybody and that I'm not worthy of a romantic relationship. Regardless of how in love i am I don't pursue anybody because it's so ingrained in me that everybody leaves in the end.

lonely,Been miserable for too long,"Been miserable for too long - I don’t really know why I’m typing this to complete strangers, but I feel like I just need to get it out to someone. I’m currently a  and have always felt solitude or as soon as Life seems to get better things just fall apart. My parents divorced when I was 3, so I never really had a parental connection or felt what it was like to have a mother as at best I only saw her maybe 2 to 3 times a year and we aren’t really close. My dad worked really hard to provide for me and my sister and my stepmom at the time. After being through many divorces and having multiple stepmoms, my sister left me and my dad when I was around 8 to go live with my mom due to issues she had with my dad (my dad wasn’t her genetic father but raised her.) 

Soon after my dad would meet someone and she would end up being my stepmom for 6ish years that we’re usually filled with many breakups. It was a really toxic relationship and tbh I hope my dad would just move on. I had 2 stepbrothers that were a little older then me and I eventually got close with them. But as time would have it, my stepmom would eventually divorce my dad and at that point I just felt like making connections with anyone meant nothing anymore.  I moved away from my lifetime school and had to start over. I’ve never had any romantic relationships and even now the friends that I do have don’t see me as their #1 or even #3 friend. 

This year has also been really rough as my loneliness has come to an all time high. Losing my favorite uncle and seeing my dad also struggle with just living also sucks. Me and him are pretty much the black sheep of the family and are cut off from everyone else. It doesn’t only end there as I’ve suffered with what the doctor says is bronchitis but I’ve been coughing up large amounts of pure blood for the past 3 months and I just seem like life is getting harder and harder and I feel like sometimes it’s not even worth it anymore. I have no motivation in school and barely get any sleep anymore. Not feeling loved or having anyone to talk to has really started to take its toll. Not expecting anyone to see this but I felt I had to get it off my chest. Sorry if I sound like a dramatic spoiled kid."

lonely,Why should I live?,"Why should I live? - Long story - no TLDR sorry.

I’m from a third world country. I’m studying in the USA.

My brother was a naturally gifted painter. I loved reading and geography. My brother was encouraged to hone his talent - my parents bought him painting supplies. They never bought me a book. 

In my teens, I started playing the guitar. I wrote a couple of songs and recorded them too. They were never acknowledged by my mother. My dad had passed away by then. I was never encouraged to play - I was just told I was wasting my time.

My brother painted something - my dad would bring his coworkers home to show off that painting.

I worked hard - I was reading books that were two grades above me. I knew obscure places in Europe before you could look them up on the internet. I was told I was wasting my time “reading” and not studying.

I was winning College guitar competitions - not even once was I congratulated or asked about them.

I went to study engineering under pressure from my parents even though my heart was in the arts. My brother did the same. He finished. I dropped out.

My brother became a cop at 25. Everyone’s proud of him. My mother especially. 

My sister is divorced. I saw it coming. I defended her while my mother and brother blamed her. My brother fat shamed her all the time even though she is beautiful and slim. My parents never asked him to stop. I defended her - I was told that I do not understand what’s going on. I stood up to her. I was told I was too naive and young. How old do you have to be to know the difference between basic right and wrong? I fought with my family. Every single day. That what they were doing to my sister was wrong and that I wouldn’t keep quiet about it. 

At 26, I quit my lowly job to plan to move to the USA. I was told that I was worthless and stupid. I was told that I was only worth being a tuk tuk driver.

I got accepted into a Top 25 college with a small scholarship. My mom didn’t congratulate me.

No one in my family talks to me anymore. I haven’t spoken to my brother in 15 years. My sister still lives with my mother and thinks there is nothing wrong with the way she was treated. She is upset with me for becoming an “enemy” to my mother. There isn’t a single person in this world who is proud of me. 

In college I see everyone and how smart they are. It comes naturally to them. I want to work hard but my brain tells me I shouldn’t because it’ll be a waste of time. I waste all my time with mindless entertainment. If I don’t get a job before I graduate I can’t live in the US anymore. If I go back, I’ll be worse off than before.

Tell me, what’s the point of living?"

lonely,I’m told so much but still feel so alone,"I’m told so much but still feel so alone - This is a long story but I’m leaving it here in case anyone wants to read it. This entire ordeal has absolutely consumed my life as of late. 

I transferred schools last year and met this really charming girl. I never really noticed or talked to her during first semester but come second semester we really started to hit it off. We would sit and work together the majority of each day, especially Fridays when neither of us had anything going on. I didn’t think much of it at the time but I liked spending time with her, she was funny and didn’t seem to get upset or bored by me.

At the beginning of this year there was this new guy who came to the school, and he was super cool as well. Both the girl and I became good friends with him and we would all hang out together from time to time. One time when it was just me and him hanging out he asked if I was interested in anyone and I finally realized I had a crush on her, he joked about it a little once I told him but he seemed understanding for the most part and let me know if she ever said anything about me to him.

Flash forward a few weeks and this guy starts talking about things with this girl I never heard about before- her past relationships, her home life, really personal shit I would’ve liked to hear as well. Eventually I find out that her past relationship was emotionally manipulative and learned that she doesn’t open up as a result, but I’ve noticed from experienced that if trusted and pressed hard enough she’ll let you in on some private stuff. 

I finally take my friend’s advice and start facetiming her nightly, something she seemed happy doing, and it went on like this for at least a month or two until we got close enough where I decided I’d tell her how I felt. We were sending eachother wholesome memes on instagram while communicating verbally on facetime, this is when I finally messaged her “i love you”. She didn’t reject me, so that was promising, she sent me heart emojis and giggled uncontrollably, eventually we said our goodbyes and went to sleep. 

The next day after school I shoot her a message apologizing for being so forward since I know she hates that stuff and is uncomfortable with it, but she sends me a huge message explaining how she loves me back but doesn’t know how to show it, I told her that I get it and it’s not something that worries me. We talked about it later that night on facetime and she agreed to work with me to try and start feeling comfortable in a relationship again, but it’s been almost 2 months since then and we’ve gotten nowhere, in fact, she’s been talking to me less.

She’s still talking with the new guy about shit and laughing about it in group calls, and doing so in a manner she’s never done with me or our inside jokes; I’ve been asking if she wants to facetime and she’ll say “in a minute” but that minute never comes; she hasn’t talked to me for 3 days straight even when I’ve been sitting 5 feet away from her, she only seems interested in talking to this ONE guy and his friends, and they all hang out after school once I leave. 

I feel like shit. I’ve had been cutting myself because her words are meaningless to me but all I want to do is hear them, it’s all completely pointless, I still feel this way but the blade got dull so I threw it out. It’s a shitty habit I wouldn’t recommend it. I’m so fucking jealous of what they have and only want things to go back to normal. I’m so obsessed and invested in someone who, despite their words, will probably never show me love back. She was the only thing I had going in my life that made me want to keep on living but now I don’t even feel like it’s worth keeping this shit going anymore."

She hasn’t spoken to me since. - I feel like a toy that was thrown away when she was done. The one person that made me feel truly appreciated just forgot about me because she found a boyfriend. 

I’m happy that she’s happy with him. I just wish I was actually important to her, instead of all these false pretences that made me feel appreciated.

Now I’m lonely. Nobody talks to me any more. I just miss feeling wanted."
lonely,Casual relationships suck,"Casual relationships suck - I'm a 26 year old woman who has never been in anything resembling a relationship. I've been through my fair share of struggles which have made it difficult to date. From surgeries to crippling depression my life has been messy and I just didn't want to get anyone caught up in all that. Even though I crave romance and companionship as much as anyone, it's always been easier to keep things casual. I don't usually have a hard time detaching sex from emotion, but my most recent fuck buddy is making it very hard.

He is sweet, adorable, affectionate, and we have a ton in common. My stupid heart races when he texts me. I get this goofy grin when I see him. I literally cannot stop thinking of him and I absolutely hate it. The worst part is that he's only interested in a casual relationship as well, so there's no way anything will come of it. Plus I'm afraid that the only reason I think I like him is because he's nice to me and to not fuck up the good thing we have going.

So, here I am, lonely as hell, thinking of how much I want to be with him right now, while actively not texting him so I don't do anything to scare him away. It's nauseating."
lonely,Im going to be alone forever,"Im going to be alone forever - I am extremely socially awkward and a bit of a loner. just the thought of going up to someone to talk or doing something out of my comfort zone makes me scared as hell. i barely have anyone in my life who im close with, i dont have any irl friends, just a couple online, and other than that i only really have my parents, nobody else. im dying from isolation, part of me wants human connections and affection so badly. every time i try to get close to someone i become so scared and get the urge to run, i can never feel safe with anyone. on top of that ive barely been in relationships and the ones i have been in werent good, i just feel so unwanted and unloved. i feel like theres somthing wrong with me, a reason why nobody wants to be my friend or anything, i dont deserve happiness. i cant even establish relationships with other people so whats the point of going on."
lonely,Stop fucking leading people on,"Stop fucking leading people on - Long story short, I went on a date with a chick. I told her I enjoyed it and asked her on a second one, she said she really liked it too but she’ll be really busy for the next week but we should definitely go out again. Later that week, she isn’t snapping me nearly as much as usual. When you literally go from snapping someone 100+ times a day to twice, if that, you start to think they’re losing interest. But maybe she’s busy, so I just left it to that and then waited. That was a week ago and she’s been talking less and less it’s so painful. Just tell someone you’re not interested if you’re not, fucking easy. Stop leading them on because it’s the most annoying shit on the planet. Fuck"

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

lonely,Friendship is fucking bullshit,"Friendship is fucking bullshit - I really having friends since they all have their own friends and friend group and I'm just the fucking outcast of everything. Conversations: them only. Hanging out: only them. Me asking them to hang: them saying they're busy and 1 hour later I see them at a pool fucking party. So what is the point of making friends? If they aren't gonna care about you? What is the point of making friends if they fucking want to hang out with you? So let me tell you friends or loners. Maybe being isn't lonely if you have bad friends like most of us. But if you find a friend that invites you into their house or hangs out with you, never ever leave them since they are a true friend and they are hard to find nowadays."
lonely,Relapsed loneliness,"Relapsed loneliness - Hardest year, started off with my wife cheating on me and ending a 7 year marriage.

Sunday, loneliness started to creep in and I realized how I have no one anymore and can't find anyone to text or talk too. I have been keeping my feelings in and focused on work and my son we have. I can't take seeing him cry when leaving my place because he doesn't want to leave....it was her decision to cheat and give up on the realationship but he doesn't deserve a broken family &lt;- I know this feeling. 

Each day is now getting harder to stay in reality."
lonely,Where do I start?,"Where do I start? - First off, I’m a 21 year old male college student. I want to start by saying that the last few months have been an improvement for me in my mindset. I’ve been seeing a therapist who I like a lot, and I’ve learned that one of the unhealthiest things I was doing was comparing myself to others. I’ve been staying off of most social media as much as I can, and I now realize the negative effects that it was having on me. I’ve also tried to stop wasting my time on my phone. Rather than worrying about what everyone else my age seems to be doing, I’m now thinking about what I really want. So, these may all seem like good things, and they are, but also, with the removal of a lot of time I’ve wasted on social media, my mind now has a lot of time (too much time) to think. I ruminate constantly about future relationships, future jobs, what I want to do with my life, etc. But most of all, I think I’m just lonely.

I haven’t had a romantic relationship in almost 6 years, and I don’t really know how to meet a girl. I feel pretty comfortable when actually in conversations, but I’m just never one to engage a conversation with a stranger. I don’t really want to just talk to/ flirt with/ randomly try to pick up girls, that’s not really how I am at all. I strive for a much deeper connection in a relationship, almost unexplainable by words. It’s difficult, because it feels like a lot of other people my age just prefer random hookups and sex in relationships, and that’s not at all what I want. If I couldn’t envision a long-term relationship, I would never consider dating someone.

I’m very much an “old soul”; I’ve been called that by people and it’s actually something I take as a compliment and am proud of. While other people might prefer partying or going to the bar or club, I’d much prefer a nature walk. I love old music, old style houses, I even think I feel more comfortable talking to people my grandparents’ age than my age because my personality is closer to them. Most of the time, I feel fine alone, but recently, I feel overwhelmed and I really want to make some friends that feel like I do and meet a girl that feels like I do. These feelings are a lot worse now that I only have one semester left of school, I guess because I feel like I won’t be able to find love and find close friends after school. I know I’m still young and have a lot of time, but my recent existential crisis on top of all of this makes me feel like I’m in a rush to create relationships and find my true meaning in life. I feel like I can’t waste any more time.

I know I’m a really deep thinker and a really deep feeler, especially for a boy. But I know there are people out there that feel the same, I just really don’t know how to find them. It seems that everyone else my age just wants to party all the time and have fake relationships to post all over social media. I just think and feel really differently, and sometimes I feel like I’m in a different universe. I just want something real more than anything, and I’ve never really found that. I do believe in true love and I do believe I’ll find someone someday who perfectly understands me. I’m ready to start trying to find that somebody; I just don’t really know where to start. Sorry if this post is a little long or unclear, I think I said everything I want to.  And thank you to anybody who read this far!"

lonely,I think that I'm lonely and I need your advice,"I think that I'm lonely and I need your advice - I'm writing this so you'll understand my story because I really need to fill my loneliness that I cant get rid of no matter how much I try and I need to deal with it now before its too late. so I really need your help.

I'm currently 19 and at young age up to 11 12 I had many friends and was super social, almost all day I was out playing with friends and at some point everyone turned against me and casted me away, almost my entire class and they did super terrible things to me that left scars that are behind me. At that time I stopped going out with friends and I didnt go to school 50% of the time(studied at home), told myself that I dont need them and I can be happy staying home and playing video games and enjoying stuff by myself. That continued kind of up until to this day.

I finished school 1.5 years ago and right now in virtual university, I watch luctures at home and study from books. I tried physical class once but its same for virtual for me, I only listen to the professor and dont mind the stuff around, so I told myself why bother with physical. I also make my money online with companies I've founded over the years so money isnt a problem for me, I have only online emploies.

Couple of months ago I got into a group of friends and we went out almost every week but it felt ""normal"" and I wasnt really happy and connected to them on deep level, I always asked myself ""Is that it? Is that how I should feel with friends around?"". I also had girlfriend that was 10 years older than me for 3 months we had fun and played games together and talked about life with her and other stuff but I broke up with her because after a while I felt it was too boring and we didnt have strong of connection anymore.

I wish I had friends/gf that I can enjoy life with like in the animes but I dont know anymore if its just a fantasy or it can happen for real. maybe its too late for me.

Just to make this clear, I can go outside and talk to people with no problem but I want to find out good friends or girlfriend that I can connect with in a deep level and enjoy life together but I dont know how and where, most of the people that I talk with are in the computer or myself. 

Please give me advice what to do, I really need it."

lonely,I like being lonely,"I like being lonely - I want to post this here but not for the reason majority of people do, and no this isn’t an edgy post I just want to vent and hopefully someone can give me any advice or can relate to this, so here it goes:
Last year I finished high school and one of my worries was being able to make friends, and not because I can’t but because I didn’t want to. So this year I started it and made a group not because I actually cared or was interested in them, the opportunity was just there ok (I dropped out later so didn’t get to much into it)
Anyways I thought I was gonna miss my friends from school but turns out.. I didn’t, I didn’t care about them at all, they moved on and so did I. And I think I should be concerned but I’m just curious/very confused because it’s really new for me. I even tried to make friends online but I get bored and stop talking to them. So now I don’t have friends and I don’t talk to people online because I don’t want to ghost anyone.
I knew I was kind of asocial but it has never been on this level, I feel like I’m losing my empathy towards everything and it’s lowkey kinda scary, I talked about this with my therapist but didn’t got much further, like my sister was born this year and I don’t feel anything towards her, and I realized the same with my other siblings like I just don’t care about them at all, we are like strangers living on the same roof.
Has anyone been trough a situation like this before?"
lonely,I can't keep people around,"I can't keep people around - I feel like there's definitely something wrong with me. I can't keep people. Even my best friends I thought who would be there forever have cut me off. I know there's something wrong with me, I feel toxic, that people keep leaving me. I am working on many of my issues but still it's really difficult to keep people. I think maybe I do look for people who don't want me or people who are hard to get along with, maybe I just view them as more of a challenge and more exciting, but I always try to get what I can't have. But honestly I feel so lonely and I've gotten to the point where I can't tell a lot of people because it's too ""taxing"" and strenuous and I don't want to burden anyone but really I feel like I need more help than anyone is willing to give me. I want to start taking anxiety meds, I don't know where to get them though."
lonely,A hard working person that never got the respect he deserved.,"A hard working person that never got the respect he deserved. - Can someone please explain to me if im having a good life or a bad life:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Good aspects of my life:

&amp;#x200B;

My parents saved me from starving to death as a baby because i was a very very picky eatter.

&amp;#x200B;

I get fed, clothing, a bed to sleep in, a roof over my head and etc.

&amp;#x200B;

My parent want to help me whenever i need help.

&amp;#x200B;

I got A's and B's in school with no sick days at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I created a working storyline 2D Platformer game in under 6 months with actual code not drag and drop.

&amp;#x200B;

I finished 2 almost 3 college classes so far in computer Science.

&amp;#x200B;

Im in the top 40 or the top 400 most hardworking students in my class (I dont remember which group im exactly).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bad Aspects of my life

&amp;#x200B;

I have High Functioning Autism i deal with all the time. :""(

&amp;#x200B;

I was bullied and shunned my whole life from my neighborhood to school and etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I have very protective parents who love me and care for me but wont leave me alone. They still treat me like im 12 when im a 20 year old young adult. Also they take my shit i bought with my own money because i didnt do something they asked of me to do. Im basically my parents house slave which im suppose to do chores if im not working on my collrge class. Also when im having a happy day for once in my life somehow something pisses me off its either my parents, work or mad at people for not accepting me.

&amp;#x200B;

If i acted as if i was a different person i would get more friends but when i act like myself i get shunned and laughed at for what i like to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to make friends in highschool and trying in college and still everyone shuns me to the way i act. I also was the guy who did all the work in group projects eventhough my group members lied about everything saying they did work as a team with me but they didnt. their phone was more important than our project.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to make friends at work and no one understands me so they told my boss that they thought i was a stalker and i got written up for it. Which now that makes me the less important guy at my work.

&amp;#x200B;

I work basically 36 hours a week with one day off for my college class and no freetime to hang out with friends or to do what i like to do.

&amp;#x200B;

idk if i am having a good life or not but please i want your suggestions cause i feel like my life is hell for me right now and because of this im a pist off, depressed child all the time with no one to go to for help to be my comfort companion."
lonely,I am so sick of this,"I am so sick of this - I can’t make friends, I literally can’t. I’m good enough at socializing only to get to the point of acquaintances, no more. I don’t know how to get past this point which eventually makes me lose those people too. I see everyone in society fitting in and having their own group of friends while I rot off mentally alone. I’m just so sick and tired of this never ending cycle."
lonely,I want to love someone,"I want to love someone - I've never been in a relationship that lasts longer than a year because I've never lovedd any of the people i have dated in the past so I always end up breaking up with them. The only reason I've dated anyone is because they showed interest in me first and whenever someone gives me any sort of affection it makes me convince myself I love them. The last person I dated I broke up with a bit over 2 years ago, and I haven't even had a crush on anyone since then. I'm male, and I don't have a single female friend, and haven't even exchanged more than a few words with any girl that I don't already know because I'm just to nervous and awkward to try to talk to anyone. I've been so lonely and depressed for the past year and a half or so, and I really want to talk to people but I just dont have anything to say. Even when people start talking to me i csmt keep it going because every thought just leaves my head and all I can think about is how anxious I feel and how I wanna keep talking but I'm clueless how. This is the last week of my first quarter at college and I haven't made a single friend and I barely even talk while at school cause I don't have anyone to talk to... This week has been the worst though because even though it's the last week of class for the quarter and there is barely any work left to do, I have been talking a tolerance break from weed and that's making me feel even more lonely"

Anyways, I came across a pretty touching (poem)? A while back called “Joining The Light”. I figured if it touched me maybe it could be a nice read for others in the same boat. Cheers. 


“Once existed was a man, 
He, like many, lived lonely,
He called the dungeon home,
And home always called to him. 

This one was special,
But like many others,
He willfully gave up his potential,
Day and night, near the light,
He gazed upon freedom, 
He prayed to be free from his spite,

Here goes again, 
The chance to make it right;

Will today be the day, he joins the light?”"

I try to keep myself drunk or distracted with video games and whatever else, which worked well enough when I was younger and had reason to believe this was temporary in that my emotions were just young and volatile; but I'm still alone throughout every hour regardless of how I spend it, regardless of what I tell myself I gain to prove, and less willing to stomach the rationale that this has any purpose beyond  pacifying a victim of natural selection.

I find myself siding with the villains these days."

time moves quicker as you get older but I stopped looking at the clock

touch starved, even holding hands would have my endorphins rushing

things are never the same we all change some times for the worst

I thought I had bad luck, hexed or I was genuinely cursed

I took the advice of the socially accepted and it never really worked

I tried to mask the pain but they ask me if i'm okay

I just can't hide it like I used to now I'm leaking in my pain

was it all for nothing, did it go all in vain

I'm a freak of nature, anti social but it's not by choice

if I'm a cosmic joke please let the camera crew out

and tell me that it is but nobody is coming out

so I guess this is reality carrying the burden on my shoulders

lonely,Currently having bad days,"Currently having bad days - 2019 hasn't been a good year for me up til now. 

On the first day of the year, the boy I fell in love with refused me. Kinda. He just ignored my happy new year messages and told my best friend that he had already had a crush on someone. He's also my classmate, so after the holiday, he just tries to keep away from me. Just a few days before the day he refused me, he still accepted to go with me on a date and he even held my hands in the cinema. That just hurts. That time, I recalled of my ex, once told me that I wasn't pretty enough to go along with him. I know I am not a pretty girl, but it really killed my self-esteem.  Sometimes I even think whether I am worth being loved. 

My academic performance is getting worse despite the fact that I had pretty high scores the last 2 semesters. I can't sleep at night and I don't want to go to class in the morning. Besides doing exercises, I dont know what else to do to enhance my knowledge. My friends around me has been looking for internships, while I am still struggling with the thought about what should I do in the future. I can't get help from anyone. My friends tend to have diffent directions from mine, and they just couldn't help. Taking the first step is a challenge for me right now. 

I have just had a foreign language proficiency test. Though I had going hard with it, it doesn't pay off. That moment I realized how bad I am at languages. It was wrong of everyone to expect of me. I feel useless. I don't have any clues of my future at all. 

I don't want to disturb my friends. They have their own problems and i just don't want them to be down by my negative thoughts. Besides, they won't understand. They have always thought of me as a strong one, and that they will say somewhat like ""Cool don't joke around I know you can't have THAT bad performance"", ""Dont be so negative"" or ""That's pretty normal to be sad, just take your time"". Even though that's true, I dont want them to see me as a crybaby. I dont want them to cheer me up. I just want to share my feelings. I just want to say it out loud, that I am exhausted. I am just... afraid. I dont want to mind my parents either. I live away from home. I dont want them to be worried about me. I dont want them to know that their daughter is really suffering with this university life. 

I know that these things above may just trivial normal things happen in everyone's life, but for now, I dont have anyone to talk to, I feel really lonely. I'm scared. Being an adult is really hard isnt it. I cry less often, but I hurt more often."

I hate that i'm so lonely I would kill to have a simple conversation or be able to develop a meaningful relationship with anyone and I can't.
There is not a single way I can come in contact with another person.

If I don't do anything no one will ever notice me or try to talk to me first. No one has ever shown any interest in me or made any effort to talk to me in any way.

If I try to talk to someone in person, that will also not work because its socially unacceptable to try to talk to random strangers in public unless its to ask a simple question.

If I try to message someone online I will probably just get screenshotted and laughed at or ridiculed for ""trying to slide into someones DMs"".

I'm 20 years old and I have nothing and no one.
I don't see how this could ever change. I will never be able to get close with anyone or open up about anything.

It's not okay for men to be upset, cry, need attention, need affection, anything.
You're only allowed to be a rapey, insane monster that cares only about using people, apparently.

So the think is, first I got friendzoned, than she started to text me less and less, i didnt now why and now she told me, she fucked that guy she had a crush on but got rejected. Yeah, fuck, im happy he rejected her. But now she’s depressed and doesnt want to talk to me.

I sometimes feel like I don't exist. I know I do obviously, but it feels like I'm not really here. There's so many things I was afraid of being all through growing up, and now I think I am those things. I can't get this thought out of my head that if younger me saw how my life progressed I wouldn't be here right now. I mean when you're alone for so long, there has to be a reason right? I think the reason is just who I am as a person. I don't really show how I really am to anyone but either way both are infuriating to be around. It's like there's surface level me (that tries to just stay out of the way and be 'normal') and there's the real me (which I can't bring myself to like). I feel like I'm too obnoxious, not smart, no talents or skills, the only thing I think I'm good at is staying out of people's way. I tried so many different ways to try and make friends and it either blows up in my face or eventually I'm forgotten about or not fun enough anymore. I have only one or two friends and they don't really talk to me anymore. I have this guy who wants to date me and all that stuff, but I'm afraid I'm being used? I don't want to finally feel like I matter to one person just for it to be ripped away.  I feel like deep down a lot of people hate me, even some family members. I recently got diagnosed with being somewhere on the autism spectrum? They weren't super specific, but that explains some stuff.   
Overall I just feel really empty, like there no point. I've always wanted to feel like I matter to someone even if it's just one person, but now I think it won't happen or it won't happen for a really really long time.

So I left a relationship around 2 years ago and it utterly broke me. He cheated, it knocked me for 6 and I've spent the past 2 years trying to form relationships and just not getting anywhere. 2 years ago, I worked a soup kitchen and last year, I thought I was spending it with my family but they were all busy with partners and I was left with my Gran which was shit but hey, it was one christmas. I feel terribly lonely that year. So much so I woke up on Christmas day with my stomache in pain at the thought of everyone I knew waking up with someone who cared while I was really just caring for my Gran because she can't be left alone.  I just remember how silent everything was. No conversation. Nothing.

This year, I feel a bit stronger (I've really worked on myself) but I am still single, still on my own. I live alone, I just moved for a new job in a city where I know no one and I've been away from my hometown in Scotland all year. I was really looking forward to getting home and seeing my family when boom. They did it again. My mum, my siblings (who only ever contact me when they need money), uncles and aunts all want to be with their partners and even Gran is elsewhere. I'm so angry. They know how dark my mental health has been.  My career is always doing great but mentally, I'm always breaking down and a part of that is being on my own so much. They know this. I spent hundreds of pounds on train tickets I can't get refunded. If I go to visit ANY friends, itl be a hotel and there's no excuse. My whole family live in the same city. There are people without families but I have one and they are just lazy. 

Anyway, thanks for reading this rant. I'm just really struggling with loneliness and complaining about it just gets met with my mum going ""Well, I can't force people. Maybe you have a nice friend you can visit?"". 

No one gives a shit and I've gone from lonely to fucking invisible."
lonely,"Why is everyone having fun while I am in home,drinking because I want to forget?","Why is everyone having fun while I am in home,drinking because I want to forget? - I hate people.I mean I really hate them.And when I see couples and stuff like that,I just want to end myself.I want to get out of where I am,I want to go somewhere when I can be happy but no!”You need to complete college”,”You are too young to be sad”What do you expect from me?Should I go outside and fake my life while smiligg but dying inside??"
lonely,Can't take it,"Can't take it - I can't take feeling this lonely, I've never felt this lonely before. The one person who I talked to a lot kinda just stopped talking to me and it sucks. Everything is going downhill and nothing seems to be going right. I have a feeling that next year will be a lot better but what if it isn't??? I have so much things going on this year if I mess up it's all over. I feel like everything is over already. I fucking can't take it anymore. Every negative emotion is hitting me harder than ever before I hate feeling like this so much yet it doesn't want to stop."
lonely,"Nobody’s real, I hate and love myself.","Nobody’s real, I hate and love myself. - You ever look in the mirror and think, ‘I am undeniably the perfect human specimen’, whilst also suffering from chronic loneliness and depression? Feeling as if you are inadequate for everyone around you. I definitely do. At times I feel like I’m the most perfect example of what humanity should be and everyone else are either not real or don’t contribute anything nearly as important as I do to society. I know this makes me sound like a major narcissist and I probably am. But I still feel like I’m lacking any meaningful human contact. I have a ‘best friend’ but I feel like her and myself don’t matter to one another anymore. Regardless of how much time I spend with her she doesn’t fill the hole of loneliness in my hart. 

Maybe I need to find someone who I consider to be as perfect as myself? My sexual/romantic life is so stale I have almost forgotten the affection of another living soul. I’m in my peak age bracket and should be comforted by others and feel welcomed. But instead I lay in my room feeling like I don’t even know anyone. I’ve tried desperately to meet new people but I have such a hideous personality I rarely get as far as making plans. I use University and work as an excuse for having no social life when I’m practically feeding my own melancholy and loneliness.

Hope someone else can relate so I don’t feel even more ostracised from humanity. 
Sorry for the cringe."
lonely,I hope I'm not too desperate..,"I hope I'm not too desperate.. - Even tho my friends live so faraway from me and most of them are online, I feel a bit lonely from time to time. Sometimes I feel like ""I don't need no one, I can be alone for the rest of my life)"" but on the other hand I want to feel loved and have some next to me, who could just help me in many ways. My mom pressures me sometimes by saying that people in my age are starting having families, have a job and be these perfect human beings. For efs sake, I'm 21 and my mom is 53 so I understand that her views are a bit old but still, it's giving me pressure. Also, like how you explain to new ppl that you aren't fully normal (I have medical condition)?? (tips are needed!)

I've heard many times from my mom that my look and attitude aren't giving me any friends or boyfriends or anything. Idk is she serious (probably not) but still...social media is giving me pressure of the way I look etc. My own standarts are a but specific and I just feel scared a bit. Like....there's supposed to be a someone to everyone right?

Despite all of the negativity, I'm blessed to know people as my friends who truly cherish me as the way I am. They have promised me to help me if I need help and I'm so happy to know that I'm not fully alone. 

Sorry that this is a messy post but I just felt that I wanna write something and just have my feelings out I guess. I hope yu guys are having a good day &lt;3"
lonely,I want a relationship,"I want a relationship - I feel empty and dead. I fantasize about having a partner, about having someone that will love me more than the obligatory love of a family member, the love of a person that I want to spend the rest of my days with.

I felt alone all my life like a big empty void withing me which I can never be filled. I know the parents I have love me to death but I just can\`t feel it and I know that sounds really ungratefull. I love them to but I never felt thier love or affection even tho they show it everyday. I know it sounds stupid but I crave that motherly love again. whenever I see a mother and her child happy together escpecially when it\`s still a infant I feel myself getting sad. Knowing I have never felt a mothers love and will never feel such a thing. I hate it and I can\`t take this feeling of loneliness anymore it\`s driving me totally insane.  I want to feel her warmth, her smell, her arms around me. For once I want to feel save in this cruel cold world. I want her to tell me everything will be alright . 

I know none of this will be ever possible and it\`s stupid to even be thinking about this. It only makes me sad and feel miserable. I have never told people this actually. maybe this isn\`t the right sub for this post so please delete if not allowed . also sorry for any error or grammatical errors Enlish is not my native and I started having a breakdown halfway through writing this."
lonely,It seems the universe does not permit me to have a relationship,"It seems the universe does not permit me to have a relationship - I just want to say anyone reading this thank you. 

I am having a really hard time this past few months with being lonely. I am a freshman in college and there are only a few weeks to my first semester. I fell really burnt out at this point not because of the hard work, but because I didn't accomplish any of my goals for this semester. I give 110% of my ability to school every day and I continue to do so despite how unhappy I am. I have good grades and my teachers like me, but this is not what makes me truly happy. All I have wanted for as long as I can remember is to find a girl who loves me. I see couple after couple at school every day and it really hurts because I have never experienced what they have. I'm 20 years old now and I haven't even been on a date before. I know that I deserve love just like anyone else does, but when I actually work up the courage to ask a girl out it seems like crazy things happen to prevent it. I have picked a girl that I want to ask and she works in the library every tuesday night. One week I had a doctors appointment, the next the library closed early, this Tuesday school got cancelled due to snow. In reality the chances of her saying yes are probably pretty low anyway, but I'm so tired of sitting and waiting for something to happen to me. Everyone knows women don't just go around asking men on dates. I'm not afraid to ask, but I feel God is just telling me no every time."

lonely,Odd sense of superiority,"Odd sense of superiority - For most of my life I’ve had very low self esteem and almost always felt inferior to my peers. However sometimes when I’m in a social situations, for example in school I feel an odd sense of superiority over my peers. As if they are dumb and easily predictable shallow beings, all part of one single collective. All too often my judgements against other people seems to have some if not a lot of truth to them.

That being said these feelings do not in any way reflect the way I actually treat people. 

Does anyone recognize these feelings? 

Do you think these feelings might be a symptom of isolation and loneliness or am I just immature and judgmental?"

No one told me it would be this lonely, that I would have mental breakdowns everyday. I just feel like shit. I haven’t made one friend. I don’t even want to. I just want to be happy. I feel like crying. I hate the independence college is giving me. I hate being alone and I hate making my own schedule. I used to be really excited about it back in high school but I just want to go back to those days, despite how depressing they were. They’re even worse now. I know I need help. I hate myself. I wish I was dead. Every friend  I’ve tried to make at this school just stops responding to my texts eventually and never wants to talk or hang out. I hate this shit so much. I don’t even know what’s wrong with me. I didn’t think anything was. Maybe I’m not fun enough. Maybe I smell. I’m so depressed. I hate everything.

I’m gonna try to get some sleep."
lonely,"I feel like no matter where life takes me, I’ll always feel like this","I feel like no matter where life takes me, I’ll always feel like this - I don’t have any friends but I don’t really try either. I wish I did but I am so empty that I have absolutely nothing to converse with people about other than how depressed I am. School is miserable and I almost never say a word all day long and I didn’t realize how depressing that it until recently. I have a few acquaintances that I mostly text from school that I met last year but we don’t hang out or anything. We just talk about school and sometimes other things too which is nice but I just don’t feel a connection. I’m not sure if I’m incapable of feeling a connection or if I just haven’t met the right people yet. But here the point of the whole post: even when I try to imagine myself with friends and a “perfect” life, I can still see myself being sad and coming home everyday crying. It’s like I would have to force myself to talk to people and do things I don’t like to do. I just feel so empty."
lonely,Empty,"Empty - *Don't think about*, they say, *just don't think about.*

Think it was that damn easy, we wouldn't be having this conversation now would we? Everywhere I look people are holding hands, kissing and laughing.. they look so happy, so loved.   
All you wanted was to be looked at the same way, to be held and hold others the same way.

*Don't think about it.*  
You think I haven't tried? I damn well wish I can be as blissful as other single folk, not wanting a relationship. Must be easy to say such a thing. *Least you had a relationship...you don't know the pain of a lifetime of loneliness.* How can they understand?   
***You think I have a choice in the matter?***  
I'm alone not because I want to, I'm alone because I have to...it's because of who I am, the entire package, that makes me unlovable.  
I am an eccentric among my own people, among the stars of cyberspace...how do you think I look to normal people, down here in reality?

I'm not mainstream, and I refuse to be...it ain't who I am...it just ain't...but that means I'm foreign to everyone. Nobody understands when I ramble on about my favorite anime or video game, or when I share with them my history memes...or talk about politics and the world the same...They do not share my enthusiasm...they do not even understand...they only pretend they do...

I put on a mask of sorts, yes....but it is part of me, but it ain't all of me. You want what's on the outside? Heh, scratch that, you don't even want what's on the outside...If I can't provide that, how can you accepted such complexity on the inside? No one wants to put up with all of this...

Everyone loves to be around me, but no one cares enough to love me. They say don't worry, me of all people will be fine...but they don't know...they don't know my pain...they act like they do...but they don't know all of me...  
***Damned if I do, damned if I don't.***

Romance for me is like bashing my head against a wall. When I was younger, I thought maybe persistence would help me break through, but as I age, I only become tired. They say believe in yourself, as if I hadn't tried. There is only so many times I can hit my wall against that wall, so many times I can get rejected. At some point the subconscious takes over, it doesn't want me to hurt myself no longer for the sake of self-preservation.   
***I've given up, given up on myself, accepted my lot in this life, destined to be alone...but my feelings refuse to leave me alone.***

I don't want to think about this, I want to forget all about this stupid chase, live the other parts of life and be free of these chains of emotions. But no matter what happens, it haunts me, creeps up on me...hurts every fiber of my being.

 I want, I crave, I ***need...***somthing I've only have had a mere sip of...somthing I've never had...somthing to help ease the raging storm inside of me...someone to be my ***anchor***.

Ideally? I want someone who understands me...Someone whom would listen to me ramble on about my favorite things...someone who understands me...someone, I can be there for...where we both can be excited about the same things...mutual love and adoration...  
***But that's nothing more then a mere fantasy...I know...I know...I know it too well...***

No...at this point, I'll settle for anybody willing to try to love me...I just need someone I can physically hold...I don't need them to fix me...I don't need anyone to try to fix me...they can't...only I can...I am the only one who can fix myself...

I just want someone to be here for me...just hold my hand as I try to ward of the chaos in my life...a back that I can lean on and not worry...and a back for me to support...*you watch my back...I'll watch yours...*

I'm young, I know...but I've always wanted children...perhaps I have more faith in raising children, then I'll ever have finding love.  
These thoughts come and go, one minute their there...next minute there gone...when will I ever be rid of this sadness...when can I be free?   
Is there hope for me? How can I believe when my history has proven me otherwise? I am a man of rationality, yet filled with emotion. A man who wants the best of others...yet to be understood fully.  
I just want to be held...I just want to feel safe...I just want this chaos to end...I just want to be loved..."
lonely,"I feel tired, lonely and purposeless","I feel tired, lonely and purposeless - I feel like shit. The only place I socialize is the school. That's not much and I always feel annoying there. Outside of school nobody talks to me, unless I text/call first, and usually if I do any discussion is done in 5 minutes. That just accentuates the idea of me being annoying and I grow more resilient to reach out to somebody.
I know that I exaggerate the situation in my mind, but it's just a feeling that catches me and puts me in the ground.

Anytime I hang out with anybody I just feel extra and if it starts showing that I'm not enjoying myself and people start noticing I just get a terrible feel of guilt and I try to get out of there as fast as possible. 

I'm not close to anyone in my family, my parents are divorced and since then I've been drifting further and further away from everybody. It has been like 4 years and I barely talk to my mother with who I live.

I haven't had a friend to who I could write anytime or to who I could confess any of my problems in such a long time. I don't have any friends to who I can open up. I tried and nothing came out of it: either they just didn't say anything or I just grew a feeling of asking for attention or pity from them, which is just slowly killing me.

I had a 2 year relationship which ended because of my psychical state resulted both from the relationship and my other life problems, it just left me empty. Now I see my ex and her bf everyday. I guess this contributes somehow, as, ignoring any bad aspects of the relationship, she had been the closest person to me ever. 

I tried going to a few psychologists, but so far it didn't have any results and I don't have enough money to throw them away endlessly and purposelessly. 

I try doing many things outside of school, I have a job, I have hobbies, but it just ends feeling too much when added up with my misery and I end up messing everything up.

I used to play computer games and I had friends there, with which I used to talk daily, but we fell out because of life stuff.

I just haven't felt as lonely or purposeless never as much as now. I don't seem to have any motivation or goal, and doing it just for myself doesn't work too much for me. I have no purpose for making this post, I guess I'm just unwinding because I have nobody to tell this stuff. It's just mess that keeps me from enjoying absolutely anything.

I hope this is somewhat coherent. Even I don't know what's up with all of this."

Something is weird about my brain, I’m not even sure what it is or how to describe it, except to say that I see and experience the world in a strange way. No voices or hallucinations or anything like that. My experience is just different. Sometimes it’s fun. A lot of times I just feel very alone in it. Like right now.

As early as I can remember in Kindergarten I was loner . It didn’t bother me until I was in the second grade , when my teacher would tell the other girls in my class to befriend me . I was bothered by this because I wanted to be alone . But the loneliness started to kick in as I grew older and found myself spending time in the restrooms at school . Everyone in my classes in grade school knew me as the girl who didn’t say a word . And I kept it that way because I was the girl who wouldn’t talk but really chose not too. I carried this loneliness up to high school and although I was more open with people I found myself in the same predicament with no friends . And as an adult I started to care less and own it .

None of my friends care to ever speak to me, and I don't fit in with anyone else. My own fucking girlfriend leaves me on read for days at a time and never speaks to me when we can be together. I can't even go to my own family without being ridiculed about something. I came out as bisexual last week and they still talk shit about me in my face about it and I have, who would've guessed, no one to go to. I'm a compulsive liar and have lied about almost anything and everything to my friends and it sends me into a nervous wreck when they approach me and say ""[name]?"", I always think they're gonna find out that I really never had that expensive bass that I said I bought, that that image was actually stolen from a 100 day old thread on here, that I didn't go out with anyone that one weekend, etc. I'm really thinking that I'm losing a shitload of friends because of that but I just can't stop abiding by my constant thoughts that tell me to make myself look falsely good, to the disdain of myself and probably others that found me out but won't tell me.

I really want to go to my room for the last time, and end my life somehow, some way. Asphyxiation, overdosing, hanging, I don't care. As long as it takes me quickly.

lonely,"Why even ask me out, dude??","Why even ask me out, dude?? - 
I felt my hopes go up because someone asked me out on a date.  It was the first time I’ve been asked out outside of a hookup context, so I gathered that he was interested in me as a person and was looking for a personal relationship.  I thought he was cute and I wanted to know more about him, and was flattered that he asked.  That’s what I’ve been wanting for a long time, and I got very excited.  I don’t know why, and it hurts to think about, but I really feel that people hardly want to get to know me or connect with me, and if they ask me out they’re just looking for a superficial sexual relationship.  

We met up for coffee and I just slowly felt my feelings sink and some deep pain rise up because he didn’t seem to want to be there at all.  He kept going on his phone while I was talking, and he brushed off anything I said or gave shallow “yeah cool” responses as if he wasn’t listening at all.  He “apologized” for the phone but it was clear that it was a formality and he wasn’t sorry, or cared.  He knew he was being rude and he acknowledged it just because he probably felt a little guilty.  I talked for a total of maybe two minutes, he didn’t ask me anything about myself.  He rambled on about his family and his music but it didn’t seem like he actually wanted to share, it felt like he was just giving the spiel to get through the date.  It lasted for about 40 mins in all.  

Why did he even ask me out?  He obviously was not interested in me at all, which was clear right at the beginning of the date.  That’s just so... disrespectful?  I took time out of my life to meet with him and it was a total waste.  I feel rejected and hurt."
lonely,Loneliness and depression,"Loneliness and depression - Hey all,  
36M here. I went through a divorce a couple of years ago which absolutely shattered me and I'm still trying to find my footing in life again. Until just a couple of weeks ago, I'd have told you that I'd been chronically depressed since the divorce. Recently, I've started seeing a new therapist and she put sort of a different spin on things for me. She told me that what it sounded as if I was describing was loneliness, rather than depression and I can't stop thinking of that.  


I identify as a highly sensitive person and if I've never found life as easy as others seem to, finding it hard to stop thinking things over and worrying about things. The kind of person that I try to be is someone who is kind, compassionate and thoughtful. Sadly, the divorce, work stress and frustration with the dating scene has made mean just exhausted and cynical and I hate being like that.  


I'm realizing more and more how important genuine, empathetic and kind people are in my life and I have far too few of them around. As I look around I just see a lot of people wrapped up in their phones, doing the rat race and buying crap like crazy, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of really authentic, vulnerable connection in the world, at least not where I'm looking.   


I feel like I have a lot of love to give and I'd like to be in a loving relationship someday. I think I have to do a bit of healing first as I don't want to be this cynical, frustrated person in a relationship. I'm starting to feel like dealing with the loneliness might really help with that, but I'm not sure quite how to find the kind of people that would resonate with me.  


Anyways, just felt the need to throw this out into the universe. The holidays always seem to bring out the feels in me.  


Take care all."

That’s is not a problem , but when you want to talk with somebody about something it’s to boring that they never have nothing to say, since I here is like be a 30 years old guy( I’m 17) in a kinder-garden i don’t belong here, I try every day to make “friends” I knew a lot of people in the school but when I’m in home I don’t have nobody to talk, 0 message in telegram, what’s up, Snapchat, Instagram one year without receive a hug, or talk more than 5 minutes, everybody is so cool here.... and sorry if you can’t understand my English still bad"

lonely,Has anyone else ever realized they were ugly late in their life?,"Has anyone else ever realized they were ugly late in their life? - Sorry for this wall of text I always end up writing way more than I plan on...

So I'm currently a 22 year old (m) in college in my senior year and I just realized a few months ago earlier in the semester that I'm actually really ugly... :(  I went to a party like I usually do but this time I was with one of my friends who is considered decently attractive. After a few drinks and a few different conversations and a few times of me getting rejected like I usually do I stopped to think and my mind was actually blown at how different of an experience attractive or even average-looking people have at life in general. I looked around and noticed pretty much everyone, even guys I would consider average were talking to girls and having a good time and laughing and the girls were super receptive and laughing and blushing and all of that and I couldn't even get any kind of response back. The next few days when I was sober I realized people actually treat ugly people a lot differently and worse than regular people... our jokes just aren't as funny, we're ""creepy"" when we try to talk to people instead of just maybe weird or eccentric, we're ""strange"" if we're generally quiet instead of just ""mysterious"" when someone is attractive. (for context I'm very physically fit, workout regularly, i have a good hairstyle and i dress nicely. In other words im doing everything i can to maximize myself but it just feels useless because i was born with an ugly face). My mom calls me attractive a lot because she probably knows how ugly i am and is trying to raise my spirits but unfortunately i can see right through that. So I've gotten extremely depressed over the past few months because of this... there's no other way to describe it besides it's just so unfair... everyone is born the way that they are and because of something that I can't change my life is just way worse than someone elses, for no reason whatsoever. I just got unlucky. I just want to be a happy and cheerful person and get to know people and make people laugh but it's like everywhere I go now I see it in the way people interact with me. It's people quickly looking away when I glance at them. It's people deliberately not moving out of the way if I'm trying to get past them because they don't feel like i'm worth it. Not only that, but you could probably tell that i'm extremely lonely... everyone around me is in relationships and i just feel like ive missed out on so much of my life. In a few years im going to get a job and start making money and then ill maybe find a girl but at that point i think she would only want me because of maternal instinct. in a few years people start looking for partners to have a family with and i think a woman would only consider me if im someone who is financially stable to raise kids or something like that. I just feel like ive missed out on any kind of relationship based on mutual desire with no end goal in mind... and that just sucks so much to think about. Thanks if you made it this far I just needed to rant a little bit because i dont understand how i can genuinely learn to enjoy life after such a massive realization that it's always going to be harder for me just because of something I could never control"
lonely,I just want someone to care about me.,"I just want someone to care about me. - I feel hopeless. Tired.

Even surrounded by people, it’s empty."
lonely,Expectations,"Expectations - (25M) When I was younger I wanted to be married by 25. Well, today I turned 25 and unsurprisingly I'm not married. Now I'm a realist man so when I turned 23 a couple of years ago with no prospects on the horizon, I realized that getting married in the couple years was becoming far more unlikely. What I didn't count on or see coming was that I would make it to 25 without ever having a girlfriend. I'm not socially inept or anything, I've had sexual relationships with women but nothing that lasted to be officially considered my girlfriend. It seems that women close to my age aren't interested in an actual relationship, they either just want to fuck around and get drunk. Or they are so focused on their building their career that they don't make time for anyone.  

What really bothered me was when my Mom called to wish me a happy birthday. Her boyfriend felt the need to chime in: ""You know when I was 25 I was already married with 3 kids!"" Uh, Okay? Thanks for rubbing it in. All I said back was: ""I don't have any kids that I know of."" When I really wanted to tell him to take a long walk off a short pier. I'm no stranger to feeling lonely, but this birthday takes the cake."

I just want to fucking hug a woman. I'm unwantable though. im probably a sex addict, which is ironic since Ive never had sex. Porn, porn, and more porn. Sometimes I'll find a woman to chat with online but its almost a compulsive seeking. Its the closest I can get to any sort of meaningful affection though so I seek it. 

Ive posted stuff before that basically boiled down to ""I'm lonely some woman please come voice chat with me while we masturbate so for a half second I can feel like I'm not completly alone"". Of course people send all kinds of hate my way when I post something like that. You know what though? Its deserved, its a shitty thing to look for, cause I'm a shitty person."

Do you guys ever feel like you might be mental ill because of how hard it is for you to engage in social interactions, for me it’s been a pain to get out from my shell and I know nowadays I’ve been overcoming my shyness little by little but I cannot stop overthinking all the time about how people really see me, I also have this ruminations about trying to figure out what people like without even asking them first and I mean you might think is common sense to ask people about anything if you’re interested but crazy as it sounds I always get stuck on my emotions and my awkwardness, I feel also that everyone knows how shy I am and that makes me more insecure. I’ve been avoiding going to a psychologist for the longest time and I know I needed you know, but somehow I just make things up to avoid going, it’s like I like to keep suffering from the same problem, but this time for real I already payed for the treatment and I’ll start going on the 6th of this month, hopefully I can treat this problem faster and get better, because I feel so stuck in life"

I have a hard time telling people when I’m sad or frustrated or stressed, and I know if I do tell people they’re gonna make me talk about it. I don’t want to talk about it with them, I just want people to let me be upset. I want them to hug me without making me tell them why I’m sad because putting it into words makes me so uncomfortable. 

I just feel so isolated from everyone—my family and the one friend that I have. All I want is for someone to understand, but no ones gonna be able to do that unless I talk about it. I just feel stuck, like I’m never gonna get out of this."
lonely,I have talked to one person at uni. They do not respond to my messages for days,"I have talked to one person at uni. They do not respond to my messages for days - I have been at uni for 2 months now. I have been able to talk to one person more than once so far. I remember we met at a session being held in the chaplaincy. During freshers while everyone else was drinking, occupied and the time I realised university is just an extension of sixth form. We talked and I asked if he knew how to play chess, he didn't so I asked if he wanted to go to the chess society with me. He said he would, that was a lie as far as I can tell. We both decided to meet the next week, but the session wasnt on that week. The subsequent weeks he did not come, I asked but he said he could not find the room. I stopped after that. I invited him to my room at one point and taught him the basics, he seemed preoccupied. I tried to be lighthearted but I do not think he cared at all. He did mention he was going to taekwondo some time before that, so I said I would go with him. We went together a few times. I missed 2 weeks in a row because I felt completely unable to be around people those nights. I have been every week without fail since. I have lost interest in programming, chess, walking and nearly lost interest in guitar. Taekwondo distracts me though. I have done stretches on and off and I am able to touch my toes now. He has not been for three weeks now, he says he had an injury and could not go, but still managed to go to a social event that night, he told me. A social event I can not go to because I can not talk to people in groups. He is my only real contact here. I can not say friend or even acquaintance, we have drifted apart from whatever tenuous relationship we had before getting to that stage. It hurts more than any other problem I have. I would give nearly anything, I would endure nearly any pain for a friend. But I can't, there is no end in sight. I messaged him to ask if he was coming this week. He has read the message and not responded. 

I will have to go to the doctors this Wednesday. I have 4 pieces of work piled up. I am unable to focus. I spend most of my time browsing reddit because it distracts better than anything else. The doctor maybe the only solution remaining. But how can a doctor cure the fact I am alone

I cant remember life being good anywhere after around the age of 12. 

The only things I derive pleasure from are eating and masturbation. Reddit and taekwondo are the things which distract. My work I do because I will be a failure if I do not. The only module I look forward to on my course is the mathematics module, which I am better than most at, but the work takes me ages because I just keep switching. Scalp rubbing, toilet, scalp rubbing, toilet, reddit, toilet, guitar, reddit, toilet, scalp rubbing. Over and over. 

I feel frustration beyond comprehension, it wouldnt take much time to be my friend. If someone talks to me I talk back. I message first. I dont think I overload them. I try to be as friendly as I can. They either ignore me or hate me and push me away. I read some posts on here about people with friends. I am in disbelief. I have not had a friend in 6 years and you whine that your friend isnt kowtowing. I have noone who has ever been there for me. I am hated and ignored only. Those are the only two things people can feel towards me, hate and apathy. Generally males are hateful and females are apathetic. I am never anyones first or second choice. I am nothing. More and more I think there is one way out. The deluded masses think exit is an abnormaility. No, the abnormality is sitting next to you on the bus. He is loathed and feared. The abnormality is in pain and needs someone more than you have ever needed anyone in your life. It is built into human nature. These people are their disease as far as everyone else around them is concerned.

I do not know what to tell the doctor. I have a list of everything going wrong that he might be able to help with. I do not know if I can say about my occasional thoughts of suicide. On the one hand I think it might be safe to do so, because I have not thought of methods, other than thinking several times jumping is the worst idea. Thats how you end up paralysed, sent to a physical hell in addition to whatever you have before. On the other hand he might think I am fixated enough to be at risk. I do not want to be watched. Even before I experienced paranoia I did not like to be watched

Life alternates between pain and neutrality. There is no pleasure any more beyond my base urges. I have become degenerate in that way

I hide what I feel. No one else knows. The people who have known I am alone have only taunted me or ignored me. You might think that is delusion, but it is the truth, throughout secondary and sixth form, abuse only. Never help. Thinking back on that, it makes me wonder if a friend is worth anything at all. All humans properly formed to design are degenerate in groups.

My mother I can not tell. She is friends with the mother of someone who went to my sixth form who was obnoxious to me, despite the fact I tried being nice back, or just ignored him. My mother seems to think it is ansport to tell everyone she can anything new she has learnt about me. She has some sort of mental illness and I have seen she is on the SSRI sertraline. Wheb I tell her not to tell anyone else anhthing aboht me she has screamed at me. She says it is normal to tell other people what is happening. She has said disgustibg things to me. She has now multiple times told me I will never have a girlfriend (although I am probably not straight so she might not be wrong there) I will never marry, I will have no friends. As far as she is concerned she is perfect. The house looks like a rubhish tip. I alternate between hating her, forgiving her briefly and apathy. Currently apathy, the hate was renewed when she screamed at me for half an hour these things while driving me to the train station. The cycle will never end. My dad has enough problems working a physical job for little money. I have grandparents on my dads side, but I do not want to worry them and I not think they believe there can be anything medically wrong with the brain and by extension the mind. None of them could help anyway. What are they going to do?"
lonely,"I think the problem is me, i'm just unlikeable","I think the problem is me, i'm just unlikeable - All my life I blamed it on something external; language barrier , ethnicity, other people being dismissive, social anxiety, personality type, them being in a relationship... It's all bull, excuses.

I've combated most these things, or at least have been into contexts where they're non existent and the problem always remained, i'm the most invisible.

I managed to have the biggest group of friends, but I was the outcast in the circle. 

I compared every action to socially adapted people and tried to learn but it's just not happening. I'm not rude, mean or have any negative flaws that make me unlikeable, i'm simply *boring*. I'm meh. I'm reliable and consistent, people trust me, and when they get mad at eachother or seperate for a while I find company. We have fun, but once others come back i'm completely overshadowed, it's ridiculous. I thought it was just romantic couples, it's not.

My latest coping explanation was this weird gender dynamic hypothesis I won't even get into, i'm reaching so far it's dumb.

I'm  and have no real irl friends rn, never have for most of my life. I have really bad social anxiety and depression and I'm really shy so I spend most of my time in my room alone playing video games listening to music and working out to pass the time, I'm failing school due to my mental shit so basically lifes bad for me.

I'm always looking for friends on the internet so I dont have to actually talk to people irl. 4chan, reddit, twitter, snapchat, kik, discord, literally anything where I can get people to meet and talk to. But it's really hard to get people to actually pay attention to you when you just another lonely guy in the mix, so I often post in places looking for lewd convos and post pics of myself or say how big my dick is just get some quick affection and attention to feel better about myself for a couple minutes, but afterwards I feel lonely and depressed again. It's a never ending cycle that I've been going through this whole year and it's probably going to continue until I get some irl friends or an SO in the future.

I feel like if I wasnt born in the time i was born in i would have turned out better. Maybe i wouldn't have been so awkward around other people due to isolation and i wouldn't have discovered that i could do this to get easy attention.

I fucking hate my life, but I still hope it'll get better oneday."

lonely,Friend being distant.,"Friend being distant. - So my best friend has been really distant for almost 3 months now, it just seems like she doesn't want to engage with me on any level. Trying to get any kind of conversation going with her is next too impossible. This is straight out of a friendship where she would openly say things like ""you and I are going to know each other forever"". But now it feels like she doesn't want me around till the end of any given day. Idk it's a pretty devastating feeling. She does have a lot on her at the moment, so I've been giving her the benefit of the doubt. But it doesn't seem to be affecting her other friendships, she's always complimenting them, saying how great they are, or getting excited to see them. But with me, nothing. I don't have many friends so it's pretty devastating, and I'm feeling very isolated at the moment."
lonely,I don’t know how to have a proper conversation,"I don’t know how to have a proper conversation - I don’t know how to really talk to kids at school.  I mostly keep quiet at lunch.  I enjoy sitting with people I know to make me feel less lonely.  The highlight of my day is if someone greets me, which is rare.

I find that I can talk to adults better than people of my own age for some reason.  Even then, I get self-conscious at the way I talk.  If I accidentally stutter, I feel like a big dumbass.  I don’t really make eye contact, I just look at general areas on a person’s face.  

I think the best conversation I ever had was 2 years ago, when I got the opportunity to fly in a flight simulator with an ex-TWA pilot.  It was awesome, being able to talk about aviation and learn about some of my favorite aircraft.  I miss that moment.  

I don’t know why, but for some reason this year, I got antisocial.  It’s my senior year in HS, and it’s supposed to be “awesome.”  I feel so lonely lately.

I’ve been trying my luck with tinder, but now I feel like I’ve wasted $30.  $15 on Tinder Gold, about $12 for two boosts.  None of my matches ever respond.  It’s demoralizing.  I feel so awful.  

I hope it’s easier to meet friends in college, and even get my first relationship."

My body has gotten so used to it that the feeling doesn't stay for long but sometimes it just lasts for days.
Basically that shit never gets old. It's just dormant inside.

I cannot go to malls, clubs or gatherings without getting triggered seeing couples or girls whom I wish to talk to. I have tried talking to strangers before but they deflect instantly. At one pt I gave up meeting someone new unless someone introduces you to someone but that's never happened because our high school gang still hangs out together so the circle never gets big.

I just went to a club today and this girl was so hostile because she was alone and bored and I asked her if she's enjoying this or if she's getting bored.

lonely,I have told my friend how lonely I am,"I have told my friend how lonely I am - It was my birthday. I was ready to spend it all alone, dreaming of someone to love and drinking until I pass out. Then, in the evening, I received a message from my friend saying ""Happy birthday, when are we going to celebrate?"" I was so excited, that someone besides my parents and brother remembered what day it was. I replied, that I'm not going to throw huge party, but I would be honored, if he and his wife came to my place for a drink. Obviously they accepted. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Soon after they arrived. We spent some nice time watching Friends and drinking. It was middle of a week, so his wife had to go in order to get up early. I took few days off and he had work at 12, so we decided to stay at me and keep drinking.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At some point, he mentioned situation from a while ago, when he and our other friends decided to visit me and I turned them down and ordered to get the fuck out of here. Then I broke. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I told him how lonely I feel. How painful it is. How keep going became so difficult for me. I told him about moments, when I was with him or with our friends, which strengthen my loneliness and pushed me further from them. He let me speak out my mind, first time in years apparently. After I stopped speaking, he suggested me a therapy and that he could pay for it (he is quite wealthy). I told him the truth. I am in no need of a therapy. I need basic human interactions. Messaging one another, going to parties, watching movies together etc. He replied, that he will help me with that. I was so happy back then and couldn't wait to end my loneliness. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Do you want to know what happened next?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Absolutely fucking nothing.

 

 

It's been weeks. No single message, no single invite, nothing.

 

 

We met once by occasion during our common friend's birthday party. He did not even mentioned what I told him back then. What is more, I've seen a facebook's post of him, his wife and our common friends attending a party, without me of course.

 

 

Did I broke? Was my heart disintegrated and my soul crushed? No

 

 

It made me stronger. It made me stronger, because it proved that I was right from the very beginning. They are one of reasons behind my loneliness. They never wanted to hear me out, they never caring for my feelings and my whereabouts. They treated me like a background character and reached me out only when it suited them. That one time when I told them to get the fuck out here, they came drunk to my place in the middle of night at my working Wednesday in a need of finding next drinking spot. Truth is, they are egoistic, narcissistic, shallow bastards with that one guy in particular. 

 

 

He was ready to give me money, while he couldn't text me ""what's up"". He and this entire world is a fucking joke. If you are lonely, people wants you to go away. They are even ready to pay you for that. You can't be lonely. You have to be happy. You have to socialize in a way they tell you. You have to post as much as possible on social media. YOU CAN NOT BE DIFERENT.

&amp;#x200B;

Hear me out my dear lonely souls. You are the only one, who can make you happy. Don't avoid loneliness, avoid people who makes you feel lonely. Don't let them tell what to do. Find your own way. Loneliness is a high price you pay every day for being yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am so done with my so called friends. I shall keep looking for that one soul I could spend rest of my life with. I have found strength in a darkness and accepted it.

&amp;#x200B;

You are not the one responsible for your loneliness. Remember that."
lonely,i am so severely touch-starved,"i am so severely touch-starved - it’s been the better half of a decade since physical affection was the norm for me () and i feel like that’s stunted my emotional growth even though all the adults in my life tell me i’m “so mature for my age, my communication skills are excellent”, blah blah blah. you know why ? adults have been my only peers. i’m homeschooled and my mom makes it impossible for me to meet anyone because she’s paranoid. the only time i really get out of the house is when i go to work.

maybe i don’t want to be mature. maybe i don’t want to operate on an adult level. maybe i want to act my age. maybe i want to be silly and act out. like kids are supposed to do. i’ll never get the experiences that are unique to my age and because of that i’ll never fit in.

i want to be held and touched. i want it more than anything in the world. i just want to be touched and i want them to mean it. i want to be hugged. the severe lack of physical affection in my life is slowly killing me. i can feel my body and my mind shutting down. i just want to be held and told everything will be alright and i’ll never get that.

my last hope of forming friendships that are appropriate for my age is college and even then that’s almost half a year away. i feel like i’m going to kill myself before i get there.

i just want to be held and hugged. i want to be cuddled for 8 hours straight.

i’m so lonely."

lonely,i need a friend - 17 y/o female,"i need a friend - 17 y/o female - hi again lol. i have always wanted a close friend. like one to tell everything to and them do the same. or like a small group of friends. i see people make good friends online but my social anxiety literally stops me from being able to hold a conversation. but i really want someone to talk to. i don’t mind if you’re a guy, girl, non-binary anything"
lonely,Wanting friends but never interested in anybody?,"Wanting friends but never interested in anybody? - Basicly the title.

I sometimes really wish I would have a crush on someone just to be finally interested to get to know someone.
Most people around me are.. Well. They don't interest me. Yea it's nice to talk to them sometimes but that's it. 

I'm currently in a research group and honestly I'm not even interested in getting to know any of them. Some of them seem nice, others not so much. Maybe it's because I'm not interested in research and their jobs. Idk. It feels really lonely there because I'm doing something completely different than everyone else. Because of that my motivation was really low during the whole internship. 

Sometimes I see people and think 'man I really would like to be friends with them' but that's basicly because their looks and there would be no way to get to know some people that you see in public transportation once. (and honestly, nobody would want to be my friend because of _my_ look, it's so weird) 

I feel kind of shallow for this kind of thinking. Because when I start to get to know someone they're becoming more interesting (I mean normal-friendship interesting). I met people online and became friends with them and they are really cool. Just - - making a start is so hard. 
And sometimes keeping these friends is even harder.
I had that group of 3 male friends and we would play online games every day but life kind of hit everyone of us and also I lost interest in that game and we just stopped talking? Every few month we write a little in our group chat and that's it. It's kinda sad.

Currently I spend my evenings with people in a voice chat where everyone just plays their own game. We're kind of a collection of loners, I guess. It's nice but it feels kind of shallow and most of the time I'm just there for the background noises and do my own stuff. Even if I would want to take part in the conversations - I just have no idea what to say. Sometimes it feels like I'm excluding myself."
lonely,i feel like actually shit,"i feel like actually shit - i honestly don’t know what to do anymore. i feel so hopeless and i’ve been crying for the past 10mins. i have no drive to do anything. i start uni soon and i honestly don’t wanna go. i don’t see the point cos i have no idea what i wanna do with my life. i am constantly comparing myself to others. i feel like the fact that i find it hard to show affection makes it really hard for me when it comes to friendships. my friends are really affectionate people and i just cant reciprocate that so i feel left out. my family life is so shit. my dad left us. it’s just me,my mum and my brother. my mum and brother are constantly fighting. i’m constantly fighting with my brother. i hate it here. i wanna leave but i don’t know where to. i love my family but i cant stand it here. we are literally struggling and it’s the holiday season and i feel so alone. i cant really put into words how i’m feeling but i just feel like SHIT. i cant bear going to school cos i just don’t wanna see people. i don’t wanna leave my house. i’m literally so emotionally constipated and when i try to open up i feel sick. 
idk..this is rambling but i’m literally crying. i cant do this anymore. i just don’t see the point in life. like i feel like everyone around me has a perfect life (which they probably don’t) but it seems much better than mine. they have 2 parents who are financially stable and siblings who are supportive and not aggressive. i just wish things were better but idk how to get myself out of this. i’m so lonely and depressed i cant deal anymore"

lonely,Feeling especially lonely today,"Feeling especially lonely today - My last relationship left me in shreds. She was the first person that I said “I love you” to and it crushed me when I figured out she didn’t mean it when she said it back to me. Now I have zero motivation to find a new girlfriend or to go out of my way to find new friends. I’ve had the same friends for most of my life so I don’t even know how to make friends anymore. I transferred colleges because of my last relationship and now I’m stuck at a new place where I feel incredibly different from everyone else. I have an extreme difficulty telling people my emotions so I don’t have anyone to talk to. Not expecting anything from this, just looking for somewhere to vent."
lonely,Difference of Emotions,"Difference of Emotions -  I recently just lost me best friend for 2 and a half years to an his ex that he started talking again to recently.  She hated me and he said that he never took sides but he lowkey kinda did. She hated me and threw shit in my face like “he’ll love me no matter what” and “me and him are pretty close now” which bothers me because I was ALWAYS there for him when he had a break down and even when the tried getting together and only lasted a day because she chose her EX instead of him. He hated her and they started talking again last month. He’s been distant and i said “it feels like you talk to her more than to me, john and justin” (friend group)  He said he’s been busy which he has been but its not right to prioritize his ex instead of his friends. 

 So after i fought with the ex on instagram after her making a post about me i said “look i dont think i can hang out when you get back or talk to you.  You know i cant stand her and if she is as close as she says she is to you then you don’t really need me anymore to help you when your have stuff going on”  as soon as I said that he ended the call and then I broke down. 

 I’ve always been lonely so when he became my friend I prioritized him over a lot of people and I became friends with his friend group and he helped me a lot so I decided to always be there for him and care for him. I started to like him and I even told him but I wasn’t his type. But we became friends with benefits.  It hurt me because I liked him with my entire heart and he only like me as a friend but fucked me like a lover. It killed me because it made us closer and i was afraid of losing the friendship so I continued it. But after all of this I dont think its gunna happen again. I also called me two friends john and justin who were supportive and helped me.  John knew the ex because he is best friends with my friend (Nate) and he hated her. I sent him the screen shots and he said that He would talk to him but i was afraid because i didn’t want justin and john ganging up on nate so I told justin to not say anything. John later texted me saying that nate didn’t love her but it wasn’t the point that i wanted to hear. At this time i still dont know what I wanted to hear.  I know all of this is a mix of my jealousy and hatered but i dont understand how 2 1/2 years of friendships can be tossed away that easily.  

 Now I’m not crying because i cant anymore.  In my head I just want to get better. Like lose weight (I’m obese and I’ve always had low self esteem) and possibly dye my hair again because i loved the color. But its like i dont have enough motivation to do anything. Even if i think “this is for my and my better health” its nothing and I even tried being stupid and thought “i can change and when nate comes back to naugy, he’ll see what he’s missing” and it still wasn’t enough.  I dont like being like this but I have no way of escaping this hole I dug myself into.  

I really dont know what to do anymore."
lonely,Almost my entire life is in my own head... that’s why I’m so lonely.,"Almost my entire life is in my own head... that’s why I’m so lonely. - The 1st question: Why do I see through these eyes?

I’m on a road. A lonely road to solve the mystery that is my existence. To answer questions that seem to have impossible answers. I have traveled to the Last Frontier in search of these answers. How much further must I go? 

This road is a lonely one. Everyone I’ve ever met, talked to, or just seen have only stayed for as long as it took to walk by them. I miss some, I hate others, and I’m anxious about meeting more. My road has taught me that everyone leaves in the end. I wish I could just stop from this road and be with someone but I can’t. I must answer these questions. I must find the answers to my existence even if that means I must die alone as much as I’ve lived alone. In the end, will these questions even get answered? Will I find peace? These must get answered.  From the ashes I must trudge on. With bitter tears I must keep going. 

The biggest question of my life, is one that I once asked my mom when I was 5. I asked her ,”why do I see through these eyes?” She didn’t know how to respond. I knew what I was asking. I wanted to know why I’m living this life and not another. I wanted to know what was so important for me to experience this existence. From this singular perspective. Why? So came forth the 2nd question: 

What am I supposed to see? 

I’ve put myself in situations just so I could feel accepted, included even. That way I can feel “normal.” Loved. And most important: understood. But none came to pass. No one seen the road I’m taking. No one understood me. Why would someone walk a road that is meant for one person? No one can. So I must keep walking and I have to look at other things. Where people brought me pain I must look elsewhere. I must follow my intuition and my dreams. I must go where I feel a connection with. I already taken the road to the Final Frontier. Why must I go on? 

My dreams show me isolation. Outcast. Stranded. Alone. I run down a mountain basin to avoid a river flood and come across black rock and an infinite view of ice. I feel partial to Reynisfjara as if it’s important. I don’t know why. I know not why I do the things I do. I just want to know why I see through these eyes and what is it that I’m supposed to see with them. But I’m tired. Tired and lonely. I want to lay my weary head to rest as Kansas once out it. Honestly, there’s not a day that I don’t think about dying. I want to die. I’ve tried so many times and yet here I am. I hope these answers are worth it and are answerable. I don’t know if I can take this road any longer. A lifetime of pain and loneliness is too much for me. When can I finally have peace? When I answer these questions? And then what? I must go to Iceland and see what Reynisfjara has to show me. What will I see? From the shadows I’ll come. The skeletal phoenix needs his rest soon so he can be reborn. What will happen to me on the beach? 

“To be or not to be, that is the question.” I need to know how and why I’m forced to live and see through these eyes to see this thing or things I’m supposed to see. I want to die but I must know. I don’t want to be old and look back and realize I never answered these questions. It would be a life unlived. Even if I travel the whole world. Even if I somehow transcend this existence. Even if I got everything this life could offer. I would feel unfulfilled without these questions answered. I must know what is the point soon. I want to die but I need a sign or something profound to prove that I need to go on. 

Why do I see through these eyes? 
What am I supposed to see? 
Why must I go on? 
Where does the road lead?"
lonely,Struggle with loneliness,"Struggle with loneliness - I’m a SAHM to a toddler. In a new area. A close family member recently suddenly died. My husband works away a lot. I’m struggling with feeling alone, but I know that even if we still lived in our home town, it wouldn’t be any better. I was supposed to go out for a Christmas night out with friends, driving 2 hours for it, and now it’s cancelled and I didn’t realise I was hanging onto this night out like a lifeline.

lonely,Whiney warning!,"Whiney warning! - I just hope this post gets burried, but I also hope at least one person reads it. Contradicting? Yeah, that is me! I just feel so alone and hopeless. I told you in the title it is whiny, what did you expect. I lost my parents when I was very young, an only spoiled child. They left me without any kind of financial security since they were both very ill years before they died, so all the money, savings etc went for the medical bills. They both died in the span of less than 30 days. After they died I got myself some scholarships and went to university where I made some really bad decisions. I didn't finish since I started working and the pay was really good, but the job was time-consuming. Through all this, I had this friend that was my rock. See, the same month my parents died, she lost her dad, and I guess we bonded over losing our parents, though we never talked about it. No, she was always the fun one, the one that made me laugh and forget everything bad about my life. God, I loved her, I still do. She was my happy place, my happy everything. For six years, I was always craveing her company, and she was like my fix for everything bad and ugly by just being near, and being herself. I got fired from my job after almost 4 years, and I went to a different place to find work, leaving her behind. She finished her studies, and got a really great job, then another, and another, and she finally left the country, got married, and has a kid now. See, we always talked how we won't marry or have kids ciz we loved life too much. Silly, pathetic, imature...I know. But I believed it. 
I got a crappy job in the new town. Met a great guy and got married. I love him, I respect him, I would give anything to make him happy, but I don't think I am in love with him. I can't have kids, even though he wants one or two. Honestly, at this point, I don't want kids. A couple months ago I got diagnosed with a nasty chronic illness. Since the sympthoms started two years ago, I had to stop working. My husband had to get another job to support us since my medical costs are growing by the minute. So now, he works two jobs, he is never home, and when he is, he is sleeping. I am all alone, all day, every day. Sometimes I realise that I've only been talking to a cat for two days. My family distanced themselves from me when my parents died for being ungreateful brat..and maybe I was, maybe I still am. My friend's world revolves around her kid and she told me I hurt her when I started distancing myself from her when she told me about her pregnancy. My other friend, my childhood friend that was pretty close in terms that I considered her as my sister, also left the country for work, got married to this super possesive a hole, and has a kid on the way. She recently texted me that I am a shitty friend and don't know how to keep in touch or ask for help. The casual friend, coffee buddy of sorts, that I hung out with for the last year, also went out of the country for work last month, and she texted me only once. I am not makeing this sh...t up I promise. I don't see a way out, I contribute nothing to my marriage, I see my husband is not happy, I am always in pain or depressed. I hate talking to people, I actually haven't got any people to talk to...."

lonely,Pretending he is dead,"Pretending he is dead - There was someone who meant a much to me, but I never really told him or anyone how much. When he was there I felt whole. Then he moved away and when I found out I broke down. It's been almost half a year now that he is gone. I'm starting to get over it and I think I'm already on a pretty good way. He still pops up in my mind everday but everday a little less. 
But everytime someone mentions him or everytime I talk about him, I pretend like he is dead. There is a chance that he is coming back to me, but if he would come back, he would also leave again. And I couldn't take that pain again. So I pretend like he is dead, so I don't get to think of having a second chance with him"
lonely,I don't want to be alone anymore!,"I don't want to be alone anymore! - I used to be (or at least think i was) the lonely guy who liked to just relax somewhere alone or in my room, playing video games and binge watching something. and I honestly liked it, it didn't bother me at all. I had some few friends that I really cared for and they felt the same. we used to hang out sometimes, go to the river to swim or do something after school. We used to all group up in someone's house or room, and spend hours playing video games (League of legends mostly).

This year I moved to another city (a bigger city) for med school. I know some people here, old ""friends"" I didn't talk too for at least two years, we hang out from time to time but it never feels the same like the five of real friends all in a small dorm room playing video games and flaming the shit out of each other.

It's been 3 months now (it's been lonely af) and I still can't make a single real friendship with someone for a lot of reasons. I tried going to parties and joining clubs I even went with a medical caravan (where people are supposed to make new friends) but I still can't find just one good friend.

Everyone already has groups and friends and doesn't care to talk to the shy guy (me) at the corner. Maybe they just don't notice me there :). if I'm not in class or between classes I'm always sitting in a bench in a place where every single one in the university passes near and I swear to god not a single one of them notices I'm there as if I'm the just an invisible cunt sitting there.

you might say don't be shy and go talk to someone about the first thing goes to your mind, but it's very hard, it feels almost impossible for me.

I'm writing this post for the simple reason that I needed someone to say this too and the internet is the place were it doesn't matter if i get judged or not because I can just go offline and not care. And also to say : please talk to people that are alone in parties and stuff. us being there is our first step to socialize. Just help us."

I have no friends here, no neighbors, no job or school, other than homeschool. I’ve expressed my interest in attending public school and have attended it before but got extremely ill due to being unvaccinated and don’t know if I can safely go back to a public space such as that. I can’t get a job because my parents are forcing me to do online college classes against my wishes and it takes up so much of my time that I don’t think I could balance that.

lonely,My Crush,"My Crush - ***\*Sorry, bit of a long post\****

Man dude, I miss her. We met over the summer at a church event and she was really the only person there that treated me like a human. She actually listens to my problems and doesn't interrupt me, but she lives in Georgia and I live in Alabama. We have each others numbers and snaps so we talk whenever we can, but she's busy most of the time. Everyday I feel lonely but whenever we talk it goes away. I just miss her so much, I haven't seen her in months and its been 2 weeks since we talked because of school and what not. Me and her both have been through similar stuff too, theres just one difference. I still feel miserable and depressed but I don't think she does. So I'm scared that I'm just making her life harder and being a burden to her. Because I'm just like my mom, my anxiety skyrockets, I think of the worst will happen, and I always wear a ""mask"" around other people. Only her and some people on discord know who I truly am. Nobody at school does though, or at home. Not even my parents. I'm just worried that I'm making her sad whenever I talk to her sometimes. I'm just scared that in a way I'm making her relive her past. Because I always have the urge to cut/burn myself and she knows about it. I'm just scared that I'm worrying her a lot because she knows what I'm capable of doing to myself. I need help, and I just want to be with her. She's the only person that makes me happy, relieves my stress, and I truly do love her. I tell her it almost every night. I just wish I was there with her so I can get a hug. Thats the first thing she did when we met. She didn't know about my situation at all and now she does. It makes me want to cry just thinking about this topic. 

Thats all, thank y'all for reading this post."

lonely,U. Toronto study: Rising white mortality rate due to fear of losing dominant social status,"U. Toronto study: Rising white mortality rate due to fear of losing dominant social status - &amp;#x200B;

A new study by researchers at the University of Toronto asserts the rise in mortality among white Americans is due to worrying about losing their dominant social status.

Titled “Growing sense of social status threat and concomitant deaths of despair among whites,” [**the study**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235282731830291X?via%3Dihub) reveals the “startling finding” that the non-Hispanic white demographic is the only one which suffered a mortality rate increase in the last 20 years.

Such a rise typically is attributable to “something disastrous” like an epidemic or war, lead researcher Arjumand Siddiqi says. In this case, however, the “misperception that \[whites’\] dominant status in society is being threatened” is “manifesting in multiple forms of psychological and physiological stress,” [***Newsweek*** **reports**](https://www.newsweek.com/rising-death-rates-among-white-americans-caused-misperceived-threat-their-dominant-social-status-1474038?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=NewsweekTwitter).

Siddiqi and his team theorized part of this threat is the fact that black Americans “economically catching up” to whites.

lonely,I've spent my life avoiding love by fear of getting hurt.,"I've spent my life avoiding love by fear of getting hurt. - I've always pushed away guys I was interested in and who were interested in me. Everything goes fine until I find out they like me back. Then, instantly, I question whether we should give it a try or not, and the answer is always no. I come up with the most ridiiiiiculous reasons. Suddenly, things that had never been a problem become an obstacle to a potential relationship. I always ruin everything. And I end up alone, and I hurt these people in the process. Every time.

Result : I'm 25 and I've never been in a relationship, and more time passes, less ready I feel, even though there's nothing I want more than being in one. I want to commit but it scares me. Also, I'm more and more ashamed by it. People my age usually have a love life, introduce their boyfriend or girlfriend to their family, move in with their partner, etc. I've never introduced anyone to my family ; I live alone, no one is ever waiting for me/I don't have anyone to wait for ; and I'm pretty sure my parents have pity for me because of how lonely I am.

I think that, in a way, it's also because I'm always in control, nothing I do is spontaneous. I unconsciously try to give a certain image of me : the one of someone who doesn't have any problem, and I guess welcoming someone in my life would ""force me"" to show how vulnerable I am. I don't know...

I don't think I will ever find someone unless I solve these confidence, trust and commitment issues. Soooo... I'm not very optimistic, to say the least :-)"

lonely,"How to cope with loneliness, knowing what it feels like on the other side?","How to cope with loneliness, knowing what it feels like on the other side? - It had been two years since I'd (20M) had any sort of romantic relationship. The loneliness was crippling. In the past few years I've worked a lot on getting to know myself and trying to be content on my own, but I've yearned for a loving and fulfilling relationship the whole time. I think I've made a lot of progress and I'm doing better than I was, but I still have a long way to go.

A month or so ago, I met one of the most charismatic, beautiful, funny, empathetic women I've ever met in my life. We clicked instantly and within 2 weeks we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend (21F). The problem is I'm in Australia on exchange, and I'm moving back to America for at least the next three years... in a week.

My girlfriend and I have spent every possible moment together since we met. Whenever we're around each other it's like life is just perfect. This is her first relationship, I've had several in the past but none of them were really very healthy or serious. I can feel that this one is so much different though, and I'm not ready for it to end. We've talked about long distance but it just isn't going to be feasible.

I feel as though I've got everything I've ever wanted. I finally feel complete. And before I know it, it'll all be ripped away from me, and I'll be back to square one. Only this time it's going to hurt so much more, because I know what the other side feels like.

How can I cope with this feeling of hopelessness? How can I leave Australia knowing that I won't be happy anymore when I get home? How can I go on?"
lonely,Friends,"Friends - I know plenty of people in my life, and seems I can only trust one person.

Now that our boys have enter middle school everyone went their own way and stop coming around. I’m fine with it, cause you see the true colors. My son also notice it also and doesn’t feel his friends are not brothers anymore. But I did tell him thing change going into middle school and high school. But it is what it is, point is I didn’t get upset of people using me for their kids because I can see the kids in the halls in middle and high schools and they speak/greeting me with respect as I taught them while coaching/mentoring."
lonely,"I miss them, but I’m not sure if they feel the same way.","I miss them, but I’m not sure if they feel the same way. - I’m currently a senior in high school. I’ve been to 3 high schools, 2 middle schools, and 2 elementary schools. I move quite a lot. There was one place (I’ll call it “X”) where I hated living in.  I was there for 5 years, which is the longest I’ve ever been in one place. We then left to a place (I’ll call it “Y”) and I was very happy there. I was used to moving and I always had friends, but I didn’t really miss them. I was in a state where I didn’t want to do anything in Y. I was just very sad, I was always being hit and yelled at by my parents and it got really bad. I had only like 1 friend to tell here. I dealt with this abuse for about two years. I would consider this abuse, because despite the fact that I’ve been physically punished and yelled at, this was a lot worst and it was on a day-to-day basis. My parents eventually had a divorce and my sister, mom, and I eventually went back to X. In a new school, I didn’t know anyone. I made friends after a month and I never knew how close we would get. I really felt connected with them. They were like a family, I had people I looked up to and people that just felt like I’ve always known. They’ve all known each other for almost all their lives. I was just with them for 3 years. I then moved to a new place. And I really miss them. I made this since I’ve been having dreams of going back to that school and seeing all my friends. But I’m a bit sad, because I’m not sure if they care about me the way I do."

lonely,I have been feeling lonely and empty ever sense i was 9,"I have been feeling lonely and empty ever sense i was 9 - When i turned 9 years old me and my family moved away to another city. I did not keep contact with any of my friends because at the time 9 year olds did not have cell phones or social media. Me and my brother ended up going to different schools. I did not know anyone at my new school and for the first time i had a feeling that i had never felt before and did not know how to describe it. Everyday i would go to school, come home and go to bed. I just wanted my days to pass faster because I wasn’t feeling okay and did not know why. 2 months in to this new school, my parents knew something was up. One morning my mom asks me whats wrong and i just burst into tears and have basically my first mental breakdown which was really scary for me because i did not know what i was feeling or why or how to stop it. I did not know how to explain so i just gave a bullshit excuse and said i was being bullied and wanted to change schools and go to school with my brother. It worked, I changed schools and felt a bit better for a couple months because I had my brother with me. Everything after that Is way too long to explain but that bullshit excuse set me down a path I wish i never had to take. I am now 18, I have 1 friend who is also depressed, not on speaking terms with my mother because she cheated on my father, i always feel like im a disappointment to my dad and i can tell he has been lonely ever sense my mom left but idk how to help him. Every girl i have ever been with has just affected my mental health for the worse except for 1 which i ruined all on my own. Me and my brother constantly fight and Im in my senior year and have no idea where im going after this or what i wanna do and have been contemplating suicide ever sense i was 16. I am scared for my senior year to end because atleast for now i have a goal, finish high school, after that im stranded in a world where nothing interests me, nobody likes me and I only see 1 way out of it all"
lonely,I feel stuck,"I feel stuck - So I’m new to reddit and after sifting through all the funny, crazy, mind tingling pages, thought I’d come through here and share how I’m feeling and the situation I’m in, as this community caught my eye, I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. 
 
For the past two years, I’ve noticed something about myself, I’m afraid to talk to people about my problems even when it is absolutely necessary. For example, in university I hadn’t done so well in my program so I was ultimately booted and applied for a fresh start, which I did get accepted into and got into another program. This program requires me to talk to an academic advisor as well as someone else to “talk me through my issues”. But I don’t enjoy talking to people about my issues nor-do I have the mental strength to get up from bed and be like “yeah today I’m going to talk to my advisor and counsellor” even though I really need to. I don’t enjoy burdening other people with my problems so I seclude myself from putting myself into situations were I would need to talk about my problems. Anyways, it’s come to the point where it’s actually affecting everything I do in life. Crippling loneliness as it were and nobody to talk to about it, but it’s my own fault for putting myself in this situation anyways. My life two years ago was completely different, had friends. had a girlfriend and I was really happy. Obviously two years later, things happen, people exit your life and that isn’t my problem. 

My problem is, I see all my old friends and best friends, moving on with their life. My world is moving so fast and it seems like I’m running behind it just barely struggling to catch up. Sounds cliché but yeah. 

TL; DR Advice for someone who needs to talk to someone about issues but can’t summon the strength to get the fuck up and do something about it. I feel it’s at the point where in order to move on with my life, I need to fix my issues. And I have been trying for two years, and I’ve had no luck. Tf do I do?"
lonely,Why do we/I feel so lonely?,"Why do we/I feel so lonely? - I mean I don't understand, a lot of people are ""sad"" for different reasons and mine happens to be loneliness, but why? I have two loving parents and two great friends, couple of acquaintances here and there... I think maybe its cause no one genuinely cares. No one asks how I'm doing, parents are an exception, of course, no one asks what I'm up to, no one asks to chill with them.

I hate to make stories personal cause usually not as many people comment cause it's ""a you problem"", but I used to have so many friends in high school, was the leader of the group and I had lunch with a friend recently, he said he was bi and that he was figuring out his life and how he felt about the way I treated people, he also reminisced about the bitterness I had in high school or ""savageness"" and that's why lots of people liked me cause I was funny and stuff, but in reality I probably hurt more people than those that I made laugh, maybe that's why they all parted ways. 

I guess it all makes sense now, this is why I deserve this I guess. It also sucks when you are 18 and haven't been in a relationship and anything you get that's close to it ends in a hope crushing way, pushing you down deeper. It especially sucks when your mom and dad mention relationships here and there, like some sort of pressure to get in a relationship as if I didn't want one... Well sorry, mom and dad but it's not that easy."
lonely,27[M4R] Seeking kind new friends,"27[M4R] Seeking kind new friends - Hello everyone. Let me start off by saying my name is Plato and I’m the host of an OSDD system. For the uninitiated, OSDD is a type of multiple personality disorder. A system is a term used to refer to the collective of people inside the body. 

We like to be open about this because we all like to have friends and be ourselves with people. 

With that said, we’re looking for kind, accepting individuals to be friends with. We need more positive energy in our lives and people who genuinely enjoy our company. 

The good thing about being friends with a system is that you get a handful of friends for the price of one. 

Our interests include: video games, music, art, cartoons, ARGs, horror stuff (like YouTube videos, movies, shows, etc.), text based roleplaying, DnD, collecting things and miniature versions of stuff. 

We like to play games with friends, voice chat, watch things together and just chill in general. We enjoy good jokes and good memes. Some of us can be described as goofy, though some of us could be described as tsundere. But they warm up with time. 

We have all manner of contact method, though we do prefer to use discord due to bots that help us communicate more easily. However, we are willing to work with what others prefer as well. 

If you’re interested in getting to know us, then please send us a message! Thanks!"
lonely,Lonely in college,"Lonely in college - I just had to do a project looking back on when I went abroad in high school. Looking at the pictures I was so happy. I had friends who I loved and who loved me, and when I got back to my home country I just stopped communicating with them. Then my family moved and I barely made new friends except for one person, who I realized was a gem too late and we graduated before we could be friends. Now I'm halfway through college with low grades, literally zero friends, and I talk to myself to fill the silence in my apartment. I just narrate everything I do or watch YouTube. My only social time is when I go to work. I'm so lonely. The only thing that brings me true joy anymore are my pets and they live 10 hours away. I have so many regrets. I wish I kept those friends. I wish I was a better person so I could deserve to have such great people in my life. I'm so starved for human interaction but I just let everyone down."

I'm 15 and have been making bad decisions recently and have always been a mix between introverted and extroverted so being grounded all the time and not hanging out w friends never bothered me but i also lived party's. I was abused real bad when i was little and that caused me to have anger problems and so I've always had a mean streak. A few months ago I had to start doing group therapy and it doesn't help very much but im forced to go there. I did lsd twice in the past couple months and my whole perspective on life has changed. I feel like there's not really a point on life and I had alway d felt comfortable being alone and was perfectly fine if I had no one to talk to. When ppl said they felt lonely I just couldn't relate but had sympathy for them. Ever since I did the lsd tho I've felt that none of my friends are real friends and that they don't care abt me but it didnt really bother me bc I had myself and weed. But tn I feel truly lonely and it's awful and I always thought ppl that put there feelings on Reddit or social media were kinda lame but here I am

lonely,"This existence is a cold one, and when people speak, they speak to be heard- they don't speak to listen.","This existence is a cold one, and when people speak, they speak to be heard- they don't speak to listen. - The worst kind of loneliness is when you have so many people around you and you still feel lonesome.

So you isolate yourself to know that in your choice, you've chosen a life where you can luxuriate in a bliss of not having to put a mask upon your face to commune with those around you.

But life without society can feel so cold and empty at times. And man sees not warmth in community, but endless empty streets, benches without occupants, parks without park-goers and the list goes on.

What does one do when the natural state of one's self is nigh-incommunicable to others?

It's like the tower of babel on a personal scale."

Grew up with an awesome family that checks in on me periodically, even my sister overseas(who is doing well and perfectly happy, even while single). I'm usually pretty positive.

Hell, I'm *the* positive guy at work, to the point all my coworkers checked in on me the one day I wasn't super talkative and upbeat. Why wouldn't I be positive? My coworkers rock.

But then I think about having always been single, and not so much for sex(I'm able to if I want) but because I just want to be a priority in someone's life, and have their interests be my priority, too(I'm a people's person).

Literally haven't heard from my best friend since I moved away nearly a year ago(we've talked a few times but I always initiated. Didn't even get a happy birthday). My brother mostly messages me for help with school-related things. My other sister usually calls me if no one else on her checklist picks up.

Why? Why can't I be content? I've so much to be grateful for, but the moment I get too much downtime and start just looking at my empty apartment, or I cook up some bacon/waffle breakfest for myself and myself alone, I wonder why it is this way. And my most recent dating attempt(aka reaching the point where I look for an actual girlfriend and not whatever the hell we are) have ended with ""Talking to my ex again, someone else would be lucky to have you...""

lonely,My ex-best friend and I ended our friendship on bad terms though I can't get over her.,"My ex-best friend and I ended our friendship on bad terms though I can't get over her. - I (20M) had a ex-BFF () and I met my ex-BFF in my middle school 6th grade year online from Xbox 360 live services. I stayed in touch with her through the years and created a strong friendship with her, completely viewing her as a best friend and nothing more but she sought something more intimate than best friends and I had some strict guidelines that made me refrain from entering that intimate relationship with her. To provide more info on her, she started developing feelings for me when I had entered my sophomore year in high school and had confessed to me for the first time mid-school year. I respectfully responded to her and told her that I couldn't establish a relationship with her because I didn't like her, along with other reasons like; she lived in Seattle while I lived in California (I couldn't handle a long-distance relationship), I was fearful of ruining our friendship by being a bad boyfriend, she's the ex of my male best friend who I still keep in touch with). She was an extremely smart girl too and pretty with a small figure and long hair. She was popular while I was kinda meh at my school, knew a lot of people but never had true friends except for my BFF. We had a strong connection like we would call each other in the morning while walking to school, after school walking home, and usually late at night until we fell asleep on the phone (rip phone bills to parents :c). Whenever I had a personal problem stressing me out, homework stuff, or a tantrum, I would rant out my feelings to her and she would honestly make me feel better and conform myself. All the while talking about her day to me soothed me and gave me comfort that she was doing well on her side. Though things didn't stay static like this as I mentioned earlier that she confessed her feelings to me that I turned down, I offered that I'd still be her best friend and she was obviously upset but took the offer and was thankful I stayed the same though 3-4 years in a row, she continued to confess her feelings to me and I did my best to minimalize the pain I'd cause to her when I declined every time. I'd even encourage her to find other guys in her area because I didn't want to elevate our level of friendship. It wasn't til I was 17 and she was 15 when she started going out to party with others and said she was changing and it was true as I watched my best friend change from a humble 4.0 GPA early university student to well just a 4.0 GPA student of the University of Washington that parties hella hard now chugging soju and .. hooking up with guys which kind of brings tears to me while I type this because I blamed myself since my later half of senior year in high school for her negative change of lifestyle. I noticed that she started to get somewhat annoyed of me at times when I would talk about someone I'm interested in (maybe I was careless of her feelings, I think so.) and she would talk explicitly about the guys that she meets that are so rich, handsome, and are amazing int'l students while I'm just a fucking couch potato lol, honestly I am quite the cozy couch potato anyway back to the story, she would I guess try to make me feel jealous and I honestly did though I mostly was kinda happy that she was enjoying herself, just kinda because she was usually with a new guy every time we talked which was about once every 2 weeks-3 weeks because of how busy we were with school. One day I assumed she was drunk and she texted me saying why I wouldn't accept her and randomly said things like how she didn't care that I thought I wasn't cute, or smart enough to go straight to a 4-year university (I'm getting into CSULB Fall 2020...so...I am kinda smart), or that I was living with my parents still (EVERYONE I KNOW THAT IS SMART LIVES WITH HER PARENTS STILL WHY IS THIS AN ISSUE), but I told her I wasn't comfortable with us getting into a relationship so she started ranting about her feelings even more and I tried to reason with her then she started insulting me and it kind of flipped a switch in me and I bursted with outrage calling her an unreliable friend that belittles me when I try my best to help her out, I called her things I shouldn't have like 'slut' for always messaging me about how she took in a 7 inch guy with her throat, and I find that sketchy because she's like 4'7"" but who knows. Though I hurt that trust that she had because tbh, giving out that kind of information is pretty hard unless you absolutely trust and are comfortable with the person you're talking to it about. Though all in all, she and I blocked each other though her birthday resides on a certain day in June and I always message her happy birthday even if we weren't friends, or are 'archnemesis'. She would reply thank you each time and despite how our relationship had ended, I still look up her instagram accounts and like to check up on her to see how she's doing, seeing posts of her cooking, her artwork, just her going to EDM concerts or festivals warms me up because though she's caused me a whole deal of pain, I'm thankful for meeting her for the good times we had. I feel that she hates me for what I said and still has me blocked but a few days ago, she liked a few of my photos from my public instagram posts and I don't know what to think of that as. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the readers, I'm sorry if the quality of this post is shit, I honestly was jumbling through my memory to keep it accurate, I am actually leaving out a lot of stuff about her that I find readers would possibly see as toxic like her immediately disliking anyone I sought as a possible relationship partner or being overprotective and too-clingy for getting annoyed at me not responding to her messages when I'm asleep. This is my 2nd reddit post and I barely type essays anymore so I'll try to improve, and please ask any questions I'll try my best to provide clarity. Gosh I'm embarrassed looking at this mess I wrote haha."
lonely,Weekends are so boring,"Weekends are so boring - I never know what to do, I just sit around, sometimes go out for a meal thinking I can talk to someone but there never is anyone, so I just go back home and sit around more. It's a lame life:/"
lonely,"At the end of the day, I'm nobody's first choice","At the end of the day, I'm nobody's first choice - I have a lot of friends. I have my parents who care. I have my brother and his fiancé. One guy I'm seeing who is in an open relationship. 

At the end of the day, that guy goes home to his girlfriend. My brother goes home to his wife. My parents go back home together. I have many friends, but no best friend. None of my friends would pick me first if they had to. 

It sucks to think that if I were to win a trip for two, whoever I pick wouldn't be the person who picks me. I want to book a trip to an all-inclusive resort in a month, and I have no one to go with. Everyone either would rather go with their partner, or have no money (so they say), or I don't know them well enough. I'm ok with being alone but in a resort it feels weird. There aren't as many opportunities to go talk to other alone people like in hostels. 

Whenever someone says they're lonely or alone or have nobody, they get told to go out and meet people. I've done that. But I'm never someone's first. Whenever I meet someone and they mention their best friend, it makes me sad because it reminds me I don't have one, and haven't since I was 8 years old, and that I'll never be that person's best friend because that slot is already filled. 

I have 3-4 friends from different groups that I consider my closest, and they all have best friends. It makes me ashamed to consider them my number ones, when they would consider me their two, three, or even worse. 

I'm so used to being alone, I learned to be ok with it 99% of the time, and to actually love it. I get so much happiness from it sometimes, knowing I won't ever have to suffer being in a relationship I dislike just for the company, or anything like that. I know that at the end of the day, I will be ok. 

That 1% rest of the time though it hurts."

lonely,Strange thing,Strange thing - When someone says they love you or they miss you but they don’t actually show it. Yes an “I love you” or “I miss you” can mean the world to me... but they can be empty words. Like in the end your actions show the most? Idk if I’m making sense...
lonely,I feel like I only have myself in this world.,"I feel like I only have myself in this world. - Nearly 8 billion people in the world. I can reach so many of them just by joining a subreddit or a comment thread. I can meet strangers as far as Germany or as close as ten miles away from me. Yet, I feel like I only have myself in this world. Three failed relationships. A best friend who left me after ten years of knowing each other, of creating art together and endless memories with each other; leaving without a word or a text ever since. A friend who has lost contact with me and doesn't respond to my texts because she is now occupied with her own life and boyfriend. Friends who update me about their lives yet never ask me about my own. One of the only people I have ever had in my life who asked me about how I felt has his own problems to deal with and often doesn't answer his phone. Family who only want to listen to the tidbits of my problems and disregards them if I tell them too much. A mom who tells me that I will never be in a successful relationship because of the way I look and the way I act. A dad who is never around and throws money at me to make it seem like he is still an active part of my life. I join clubs and reach out to old friends. They don't pay attention. 

So what next? I can go on Omegle and have a dead conversation that leads to some kind of sexting. Only for it to end right after it's finished. I can play video games and escape from my problems and have to face the fact that I will have to return to reality again. I can just look into the wall until I fall asleep or maybe even cry thinking about how it all doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense how it is so easy for people to leave. How easy it is for people to ignore things. I know, I sound like a broken record. It's the same things you have all read before. It's the same story, the same words, just by another person. Yet I feel like there is no one who can explain this to me.

Three years ago, I contemplated suicide several times. I wondered if my life was meant for anything. The people I called my friends would stare blankly at me whenever I said anything about how I felt. So I continued on by telling myself that it didn't matter what I felt, not because it was burdening them. But because nothing was going to change it. And obviously so, because no one stuck around. No one asked. No one wondered or did a double-take. They just thought I'd be fine. And I most likely will be. But I won't be living, I'll just be existing. A husk of what I could have been."
lonely,I feel lonely and invisible :(,"I feel lonely and invisible :( - So I’m a guy who has never had any kind of meaningful relationships, not because I don’t want to but because life decided that way. Because of my parents jobs, I constantly bounced around places therefore I was never able to build long-term relationships with other people at school, it also didn’t allow me to date because why would I try to be with someone if I sometime later had to move to other city/country... 

So because of that I grew up alone, all by myself and to be honest I don’t hate it, I got used to it. But now that my parents quit that job they had, I was able to establish myself in one place and I was looking forward to form meaningful friendships and even perhaps find a SO.

But that was not what happened, I just feel unmotivated to make friendships, I mean I do have friends but their just school colleagues, when I get home I’m all by myself again and don’t have anyone to talk to, I think I got accommodated in my loneliness.

In terms of possible relationships, I just feel like I’m completely invisible, it just seems that everyone looks at me simply as a friend, it’s like I’m not attractive in any kind of way, I know it doesn’t help that I’m a short and not so good-looking guy, but I try to be kind and respectful to everybody. Despite this, girls just seem to be interested in the “bad boys”.

It really makes me sad when I see others in relationships and being loved, but then me I’m just here lonely and dreaming about loving someone and being loved..

I’m sorry if what I wrote is confusing, but I just needed to share somewhere what is on my mind.

lonely,"How do terrible, mean people have friends?","How do terrible, mean people have friends? - My entire life, I have been known as the “nice” girl. I have been told by people that I am one of the nicest people they have ever met. 

I was the girl who would smile at strangers in the hall and politely nod and provide commentary to people’s stories. I was the shoulder to cry on and the ears to vent to. If you were my friend, I was the friend that would give you my last $20 if you needed gas money. I would go above and beyond for birthdays. I listened to everybody’s problems, provided amazing advice, and rarely ever judged. I constantly put other people before myself. I would go out of my way to be nice, because I loved when people went out of their ways to be nice to me. I loved making others feel good. 

Unfortunately, It has not been reciprocated because I have no friends. I do not have any friends that call me to hang out. I do not have any friends that reach out just to check up on me. I always thought that being good to others would guarantee that you would have people to fall back on, but that has not been the case for me. 

It bothers me so much especially since some of the most judgmental, negative, toxic, ugliest ppl I have ever known have tons of friends to spend time and hang out with. I always hear people talking about their friends, saying things like, “my friend is extremely annoying and such an racist asshole but I love her. We hang out all the time”. It’s very confusing.

TL;DR: I am nice to everybody and have no friends. I know ppl who are terrible to everybody,  yet are extremely popular and well-liked/loved by many. Is that confusing to anyone else?"

lonely,Stuck in a rut,"Stuck in a rut - 31 m uk living alone. My current life is work, come home in the evening, smoke a bit of weed and play video games for 3-4 hours then repeat. I dont have any friends anymore and really struggle to be bothered with people anymore. I've kind if just numbed myself to the loneliness but recently it's been eating at me again. I don't know why I'm saying this here I guess it's just nice to 'talk'."
lonely,Damaged on the inside,"Damaged on the inside - I used to be fat. Really fat. During that time, I stopped looking for love. I was invisible to guys and whenever they did pay me attention, it was usually to make fun of me. My friends would encourage me to come out (bowling, clubbing, picnics, etc) but I would always decline because I felt so ashamed of myself. I was disgusted with myself. I felt like nobody would ever want me. 

Fast forward, and now I’m a healthy weight. I’m slender and graceful. Nothing like the clumsy mass I once was. People tell me I look good. My friends tell me ‘that guy’s checking you out!’ My mother genuinely looks happy to see me and parades me around when her friends come over.

But inside I feel sick and ugly. I still feel like that fat girl. My confidence is completely shot. I don’t trust guys who approach me — I’m still convinced they’re only being nice so they can get close and make fun of me. I feel so lonely and I just want a relationship but my insecurity is crushing me.   

And so, I’ve gone and fixated myself on a well known person. A crush, a one sided relationship that is (almost harmless*) because he will never tell me I’m fat or ugly. He will never hurt me. Sometimes it’s safer to love someone from afar even though you’re sacrificing touch and intimacy and even conversation. I feel pathetic even admitting this but it is what it is.

*until he gets himself a girlfriend or gets married, that is"

You try to talk with someone and someone else drowns you out with a topic that you know nothing about, so you can’t include yourself. It seems so stupid but when I’m around these groups it makes me feel way more isolated than dealing with just one person. Because you just have to sit and watch as you see any potential you have drain away as people have the time of their lives.

lonely,"I just feel like everyone around me talks about relationships and I'm just here, lonely as always","I just feel like everyone around me talks about relationships and I'm just here, lonely as always - (posted on a throwaway account because I don't want my friends to read this)  
Basically, even though I count myself as a lot happier than I’ve ever been, I still feel so damn lonely, even lonelier than I ever did before. For context, I’m 16, male and gay af.

I have people that I care about a lot, okay… only one really. I count him as family even though we’re not related and only know each other for about four month. I know he wont leave me, but there’s still something that makes me scared so much about it turning out that everything is a lie and he just leaves me for no reason like people did before him. Don’t get me wrong, I have no intention of ever wanting to have him as my boyfriend or anything, I see him as more than that.

Apart from that, I have no one. I have some “friends” at work and school but honestly they don’t really care about me and neither do I about them (even though I’d never tell them that).

So.. enough backstory. My real issue, and why I feel so lonely is that I never had any sort of boyfriend and no reason to think that I’ll get one any time in the foreseeable future. Yes, I know that it’s just stupid and I shouldn’t feel bad about this and that I’ll probably find someone at some point but, tbh, I just don’t think that’s true really. Everyone I know at least has or had someone, I'm just lonely and never had someone.

I just want someone to cuddle and give all my love to.

Also not helping the fact is that I literally never met a gay guy irl and that just makes me feel even worse. Like… I have contact with people in the LGBT-community, most of my online friends are part of it. But irl, I know two LGBT-girls and not a single gay guy and it’s depressing me more than I'm willing to admit.

Don’t get me wrong, I can live with that, even though I really don’t want to. But it’s just depressing me and making me sad, especially when I see couples being happy together and most of my friends finding partners them self (although that usually doesn’t always last long, but the point still stands). I’m just here and lonely, without anyone (and me crushing on straights is definitely not helping the situation).

Anyways, thanks to the about zero people reading this."
lonely,Looking for someone,Looking for someone - last time i was in a relationship was 5 years ago. Been single since December 2014 (i know it’s been too long) . I moved abroad just before my breakup and living in a different country i guess it gets a bit difficult to connect to people so probably that’s one of the reasons i am still single. I have been on a roller coaster since i have moved. From working 7 days a week to struggling to kickstart my career to now where i think i am finally at peace for a bit. But off lately i am struggling to make sense of my life . I am 26 single and miss being in a relationship. All i ever feel now is to find that special someone just so that i could hold her and walk down to the park and talk all day. I mean i have tried online dating and stuff but it hasn’t worked out for me . All i want to do is find that someone so that i could finally feel things and get my guard down . I just need to meet her so that i could tell her how beautiful she is and all this wait has been worth it for her. I mean i just don’t how long can i carry on like this.

As I sit there reading, I start to cry, silently, so Mom won't hear. She enters my room anyway to ask for some stuff, sees me crying and asks me if it's because of my studying difficulties.

lonely,I just want to talk to someone [vent],"I just want to talk to someone [vent] - Every sunday I have another mental breakdown. I want to vent to someone about it but the truth is that I don't have anyone. I have a hard time making friends, right now I have couple of people with whom I spend time during lunch.. maybe 2 or 3 but.. I don't really view them as friends and they probably feel the same way about me. I just can't connect with people. Maybe it's because I wasn't born here. Maybe everyone feels that way and I am just bitching. Probably.. Right now I just feel miserable. A week ago I counted all the pills in the bathroom to see if it'd be enough to do it if I ever wanted to. Tomorrow I will probably feel better, ignore my problems, but right now I just can't live with the thought that there is no one in this world who really likes me..hah"

lonely,"37M, UK MK18, shy, lonely and desperate for a cuddle","37M, UK MK18, shy, lonely and desperate for a cuddle - Marriage ended 2 years ago.  It was the right thing to do, we’d been together all our lives and we just weren’t compatible anymore.

Met someone new a year ago, she was absolutely perfect.  A second chance.  We rushed into living together too soon, and while I was still dealing with the stresses of divorce, and other things, I ended up neglecting the relationship.  By the time she told me she wasn’t happy, she wouldn’t let me have another chance to make it right.  

So I’ve been single for two weeks, unexpectedly heartbroken.  I’m a very tactile person, and I’m spending every day in floods of tears because I just want someone to hold me.  Waking up in an empty bed is soul destroying.  There’s no motivation to even get out of bed, she’s not around to look forward to any more."

I've learned a lot about myself and have matured emotionally,  but all of that tends to not matter much when you're walking into your 8th prospect putting your best self forward trying, like actually trying and in the end the results are not how you expected.  I don't blame the other person this time around, they have a whole lot to deal with and sort out before they are ready to enter something seriously. That's okay.  Perfectly fine.  Even still,  it's just tiresome,  trying over and over and never having a good outcome. I'm just tired of it all.  The constant putting effort into something that results in a loss."

lonely,No friends..,"No friends.. - It all started out very slowly over the course of 3 years. 

When I 1st started high school in a new city I struggled to find friends and to just fit in. 
It seemed like everyone had a group of friends around them and belonged in the school. 

I absolutely hated eating lunch alone watching everybody having a great time with their friends. 
I tried to hang out with people but I just didn't find anybody that I could vibe with at school I felt like I was annoying to everybody. 

 I started skipping lunch  and I would just show up in the afternoons right after lunch. I thought I could just do my morning classes online. 
That lead me down a path of just skipping school all together. In total i missed around 90 days of school and that's when the school finally decided to kick me out.

So now I've been doing online school for 1 year now and I fuckin hate it. It's lonely and depressing as hell. I'm only doing it because my depression is so bad that I can only wake up in the afternoon or evenings no matter how early I fall asleep. 

I tried going back to school after going to therapy but I only lasted a few weeks until I just gave up and went back to isolating myself from the world.  I do love being alone sometimes but it would be nice to wake up and just be a normal teen for a change. I really don't see myself being in this world for much longer and that's also a huge part of why I kind of gave up on finding friends. I feel like I would be wasting their time if I'm just gonna off myself in a few years"

lonely,[L] tired of living,"[L] tired of living - I don't know what to write of where to begin, I'll think of something as I write.

Hi, my name is Lumirogen, it's not my real name, but just call me M.

I'll start where I feel like most people would get why I struggle the way I do, I grew up with a single parent who was abusive and neglectful, and because of that, I grew up selfless, and I don't really think of myself that often, and that resulted in having to cope in bad ways, I.e, substance abuse, self harm, going up unto rooftops I'm not allowed at because of not really putting helpful coping skills into practice. 

It's just there are very few places I feel like I can go to to recharge, so I feel as I get older, I feel like one day, I'll just stop giving a crap whether or not I'm going into places I'm not allowed to be at, it'll become a problem, especially involving my mental health and my living situation.

I moved out not too long ago, say a few months ago from my toxic environment, and I am struggling, I admit that, I grew up cut off from the world and my *want* to get better with that is getting stronger as much as my want to kill myself is, I do have suicidal ideation, but I do want to say that I don't feel like I am suicidal, it's just, I don't have any healthy coping skills nor do I feel like I want to put that into practice having major depressive disorder and PTSD myself, I do have hope for myself, but I just keep struggling because I feel like I'm stuck in a feedback loop of not wanting to care, but at the same time, I feel like there is something inside of me that does want to care, so in between that is what I feel like my fight or flight response is messing me up."

From what I’ve read, a lot of you are. I’m a 33 year old bloke, from Ipswich in QLD. I don’t care if you’re straight, gay, bi, trans, male, female. Does anyone want a day or night out? Not sexual. No strings. Just a hug, coffee, lunch, an ear to vent. I’m not here to judge.

lonely,Just lonely,"Just lonely - It gets pretty lonesome being by myself all the time. I do my best to engage in other activities but I guess my depression is pretty bad off. It difficult to focus sometimes.  I know there are plenty of people who care about me,  despite it doesn't seem like it at times.  Sometimes I feel like I just demand a lot of attention.  Whether it's  good or bad.  Past experiences have taught me to leave people alone since they really don't want to be bothered half the time.  Most cannot stand that I am just naturally quiet. Sorry I am not for your entertainment always.  Life has been rough for me,  for anyone really. Just throwing this out there.  Talking to myself helps.  Maybe I should watch something.  I don't know.

lonely,Have friends but still lonely,"Have friends but still lonely - I'm looking for a friend I can improve myself with. I'm not looking for a group. I suspect why I feel lonely most of the time is because I always hang out in groups, and it never ends well. 
At first, I would feel so bonded and all, having my own group. But eventually, I get left out in the group. Even if I finally connect with someone in the group, it gets ruined because of some drama in the group that affects our friendship. (Maybe there's some quarrel and I'm forced to take sides or mediate or something)
Every time I try to just form a 2 man group, eventually someone hacks in and the group gets bigger. And after a while I just don't feel as close to the anyone in the group anymore.  
I just hope to find someone here to talk to. 
We could try talking on reddit for a week or so and see if it works out :)"

lonely,"My first post here, sorry that its long...","My first post here, sorry that its long... - I've always been a person that hates my appearance, and an introverted person who is really bad at social skills. The ""friends"" I have never talk to me outside of school so I'm usually always home thinking about stuff, drawing or playing stupid games.

A while back I went to a party my family was invited to, and a friend I don't get to see often also went. We have known each other since we were babies and she is somehow also an introvert and awkward person like me. I had always seen her as one of my only friends till that day. We were talking about some stuff and out of nowhere she asked for my number so after that day we talked every day, I eventually told her all of my problems, and how I've hurt myself before and she seemed to really care, then I started to get to know her better and I felt happier than ever before in my life since she always checked up on me and made me feel important to someone.

But my stupid self had to fuck it up. I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, she said yes which made me even happier, so I started trying to always be happy and make her feel as happy as possible but the problem begins one day like a month ago she left. She told me she didn't feel ready but that we could still talk as friends (she hasn't texted me since, and I don't since I feel like Ill bother her) yet I can't help but think it's my fault. My unstable self was probably too much for her and I feel worse than I ever did. 

I feel like talking to people and making friends isn't worth it, I'm only getting hurt in the end, I feel like I shouldn't tell people my problems, I thought I'd finally found a purpose in life, and that was to live for someone who wanted me to be there, and now I'm back to feeling worse than before, I don't have a purpose again, no one cares about me, my self-conscious mind is killing me and I don't see a future in myself. 
So here I am at 2 AM getting some of my pain out before it kills me.

lonely,Constantly trying to improve myself but it's really hard,"Constantly trying to improve myself but it's really hard - I try to make myself someone worth loving but it's a constant effort. I feel like I'm constantly contorting myself and working hard to maintain any improvements I make. And I feel terrible when I slip up and it's so easy to slip up.

I'm the kind of person who cannot be herself. I am basically a living bad habit. Everything that makes me who I am is negative and so I have to do everything I can to not be me. But I'm also not sure what makes me who I am in the first place because so much of how I just get by in day to day life is mimicking people.

People say that you have to work on yourself but I don't think I'll ever transform and be the person I want to be. i don't even know what I want to be. I just know I don't want to be a lazy socially inept jerk who dies alone. I put in the work to avoid being a bad person, basically.

Sometimes I feel okay about myself and other times, like now, I just hate that living my life without being an utter miserable failure has to be constant struggling. I get tired. I start to forget things and lose track and get absorbed in random stuff. And then I start messing up. When I mess up every improvement I make in how I manage my time, social skills I learn, it all just crumbles. It's like all the hard work never made a difference."

I am introverted so I’m naturally good at being alone but some days it just hurts I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it except for my sister I can only text her though because she lives two states away from me. I’m sure she is sick of hearing about it though

I was considering talking to a therapist but the other ones I’ve been to didn’t really help me and how are they supposed to help me get more friends they’ll listen to my problem but there isn’t much they can do for me anyway.

lonely,Rejected twice dam,"Rejected twice dam - So basically through out all of my 15 (lmao yea I’m young) years on earth I’ve only asked out 3 girls and only 1 out of the three girls actually accepted me so that’s kinda cool but that was in 7th grade when I asked out a 6th grader (we were both 12) we only “dated” for about 2-3 weeks and I felt kinda happy but sad that it lasted that long. Once I hit 8th grade I was like super fucking confident I asked out a girl hell even my friends knew that I liked her so much so I was like fuck it I asked her out but sadly she said no she said the basic shit mostly every girl says when she rejects you “We can still be friends”/“ I only liked you as a friend” bullshit so that’s shitty, a year later (9th grade) it was almost Valentine’s Day and I saw this girl she was decent looking , she was like a strong 7 out of 10 (I know it’s rude to rate a female but that’s the only way I can describe her appearance) my friends didn’t know who I liked because I know they would’ve been hyping me all up like last time but they did know I did like someone so I literally bought a teddy bear holding a heart (shit was soft as hell even my sisters were shock it was so soft) and I was like “I’m just gonna pray she accepts me for who I am and becomes my girlfriend” but sadly when I asked her out she was like “what the fuck no, I won’t go out with you” and that shit literally broke me, like literally my whole confidence went so low. I’ve never felt so heartbroken over a rejection in my whole life. So when I turned into a sophomore I told my self “dude don’t ask out any more females until Junior year or Senior year or at least be hella lucky and wait for a girl to ask you out” so yea that’s where I am now single and kinda desperate looking for a girlfriend and hopefully get super lucky and wait for a girl to ask me out instead.

I try to keep my mind occupied re watching show after show, but my mind always wanders back to her. Weeks and months go by hoping that she would reach out again. It's only been about a year of sharing pieces of our life and thoughts, but I feel as though there is no one else in this world I can have more in common with than her. I know it's just the idea of her that I am tripping myself up over, but no matter how hard I try I don't think I can ever forget this girl I've never met."
lonely,The best of friends,"The best of friends - I have real friends. I crack jokes with them during school. Sometimes. Other times they insult me about my disastrous relationship with my ex, which is always nice.

It always feels like each friend would always rather talk to someone other than me. I basically don't exist to them after school. I might get sent a link to a video. If I'm lucky.

Friends that have moved away are much the same. Yeah, invite me to a party, and then leave the party, so another friend can join my party and then leave it to join your party, all so you can play a game that I don't own while I wait a week for about an hour of actually playing a game with you guys before you go play another game I don't have.

I know all my friends are out at each other's houses, watching movies, and doing other stuff while I'm sat here at home with nothing to do and noone to talk to until I get back to school, only for the cycle to repeat. I don't so much as hear about any of this until it's already happened, either.

""Last night Friend and I did this and that."" Oh, really? That's cool. Shame, though, as I never get invited to have fun with you guys after school. 

This all makes me feel... tolerable at best. People can stand being in my presence, especially when they're laughing at my expense (""your ex left you"", ""you'll never have a stable relationship"", ""This is why she left you for Friend""), but they'd rather be rid of me as long as possible. I constantly have this feeling and it's not fun.

Yeah. Yeah, I have friends. Great friends, at that."
lonely,Stuck in a loop,"Stuck in a loop - So I'm a 27 year old guy with a fiancé and a baby, but I'm lonely as hell. My home live is fine, but it's just not enough for me not to feel this way. 

At work there are a few people who I genuinely get on with and have stuff in common with and a couple of them I've known for 2 years now but I've never spent time with them outside of work or even had proper conversations with via social media. See, I've what's been the last resort friend, the one people will say to me “We should do something together soon” but it never happens. I'm a kinda introverted guy but I'm not quiet and I'm quite confident but whatever. Years of being that “friend” have made me very hesitant to make real next steps from acquaintance to full blown friend.

I now will wait for the other person to take the initiative. I mean if they really like me and want me as a friend they could ask for my number right? I'm not going to ask because in my mind I'm 99% I'll be disappointed.

But I could be missing out you know? What if they're like me and we just both don't want to take the first step? 

I just want ONE person to message me out of the blue asking how I am or something. It's like I don't exist outside of work to these people and it's making me question myself and what I'm doing wrong.

lonely,A hole in my chest,"A hole in my chest - It's 3am here, I'm listening to music in my dark room, the same place I've been in the past 2 weeks. 

Sorry, I think I should give some context. 
I'm a 15 year old male, I have no friends, only some people I barely talk to, my parents divorced a few years ago and I've stayed alone at my father's apartment in the past few weeks, alone, in the dark. 

I've had this hole in my chest for a really long time, I can't really talk to anyone, so I've decided to talk about in the internet, with strangers. 

I have a feeling like I don't have a purpose, that nothing really matters, and that has been affecting my grades over the past few years, and this year (I live in South America, my school ends in November/December) I'm probably not going to pass. 

I've never really had any friends, I remember a few things about me when I was younger. I used to have violent tendencies when I was 5-7 years old, but I'm rather calm now, avoiding violence at any cost. When I grew out, my class had a few groups of friends, two groups of boys, one of girls, and me. I was alone, with exception of one year, when a new student with mental difficulties showed up for a while. He was fun, we had a sincere friendship, but he left as soon as the year was over, and I was alone again. After that, I tried getting in a group, but one didn't even wanted to talk to me, and the other only let me in to make fun of me. And I was okay with that. I let them make fun of me, thinking that's what friends do, but, of course, it isn't. Now, most of them pretty much regret it, except for one guy, he was a dick and still is. 

Then I moved to Florida for a year, and that was fun, I guess. I still hadn't many friends, just one or two, but they were cool, I guess. Never spoke to them again, I wonder how they are.

And that's when my grades started decaying, moving to another country then back messed up everything in my school live, from what they were teaching to the school time. 

Math was, and is, my biggest problem, I had no idea how to do the complicated stuff they were teaching back here when I was in Florida, so the first two years back I barely passed, but the last it was my teacher's kindness who let me pass, and I still was in complete ignorance of half the things they were teaching.

Now I'm in high school, first year, in, once again, another school, and I'm not going to pass, there's absolutely no way I'm going to manage to score high enough tomorrow, but... I don't know, I feel like that doesn't really matter, I just feel like staying in my dark room playing videogames, listening to sad/romantic music, eating crappy food and watching YouTube late a night, waking up at 2pm, and doing it all again.

But some nights, like this one, I can't sleep, the hole in my chest becomes too hard to ignore and I just stay there, wanting to restart my life, see if I can get lucky and this time make things the right way, then maybe I could be worth what my parents think I am, then maybe I can have the will to do the stuff they think I can do.

I have a good life, that's not really the problem, I am. If I wasn't a self centered dick then maybe I could make some friends, some real friends.

I am sorry, I don't really know if this is the best place to post this, but I really don't know what else to do with all this inside my chest. If you've read until here, thank you, you don't need to comment, give an upvote or dm me, just know I'm thankful someone actually used their time to read my long (and maybe unnecessary) post.  

Have a good day."

lonely,I’m fucking sick of it,"I’m fucking sick of it - Yeah, I’m pretty young and still have a ways to go, but my brain doesn’t care. I just need someone. I can’t go to school because literally everyone has friends and partners, and I’m the outcast that gets noticed when someone needs money/help. I have 2 people I’d call my friends, one of which never has the time to hang out, the other has an abusive mother and visits her dads on the weekends. My depression is killing me (almost literally at this point) and it weighs me down so much I struggle to go to school. My mom has to go to court because I’ve missed so much of it. We’ve had a parent-teacher conference for me but I couldn’t open up and still can’t. I hate being bothersome, I hate making people worry, I hate that I have a brain. I’m supposed to be “the good child”, the one with a future but that’s definitely not happening. I keep getting praised as “kind”, “smart”, “good looking”, but I hate having people praise me for something I don’t put to use. I’ve never really had any more than 2/3 friends at any point in my life, had a “girlfriend” once, who was too shy to do anything for the 3 months we dated and her parents didn’t let her do anything. I just want to not be a burden, I want to make people happy. I want to be useful, but my stupid ass brain decides otherwise. It doesn’t give me the energy to do something, doesn’t give me the motivation, doesn’t give me the rationality that I need to stop fucking myself over. All I want is for someone to be there for me as much as I’ll be there for them. I need someone who won’t ghost me for being clingy because I was worried about them. I want someone who I feel actually loves me. Instead, I’m shy, antisocial, introverted, and overall idiotic. My mannerisms(?) are so awful I’m possibly autistic (coming from a psychiatrist). Why am I like this? Why do I have to have such hormones for affection when I’m well aware I won’t get any? Why am I so selfishly selfless? I’m done being alive, even if I “have so much to live for”."

I already understand we all have weird stuff about all of us. Also i understand how some people who say they want to help but they really arent cause all they give you is just wait and the time will come or dont talk about it till you know each other for a long time. I know that ok but what i would like is for someone who is in need of someone who will respect me someone who has empathy no matter what my weird trait is. But where do you find that when you are shunned 24/7 and about to give up and start sobbing cause you think to youself your no good for people. Where can those people find what they are looking for when all they get is no help. Also to be honest i am one of these people who has been shunned basically for my whole life and im 20 years old now with 2 jobs. A college class ans very protective helicopter parents + on top of that people shunning me for who i am.

Unfortunately I’ve had to move back to my home city. It’s been ok, but I haven’t felt the high. Days like today feel empty and I remember why I left in the first place. I have close friends and family here, but sometimes it feels shallow. I left without many connections and I’ve come back pretty much the same.

lonely,Forever alone...,"Forever alone... - A few weeks ago, i had an appointment at a new hairdresser. As the time goes by all the girls asked if i have a boyfriend. I said no but i lied about the length of being single since i never had a boyfriend and at the age of 28 that's pretty embarrassing.
They all asked why and how. I always try to keep laughing about it and pretend that it's no big deal but everytime someone says ""why? You are pretty and smart!"" Something in me breaks a bit more apart.
Yes i would love to have someone too love and care, share a lifetime. But I have the most awkward body shape, unclear skin and every Guy just wants to have the benefits of ""friends with benefits"". they don't care for me. And i think they would be ashamed introducing me to someone else as a girlfriend or just a friend.
It hurts and i hate this question soo much. I don't know the feeling but i would say it's similar to the ""are you pregnant"" or ""when will you have kids"" question for someone trying hard to have kids.

I've been the sexdate for a guy for almost 7 years. We met through facebook and in the beginning i really thought he's interested in me, not only in having sex. 
I told him i have feelings for him but he rejected me. I still let him come over. This half an hour ever 2-3months make me feel like someone cares, even if he just comes over to satisfy his own needs. He's not even texting back if I ask him to come over. 
I tried several times to stop but i can't. It's like those 30minutes keep me alive. And i always think about if he maybe could change his mind, i know it's impossible but the imagination is nice. 

I have never had someone saying that he loves me or being happy seeing me and with every week of my life, the feeling of being unnecessary gets worse. 

Ending up alone, with nobody who cares. I always try to stay strong, saying to myself ""you don't need someone else to be happy"" but it gets harder. Every day. 

Excuse the messy writing. Didn't know where to go with my thoughts in the middle if a german night (almost 3am)"

lonely,Story /lonely can feast upon!,"Story /lonely can feast upon! - Hey, for the starters fuck being single and alone, everyone should have a relationship.

I just want to share one story with you, we can all feast on it's rotten flesh, it stinks of shallowness. We go back when I was 17.

When I was 16 I was into a girl. I didn't wear tight clothes and had some extra pounds but nothing special.

So one day we were at night club and all my friends were like ""Just go for it"".

I went, she dismissed me and of course this stuck with me and guided me later on to make mistakes and suffer more.

Anyways, few weeks later I just woke up and ... I started to work out, cut bad food, got myself some tight pussy shirts or whatever.

My birthday came up, I threw a party on the beach. Already, some of people including girls were in AWE and started to treat me like I'm some Nobel prize winner all of the sudden, lol.

Girl that I was digging showed up at party. I didn't pay attention to her and I was drinking my wine like it ain't nothing.

Then when I got drunk I just remember that I was wandering talking to people and all off the sudden I bump into her and her girl-friend.

We just started to talk, had laughs, I lied down and all of the sudden I felt someone is touching my stomach.

I look up and I see my crush screaming like ""oh he has so much muscles!!"" and literally making some primal noises.

After a few moments I went outta there and next thing I know someone rushed me from behind, next moment she's kissing me on the beach.

So, as you can see from this rotten shallow story that success comes from:

\- Your character

The loneliness of having no friends causes me to look for a boyfriend because I feel that is the most easiest way of getting the social connection I desperately crave. I never really got along with women. When I was a child I thought girls were touchy and mean.

Almost every girl I knew had a clique and bullied me in some way. My best friend was a tomboy who wasn't like a girl at all. In my teens I didn't have any girlfriends and spent most of my time alone. Now that I am 26 years old don't have much in common with women in my age range. I'm not married, I'm not pregnant, I'm not a mom. There's just not much to talk about. And most women have their inner circle of friends by my age and it's hard to get in that. So in the back of my head I guess I have given up on the hope I can have healthy female relationships. I can't believe I have had this revelation."

lonely,Its my birthday in 2 hours and nobody fucking cares,"Its my birthday in 2 hours and nobody fucking cares - No. Before you flood this post with birthday wishes, I'd advise you to take a seat and listen to me. I'd want you to understand where I'm coming from. I have had enough of keeping with the facade. 

I have lied my entire life. I have mental issues. I have depression. I cut. But I'm good at lying and so people think I'm an arrogant prick who thinks too much of himself. But its not me. Its a character I play. Its not that I hurt people. I just dont talk to them and they dont talk to me. That was the case until last year. I decided that if I'm so undesirable, I might as well just stop all my interactions. And so I did. I used to stare at my screen for 24 hours for someone to text and nobody ever did. And so I stopped bothering people. I've only been nice to people. But they dont respond. They are not nice to me. I tried suicide and was hospitalized. My parents screamed at me. They didn't act like they cared. They were just annoyed that i didnt finish it off. What could I do?  My body is full of scars and I havent shown them to anyone. I'm ashamed of my scars. I'm ashamed of who I am. I talk in the stereotypical ""gay"" way. I'm not gay. I'm just socially anxious and thats how i talk. I was bullied throughout my school year. They called me a ""Fag"". I couldnt prove them wrong coz who the fuck would date an asshole like me. I'm sure that even if I was gay, no one will date me.  

My world is full of books and music and art and movies. I occupy myself with creative pursuits. I dont write yet but I listen and read and watch a lot. Those are my only friends. I talk to people inside my head. Sometimes I see them too. Yes, hallucination. I'm totally fucking insane. 

So, now that you know something about me.  I havent celebrated any festival since I was, like, 15. I'm 18 now. And I'm just too tired. Too exhausted. Sometimes I feel like I should just give up. My corpse will rot and nobody will even come to my grave. No lover would give eulogies. No friends will talk about how good a person I was. And forget about parents. I dont think I'll survive for long. I dont think anyone will pick me up and I dont think anyone will love me. I dont ask for much, do I? These are just normal stuffs. Someone to care. To provide me with some warmth and protection. Everybody has ppl who cares. Why not me? Did you know that the serial killer Ted Bundy had a bunch of fans who never met him but who gave interviews about how he was cute and how they cared for him? They never even fucking talked with him. Jeffrey Dahmer's parents stayed with him through it all. There are even a bunch of fans of the Columbine shooters online. Theres a whole fucking community.  Look at me. I have never harmed anyone and people hate me. Why does it matter? Why be nice? 

Yeah. If you wanna talk, message me on reddit chat."
lonely,"Create a network of friends, not just one best friend.","Create a network of friends, not just one best friend. - I made this mistake. At college I ment one person and I thought that guy would be a great friend, so I tried to be ""best buddies"" with him. And it worked for awhile until he started to reject me, and then I was more lonely + one damaged relationship. So why did this happen?

We're ment to have many friends, not just one friend you think you can depend on. If that one friend abuses the fact that you are his only friend. You have no one else to go to. And in my case this friend already had a network of friends. So he didn't need me the same way I needed him. And that was my fault, for not building my network.

There's nothing wrong with having one best friend, but you should also have other friends on the side. Incase one of you goes ""out of the line"". It's how we humans are ment to live, and I've realised alot of my loneliness has come from the fact that I've always searched for one best friend. But whenever I do get one, we end up on bad terms, because we become dependable on eachother, which isn't very healthy when issues arrise."
lonely,Feel like an idiot wasting my time typing this but I’m lost,"Feel like an idiot wasting my time typing this but I’m lost - I’m a 25 year old very tall kinda chubby white guy living in a house with roommates who don’t like me in Michigan right now. I have absolutely no friends in the world. I’m terrible with people in general. My life consists of getting up without sleep, going to work, coming home, and being alone in my room till I get up for work again. I hate my job building electrical harnesses to death. It’s the most soul sucking job I can imagine having and I do it 6 days a week. My coworkers are my age but want nothing to do with me. I think that they think I’m too bizarre, which I am. I have strange interests and passions, mostly in the occult, science, and art, so I’m terrible at small talk and normal conversation. I also question reality a lot, as my insomnia gives me peculiar hallucinations in the day time. I’m so terribly lonely, and it feels like my chance to break into a group I can fit into, or even to find one decent friend, is long gone. I can either go on for the rest of my life being this lonely and miserable, or I can end things sooner than that, and it is a tough choice to make.

I know sending this out to the world won’t help me one bit. People like me are generally cast aside, and rightfully so. We’re no good to society. I’ve just been in the same suicidal rut for years now and with nobody to go to. Maybe putting this out there will end this fucked up simulation immediately. That’d be pretty cool"
lonely,I want to have more free time,"I want to have more free time - I have so much homework each day. 4 tests a week, 4 hours of homework a day. Everyday I look out of my window and see people play outside. I don't want to play ouside or something i want to be free. School is going to kill me, one day."
lonely,"When I was heartbroken and alone, I took up gardening.","When I was heartbroken and alone, I took up gardening. - ""Find a hobby"" sounds like generic advice, but it really helps. Focusing on things I wanted to do/could do by myself helped me find value in myself. I realized that while even being alone I was capable without having an emotional attachment. I wouldn't have been able to put in enough work for my plants if I had stayed in those relationships. Now I have 3 giant aloe vera plants, one fern, two pineapple plants and three different types of succulent. Trying to grow a bonsai tree now!

It's okay to be alone, you'll see the value of your own company. You'll see all the wonderful things you're capable of. And maybe, through your hobbies, you'll find people who will stick around and also see your worth. If they undermine your worth, if they treat you like you don't have any value, then you're better off alone."
lonely,In a weird mental state,In a weird mental state - Nothing makes me happy anymore but still have enough to get up and get about my day. Feel incredibly lonely but always surrounded by people. I don’t want to die but I’m not really sure I want to live either.
lonely,Friend,"Friend - Today it hurt me the most. It hurts when the only person who ever talks to you and the only one who you've considered a true friend doesn't show up to simply meet after months of not seeing each other. I know he is ignoring me and not picking up my call on purpose. Didnt even bother to call me to cancel. I was waiting for him. I was looking forward to it. It was suppose to be the best thing thats happened to me in a long while. I've struggled with loneliness for as long as I can remember. It hurts.

I hope that those of you reading this truly find someone you can call a friend. Someone who can pull you out of your darkness. All it takes is one friend, to make this life worth living. Thats what I believe."
lonely,Anyone Need to Talk?,"Anyone Need to Talk? - Well, I have no plans for today, and I’m in a chatty mode, so I’m making myself available to talk!

I might not respond instantly, but I’ll definitely talk to whoever needs it! Just feel free to PM me."
lonely,I feel alone because of my strict parents.,"I feel alone because of my strict parents. - I feel alone a lot. I am the only person in my class and friend group that isn't free to go outside whenever they want. They let them out as much as they want. But I have a strict ass curfew and I have to tell them with who am i going, where will I go? I want to free. At least a bit. Today two of my friends wanted to take me out with them to a few shops. If I could I would have lied and sneaked but I was scared my parents will find me there and when j come home it will become a shitstorm. I ae back home and both of my parents were home. I told my mom and she always tells me the same ""It's to far away to go by foot"" ""You have 5 bucks you cant buy anything"" ""Don‘t worry I'll take you with me when j go there next time"" ""If it was that good I would have  even forced you to go"""
lonely,Lonely :(,"Lonely :( - Hey everyone
