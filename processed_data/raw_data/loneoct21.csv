lonely,I (32 M) accidentally pissed a family away. I’ll never be able to forgive myself.,"I (32 M) accidentally pissed a family away. I’ll never be able to forgive myself. - I made my ex (39 F) feel like we ware just friends.

lonely,Does it ever stop hurting?,"Does it ever stop hurting? - The older iv gotten the more I feel lonely. I crave intimacy with someone so bad, but not like sex, I honestly just want someone to hold me and tell me everything is going to be ok. I try and keep myself busy and district myself with friends and work, but I still feel empty. The More I try and fill the void, the worse it gets. I wish I could just disappear and get away from myself and this never ending feeling of sadness and loneliness."

lonely,"Lmaoo turns out my ""friend"" isn't my friend at all","Lmaoo turns out my ""friend"" isn't my friend at all - I thought he didn't use discord. Then I texted him to add me and he kept refusing. We hung out like 2 weeks ago and I thought we were having a good time. Turns out that shit was all fake. His discord was full of messages. He didn't want to add me because he didn't want to speak to me. We haven't talked since. He doesn't want to be my friend. I'm not speculating here, I'm just not lying to myself anymore. He could have just been honest and just blocked me or something. To be fair I kind of treated him poorly but I was in high school at the time. I fuck up like this. Everyone eventually hates me. I wasted my time on this. Everytime I friend someone new I just waste time doing mental calculus just so that they will just abandon me."
lonely,Almost everytime i meet a nice girl she ends up having a boyfriend,"Almost everytime i meet a nice girl she ends up having a boyfriend - I have been to 2 parties this weekend. Had a great time and met a lot of people. Of those people i met 4 girls who i really vibed with. Good conversations, holding hands etc. Than after about 2 hours they end up telling me that they already have someone. Although we didnt kiss they all felt guilty because they felt the same way about me. I would take my L give them a hug and go on with my night because i think you shouldnt feel attracted like that to anybody else but your partner. It still sucks tho. Dont know why this keeps happening lol"
lonely,I don't know i just feel lonely,"I don't know i just feel lonely - I'm  and for over a year now I've been feeling extremely lonely. I have some really good friends whom i can usually tell everything about myself. I'm a bit shy but I'm not an completely anti social person. I can't really tell where my loneliness come from, i just feel so disconnected from everyone. When I'm at a party talking to people i never have that moment where I'm enjoying talking to someone.
Idk why i even post here if anyone can help me or just relate with me you can dm me."
lonely,This might be fucked for the subbed cuz I do I have friedns,"This might be fucked for the subbed cuz I do I have friedns - I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense. Ive been drinking and it’s friends so I’m trying to make sense. 

I was drinking with friends that are cool with how I behave with beer and drinking. But fucking hell it hurts knowing that I’m leaving the same way I showing  up same way. I swear I don’t leave with anyone I even be remotely enough to hold their thinking or if they’re not able to say no then I say “no,”  for them even. if the say yes if they cannot consent then I will say  “No” I’m cool with they behave Coolley then I will say friendly to contact because I refuse to put anyone in the place that they may not consent. I desperately want to sleep with someone but I I want them to know what they’re knowing what they’re doing. How do I put myself out there even tho theyre sober or twice? I’m so tired of missing sex but I refuse to even be close to rape, how do I fix this? I know it might he fucked cuz of all the alcohol, I will not hurt anyone like this. Please anyone, how did I fix this?"

lonely,I just want someone to hold me.,"I just want someone to hold me. - Yes, that's all I want, someone to hold me and hug me at night. It will probably never happen because Im not worth it. I would just waste their time."
lonely,I feel like I’m going to be alone forever,"I feel like I’m going to be alone forever - I hate my sexuality.

Im asexual and heteromantic. Basically, I want a romantic relationship with a man. But I do not want to have sex. I don’t want to exchange nudes or look at each other naked. But I want to get married, have kids (that’s the only time we’d have sex). I want to have a best friend whom I live with and we watch movies and cuddle on the couch and sometimes kiss. I want a child’s idea of a marriage. And it doesn’t exist. 

Im in college. Every time I talk to my mom she asks me when I’m getting a boyfriend. After all, she met my dad at college. I should too, since it’s the best place to meet someone with good prospects and all. I don’t know how to tell her I’ve tried. And I do get them. But it always goes wrong and always because I don’t want to have sex. 

It goes one of a few ways. Sometimes they just go “hey that’s not for me, nice knowing you though.”. Sometimes they say, “Cool, I’m waiting until marriage too!” But then they still want to dirty talk and I’m not just waiting until marriage. Plus, this type tends to be super religious and I’m not. The worst part though, is the ones who pretend. The ones who say “That’s fine! I still want to be with you”. And you date them for a little while and you’re happy. They put up with it because the appearance of a girlfriend is worth it to them. Then they leave you when they find someone who will put out eventually. 

You may think I’m just bitter after a breakup with one of the last type. I’m not. It’s been months since the last one. It’s happened so many times, over and over. I’m tired of waiting. Every other girl doesn’t deal with this. I hate it so much it’s beginning to make me hate myself. 

I feel selfish. I realize most people have needs— I actually do too, I just want to take care of it myself. But I don’t want polyamory or an open relationship, either. So really it’s my own fault. I can’t expect someone to give up their prospects for me. But I shouldn’t have to choose between getting cheated on and depriving my partner, right? 

I know asexual men exist. But apparently they don’t exist around me! I wish I was aromantic and didn’t want a relationship so badly. Or a lesbian or bi, cause in my experience queer women tend to be more accepting. But no, my options are straight men. 

I could try therapy, I guess. But I’ve tried so many different therapists, and all of them just tell me that asexuality isn’t a thing and that I should get my hormones checked. I have. They’re fine. It’s a valid sexuality. 

Whether true or not, I feel like I’m unlovable and I will be alone forever. I need to stop feeling this way. I have to. Im going insane."
lonely,Are you really lonely or seeking approval from people ?,Are you really lonely or seeking approval from people ? - So I’m honestly starting wonder- are people on here truly lonely ? I see a lot of complaints about it but no actions taking to understand the reason your lonely or claim to be. I have tried many times to befriend people and be there free ear to listen. I’m lonely. I rarely have time make friends due to my age and my career. I had to cut a lot people off to change and now I have nothing. Now I understand why so many people go back to their old habits or lifestyles. It what they know and feel comfortable in. Change is hard because what comes with change is loneliness and trying to understand who you are ? Your purpose to society ? I have lost many and sometimes I take a walk alone in woods and cried because I don’t know who I am anymore. It gets so lonely all I want is a friend. Someone that I can talk to.
lonely,I had a nightmare,I had a nightmare - I had a nightmare. And to whom I should be venting to ?
lonely,For some peoples being lonely is red flag,For some peoples being lonely is red flag - nobody want to be friends with you or even near you because there's something wrong with you or at least that's what they think..
lonely,Birthdays suck.,"Birthdays suck. - My birthday is coming and I am not happy at all. Because I know that nobody is going to wish me. I don't have friends who will surprise me on my birthday. I just feel that why is birthday even a big deal for me?

There are some girls who live in my neighborhood, they have so many friends and they celebrate their birthday every year, and I feel jealous of them that they have got somebody to be there. I miss my college life 😭😭😭

I am an introvert and I will always be lonely no matter what. I am turning old and I hate it. I just hate my life. 
I can't deal."
lonely,"I thought when I have a friend, I won't need to shove my feelings down the drain, I thought I can let it out and someone would finally listen.","I thought when I have a friend, I won't need to shove my feelings down the drain, I thought I can let it out and someone would finally listen. - Boy, was I so wrong. I realized I've been setting my feeling aside to accommodate my ""friend""'s feelings. Whenever I try to talk about my feelings, the ""friend"" would have an excuse or whatever and make me feel like my feelings are not important. Maybe I've been too independent or too strong that the ""friend"" thought I could take care of it on my own. The ""friend"" is not wrong but it would be so much better and so much lighter if there was really a friend to lean on."
lonely,Lonely but still thankful,"Lonely but still thankful - I don’t know what to say… In high school, I had lots of friends but I wouldn’t say they were all good friends. I was basically cool with a bunch of groups including the ‘popular’ people but I guess I never fit in with anyone. Now when they all are still together and partying etc, they all seem to forgot I had ever existed. No invite, no messages just silence. They all seem to be moving forward and I am stuck in one place. The group I chose to hangout with after high school completely backfired on me and well don’t really wanna talk to me unless they need something. And I can't even go find new people to talk to, since all my classes are online, and I spend most my days studying my room. 

On the romance side, it have never had any luck. I completely flunked on the chances I had to finally ask my crush out from high school, and then completely lost touch with her. I don't know if she is the one, but there was 100% a connection. We would always talk, laugh and have a good time in our classes. I was pretty sure she liked me back, as I would catch staring at me sometimes or being worried about me. Just as we graduated, I cowarded out. For  2 years I spent just thinking about how things could be if I had the courage. I thought about how I would ask here out the next time I ever saw here even if just as a friend to go out for a coffee or something. Then when she appears out of no where, 2 years later on the same exact date I saw her last, I chickened out yet again. To be fair tho, her what seemed to be her mother was there with her and I didn't want to put her in a uncomfortable situation after ( Indian Parents can be strict lol). Now, almost everyday I think of what could have been. I can't even send her a simple DM or message cause she isn't on any social media. I've spent time looking but no luck. It's just hard to keep wanting her, waiting and waiting. Heck, I am probably gonna have a visit from her in my dreams after I am done writing this. 

And its not just that tho. I haven't had a real good crush like her in a long time ( I think she was the last time). First of all I used to be very shy around women. Like to a point where I couldn't even talk properly and would stutter. This was the same for any women who wasn't related to me. However, I think I am doing better on that part now. For me, I would generally getting better talking to a woman when I got more close to her. That's what happened with my crush I mentioned before. I think I have gotten better now talking casual talk with women now tho. I can keep a conversation up.  The problem is, there is no place or option for  me to meet women. My college classes are still online, and I don't know how to DM someone without embarrassing my self. 

I am thankful however. I am thankful for where I am. I finally starting liking my college choice. I am thankful for my family who show support all the time. I do have some good friends (&lt;10) but we don't hangout as much as we should. I am sort of religious, or at least involved in my community, but still liberal.  I don't drink myself, but I am not gonna stop anyone else from drinking as its their choice. I guess people just assume I am super religious when I am not. I can't even talk to my friends about girls because they start making fun of how I am ""super religious"" when I really am not.    

So that was my rant or me just venting. If you made it this far, Thank you! I don't do this often and don't know how if I am being honest. I don't want to change who I am, I want change people perspective of me. I want people to see that I am a closed off guy, I was just shy who made a wrong decision while choosing a group of ""close"" friends. Mistakes were made while writing as I didn't proofread. Any Advice is appreciated! Especially about my first real crush lol."
lonely,My old friends are all out whilst i'm sat at home by myself.,"My old friends are all out whilst i'm sat at home by myself. - I moved to the other side of the country to be with my family, i've not made any new friends here. My old friends used to message me still but all of them stopped reply eventually, that was over a year ago.

Everyone i knew is out having drinks for halloween, and i'm here. Alone. I've not had an open face to face talk with someone in a year, most days i don't say a single word to anyone. 

I wanted to travel at christmas time to see people i've missed, but i'm probably wasting my time holding onto past memories and emotions i'll never get back."
lonely,how do you fill the void?,"how do you fill the void? - Hey guys, I'm 23 and have only one friend who i can hang out with occasionally, but mostly my time is spent alone.

I have a job but currently am only working once a week (thankfully sunday so my weekends arent so depressing) and will hopefully be getting a 2nd job throughout the week which will fill in some time. I'm on uni break for the next few months so don't have any study obligations to fill time either. 

How the fuck do you guys fill the void? constantly occupying yourself? tonight for example i had work and upon arriving home from work am at a complete loss. a part of me wants to go and paint, another part just wants to lie in bed until i fall asleep.

i used to fill my time with gaming but now i hate gaming and the lack of gaming has opened up a lot of free time. as has my recentish breakup. 

any advice? stuff i enjoy doing is mostly stuff that i do alone - gym, painting, gardening, movies, tennis. guess i'm just hating life. this is making me realise i gotta get my shit together and find some friends somehow tho"
lonely,What are activities you partake in as a loner?,"What are activities you partake in as a loner? - I’m looking for different things to do either by myself or with a single friend, who is down to do whatever. Any recommendations? I’m open to any and all ideas. If it’s weird or eccentric then good, I’m into that too. Honestly I feel like I’m gonna go nuts even though I have plans and shit to do all week and weekend, I might run away and take some time for myself a little bit."
lonely,Do you guys have the same feeling as me?,"Do you guys have the same feeling as me? - Hi, everyone. I'm 33F. Recently, I feel like have no security and always alone.... Totally no mood for anything. I don't it is because what happened to me a few weeks ago.. or anything else. I just feel like lonely.... and really wanna cry... I wanted to end myself as well.... I hate this feeling. I hate how I'm right now."

lonely,My mother,"My mother - Good lord, i can't stand my mother. All i ever wanted was some help from her but instead she set me up for failure. She raised me to be a socially inept doormat. Don't drink, don't smoke, don't party, go early to bed, never talk about hard topics and do only smalltalk, always offer help with everything and be overtly pushy with it. And when for years i wondered why people treat me like i'm invisible she kept telling me that i just had bad luck and that my ""time will come"", i just have to wait a little bit more. Eventually i figured it out and called her out on it. My mother told me that i should be happy because i avoid the ""bad crowd"" and if i'll just wait patiently i'll meet some valuable people eventually. Maybe if i looked for friends at church instead of at college... She also gave me the ""girls date bad boys when they are young but when they turn 30 and wisen up they go for the gentleman"" line, like it's a good thing"
lonely,nothing feels like it really matters when you’re lonely,"nothing feels like it really matters when you’re lonely -  i stay sane by continuously attempting to address various issues in my life, to varying degrees of success. I become briefly uplifted, or become upset with myself when I achieve or fail, in a short term capacity, at certain long term goals. Things like trying procrastinate less, smoke less, read more, meditate daily, or push myself to engage more often in my creative endeavors. But now, im lying in my bed at 3:30am typing this out while my brain tells me that none of that even matters to begin with, because no matter what i do to better my current life circumstances, it doesn’t mean shit because no one cares enough to love me for myself. All my attempts to squeeze more happiness and meaning from my life feel tangential and ancillary, like it’s missing the most important centerpiece of it all; love and affection from a person I genuinely trust 

sorry, didn’t mean to come off as overly dramatic, that’s just how theses thoughts formed in my mind"
lonely,Late nights,Late nights - Late nights are so lonely Bc I have very few friends and the ones I do have are always asleep
lonely,WeightLoss is the only good thing in my life,WeightLoss is the only good thing in my life - Anyone else here using WeightLoss as the only good thing in their life ? Started going to the gym about a month ago to distract my self from the loneliness in my life and to hope that if I get into shape that I might get a romantic partner. Still a very long way to get to my WeightLoss goal so hopefully it will keep distracted still then from the pain of loneliness.
lonely,Fuck my life,"Fuck my life - Well, it happened. I had had suspicions but they have been confirmed. My friend, who I go to near all classes with, is days after I broke up with my girlfriend, going out with her. And she did it to spite me. To clarify everything, throughout the relationship I had accepted all the blame, never once had I insulted or insinuated an insult towards her, I called her for hundreds of hours yet it was “not enough”. Continuing on, she would threaten to go with other men throughout the relationship and compliment them. As you can tell it did not end well. I have to see my friend tomorrow, as I only learnt from her friend tonight that she had done this, thank god her friend has more honour than she does, and my friend goes to all my classes. I feel isolated, betrayed manipulate and paranoid. I don’t know who to trust anymore. What to do tomorrow? Fuck, I dont even know"
lonely,im a minor and I sexted older guys online,im a minor and I sexted older guys online - im a 13 year old girl and recently I've been feeling really lonely and sad and I honestly just really wish someone would show me lots of love and affection so I would go on omegle and talk to older men. I don't even get any pleasure out of it I just like hearing the nice things they say about how they want to take care of me and cuddle me and stuff. I know it's all bullshit but I don't care I just like the attention and I hate myself for it. I feel like a disgusting whore and I just wish someone loved me and would tell me everything's going to be okay. I just wish I could get my innocence back. I wish I could be a kid again. (pls don't send any creepy dms)
lonely,The late night walks alone….,The late night walks alone…. - They hit the hardest.
lonely,Loneliness and envy,"Loneliness and envy - I know I'm not the only one who feels and intense burning of envy at even the slightest hint that someone had fun with their friends. It can be a passing comment about just spending some time with friends and i am instantly in a bad mood and incredibly jealous. It's also so impossible to avoid because everyone around me seems to have friends. Being unable to even talk to people makes it so much worse. I feel like it's impossible for me to talk to people, let alone make friends while at the same time having friends is taken for granted by everyone I've ever met.
   The jealousy i feel is so intense. I just want to have friends. I just want to be able to have friends."
lonely,I saw a dream,"I saw a dream - In the dream I wasn't alone in my grey world. I wasn't really happy either, but atleast I wasn't alone. I had someone next to me, who I talkt with, spent time with and cared for...

3 minutes ago I woke up. Alone, bleeding through my  bandage and feeling disapointed. What did I expect? That I go to sleep and once I wake up everything will be magically better? 

Grow up. 

Fuck dreams."
lonely,Hullo! Looking for ppl to hang out with in Toronto :),"Hullo! Looking for ppl to hang out with in Toronto :) - hi everyone! i recently moved to toronto and was having some good luck meeting folks my age (22) at sports groups until i got hit by a car 😓 and broke my leg

since then, it’s been harder to find people to go out and do stuff with, so i’m reaching out here to see if anyone wants to hang out, chat and get to know another human bean :)

some things i’ve been thinking about (that we can talk about!)
- is toronto a lonely city? lack of social infrastructure for meeting new people after university
- finding a place to belong (and the experience of social homelessness)
- building things that fly!
- how to create meaning
- how to set healthy boundaries :^) lmao

some things we can do!
- minigolf pls
- i used to sit on those concrete blocks by the street-side patios and watch the cars go by and people-watch and talk but now it’s getting colddd brrr
- attempt to make a tiny hot air balloon, fail miserably, and burn my house down
- i wanna bake something i’ve never baked before (macaroons are so expensive!!! are they home-makeable???)
- volunteer somewhere tgt 😌

anyways my sleep schedule is ultra fucked, it’s 4 AM here so imma head to bed BUT DM ME IF YOU’RE INTERESTED 

also i feel like chances are, if you’re on this subreddit at all things are probably pretty rough for u so hang in there ok? u got this, lots of love ❤️"
lonely,all of my friends are at a party I wasn’t invited to,"all of my friends are at a party I wasn’t invited to - As I write this, I am receiving a text from my best friend saying the party is going great - granted I’m the one who asked how it’s going. I have a small group of “friends” who I hang out with. They’re pretty cool and are nice to me. I met them through my best friend whom I have known for years now, since high school. They consist of a mix of family members of my best friend and their significant others. In the past I have been pretty cool about not getting an invite considering most of the time it was a birthday party or going away party for a family member or friend of theirs I have not met. But this one… just hits different.. it’s a Halloween party. Surely my best friend could’ve invited me if they wanted me there? I never really been to a real party before so maybe they think it’s not my thing, but still an invite would’ve made me feel a lot better. I don’t know I just can’t stop crying thinking about how shitty it feels to watch all of their ig stories and I’m just sitting in the dark. I wish I could just fast forward and find a new group of friends who care for me the same way I do for them. Hell, even 1 person would make such a difference in my world."
lonely,here it comes.,here it comes. - i’ve been doing so good not thinking about being lonely and being comfortable with myself but with this time of year coming up i’m about to collapse. it’s so crushing seeing people having friends to go to halloween party’s or just to hang out with on halloween. i know it seems like something stupid or small but it’s all i think about now. the loneliness hurts so fucking much

And it ended because I could not give her sex. And at the end of the day it cost me a family with her and her sons.

Im kind of a wired person. So I’m still not sure why she was in to me. Actually that’s a lie. She wanted sex. And I wanted to give it to her.

But the few time we did anything. I have her Orel. With she seem to like. Witch I should have done ALOT more. But the 2 time I had a malfunction on my end. It made me start to question my self.

I guess I should of gave her pleasure other ways."
lonely,Invitation Addendum,"Invitation Addendum - It was brought to my attention my first post I didn't really say who I was.  I am 35, white male, straight.  I like gaming, photography, and all sorts of other things.  Friends, gaming buddies, or any manner of people to talk to are welcome.  I also realized only 1 person actually ended up being what I would consider someone actually wanting an ongoing friendship, out of over 350 who read my post, which was a bit depressing, so figured I'd throw my hat in the ring again.

I'm a decent guy.  I like talking to people.  Talk to this people.  I like playing games.  Play games with this people.  It will be fun.  Or don't.  You do you, homies.  


I welcome all messages.  Tell me you wanna be my friend.  Tell me I am a butthead.  Whatever works.

Hope everyone has a lovely night.  Sometimes all we have is each other.  Stay strong, people. :)"

i feel really lonely right now thinking about it. i have no irl friends, not since the 6th grade. as an adult, it's so hard to make friends, and since im struggling to find a job, i cant even make friends at ""work."" even if i did get a job, i'll still struggle to socially interact, so i might not even make friends when i finally get a job anyways. 

idk, this neighborhood is so lively now a days and it makes me feel so sad and lonely."

Honestly don’t think parties are that amazing from the few times I have been to crowded bars when I turned 21, but I still feel down seeing people at these college parties and girls and I haven’t consistently found a good group of friends tk go.
I think I have gotten better with not getting depressed about it, but it’s just hard with Halloween. Just seems like the holidays that wants to crush introverts like me and others down.
Its good for others and I wish I was at a bar with some friends and maybe meeting girls or having a girlfriend or girls I’m talking to.

It’s just gives me a shit energy and hope many can relate."

lonely,Nobody would really even notice if I wasn’t there anymore,"Nobody would really even notice if I wasn’t there anymore - I’ve posted before about being the background friend, and my current situation has really just confirmed it. My roommate is breaking her lease and moving out, leaving me responsible for her half of the rent and other living expenses. I prepaid everything upfront with my federal grants as a grad student. With her moving out, and me being a full time student with little to no income, I’m facing eviction and homelessness. 

I’ve tried reaching out to talk to people to I go to for support, and it’s clear the subject has made them uncomfortable because all I get in return is “oh that sucks I’m sorry.” And then they just stop responding. I’ve spent the last two weeks trying to apply to everything I can find, finding food pantries, trying to negotiate bills, asking people I trust to take care of my pets when I get evicted. But it’s become so very painfully clear that help is just not coming. I am alone and I’ll very shortly be alone and homeless during December in the Midwest. 

I’m exhausted. I haven’t slept in days, I haven’t really eaten either. I’m trying to make anything my cats/dog could eat lasts as long as possible so at the very least they aren’t going hungry. I’m so fucking tired of keeping it all inside and putting on a fake ass smile when I really feel like I’m going to collapse at any moment. I don’t have anywhere to go, or anyone to talk to about what I’m feeling right now except for a bunch of random strangers on the internet, and I have never felt so alone."
lonely,I dunno,"I dunno - I’m 21m, in college, and have started to feel more and more isolated lately. I don’t know how to handle my thoughts and emotions, I feel happy at times, but majority of the time, I feel nothing. My grades are dropping, I have lost the motivation to go to class anymore, and have been spending most of my days laying in bed, sometimes reading, sometimes just watching videos.

I am single, haven’t had a relationship for a few years. I don’t think I can go through another relationship, as I don’t think I’m emotionally available. Thinking about situations like being cheated on or going through something like that deters me from actively seeking someone. I have no idea what I would do if something like that were no happen.

I do have friends who I play games with on discord, and sometimes dnd, but I never really talk to them about what’s going on in life, it kinda feels like a burden I don’t really want to unload on them. I’m grateful for them, no doubt, but now I don’t even really want to talk to them anymore. Lately I see discord calls that I think about joining, but just don’t.

I’ve never written about myself to share before, so this is a bit odd for me."

lonely,Hello. Me again.,"Hello. Me again. - I know I’m writing here a lot, but it honestly helps with the empty feelings I get when I remember that I don’t have anyone, so here I am again. 

There’s this woman I’m attracted to, desperately so. I just met her today, and we get along pretty well. Her sense of humor is very dry and sarcastic and I love it every time she opens her mouth to tell some dumb joke that we both laugh at anyways. Her mannerisms, the way she talks, I just can’t get enough of everything. There’s just one problem.


 She’s in her early 30’s and I’m only a few months over 19. She probably doesn’t see me as much more than a child. She’d probably laugh in my face if I tried to start a relationship with her. It hurts to be so close yet so far. 10 years older for me or younger for her and we’d almost certainly have liked eachother mutually, instead of this one sided affection that I feel. Oh well, I guess I’ll have to try to just put this behind me and keep looking."

lonely,I hate it here,"I hate it here - Well after 3 years of being single I decided to finally put my self out there. So I went on date with this girl who's light was just so blinding. The date was absolutely amazing we went to festival here in town. We started off at a pumpkin patch took some pictures and shared some food and some laughs. We then went to the corn maze where I realized she was actually pretty smart. We managed to get out and proceeded to the carnival that was set up. We rode various rides and ended it with the ferris wheel. Everything just felt right and at that moment I felt the happiest in a while. Well we go to the haunted house and seeing her around my arm just gave me a feeling like I'm finally needed in someone's life. After the haunted house we went to a bar and had some drinks and shots. We danced, laughed, and on the way home we sang all the way. In my book this is like perfect fall date. I tried to text her the next morning and I found out I was blocked on all her social platforms. I usually try to put my faith in people to see if there is still good in the world Everytime I'm let down. I don't enjoy this kind hurt especially since I know I'm a ""rare breed"". I just wish this dating game was easier and simpler."

At this point for your sanity, turn your phone off, and go watch a movie by yourself with all the things you love.

lonely,"21 yr old here, life for me is getting much more lonely over time.","21 yr old here, life for me is getting much more lonely over time. - Nothing in life seems good to me, everything and everyone is temporary. I honestly don’t know when was the last time I was truly happy and not just temporarily plus never had a gf. Not too long ago I was depressed to the point were I was just jobless, couldn’t do basic tasks like shower everyday or other day, brush my teeth in the morning and would neglect until later in the day, stopped working out and just over ate plus gained some pounds so quickly and now just feel insecure &amp; bloated. Been numb for some time, as the oldest sibling in the family I feel like a let down to my family especially since I lost my father back in 2007 and literally never had a father or male figure in my life to help me push through or just give me advice. Everything I’ve learned comes from searching it up on the internet or asking good people on Reddit which is sad. 

I may have a supportive mother whom I love to death and appreciate everything she’s done for me and my other 3 siblings. I may also have a close group of friends whom I always hang out for the past two years now, I love em to death too although I never tell em because I’m afraid to open up to people and never use that word outside of my close family. When hanging out with them I’m very comfortable but usually never have those deep conversations about our life with each other. Plus we never really talk unless we hang out, so I literally go days without talking to other people which can get lonely which is what I get for not putting myself out there. 

I’m slowly getting out of that depressive state, getting a job might’ve helped but afterwards it’s the same bs again. I just end up numb and go into depression, it’s like a cycle. Some nights are so lonely I end up crying like a pussy for some reason and I hate it. I also end up shutting down and going ghost on everyone for some time and that’s not a good thing to do to people. The only reason I push myself in life is because of the people I grew up whom I looked up to with ended up in jail, drug addicts, gang bangers and homeless/drug addicts. I know I gotta do better than them and cannot disappoint my mother and father who’s watching over me. Well that’s about it, sorry bout this bs ass post just wanted let it out."

After her passing I deleted social media apps from my phone so I didn’t have the urge to check them. Seeing other people live their lives when mine came crashing down made me very sad and I always hated the comparison that we become absorbed with in social media.

I stayed off for about 6 months, then stepped back into the social media world in January of this year when I re downloaded apps and got a discord. Since losing her, none of my friends really ever checked on me as I am younger and people my age are a bit naive and busy in their own lives, but it always hurt.

I like to see myself as a social person but I feel like no one ever wants to get to know me or give me a chance. Blargh!

lonely,I fall madly in love with fictional characters,"I fall madly in love with fictional characters - For some context, Im a 17 year old boy, and I am very lonely. I have never been popular with girls or into going out drinking like lads my age. 
I haven’t even had a girlfriend since I was 13-14 and even then that was just texting. 

Anyway I have found over the last year and even over the last 3 years I get emotionally obsessed with female video game characters. While it seems innocent it’s not and it’s gotten to a point where I feel I’ve had enough of it.

It’s to the point where I feel like I’m I love with them which is very very stupid, but I have no real connections to substitute. 

I get infatuated with them, pictures saved, nightly routine of looking at videos the whole depressing 9 yards.
But I feel it’s going too far when I physically feel heartbroken when I realise I can’t be in a relationship. It effects my mood and I am in a really bad mental state and more worryingly it’s starting to affect my school life. More recently I have discovered watt pad as a way to sort of live my “fantasy” or whatever. I feel more stupid writing this out. 

I feel as if it’s due to my lack of real human affection that I do this and it’s just shit

My main point of writing this is too see if anyone can relate to me and too get it off my chest.  

P.S apologies for my terrible writing form, not very good at it."

God I was thinking about how nice it'd be to go to a Con with friends, having a friend group all cosplaying, weening out, having fun. Worst part is I didn't even try to make friends at the con which I think would've been a great place to. I'm just lonely man, why'd we have to move. I guess it's my fault for not attempting to make friends but after we moved I just lost all motivation to socialize... God I'm just lonely."

lonely,Some friendly reminders,"Some friendly reminders - If you're having a hard time finding ways to meet people, just remember there are a lot of people out there who need some kind of help, and you might be able to help them.

There are homeless shelters, old folks' homes, animal shelters, all full of people/creatures who need a bit of help getting through the day, or even just a bit of company.  

Not only does this provide a service to others in need, but it seems like a much easier way to meet new people than just going out to bars etc. and trying to strike up conversations.  

I hope this helps.  This is advice to myself, too.  I'm feeling a bit lonely and realize that I've been too focused on myself, forgetting all the others that need a helping hand."

AP- idk what he’s up to. He doesn’t do emotions. He just wants “lust.” Obviously my own fault right there.

lonely,Sad pet post. :(,"Sad pet post. :( - My favorite cat I've ever known is now a hospice cat. His heart failed, and he's being kept alive with medicine. But I can tell that the medicine isn't working the way its supposed to. The medicine is supposed to prevent his lungs filling with fluid, so I know that this is what is happening when he starts breathing heavily. On Halloween, he'll be 6 years old. He has a vet appointment in 5 days, but I don't know if I can even wait that long to take him in. I'm terrified that I'll need to make an extremely difficult decision very soon. After having a mental health crisis around 2017, I ended up neglecting all of my friendships and relationships until they dissolved into nothing. The few friends I have left are all busy and nonresponsive. Steve has been all that I have for so long. I can't begin to describe this profound loneliness, sitting here in this eerily silent house, knowing that my best friend might be dying. I have no support system. Nobody to share the pain of greif. 

Please, take it from me. If you ever have an animal that has a terminal illness that requires extraordinary measures to treat, don't make a hasty decision to keep them alive in a moment of desperation. Know that the long, drawn out situation you'll end up with is far more agonizing than the quick heartbreak of a sudden loss. The vets have all promised me time and quality of life, every step of the way, like a carrot dangling on a stick. But their definition of quality of life is basically the bare minimum--the absence of pain/suffering. In reality, keeping your pet alive might actually be the most excruciating emotional rollercoaster imaginable. You will watch your pet cycle through periods of suffering and improvement. You will develop a sense of hope only to watch their condition suddenly and sharply decline. You will become overtaken by greif over and over again, everytime you get some bad news or complications. And worst of all, there may be things that your beloved pet used to love but will never be able to experience again. Their life will be reduced to mere survival. And your relationship with them might never be the same. 

I feel foolish for having spent years worth of savings in hopes that I could keep my Stevie here with me a bit longer. Thanks for reading."

So when I see that she has someone to text or someone texting her it sorta makes me sad see that because I wish I had that. I haven’t said anything about it because she has BPD and communicating with her can be difficult and it isn’t her fault she always has people texting her. I know I shouldn’t be comparing us together but it’s difficult for me to hear her say she’s lonely but will have multiple people text/Dm on a daily basis when I don’t have anyone. I don’t know i just feel lonely and needed to sorta let it out.

lonely,Never Thought I Would be this Lonely at 28,"Never Thought I Would be this Lonely at 28 - Here alone on Halloween weekend really feeling it. I never thought I would be this lonely at 28. 

It wasn't always this way. After university I moved to another country. I had friends there and coworkers who I got along with well. I met someone there and we had a great relationship. It lasted for years. We got engaged and she wanted to move with me back to my home country. Then she disappeared....ghosted. Never told me she didn't want to move anymore or that she didn't want to be with me anymore. Just dropped me and threw away our several-year relationship with no answer. 

I think I took it alright at the time but it was all downhill from there. I moved back and found myself unemployed and struggling. Everyone I knew had just kind of moved on. Then the pandemic hit. I just got more and more isolated. 

I actually met someone recently. She told me that she really, really liked me but in the end she ghosted me too. It's a lot different a few dates in vs. a few years in but it still hurts. I feel like it'll always end this way no matter what. No matter how far in. 

Halloween used to be my favorite holiday. Now here I am more alone than I have ever been."

lonely,Sometimes I avoid going to events and social gatherings just because I know how different I’ll feel once I get there,"Sometimes I avoid going to events and social gatherings just because I know how different I’ll feel once I get there - I think part of me is very lonely by choice. Everyone needs some amount of social interaction, to varying degrees. But I’m highly introverted, in addition I can be socially awkward. Sometimes I just don’t know what say. I know how to keep things going. Silence isn’t always bad and i’m fine with it. But other times I feel unprepared to meet people and get caught off guard. Part of me didn’t want to see them in the first place and so my mind goes blank. I say just enough to get out of there. I’m a very “internal” person. There were like 4 events and college parties I could have gone to this weekend and I deliberately distanced myself because I know I’m already terribly lonely by default. Not the kind where I’m desperate to be surrounded by people. There is something “missing” in me. I have friends and people I can call, talk to and hang out with but i partially feel like wouldn’t make a difference to me if it faded. I tire of people easily. I dont want to be a bummer because I know I sometimes can be so I keep to myself. Someone coming to my car right now and sitting to hang out with me would not make any of this better. This lonesomeness feels incurable. I could be in bed with someone and still feel heavy and unable to sleep, staring at the ceiling. Tf is wrong with me dude. I have flaked on so many people and distanced myself from a bunch of clubs I’m a part of on campus. The only thing I don’t flake on is going to concerts with a friend of mine, just because I get swallowed by the crowd and blaring music and i’m probably one something or two. I’m going next week and then running a marathon the next day with someone else. I will be in the moment but I know that will fade, and I know what comes next."
lonely,Missed opportunity again?,"Missed opportunity again? - Hey, 

Posting this because I have had this experience multiple times now. 

I often work as a bartender at big events/parties. I interact with a lot of people, including women. I´m being professional most of the time,  but sometimes I get multiple orders over the duration of the event from the same person. So I start relaxing more than usual and have some small talk or joke around with them. Women sometimes seem to be into me in this context and they often ask my name. I am never present or socially capable enough to ask more than their name in the moment.

I dread the feeling of losing out on an opportunity to ask their number or socials. I don´t get a lot of chances with women to begin with, so it hurts even more than usual to loose these chanches with them.

In the end I feel even more of a failure and my lonliness intesifies even more to a point that makes me feel useless. The idea of missing chances makes me goed crazy.

It seems like everyone is getting the chance to dress up in costumes or participate in something fun and it’s is really making me feel left out. It’s probably been 2 years since I’ve actually hanged out with anyone because most of my friends are going to out of state colleges and the loneliness is getting to me. Originally I had plans to carve pumpkins by myself but unfortunately even though I went to 2 stores, they were completely sold out of them, so tough luck. The only thing that I have going forward are deadlines and work."

But when we do, it's like time hasn't passed. But I still get lonely because it's like I have to write for them to remember I exist. I think I care about them more than they care about me. Take today for example, it's Saturday and everyone is doing something, but nobody's even talked to me. If it was for me, I would be having dinner or whatever with any of them tonight. I'm not that important to anyone. I'm nobody's first choice."
lonely,I feel alone and helpless. Should I just do it?,"I feel alone and helpless. Should I just do it? - I'm a 24 year old male and I've have trouble making friends my whole life. It should be mentioned that I'm a highly fictional autistic. Pretty much adds to the social anxiety I already have. Or maybe its purely the autism. Could never figure that out. Anyways I've been bullied to no end in highschool until a best friend let's call him L convinced them that I had no control and they should stop. I made a group of anime friends and It was the best days of my life until they cut contact with me after graduation. That was understandable sense we all have life paths. 

After that only L and another friend let's call him A, we're my friends. I could never make any more friends than just them. Then a girl walked into my life named M. She went through ALOT and I comforted her every chance I got because for the first time someone understood my pain. Long story short they all severed contact with me. Every attempt at making friends that I made, it was in vein. They abandon me one way or another whether in the matter of days, weeks, months, even fucking YEARS. 

I feel like I'm just destined to be alone and I hate that. It's hell. But what can I do? Just keep failing? That combined with voices of people talking behind my back about whatever I do and feeling like I'm walking through no man's land Everytime I go out to socialize and even trying to atleast talk to people who either ignores me, keeps the contact short, or pretend to be nice only to not give a shit about me made me deeply depressed. I want to die. I don't want to live like this but I feel like there's nothing I can do about it unless I'm not me anymore. I'm nice to everyone whenever possible but it never matters. The friendships I do manage to get are only out of pity. Even online people want nothing to do with me. If it's my fate to be alone, I don't want to live.

I might just end it but my body and mind refuses to let it come to that. It's my shattered heart telling me to just do it and get it over with. It's sick of the pain. Quite frankly I am too. So what in the name of God do I do?!"

as i normally do and i am crying. everyone was invited to parties this week and plans on going trick or treating with people tomorrow but guess who has to sit in the house ONCE again; ME. i am never invited anywhere and i hardly have real friends more so acquaintances. in fact i don’t even think i’ve been invited to a party ever since middle school that has nothing to do with family and i dont even hang out with my two best friends like that either. the first one is having the same issues as me (no real friends, invites, etc) and the other one is popular and always going out, she’s at a party rn actually. 

all i do is fucking go home and sit on my phone and do nothing productive i don’t even enjoy drawing anymore. i had to join an art elective this year to get myself to draw. i want to be productive but i can’t. i wanted to bleach my hair but i’m not allowed to for no valid reason and i was yelled at for asking which was the tip of the ice berg for me. i just wanted to do something different in my life. 

i’m rlly sorry if this post is all over the place especially the second paragraph. my eyes are glazed in tears and i can’t think straight. i just wanted to get these things of my chest."

I try to psych myself to do even small things like compliment someone's outfit or just say hey to them when I walk into class but I can never bring myself to jump over the emotional hurdle and actually say it. Idk what's fucking wrong with me. Just got advice from a ""friend"" who claimed to be experiencing the same thing whos advice basically boiled down to ""stop being lonely and do something about it!""

Well, because of a ""lack of communication"" I got left alone in their apartment two nights ago while they went to a Rocky Horror Picture Show showing. And now I'm all alone again because they all went to different Halloween parties, stop here I am, crying because I feel absolutely worthless.

I'm also stewing in self hatred because I'm a jealous piece of shit. Two of them are engaged to each other but also share a girlfriend, and it hurts me to see her hanging in them, or giving them a kiss, because I'm the only one of us that hasn't been able to find anyone to be with. Hell, I've never even been hit on or been on a serious date.

lonely,Not making any friends and feeling lonely :(,"Not making any friends and feeling lonely :( - I recently came to a new school after I graduated what is the equivalent of  high school in my country. I was pretty popular in my old class, so it was pretty tough. In my new school I had a very rough start. No matter how much I tried getting to know people, and talking to people, after a while no one cared. Me and my new class were on a camping type trip to get to know each other in the very beginning, and there from another tent I heard some of my new classmates say very mean and hurtful things about me, not knowing I could hear them. I had not met them yet, and that hurt me alot Ngl. They were saying these things because I am from a country that has become very hated where I live, and my name is very much tied to the country I come from. They were saying very racist things if that wasn’t clear enough. I also have a pretty shit history in the area which didn’t help me also. It’s not that people just ignore me either. That would be even worse. I’m kinda just a laughing stock.
I haven’t made any friends really yet, and I am obviously to blame, but I don’t know why it is such a struggle for me. I think of myself as a pretty average, normal looking and approachable guy. No one owes me to be my friend, but I had never thought I would become an outcast like this.

He asked me if I could do something whenever we stop talking for the day/night and at the time I didn't fully understand it. Now I realized it's something really important for him. I'm trying my best not to forget and to make sure to do that. Is there anything else I can do?

lonely,...,"... - Now I've come to know that being a man means your thoughts and feelings don't really matter. You just have to suck it up. You're either seen as desperate or weak. So you just stay in your own little bubble, even around friends. You may laugh, have fun, but these thoughts are always there with you. And again, if you were to vent it wouldn't make a difference. 

It's cool tho. Perhaps none of it matters. I wish I can turn cold hearted and not just give a damn anymore, since no one really cares about how I feel. It's all good. :)"
lonely,50 * 0 first dates,"50 * 0 first dates - I'll be honest, this is mostly since I need to vent somewhere. Unfortunately my troubles are keeping me from finding motivation to do important assignments. Anyway, here goes:

I just feel terribly alone all the time. To be clear, I'm not truly alone; I have a decent circle of friends and a loving family. However, despite all of that, my struggles in my love life (or lack thereof honestly) just eat me up for some stupid reason. I've never been on a date, never held hands, nothing. My friends often will talk about relationships and stuff and honestly it feels so terrible when you can't relate. At this point I've honestly taken to somewhat living vicariously through their relationships, since I've basically come to terms with my perpetual loneliness. 

Now, I'm not going to say it's because I'm ugly or anything. Nobody's guaranteed a relationship and frankly whining about that (in my opinion) is just counterproductive. People have a right to their choice in partners. I just feel terrible since I know I'll never be able to experience what it's like to be loved in that way. I'll never understand what it's like to wake up holding someone else and feeling happy that they picked you of all people. Yes it's sad, yes it's stupid, no it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, but it still hurts me, much more than I'm willing to admit out loud. 

Maybe this is just fueled by anxiety about classes and stuff, but honestly after 6 years of trying to at least go on one bloody date, I'm just so tired of it. Wish I could just cut that part of my life out so that I never have to feel this sadness again. But, as it stands, I needed to vent, so here I am.

Thanks for reading if you got this far. Please don't try to give me dating tips; I appreciate the sentiment but sadly they make no difference."

I havent had good friends for over 6 years now and because of that im painfully awkward and feel like ive wasted my youth. I havent really lived. I have also developed this mindset, that if im not being entertaining and making someone laugh every fucking second of an interaction im boring and theyll leave me, which just makes me more awkward. I just want someone to truly care about me, and not because theyre literally expected to, (family), but because they see something in me and like being around me. I just feel so pathetic, and its embarassing when extended family asks me about my friends. I have none, and its completely my own fault. I feel like i try, but cant find a connection.

Ive got the job, i am free, i can do whatever i want. But I feel more and more unhappy everyday. My dream have always been the same.. To start hiking, travel to some country during the summer, buy a bow and do archery... With the person i love.

So as you can imagine i did nothing. 
I stopped going outside..i work with ppl everyday but I have anxiety from ppl, so that didnt help it aswell.
I stopped cooking. I stopped caring at all. I play games whole day after work or cry at romantic anime. I cant anymore. I refuse to live like that.

I quit the job. I am moving back to my country. Closer to my friends. Closer to my parents and siblings. Near the Mountains so I can try some hiking. Ill start to go to gym again. Sure, i wont have my dream job... Whatever... Its just a job.. And i was feeling pretty insecure at it aswell. So maybe its not a job for me... Sure i wont meet anyone for me.. I simply cant trust a woman anymore.... When ever i try to go to tinder all i see are half naked photo of women living nearby. Their biggest interest being drinking and whatever... And i know lot of ppl wont have problem with that and ill be seen as weird. But its just not for me. I dont like drinking, i dont like smoking, i dont like women whose all photo album is just her cleavage and butt. Its nice to look at, yes, but, thats it. And when ever a girl was interested in me she was in a relationship and was basically thinking about cheating. Like wtf?  So whenever i even see a woman that Id be ibterested in i find myself more and more scared. What if she is like my ex? Or what if she is in relationship? Or we will be in relationship and she cheats? What if? What if? So im not even doing anything anymore. Im not trying. I dont know if ill start trying. I am terrified. So ill be doing everything alone. I knowsomewhere out there is a woman that wr would be perfect for each other, but its like looking for a needle in a pile of hay.
Im just ranting at this point. I just wanted to vent about me changing my life, but ended up with me not changing that much, huh? I think what i want to say is that Ill still be lonely but I hope iwont tbe unhappy anymore."

All of this is making me very depressed and I started having panic attacks and even had to go to a hospital because I couldn't breath and my chest hurt so bad and I thought I was going to die I am always feeling low energy the only place I can feel okay is at work when I don't have time to be depressed but at home I have no motivation to do anything I just lie around listening to music and often crying

I have tried making new friends for a long time but I am boring anxious and withdrawn and I know no one would have any reason to want to be with me because of that

I am more comfortable with talking to females more than males since I had female friendships in the past that lasted longer than my male friendships ever had. I felt like I was more comfortable and less shy talking to women more than men because I can keep a conversation going with a woman more than a man.

I am not looking to have an online relationship or anything romantic. All I really want is to have a few female friends that I can chat with and listen too. It would really make me happy and less lonely before I hopefully go to university to learn about computer science sometime next year.

A little bit about me is I'm 23 years old, I live in Canada, I'm currently working and I have no friends IRL. I like reading, exercising, gaming, cats and all kinds of music except for rap. I like WW2 history and I'm planning to be fluent in German and then travel to Germany in the future.

I hope I did not come off as a creep in this post. If I did, I did not mean for it to be intentional and I'm sorry if I hurted anyone by accident.

Personally, I have been feeling lonely too. I have zero social life, and I have not celebrated Halloween for the past few years since I don’t have friends to dress up with or go to a party with. But today, I decided not to wallow too much in those feelings, and to make a fun and relaxing day for myself. In the evening, I plan to make some hot chocolate/cookies and watch some Netflix. So if you are able to, please do something nice for yourself because you deserve it. Treat yourself how you want to be treated."

So... long story short, I made a friend on here but due to my anxiety issues I stopped speaking to her. Now she seems p\*\*sed at me and is what people would call a 'troll' but I won't.

Anxiety can cause me to hurt really nice people - I didn't intend to hurt her I just got a bit overwhelmed with anxiety which happens. I refuse to hate her though and hope that she doesn't hate me too much.

Anxiety sucks but I'm trying to be a better person and learn from my mistakes."

I don't even miss sex, I'm 53 and kinda over it. But not having someone to tell about my day, share a meal with or just sit and watch tv with fucking sucks. I used to be a fairly social guy. Now I've got no friends, no girl and no family. I dunno what to do. Frankly, a bullet in the head is starting to look good."

It's hard being a hopeless romantic nowadays because you often get the bad end of the stick. I had a breakdown just after the latest guy I was with. We had been talking for 2 months, really thought we had it going good and it was going to a point where we'd be in a relationship. Sadly, we were both in college for engineering and time was a huge constraint to us jumping onto that level. I hated how he liked me first and yet I was the one asking him to make things work in the end. And now it's been two days since we had ""closure"" on whatever we had for the past two months. I'd tell a close friend about what happened yet no amount of assurance is gonna convince me I am not a problem in the relationships I have formed. I'm slowly spiraling back to my toxic behaviour where I avoid crying by doing school works and video games just to avoid the thought of him but fuck I feel so lonely. I miss him alot. I hate how I give out pieces of myself to people without leaving some for myself."

lonely,Is there something wrong with being a loner?,"Is there something wrong with being a loner? - I'll probably delete this post later, I just need to read some answers. 

I have some (not many) colleagues whom I can say hi to and talk about some current stuff, but I don't have any close friends. I've had moments in my life when I had more friends than I do now, but I've never really had a lot of them and I've never had a best friend. I've never had a friend with who I could share my feelings, do a sleepover, share the same interests and stuff like that. 

I'm an introvert and I just find it hard to meet new people. The fact that I lost contact with almost everyone I knew doesn't really help. I've never been to a real party, I don't remember the last time I had a sleepover or went out with someone. When I look at the popular people I just get sad, not angry, not jealous, just sad. Is there something wrong with being a loner? Are some of you in similiar situations and if yes how do you cope with this? 

I'm pretty young so my go-to excuse is being young and convincing myself that it will all be better when I'm older, but I don't even believe myself at this point. 

I'm sorry if the post is chaotic, I'm just having a lot of thoughts rn and I needed to let everything out and get some answers."

And yes I do have a few friends in real life but I feel like they don’t value me as much. I hang out with some people and realize that they are close to each other more than they are with me. They know each others secrets and what’s going on in their lives, they know eachothers quirks and all their pet peeves, for me they just see the surface. The two best friends I’ve had in my life always seemed like they’d rather hang out with other people than me. One of the girls dropped me once she found a new group, and I’m thankful for the one who has stayed by my side for so long, but I even feel like we don’t mash as much as we used to. She has a car and I found out that she would go visit her other friends house all the time, but she’s never done that for me. We’re more like school friends then actual friends. We only see eachother in school. We barely text or call eachother outside school. I really just wish I had someone who I could be super close to. Someone who I know I could lean back on in my darkest moments. I saw a girl on Tiktok who seems really close to her sister, and they seem to know eachother like they’re one. It’d be super cool to have that. Even if it was just a friend."

For instance someone I thought was one of my bestfrienfs never invites me to anything it is ike he talksto.me because no one else does it at the time. Also I feel like I am only accepted in my soccer squad because of my past and my closest to a friend is that we talk a bit more before games and training. And the worst is that a girl I thought who likes me ghosted me and I don't know why this i what kicks in the hardest and I don't know what I should do.

lonely,When are you considered too old to date?,"When are you considered too old to date? - I'm a 34 year old man, I haven't been on a date in years, unless you count coffee with an old friend. (And that went smashing...)

So, when are you ""too old"" to be datable? I feel like I've reached that phase already because most women I am interested in are waaaay to outgoing (I am interested in 20+ year olds, for if I change my mind on having kids.) and how does one do the whole dating thing when you seriously aren't interested in pub-crawling or staying out and about after 21h00?

A normal day is work, then study.. trying to go back to uni, it has been hard.
I also want to move to another country to have a better life, idk where yet probably EU since i am a citizen, this is important because i like to daydream about it but don't know how to do it yet.
 I also would like to date in my country but i found the ""market"" disappointing.

Goals: 
Make new long term friends, make eachother company.
Have common goals, mine are studying and exercise, also eat a little better, i am looking to improve my English, so if you are also looking for that or learning Spanish it would be great.

Talk to me if:
-You are looking for friends, planing to talk for a long time.
- You are LGBT+ friendly (I am Bi)
- The older you are the better, like 24+ please
- You aren't rich
- You can talk about difficult or sensitive topics without getting offended or aggressive, using arguments and feelings.
- You have some defects and you know it

lonely,high school without friends.,"high school without friends. - High school without friends sucks. Growing up, I was a selective mute. I didn’t talk to anyone at school- and everyone made me feel weird. But, every day, I’d see my grandma and my dad and everyone. I had 0 friends. I was just quiet and would cry every day at school. In 4th grade, I got my puppy, Lucy. She was a Pomeranian. We got her before Christmas of 2013. I remember it. I get to fifth grade, and graduated elementary and didn’t celebrate with anyone. I was still alone. Middle school sucked. 6th grade was fun, I had a group of friends for once. It was so nice. My grandma had passed before , and it was starting to get to me. Seventh grade, it went downhill. Depression, anxiety, social anxiety worsened, attempts and excessive s3lf h@rm. my ankles are ugly and scarred years later. No friends again. Eight grade, same deal. Got in an emotionally abuse r relationship with a guy. I’m a girl. Questioned my sexuality. Stayed with cishet. Ninth grade, one or two good good friends. High school too, it was really nice. Met some new people, too. Met my boyfriend, J. J cared for awhile but midway through tenth grade he didn’t. I could tell. Drinking (he did.) tenth grade really hurt me. Good grades, a job, but no friends. I stopped texting people. I fell into severe depression again.  Thoughts of attempts rewinded me. Summer going into 10th, was horrible. I had none. Halloween 2020 I was alone. Stayed home. Attempted midway through 10th. Didn’t work. I watched everyone have fun. Cried about how I have nobody. My dog Lucy died, and it destroyed me. I still miss her. 11th grade, I have 0 friends. Spent the summer with not a single friend not any day. Now, I’m almost a senior and just want to end it all. I’m so miserable. I’m so alone. I’m the loner. I try to make friends but I just embarrass myself. Everyone else has them. I’m gonna be alone forever. I just want a friend. A group. A small one. Only people in school I speak to is teachers. Crying for help."

lonely,Is it a man thing?,"Is it a man thing? - So, I literally made a Reddit a about 2 weeks ago because I’ve been feeling so lonely. I have kept an eye on the community and it seems like it’s mostly men that get this feeling from this community. Why do men get this feeling of loneliness and how do we fill the gap?"
lonely,Giving up,Giving up - Thinking I'm just going to drop out of school. So far behind now due to unresolved nonsense I cant make any friends so I have no one to ask for help and literally no one cares. Hell cant even get a single response to my pain on this subreddit.  Ya know the one where lonely people go. It's clear I had no xhanse and never did. It was a mistake to think hard work and effort actually meant anything. Once you're failure to launch that's it. Theres no coming back. Wanted to try so hard to be able to live life but now I know better. Theres no place for me and there never will be.
lonely,Not relatable,"Not relatable - I wake up feeling sad, lonely and horny all at the same time, this goes throughout the day. The only thing I do to keep myself from thinking about it is work to keep busy. But when I’m all alone that’s when it hits the hardest. Just needed get that off my chest."
lonely,I think I hit my head to much.,"I think I hit my head to much. - When I was younger, I got hit with a hard plastic shovel in the head. And I don’t know if just am making it an excuse for who I am. But I remember, I think, blacking out.
After words I just was so angry but felt bad, because I remembered that I loved all these people around me before I got hit. So I chocked the anger down and cried. Crying not from sadness, but not feeling love anymore after being hit. Not that I lost love for them, but it just stopped being something I could feel.
I just don’t feel a connection with people. But I don’t know if I’m making it up, but I just remember when I came to from blacking out it was like I didn’t understand my old self. Like I was a different person from before. Love was and is now a foreign felling. It’s not like I hate people. I’m not opposed to them, I just don’t feel anything when around anyone. 
I am trying to do better now, but the emptiness is there. And makes me avoid anything with people, because I don’t like faking myself just to look normal. 
Just stepped up twice on a ladder today, and hit my head. Same spot I had 4 wood blocks hit me a month prior, because ladders are being used as tables here. I should have looked up, but I discussed about not leaving things on them. My dad said it was not a big deal when he worked with ladders. Then my uncle I over hear talking to my cousin tells my cousin the most important rule is don’t leave things on your ladder. Just flabbergasted.
Jesus my head wants to just snap at the next sound I hear now."

lonely,Birthdays,"Birthdays - I despise birthdays. I despise my birthday. I despise other people's birthdays. They always remind me of how utterly alone i am. The few time i was invited to one it was always packed full. At least 30 people every time. I in the meantime have usually 4 guys come over, despite inviting even more people every year. 
Or when people complain about their own birthdays, like this one chick talking about how she only invited 20 people like it's an exceptionally small number.

The worst one was a year ago. I had to cancel my birthday party due to the lockdown. So i decided to make a small rpg session for 5 of my closest friends. Everyone agreed. Nobody showed up. I ended up drinking to a mirror all night. And to add insult to injury when i complained to my sister about people not showing up she was like ""no big deal. My daughter invited 30 people for her birthday and a few didn't show up. It happens and nobody holds a grudge"". There is also my mother who every year tries to convince that actually it's perfectly normal to be so lonely because everyone is an overworked loner and at best has two friends."
lonely,So I was thinking…,"So I was thinking… - I’m currently in my twenties and I feel like my life has become meaningless. No matter how I think about it, I can’t find any motivation. I sleep early just to wake up late at night and avoid sleeping when everyone’s sleeping.

Does that mean I’m depressed?"
lonely,I miss my best friend,"I miss my best friend - It’s been 4 years since our friendship dissipated into stranger territory. I’m still friends with her on social media, and my heart breaks every time I see her hanging out with her other friends. My heart broke when I saw her post pictures of her wedding that I was uninvited invited to (my anxiety was too big of a liability for her special day. She wanted her wedding to only be about her and not about making sure I was comfortable. Thanks social anxiety). My heart broke when I was invited to her baby shower, yet I felt I was only invited to give her a present. I went to her baby shower and she took my gift, thanked me, and then didn’t talk to me other than a quick 5 min convo. 

We aren’t enemies which makes this harder. She sometimes even messages me (super rarely) and she sometimes likes my fb posts… but she is a stranger to me now. 

I have no friends. I’m so tired of this."

Avoid talking to friends because I’m afraid they are only with me because of my status in the family. Also, because I can’t get my head out of it for almost a year. I lose almost all daily human interactions. I don’t even know is there really anyone who will be my friend regardless… I just feel like a failure at this point in life (quarter life crisis).

I would finally have a solid group of friends and be able to go to parties and life that idealized college life. That is, unfortunately, not what I got. I miss my parents and home, surprisingly this is not something I expected. When my sister went to college 3 years ago she never felt homesick that is not the case for me. I miss home, friends, and mostly my dog. I have friends in college I'm not a complete loner but these friends don't party at all. Every weekends we either stay in our respective rooms or go to the library to study all day, occasionally we'll go out for dinner or lunch. I really thought things would be different in college maybe that's the reason I feel this way. I sit in my room every night stalking other people on social media and watching them live their best lives. The worst part is FaceTiming my high school friends and listening to them live their best lives. Academically I'm doing great and I'm not really sure who to talk to this about. I just feel heavy, like I don't want to do anything and I'm worried this feeling is going to start affecting my grades. Maybe I had way too many expectations on college but this is not what I expected. I'm not really sure what the point of the account or post is, I just wanted to put into writing what I was feeling because I can't talk to anyone about this without burdening them."

I’ve been careless with my love and trust. I’ve seen too much. I check my pockets but can’t find the toll required to keep crossing.

I would also ask you be somewhere around Nashville(thereabouts) or west to the TN River(even slightly into West TN) for the chance we would both want to meet for coffee or a drink in the future. No rush for that here btw.

I am an intelligent, decently attractive, athletic, attached male searching for ONE intelligent, attractive, female friend. Maybe you're in a similar situation and need a friend to chat with too. Maybe you've been treated badly or done wrong and need someone to confide in and brighten your day. Maybe you're single or married and just feel alone in this world. Maybe you're younger or older than me and would enjoy sharing your day with someone who actually gives a dang. Age is just a number anyway and I still feel young even during lonely days. I only wish I knew in my late teens/early 20s what I know now. You are eager for endless emails or conversing through PMs.

There is so much I want to say and could say but I will save it for your PM. I definitely would enjoy some conversation about almost anything. If you do decide to reply, please send something worthy of a response. 3 to 5 words or a sentence or 2 is not what I call good conversation. I will know if you're serious by the content in your reply. Heck, maybe you'll even share some minor details about yourself.

Have an amazing day and maybe we find each other.

No lie, even though I have friends, I am incredibly lonely. I am really alone. Nobody would ever want to be with me, and nobody has made such an advancement in years.

I am stuck and hopeless-- need to find a way to live with it"

lonely,My Friend Got A Girlfriend and I Don’t Know How to React.,"My Friend Got A Girlfriend and I Don’t Know How to React. - (First off, some people I know, and possibly who this post is about, know about my actual Reddit account so this is a second account that I’ve had for a while.)

To set the stage me and my friend are both high school seniors, so this could just be high school drama or adolescent overthinking, but I find comfort in talking about these things with other people and hearing advice. 

So essentially my friend is on the verge of a full on relationship with this girl and I’m trying to get ahead while I can. We’ve been great friends for the past year and, in all honesty, has really helped me with meeting new people, going to parties, etc. I spent the first 3 years of my high school in a weird friend group where I felt out of place in, so when I met him and the rest of our friend group, it really broadened my horizons. Now I’m just scared that with him getting a girlfriend he’s going to completely forget about me and the rest of the friend group, considering I’ve heard it a million times before. I understand that I may just have to go “head down and push through” for the next 3-6 months until the honeymoon period wears off, but I rather not and still wanna hang out seeing how many memories we’ve made recently and how close we’ve been. Without him I’d lose a lot of motivation as he often makes me feel accepted and not alone. 

Is there anything I should say to him or try to let him know, or should I see how things play out? Appreciate any advice."
lonely,"The worse I get at my academics, the more friends I lose","The worse I get at my academics, the more friends I lose - I haven't been genuinely happy in last 3-4 years (21M) , I somehow landed a seat in good university but it was pretty rough road getting there, but I still couldn't manage to get a friend who would be interested in talking to me, suffered embarrassment when professor asked if I has any friends to help me out with my studies since I was failing, failed my first year , got chance at repeaters and someone close to me passed away , don't really know now what future has for me, the only good time I had was in my 10th grade where I made good friends and kept succeeding."
lonely,Never feel valid or important,"Never feel valid or important - I don’t usually get this depressed, but it’s been very bad recently. I don’t want to eat, I don’t want to sleep, I don’t want to better myself. I’m 23 never had a relationship in my life, always gets picked last for anything, the butt of most jokes. I want to better myself, but I won’t bother if people don’t want to be around me. Seems like all of my friends can get girlfriends when I can’t. I’m probably at my lowest low in quite a while now and I don’t see it getting better."
lonely,I don't know what to do anymore. (23M),"I don't know what to do anymore. (23M) - Last night I got really drunk and I tried putting a knife to my chest and my wrists, but I couldn't do it. I feel like such a coward. I don't want to live anymore and haven't since I was 17. I've done the therapy and self-improvement bullshit as much as I could and not once in my life have I ever been happy. I just want to end my own life but I'm apparently too much of a coward for that too."

 Little group my ass 10 enjoying a late night game while I was alone watching youtube. When I asked for an invite link , they sent me one but they built a another server just to trick me. But I'm not that stupid and not that stupid to the point that I consider them true friends.  


 Now I treat them stranger , we just talk and thats it. I feel lonely because nobody really have this problem if you guys wanted to share your stories simillar to this you're welcome."

lonely,I'm just complaining this time.,"I'm just complaining this time. - I'm alone again. It'll pass soon I guess. 

I can always play video games to pass the time. I can always sleep, eat, dress myself, anything to pass the time.

There's no point in loving someone who discarded me so long ago. There's no intense feelings anymore. All good memories I once remembered has finally died. All there is, isn't even lust. Just resentment and disgust.

And I won't repeat with the new person. I already sensed the relationship is mostly transactional. He doesn't care about my hobbies. Or at least be excited for me. Every time I talk about what I've done or my passion for things it's always. ""Okay."" Or ""Okay?"" And I get so fucking hurt that I just stop talking about these things to him altogether. These romantic interactions was to mainly fill the need for love but to not actually put in the work into it. In the end it's all filler though. There's no satisfaction from doing it. 

I'm truly a love sick person tho. I never learn anyway. 

Btw this is just me ranting into the void. I know this is a lonely subreddit but I'd rather be alone right now."
lonely,"Lots of games, no friends to play","Lots of games, no friends to play - I keep buying board games and card games despite not having any friends to play with. I keep hoping that one day I will make enough friends so that I can have a weekly game night. That hasn’t happened yet I keep buying more stuff.

It’s starting to get depressing actually. It’s making me feel lonely. My coworkers have their own DnD group but they are very cliquey. Even though I voice that I’ve played campaigns and haven’t done it in years, that I would like to do it again, I never get any invites. My work schedule doesn’t permit it but it would still be nice to have the invitation extended.

The pic is just a small sample of my collection. It’s not even picturing the video games. I have Mario kart and I would love to play that with a group of people. No group. I have my old Wii and we party games. I have fighting games. I don’t even have a player 2 since I’m single let alone player 4.

Friends would be nice.

lonely,Don't realize what you have till' it's gone,"Don't realize what you have till' it's gone - May not be the right sub but here goes...About 2 months ago, I (22F) was broken up with by my ex (25M) of 9 months.

He was kind, loving, supportive, funny and would always prioritize my feelings over his own, the fucked up thing was that I allowed him to do this. I let him shower me with gifts, affection and care and he expected nothing in return - only that we hung out together often. He would surprise me with hot breakfast delivered to our door consistently and from different Cafe's every time. He would make little puzzles and treasure hunts for me to do if he couldn't sleep at night, I'd wake up to a loving, romantic or whacky sticky-note treasure hunt often. He would listen intently to my stories of how my day went, ask questions and become equally invested, despite the topic not being of interest to him. He was loyal, would actively tell other girls to take a hike if they were showing interest in him (even when he didn't know I was aware of it!)

He really was such an amazing person to me and I messed it all up because I failed to return the kindness and love he would show me, in nearly every way, example being I wouldn't really properly listen to him when he would tell me about his day, I wouldn't get off my fucking phone for 5 MINUTES to ask him if he wanted to talk or hang out or do something together, ever (and a mammoth amount other stuff that would reveal how much of an ass I am. It wasn't until he was truly gone did I realize what I had lost.

It's been 3 months now and I'm more lonely than I've ever been in my life, without him. I suppose this post is just me ranting about how much of an idiot I was and that I plan on being a better person for my future boyfriend, regret is a good motivator."
lonely,I feel I am at breaking point from never being in a real relationship and being a virgin at 20,"I feel I am at breaking point from never being in a real relationship and being a virgin at 20 - No matter what anyone tells me, I just cannot change my mindset or thoughts about this. I am 20, never been in a real relationship, never kissed, never held hands or had sex. And before anyone suggests a prostitute, I'm not paying 200 dollars just for 1 hours experience when teenagers in high school and friends (well they aren't anymore) and even my ex who was a LDR, got to have sex for free, and in some cases multiple times and they were almost all HOOKUPS.


I just cannot get over it, and the thought of me being a virgin at 21 traumatises me. I have been judged. Made fun of because of all of this in the past, and I can't just ""not let it get to me"" I am on the spectrum and I haven't really had anyone really close to me in my life. No best friends. Never been to friends houses. Never trick or treated. Never been to a party. My parents didn't give me the best childhood. I envy almost everyone my age and younger because they not only had/have more things than me, but had a better social life and sex life than I ever did and do.


I have been told by psychologists to get out more. Sure but how am I supposed to build up confidence if every single night and day I think about the sex and dating thing? I can't function concentrate. I feel it has done enough damage not only to get suicidal thoughts but also enough damage to severely impair my concentration, eating and sleeping habits. Basically making it almost impossible for me to live a good life. And I struggle to talk to people when I feel this way.


I cut out contact of some friends because they have all these things that I don't have but it isn't just that. They previously either attacked me for it or boasted about their better life. My ex even went as far and said I got bad grades and I'm not ""outgoing"" so she thinks I don't deserve any of these things.


I can't cope. I've tried dating apps from a psychologists recommendation to no luck due to the lack of photos but also I struggle with top bios.


I don't feel like being here anymore, and I really struggle to take care of my health to the point I don't care about it, I am not overweight but I likely don't get the right nutrients. Sooner rather than later I am going to get a serious illness because of my habits. But I have no clue how to solve any of these problems.


Changing my mindset is almost impossible, been there loads of times. I just want to experience the things most teens and young adults experience that's all. I understand it won't cure all of my problems. But if I could somehow know how I could get a free hookup tommorow. Whether I get HIV or a STD or not I don't really care anymore. I do want a long term relationship as a long term goal but I've been reading allot of posts on reddit saying girls hate inexperienced guys etc,  and that they assume they are bad at attracting women.


I just don't know how to fix any of these problems. But I feel I just can't go on because of the way past peers treated me over it. And while 90% of the I'm talking about are American (and I'm not) it still affects me greatly.

When with friends, I feel like I am cornered out, and just there hanging in their conversations. With time, distance between me and my family members has also increased."

lonely,I feel like I’m suffocating,"I feel like I’m suffocating - I feel this pressure and ache in my chest and throat and it just feels like I’m choking. I can’t really get myself to cry. Maybe that’s the issue. The sob always crawls up and my eyes start watering but it just never works. Maybe it’s because I’ve learned not to cry or show it. 

I feel like an idiot. I’ve been trying so hard to be happy. To involve myself more with my family but I just feel like I’m carrying the conversation every time. And they make fun of me every time. It’s a contant reminder of why thing are the way they are in the first place. 

I feel like I’m faking being okay. I laugh a lot. And when I go upstairs to my bedroom I feel gross. Like I’ve been lying. My parents or little sister don’t even know me. I feel tired, exhausted and so so lonely. I keep trying to be happy on my own but it’s really not working. I don’t feel like anyone really gives a shit. Nobody has really cared for me in over 10 years anyway."
lonely,All alone again - My 2021 story,"All alone again - My 2021 story - I’m no stranger to loneliness, I’ve known it my entire life.
There have been brakes to my loneliness, I used to have a small friend group, those times made me feel really good and I thought I would never go back to my old self isolating ways. But the friends I loved so much decided that I was no fun to hang around with anymore, because I don’t like to drink and to go to huge parties, so they left me alone again. After that I was mortified and completely isolated, earlier this year I went months without talking to anyone but my boss and the cashiers at my local store. I was miserable and wanted out of the hell I created for myself. 

One day, I was at work, I saw a post on a mental health sub I follow. Someone was asking if anyone wanted to talk about their issues and plenty of people showed interest. A small discord was created and I decided to join. Immediately I was amazed at the atmosphere the users of this server created and I wanted to be a part of it. I put so much effort into talking to everyone offering advice and helping people out wherever I could. And for the first time in my life, these efforts were not only recognized but also appreciated, people started to value and respect me. One day the creator of the server dm’d me out of the blue to tell me he appreciated my commitment to the server and how much I cared about the people on it. He had made me an admin and I have never felt so valued in my entire life.

By that time the server was buzzing with positivity and we shared nice things like pet pictures and sunsets. I wrote almost 4000 messages to people and spent literally hundreds of hours in voice chat and it was absolute bliss for me, I could help people out and it made me feel great. And when I felt bad those same people were there for me and offered their best advice. I had finally found what I had been searching for my entire life: people I cared for and can take care of and who do the same for me.

I remember one day a guy from the US wrote a message at an unusual time, he said it was three in the morning for him and he was having a terrible panic attack. I talked to him for a bit, tried to calm him down and recommended some anxiety relief exercises to him. He said he was feeling better and was going to get some sleep now. The next day he texted me and thanked me for what I did and it felt amazing, I was able to be there for someone on the other side of the earth in the middle of the night and it actually helped them.
Another time I was feeling really bad, I had something bad happen in my personal life, and my thoughts were racing, I was freaking out. I put a small message on the server and said I wasn’t doing well. Within minutes people replied to me offering to help me out and others even dm’d me asking if I needed to talk. I was so touched I could’ve cried for hours.
I have so many stories like that from the server and it truly was a magic place for me and for the others. 

But then reality struck us, people became less active and one by one they started to disappear. The server slowed down and I couldn’t take seeing it so I too stopped checking in all the time. Before I knew it the server was dead and the beautiful space we created was forever lost. I miss the server, I miss the atmosphere on there and I miss the people on it so god damn much that it hurts me every day.

There is another part to this story I haven’t gotten into yet and I don’t know if I’m able to do that right now. Let’s just say, I met someone on the server who I cared for in a special way and they cared for me the same. It was another feeling of bliss and I enjoyed it a lot. However much like the server, everything changed and now I barely recognize that person anymore… it hurts me to see them hurting but all they do is shut me out.

Now I feel so alone again, I have no one to talk to and no one to take care of. I’m depressed, I’m anxious, I have no direction in life, nothing to look forward to and I once again spent my days wasting away all alone again.

If anyone actually read through this ranty story, I thank you for listening and taking some time to hear me out!"

This has all been building up gradually for about a year now though. I feel really lonely lately and have no one to turn to except really just saying this all out loud here. I’m slightly ashamed to say this but if I ever want to cry I can’t and the very rare times (i mean like twice in the past year) I have it feels embarrassing. I have no girlfriend to talk to or anything, and don’t want to talk to my family about it. I’ve got no motivation for stuff, I now struggle get energy for the gym, no desire for playing the guitar. Anything I used to enjoy now does basically nothing and I feel really insecure. Plus when I got my mock/practice A-level (UK) exam results (I think there called AP examinations in the USA) and they weren’t as good as I was hoping, which really didn’t help with things. I didn’t do much revision because I just had no motivation and I don’t want that to carry through to my January practice exams or my final ones in 2022 summer.

lonely,16 and depressed,"16 and depressed - I found this forum and wanted to share my story. I’m 16 years old and have never really had trouble making friends. I’ve never had a best friend or a close friend however that never really bothered me that much until this year when I lost all my friends and have felt so lonely. Im too nice of a person to take up for myself and let people walk right over me and call me names and i don’t do anything about it. I have always had trouble learning in school because I have adhd and learning disabilities which makes school very difficult. This stresses me out because I have never gotten good grades even if I try my hardest so it’s gotten to the point where I don’t try anymore. My grades are too bad and I feel like it’s too late to fix them. Since my grades have been so poor I feel like have no future ahead of me. The teachers have called me names like idiot, moron, worthless, and a failure. This took place at a private Christian school where people think nothing bad happens there. When I was there it was filled with bad influences. School got so stressful for me that I ran away from home and my parents ended up calling the police on me about this. I’ve always felt like a failure because I’ve never had a girlfriend and I have never really accomplished anything huge. I’m not very shy but I’m a very awkward person. There was this one girl at my school that I would talk to every day and I liked her for 3 years. I would go home and think about her all day. After 3 years I decided to make the decision to tell her I like her. After I did that she said she wanted to stay friends and I was fine with that. The next day I came to school her friends were making fun of me and she never talked to me since. After all these events happening I fell into depression and it has ruined my life. I lost all my friends because I don’t even talk to anyone anymore. I have switched schools and it has just gotten me more stressed out and I don’t see me making friends with anyone there because it’s a very small school. I am now taking medicine for this depression I have and it seems to only make me feel worse. I don’t know what to do about this anymore I sure hope I’m not the only one facing stuff like this."

My home doesnt even feel like home.

They haven’t really spoken to me since but everyone has their own life so i really shouldn’t be caught up in it. I just want to feel like i belong somewhere. I want to feel welcomed and not like i have to be here for the sake of being here. I haven’t been outside in 3 weeks and i think thats a personal choice. I dont feel the need to.

I’ve reached a low in sending her emotional texts, begging for her to give me another chance and to take me back. She’s so emotionless that it just hurts so much. I just feel unloved and alone. It just hurts so much. I know this type of post probably isn’t uncommon for this sub, but man I’m just hurting. I have no motivation now and it sucks.

I wouldn't consider all of it that amazing, but maybe I just feel if I had more friends and a netter group of friends, I would be going to more of these things and enjoying it a bit more.

It's just been tough for me during these type of weekends and it just makes me feel depressed knowing where my social life is. Add that to other stresses in my life, it's hard to try to focus and think about what's important and more important. Hope some would understand."

I was leaving a Starbucks the other day and an employee by the door told me to “get home safely,” and for whatever fucking reason it made my day.

I’m pretty good at a sport, I have a pretty cool style, drive a pretty cool truck, I’m pretty good looking relative to the kids my grade, I’m open and outgoing. But they treat me like I’m a social reject. The kids aren’t amazing either they are all going nowhere in life and just smoke to pass time. They just could care less if I just dropped out tomorrow. Can someone give me advice on how to make friends cuz I’m drowning socially?"

lonely,Hey there,"Hey there - Just browsing reddit in the morning, trying to stay on top of everything that is going on in my life right now. Quite tough but somehow I'm slowly solving my problems without anyone's help since I'm an absolute loner. Finally landed a nice job a few months ago, started some new hobbies and life is moving forward, it's not so bad. Still lonely but I'm managing. It really is about the mindset and leaving the comfort zone.

Anyway how are you guys doing ?"

lonely,I’m sick of my life,"I’m sick of my life - Sorry if you can’t read this but I’m writing this through tears. I’m tired of my life, the way I look, my weight, my work, my coworkers and even my parents. I don’t want to be tired of them but I’m drained. I try so hard to be happy and put a smile on my face for everyone because I don’t want them feeling the way I do but little do they know is that I think about leaving this place every second of the day. No one knows this more than my parents. I’m in my 30s and still live with them. Today I broke down because my brother rang to ask if my mom could look after his kids … this happens every weekend. I’m tired of it, not of them, I love being an aunt but of working 45 hours a week and my weekends not being rested because of my nephews. I tried to explain that to my parents and instead of them being understanding I was met with yelling and slandering how I’m a bad aunt, that I’ve ruined their lives not having my own place (that I hate myself over everyday but anxious and depression won’t let me). This made me have a panic attack and they just yelled at me saying to grow up and stop acting like a child. That my mom was crying and it’s my fault and that I should stop crying because she is. All my life I feel like my feeling have been invalid. I either get screamed at or laughed at never taken serious. And this also happens at my work place. I’m just so tired of it all. I have hardly any friends and it’s hard for me to be open. Even on line when I feel like I’m getting enough confidence to break the wallls and be confident it ends up with me appeeantly doing something wrong. I just hate being this loser that no one respects nor wants and I just feel like leaving."
lonely,Good but not good enough,Good but not good enough - 25(f) I am lately coming to the realization that love isn’t what we are raised up on with false hopes of soulmates and what not. Or at least I grew up a hopeless romantic. Always wondering who is my forever person going to be? Now I look at the world as grey and no one feels genuine. I have my friends when needed. But man. I’m always #2. And I CRAVE to just be someone’s number one… but. Like I said. The realization that maybe I am meant to be on my own. Maybe that’s how things are meant to be. And it hurts because as much as I don’t want it to be that way. No one feels real enough to me. No connections ever strike. And the ones that do it’s one sided pointing at me. I just needed to say it to someone or something. I needed to get it off my chest. Man this really does suck.

I dont know why I keep posting here as if I’m not screaming into the void. I complain about the same problems every day. But the hard part is that there isnt really a way to solve them. I’ve tried being more socially open to people, but that doesnt change the fact that I’m drastically different than everyone around me. I dont totally fit in with gaming communities either because they tend to be people that dont wish to leave their virtual worlds. 

No friends to care for, family doesnt care about me, and I feel like I’m wasting my life by constantly working. I have so much to say, but so little will to keep repeating my same woes."
lonely,I just woke up from a dream I would’ve never wanted to wake up from,"I just woke up from a dream I would’ve never wanted to wake up from - For the past few years, I’ve somewhat-consistently had this overwhelming issue with loneliness. I never really feel a great connection to my friends, and I haven’t had a significant other in about 2 years. For context, I’m 19 years old now, in my second year of college. This evening, when I was asleep, I had a dream that placed me in my utopia. I was walking on campus with my dream person, we were laughing obnoxiously. We just had a prolonged hug as we were waiting in line for something, and it just had all kinds of things like that. I woke up in the middle on the night about an hour ago, only having had about 2 hours of sleep, and I’m so incredibly depressed. In reality, I don’t really talk to anyone on campus, and I don’t have a car to leave and meet any other people. Has anyone else had this experience? How do you get rid of these agonizing feelings?"
lonely,I feel empty and just want to talk to someone,"I feel empty and just want to talk to someone - I just had somewhat of a revelation about how lonely I actually am. I'm currently in high school and  I feel like I have a lot of acquaintances, but no actual friends. I know having friends in high school isn't the biggest deal in the long run, but sometimes I just feel kinda pathetic for going through so many years of school without making any lasting relationships.

The thing is that I know there's at least one person I can text right now to rant about my loneliness, but they'd never confide in me that way. So I just feel weird pouring out my emotions to someone who wouldn't do the same with me. Idk if that makes sense, and it probably sounds dumb, but it makes me sad af and idk why. Like, none of the friendships I have go both ways. Everyone has someone else.

I've realized that I cope with the loneliness by getting really invested in things (tv shows, movies, books, etc.) and it just seems plain sad to think about. I mean like, I have no one in real life, so I turn to fictional stories for comfort and belonging. Like I said, sad.

So, yeah. I just wanted to talk about this somewhere where people might understand and relate. I'd be more than happy if someone struck up a conversation in the comments. It could literally be about anything, I just want to talk."

I feel distant from everyone and I do everything I love by myself to get myself out of the void. I even start going to therapy working on myself and I’m feeling like I’m doing great but as much as I try, I feel very lonely and start hating everything about myself blaming myself for not being in the place I wanted. I became sick of trying to approach people because most people already have their lives and it's hard to include you in their friend group since you just came out of nowhere. Clubs and other college activities are good to make connections but not for friends. The few people I know are busy with their lives and I’m happy that they are doing great but I swear I’m losing my mind with every minute I spend by myself. I hate the weekend because I have more free time and nothing to get me out of my loneliness. I becoming more depressed and failing my classes and not doing great with my life.

lonely,F!ck a title,"F!ck a title - I'm 25. Male.

I don't think I am ever going to have a successful relationship. I believe that I am unlovable over a period of time, and I am speaking from experience. I also have a fear, a form of body dysmorphia...

So my fear is that I'll get cheated on. I know something like that would fuck me up more than I am fucked up already. I sometimes cry myself to sleep. I am also the type that when I cry I get angry at everything. I know why I get angry now, and thays because I cried easily when I was a kid. Never had friends because of that. I know belive because of this I have trouble expressing any real emotions. Which is just another reason why I won't be able to maintain a relationship. I also feel that it wouldn't be fair to whoever I attempt to talk to because I will fuck it up. Then again I can't even get passed the first step of attraction, but if I did I know that I can be likeable but I can't be loveable or desirable if that makes sense.

For a while I believed i could do it alone. All I want is to not be alone now, but that's all I am ever going to be.

Fucked up thing is I hope a girl sees this read this and can relate and we would start talking. That's just a dumb thought. Even if someone hit me up and it was a ""girl"" I wouldn't believe they are a girl. So I wouldn't believe anything anyway.

This is just, words from a sad mind that wishes he was not afraid of death but he is. And he knows there's a good chance that he is going to die alone and disappear from the world not adding to it or anything. And that everyone at school knew I was a fucking looser and they were right I guess or something idk..."

For almost a month all of my attempts to make plans have been repeatedly shut down, yet she still insists that she's interested in hanging out again. It's clear now that she has no interest at all in seeing me again. It's like life is just teasing me by giving me a small taste of what I'll never have.

lonely,31 and wondering where it all went wrong,"31 and wondering where it all went wrong - Ain’t no one going to read this long ass shit but it might help getting it off my chest.

I used to be the ‘comic relief’ of my friend group and had plenty of acquaintances through sports but that is all long gone since high school and college ended. I say acquaintances because no matter how fun we had or how much I was included, none of those relationships seemed to really stick after those years. I have probably 3 contacts in my phone at the moment besides family that I could reach out to but the problem is they are either in long term relationships or married with kids and have their own new friend groups. 

I legitimately feel like a parasite and I’m afraid to even reach out because after years of depression slowly eroding any sense of self I have, I’m not sure I’d even have that much to say or I’d be even worth having as company.

On top of that I barely make enough money to afford rent and basic living expenses let alone lead any kind of worthwhile social life.

I feel like my past is catching up with me. I’m an only child who comes from a divorced household where dad left when I was only 11. I had a history of being bullied when I was younger which led to switching schools a few times. Since high school I’ve always been a sort of chameleon and managed to blend in and make some people laugh along the way but I think I’ve never really learned how to ‘make friends’ due to my insecurities and doubts that are fueled by my life long depression. The true definition of the sad clown.

I probably need to talk to a therapist but I feel like at this point I am stuck with a pessimistic and bitter world view that makes me ask why. Why don’t I deserve friends? Why can’t I make good money? Why can’t I look forward to the weekend like everyone else? And lastly, why the fuck should I keep going? I guess that’s where my true power lies, I can end this whenever I want.

I should also note that I realize that there are people who have it worse off than me, people like the children who have never had a chance to begin with because of cancer, tumors, or whatever shit the universe throws in their bucket. People who grow up in the slums and favelas of third world countries who are beat down by the daily grind of life every day.

But at the end of the day, we are the only ones who walk in our own shoes and our world is our own."

lonely,"I don't really crave sex, I crave intimacy and feeling human so I hired a sex worker to cuddle and watch Netflix with me.","I don't really crave sex, I crave intimacy and feeling human so I hired a sex worker to cuddle and watch Netflix with me. - I always feel kinda lonely because I never had a girlfriend and don't have friends, but this feeling was worse today because I saw people I know posting on social media about the Halloween parties they were going to and those who stayed home posting how they decided to binge a scary movie with their boyfriend/girlfriend.

I got a few drinks to try and make the sadness go away but no luck, so I decided to say fuck it and spend some money to make myself feel better. I hired a sex worker.

At first, as soon as she arrived I kind of regretted it, she asked for money upfront and didn't seem to be in the best of moods but I don't blame her, then I told her I didn't really want sex and just wanted to cuddle and watch something. I think she felt pity for me because we planned for a 1-hour session and when the time was up I was ready for her to leave but she stayed and told me ""I'm having a good time"". She ended up staying almost 3 hours cuddling with me.

After we watched a few episodes of a tv show she stayed a bit longer and when she was leaving I offered to pay for the extra time she stayed but she didn't take it, just told me I was sweet and that she liked cuddling and watching Netflix. I know she only did this either because she felt pity or because it was easy money just watching Netflix with some dude but this is the first time in a while I've felt human.

I think something a lot of people who have friends and a partner don't really realize that sex isn't really the main point lonely people are making, we just want to feel like we belong and that someone cares for us even if it is just for a moment."

I have never reached out to this subreddit before but I wasn't sure where else to turn. My life over the last several months has been in a word a shit show. It was capped off today by the love of my life telling me she couldn't do it anymore. I know I have friends and family but I just can't admit what's going on to people I know.

lonely,Something about connecting with people,"Something about connecting with people - I really want to find someone who's like me. It's just that I feel so far away from everyone.

I'm pretty lost in my emotions. I don't even feel like a person sometimes, instead I'm more like the embodiment of my emotions. It makes me feel insane. I feel like a lot of people who see this will see someone who's lost it. But really, I'm fine. Not insane, I think. Well, I'm likely gonna have a mental breakdown when college starts and I can't make friends, but that's besides the point. Anyways.

It feels so hard to be anything but stuck in my emotions. I see people posting on subreddits like r/MakeNewFriendsHere (fuck if ik how to format that on mobile), and they all seem so fake. Everyone is so painfully... social. I'm here pleading in my mind that someone will connect with me and with what I go through, but all of these people are like, ""hey everyone! i'm really bored rn and my friends are busy, so hit me up haha xD"" That type of stuff... They feel so far away from me. They feel so normal.

I say all of this, but I'm a hypocrite. When I do talk to people, I have such a hard time forming the type of close connection that I want. It's so easy to lapse into being safe and formal, hiding behind boundaries, afraid to be open about anything because it might hurt. And a lot of the time, I quickly dismiss people with thoughts like, ""this person can't be who I'm looking for, i can't see this happening with them."" But honestly, I don't think this person I'm looking for even exists. I've fabricated them. It's an unrealistic dream, created from reading too many sappy romance novels and empowering fantasy stories.

...I don't even know what I want at this point. I really don't know what could make me happy. I'm always so depressed and introverted, dreaming about greater things that I barely work towards achieving. That I barely ever *feel* like working towards achieving. But would I even be happy if I achieved any of those things?"

I’m actually starting to hate my 2 days off a week cause I have nothing to do or no one to hang with; I just binge watch movies and shows all day when I’m at home. Too much free time to think just makes me remember how pathetic my life is; I know it sounds weird but I’d rather be at work so I can take my mind off things.

lonely,it’s hard being alone,it’s hard being alone - sometimes i forget that i’m real when there’s nobody around to remind me.
lonely,Not where I wanted to be,"Not where I wanted to be - I’m just not where I thought I would be. I’ve just finished University , where I made no friends largely in part to the pandemic (my school had no in person). My one and only best friend became extremely cruel to me after she entered into a relationship not too long ago. I’ve talked to her about it and there’s no point she just uses it against me. My one friend I was supposed to hangout with this weekend had to cancel because she’d had a long week. it’s ok i get it. But life’s just not what I thought it would be. I’m 22 and sitting in an apartment i spend way too much money on alone on Halloweekend. I was so excited to go buy a costume , hoping I would get invited out but no one invited me anywhere. So now I’m sitting on my couch crying in silence, wondering where I fucked up that made me so depressed and lonely all the time. The only people I have spoken too in the last week are a maintenance man, and cashiers."

lonely,Lonely reminder,"Lonely reminder - I talk to myself a lot , I don’t really trust people and the friends I had were fake so I’ve got no friends n some of them we’re totally different people now (out grew) but sometimes I’ll have conversations to myself when I’m alone sometimes loud conversations as if I were talking to another person , they’re good conversations nonetheless
I’m a funny person
But I sometimes feel weird because I then realise how lonely I actually am when there’s no one around, like uh sh “I’m talking myself again 🙄🙄🙄 o no I can’t stop talking to myself stoop”

So when i got invited to a halloween party, i did expect the usual. In  the beginning it was just that. I got left out on conversations and no one realy talked to me. I was just roaming around most of the time looking for something to do.

Some time later i sat on the couch with my phone out, when suddenly one of my friends sat down besides me and asked me how i was doing. I said that i was bit tired of work as an excuse. And we just started talking about work, school, and family. We went back an forward for about 1 hour. 

At the end i just broke into tears because its was so long ago when i got this kind of conversation with someone that wanted to listen to me. It felt so nice to have that. Even tho for her it was just a normal conversation."

As things currently are It genuinely feels like she neither can nor wants to understand, empathise or just be with me in any positive way. I moved to the other side of the country for her, left behind friends, family. everyone. Yet she continues to act jealous when i have no one to talk to. Tonight I went out alone to the pub for the first time in almost two years with the understanding she would meet me after work yet she turned up and was passive agressive or agressive with me the whole time and now o just don’t know what to do it seems like she doesn’t want me to be happy without her. I know I have my flaws at times I can be moody or simply narrow minded yet I try my best and always try to make her happy yet one time just once I try and get out of the house and enjoy myself and she just demoralises me. I don’t know what to do. It feels like I’ve done so much for her yet she won’t accept méfie who I am. I don’t want to leave her because I genuinely love her but I can’t continue like this. I’m so fucking lonely."
lonely,(BIG VENT) - Story Time - 6-7 min read.,"(BIG VENT) - Story Time - 6-7 min read. - Hi, this is gonna be bit long so I appreciate whoever takes the time to read and respond. This is a real emotional roller coaster of a story, involves heartbreak, disease, fighting, back-to-back betrayal, and just about everything that could go wrong for an attempted relationship. I know this is super long, but it would mean the world to me if someone reads and relates and of course I could use some words of hope or encouragement. I don't really post much on reddit, nor do I seek getting help even though I probably should, so I have quite a bit to unpack here. I'm grateful towards whoever reads.

To give some background: I'm M-23. Last girl I dated I was 19 and it was nothing too real when I look back on it, just a fuck fest between two teenagers that had abandonment issues, I am grateful to have learned some things from it in the end. Over the course of the next year after that breakup when I turned 20 I tried the ""talking"" even early dating stages with 4 girls during that time period , most of which never amounted to any real connection or talks about being fully together and committed. I had been disappointed with a couple of them after things ended prematurely, but a couple of them I also decided to break off, and I never really felt a super strong connection or deep sense of longing/regret after any of them. It seemed like I was healthily dating and I was ok with things not working out. But this did not last long, since I met 2 girls after this that I fell toxicly in love with. 

Fast-forward to Summer of 2019. Girl #1 appears here. This is where you might wanna buckle up cause I am really about to vent here. I reconnected with a girl who I actually ""dated"", if you can even call it that, in 5th grade. We were each other's first gf/bf and we somehow reconnected through a few random mutual friends, sounds a bit corny but yeah it was a hell of a coincidence. She was 1000% my type, all of my friends and their girlfriends loved her and for the first time in my life I was hearing people say things like ""yall just really go together"" or ""she is so you man"". Deep down I really agreed with them and I was super sprung on the idea of having something special with this girl. We just really clicked, hung out a lot, had great sex. Then one night we kinda got pretty intimate and had a deep talk and hooked up and she told me how she wanted to keep seeing me, and that she didn't want this to be a little fling. Fast-forward a few days later she got really spaced out, I didn't text her much and just gave her space since I figured she was having mixed feelings. Anyways, she got on Tinder and was matching with people I knew, and I even found out she had sucked one of my old friends dick the night before she told me all of that. So yeah that ended really ugly.

After about half a year of processing wtf happened with me and girl #1, I met another girl (Girl #2) who I had met through her older sister. We hit it off really well and things were good, given what happened with me and the girl #1 who I really did love, I was trying to be cautious with this girl #2 to avoid a heartbreak. Of course, she was kinda playing the field a bit for the first couple of weeks and she hung out with this notoriously creepy guy that I went to high school with, so I told her straight up I just wasn't into that and we probably shouldn't talk if that's they type of guy/lifestyle she wants. She of course begged and pleaded and made us out be some type of soulmates, so I obliged and kept talking to her even though deep down I knew she was still gonna be all over snapchat getting attention from these weirdos. I think probably in the back of my head I was compensating and allowing this in order to feel the love I missed so much from girl #1, even though she betrayed the shit out of me. Anyways, as time goes on we got pretty close and things were messy, the creepy guy wouldn't stop popping up on her phone (come to find out she was using him for free shit) even though it wasn't sexual, its a respect thing and the dude wants her and talks shit about me, therefore if we are hooking up she should probably not talk to that man, but ya know whatever no one this day in age knows what true respect is. Another guy she had texted who was a friend was this dude who barely speaks English and plays soccer at the University we go to, he was in Greece for the summer. Given the extreme language/social barrier I assumed they had probably hooked up maybe but there was nothing serious there. Boy was I wrong about that and everything else. 

So she kept texting creepy guy for stuff behind my back and even going and hanging out with all these people at his house, one night he was on drugs and started texting my phone saying he wanted to fight me because he saw me posted on her snapchat story with her out at the bar. I am about 6'4 200lbs, and this dude is about 5'8 165 and not an athlete by any means, so I basically didnt take it seriously at all and I went home from the bar with her and we hung out at the house. He blows my shit up constantly, and finally out of nowhere this kid showed up to my house with a gun in his wasteband talking all kinds of crazy. So I whooped his ass immediately, but in the process I broke my hand completely with a full boxer's fracture. I tried cutting her off again here but she insisted on being here for me, and after such neglect from my previous girl (girl #1), i just allowed it in order to feel some type of support. Anyways, I got surgery and then unluckily contracted MRSA staph in my hand, had to spend a week in the hospital and underwent 3 months of treatment after via PICC line in my arm. I couldn't workout, go to work, do school, or even really use a computer efficiently. During this time at the hospital, where I laid completely alone, embarrassed, and helpless, the boy from Greece came back in town, and she immediately started sleeping with him. They were dating less than a month later, she completely abandoned me. To date they have been together for over a year now. 

Fastforward a bit more, a couple of months into treatment around Oct. 2020, girl #1 magically appears in my instagram inbox telling me she moved away for a while but was now back in Memphis. I briefly explained my situation to her with my hand being broken or whatever, but of course left out the fact that I though I was in love with girl #2 and that's why it happened, I made it seem more like I did it because they guy showed up at my house and I deserved it instead of saying it was really because I loved girl#2. Anyways, we started hanging out again, she apologized for last time said she really missed me and we agreed to keep things Platonic for a while. Of course we would get drunk and hook up a little bit and slip up before eventually stopping ourselves, but she had expressed to me if we were as intimate as last time she was going to have feelings and she was set to move back out of town in about 5-6 months (not enough time to commit to anything), which of course I respected. I was at such a low point I was more than willing to be able to hang out with this girl I used to love and have a nice ass to grab on while we smoked and watched our favorite shows, even if I had to use some level of self-control and avoid actual sex. She had also expressed to me she talked to a guy when she was out of town and has been on a complete break from hooking up/looking for relationships since. Of course, you guessed it, all turned out to be a complete lie.

After a while me and girl #1 had a couple of moments where we were about to get it on, where it just felt way too right and I thought to myself, if she REALLY wanted to it would be happening, even though since she's moving away it would probably be awful for both of us after she was gone, when you're drunk and horny there is usually not much stopping it. She was also basically inviting herself over 4 times a week which made me think she really did like me and that she was just holding back. This being said, one of her friends was over at my house hanging with some people and I was back in my room and she comes back there and asked where's ""my girl"" (girl #1), I told her that I didn't know and that she was being kind of weird and not really wanting to hookup anymore and stuff. Of course her friends spills the beans and tells me that she has been hooking up with people in town, and she was also holding out for some other guy that lives in the town that she was moving back to. So yeah, the one that I really loved the most betrayed me twice. The first time was bad, but you can move on from that, but coming around when you see me in an awful spot in life where I am recovering from an awful situation that essentially was holding my life on pause is really really really really fucked up. It's completely unforgivable and I don't know how she could've done that to me, especially after already fucking me over once, now she comes back and does it again when I'm no longer in a good spot in life? It's just awful. 

Fast-forward to this year. Yes we are finally almost there (I really appreciate if you made it this far). I got done with MRSA treatment got back in school for the spring semester. Girl #1 had moved back out of town after betraying me for the 2nd time. Girl #2 had been texting me periodically acting like she wanted to check on me or apologize, but it started becoming regular in January. Girl #2 texting me apologizing saying that she cant stop thinking about me, calling me crying telling me she made the wrong decision, that she still loves me. It was just all so much, I was genuinely living in a permanent state of anxiety/confusion/depression from what these women did to me and yet they couldn't leave me alone in the end. Over the course of this past 9-10 months I cheated with her, multiple times went over there when she has called saying she misses me and fucked. The foreign bf of hers moved away and they are still doing long distance apparently, and she insisted on trying to tell me that I was the only other guy she was sleeping with and that she wanted to be with me and needed time to break up with her bf. This started in January......the story is still the same with her....9 months later. She still hits me up periodically to come over, wants to sleep with me, and yet I hear stories of her sleeping with other people, some of which who are closer to me than I would like and all she does is deny it. Keep in mind I would never take this girl back, I just need to cut her off completely, but i literally block her and she will make a fake account and follow me and message me or make a new phone number with some stupid app to text me off of.

Finally, I gave in to her after about 3-4 months of removing myself and went to hangout with her last month (girl#2). Since then she has had some issues and made a couple of doctors appointments, literally called me on the phone asking me if I gave her and STD since she was bleeding (I definitely did not), and claims that if its not that she might be having some type of pregnancy, and she is sure that the kid is mine. Even more added stress to my current stressful and lonely life, exactly what I needed huh?

I just feel so low and awful to have reached this point. Instead of bouncing back from the betrayal, I was completely consumed by love and the need for affection and allowed myself to be vulnerable with women that I shouldn't have. I even gave them multiple chances after being done dirty. On top of all of this, it has wrecked my confidence and mental health so bad I find every excuse to not talk to a new girl and I have no drive to really meet someone even though I want to be loved so bad. Its like being in a weird limbo-state between wanting something but being too afraid of betrayal/lacking the energy and determination to go after something and make it work, especially since it has never worked in the past. I was ultimately consumed by all of this, past year has been bad, days kind of just fuse together, don't really remember much of anything anymore, and I get daily spells of feeling extreme loneliness and despair along with an actual pain in my heart. I was actually emotionally beaten down by these two girls, a 23 year old tall athletic guy with absolutely zero drive, mental stability, or confidence. I hardly feel anything when I receive a complement anymore, which I used to feel great about because its a rare thing as a man to be randomly complemented. I cant imagine trying to love someone again."
lonely,Anyone else seen as a joke by others ?,"Anyone else seen as a joke by others ? - 

I'm seen as the weirdo in my class, Wich isn't surprising i guess but it makes me feel even worse tbh 

People when they talk to me sometimes laugh. Many times they say hi, i say hi back and it's funny i guess. When i talk to my parents or family i speak normally but with classmates and strangers my voice comes off in funny way i guess. I talk completely different. 

One time 2 Girls came and one said ""my friend has crush on you"" . I said ""really?"" And her friend started laughing and sad ""hell no wtf "" and then the other girl said ""we where joking"". Then they walked away laughing.

Like why ? Why ? Why come to me out of nowhere just to make this stupid joke?

And last year , one girl (who i thought we where Friends before) told others she invited me to the Halloween party.

So some classmates asked me if I'm coming to it.

Well.. i wasn't invited. I told them ""i haven't received a invite"".

And they Told me to check Snapchat and see if there's some invite.

I sit infornt of this girl in Spanish class, days pass by and she doesn't Even mention this to me and Halloween is over.

She told others she invited me for some reason but didn't invite me ? 

Is it like trey think I'm the weirdo and inviting me makes them look good or what ?? This happend last Halloween.

Well people back in 5-6th grade also loved making fun of my pen eraser collection. They thought it was funny i had almost 100 hundred of pen erasers. 

And then one guy who usually bullies me just opened my Locker / box (we didn't have keys) and just clipped all my erasers.

He ruined them all and of course it was seen funny.

There was a specific pen Sharpner i loved also  ,and 2 people who used to bully me also just destroyed it. And they laughed. I hit the guy who destroyed it tho and his face got red that day... This happened in 5th grade tho .

People always laughed at me but i never realized it was at me i thought i was funny back in 5-6 the grade. 

But i have stopped doing this. I no longer really interact with other classmates that much. Then why do people still see me as joke ?

I used to be really annoying looking back and obnoxious. But i no longer am since I don't interact that much with others. But I'm still seen years later as a joke .Even tho i literally do nothing. 

For some reason many classmates like to tell me ""remember when X used to bully you"" or ""remember when you and X fighted?""

I don't get why the fuck they would say something like this. Like to they think it's funny when people fight or get bullied? 

It's not just one classmate who does this a lot of them do this .

I'm just seen as a complete joke , and i don't know what to really do."
lonely,I’m finally accepting my fate…,"I’m finally accepting my fate… - Well, y’all… Monday will be the one year anniversary of me moving out and separating from my soon to be ex wife. 
Over the last year I’ve come to realize a few things. I’m starting to understand that she was right. I’m not good enough. Every day when I wake up is a reminder of that fact. I‘ve been on multiple dating sites with almost no success. This has made me realize that I’m definitely not boyfriend material; much less husband material. The only ones that show any interest in me whatsoever are scammers. A lot of women say that they want a guy with a sense of humor. But I have yet to meet one who is for real. Those two factors show me that nobody is going to love me for me. And they sure wouldn’t want anything to do with a fifty something who is on his second divorce, doesn’t make a lot of money and isn’t attractive. Or someone who is too weird, or too annoying.
For me, it all boils down to this. I’m starting to realize that I’m destined to be alone for the rest of my life. Two of my four kids hate me; and my two youngest don’t know enough to hate me yet. So there’s a better than good chance that I’ll die alone. And I’ve already told God that if it is His will for me to be alone for the rest of my life, then I will accept that as my fate."

I now realize i fucked up breaking up with her a while back because now i feel like im going to be alone forever, all my exploit on tinder come up nul even the ones who seem interested and i have good chemistry with, ghost me out of nowhere or start dating others. Ive tried just about every dating app for quite some time, and now everything with covid 19 makes it so much harder to meet people in person. I dont know what im expecting to get out of this rant post, but i guess it helps to vent. TLDR: I think i messed up breaking up with my Ex, i feel like the ship has probably sailed, but i dont know, maybe i should shoot her a text. What do you all think ?"

Our families have been extremely close and every year we go on a trip together. Selene and I have always had a complicated relationship. We are three years apart and have very different personalities, despite this we always remained close and continued to promise to always be there for each other forever like sisters. We even called eachother cousins when we introduced eachother to new people because we practically were. In the past year, things have taken a huge turn. I haven’t seen her in almost a year. She practically disappeared from my familys and my life. She is withdrawn and living in her own little world and her parents are letting it happen. Selene almost controls her mother and her mother won’t say ANYTHING about Selene or where she’s been. I just turned twenty and no happy birthday or word from her. I try not to let it show but I am honestly devastated. Selene always promised she would be there and loved me more than anyone and I felt the same. I feel so broken. No matter how many times I have talked to her about it she still makes no effort. She was the one part of my life I thought I could count on. Now she’s just, gone. Imagine your younger sister just took off and you never heard from her again. I feel alone, scared and angry. There’s nothing anyone can do to help but I wanted to share this if anyone else is going through something similar. Blessings to everyone and be kind to each other."

I'm in great shape workout all the time and I'm a sweet guy according to all of my family members and friends and its not like i don't have a personality because i have a ton of interests and hobbies but i can't seem to attract the right person I mean I'm not the most social person in the world quite the contrary I'm quite introverted tbh but i can socialize when I'm with people I'm comfortable with.

lonely,I’ll never understand how some people can ghost others,"I’ll never understand how some people can ghost others - In my eyes it’s just common decency to let someone know you aren’t interested in them anymore or if they’ve done something that’s put you off them or if you just need space. How can you spend months talking to someone, spending time with them in person, being a part of their life and you being a part of theirs, for them to one day disappear without a word. It hurts, and every time it happens they take a piece of you with them that you never get back and there’s only so many pieces that make up a person. It just makes you feel like you’ve done something wrong, or you’re not good enough to be given a reason why. I get that nobody owes you anything, but I just think it’s selfish and cowardly.

lonely,"""All we want for you is to be happy""","""All we want for you is to be happy"" - This is what my father told me after arguing for half an hour.

I'm 19yo male. I have only one friend, but barely talk with him (or anyone else, aside some uni groups). I don't work (yet, but I'm starting in january), but study, uni is public here so there aren't student loans or anything like that. I barely have reasons to leave the house, unless i need to buy something, or simply go for a walk. Aside from studying i don't do much aside scrolling, and grinding in genshin at night. 

Last sunday, me and my dad argued. My parents wanted me to do something rather than staying at home all of the weekend. Long story ahort i didn't, because i don't have anyone to hang out with .my dad couldn't stand it. He told me thst anyone else from my age was having fun and then there was me, sheltered at home. That i wouldn't even should been at home last night, that i should has been partying. He is a rational guy, but fuck him.

Other parents doesn't let their sons go anywhere so they would get good grades.and then, i get good grades and demand me to go outside? He is a teacher, for fuck sake, how he can come with this?  I explained hin i didn't had friends, that i didn't talked to anyone, that there wasn't anything. Now speaking to him is awkward, and idk what I'm going to do this weekend. 

Seeing my socials everyone always has plans for the weekend, I'm lucky if i have something to read for uni, but once i get done with this term, idk what I'm going to do.  Let alone that will be summer here, so i will not have it easy"

Little background about myself: Male. 21. Live alone with my cat. I’ve been very lonely my whole life if I can be honest but not until the past year when my mom moved out and left me a home have I ever felt this scared and isolated. I have a group of friends I talk to but find it’s becoming harder to just be around them because they all seem very content with their lives, I’m happy for them though. I’ve started writing some romance stories just for my own enjoyment and while it’s nice to put my thoughts into physical text it leaves me feeling empty most times. I’m one of those goofy people that believes in soulmates so I find myself wondering if I’ll ever find mine, which makes me just want to crawl in bed and weep haha. 
Any others feel like me? Or perhaps have equally depressing lives we can discuss?

I wanted to die at that moment because I saw everyone's eyes on me due to how much we stood out

This sucks, it's a small town so us young people tend to at least know a little bit about each other so this feels even more personal, hell I actually saw a lot of people I used to be friends with and I could FEEL the silent judgment. Though that most likely wasn't the case and its probably just in my head but still. I feel dreadful"

lonely,It's lonely at the bottom of the top,"It's lonely at the bottom of the top - I'm a medical student, training to be a doctor in the US. Being a first generation doctor in my family (unlike many of my classmates), I know I should be grateful for being in the position I'm in, to be learning an incredibly amazing trade in medicine. We're told fairly frequently by our professors that 'just by nature of studying medicine, you're now in the company of some of the most talented and brilliant people in the world.'

But god damn do I feel so fucking stupid, every single day.

It's not even a once in a while ""oh, got that question wrong"". ""Oops, didn't know that"". Every day I come home from school feeling dumber than the last. Not that I'm not learning anything, but I feel so incredibly behind every single one of my peers. It feels like they have the brains to be here and I don't. I leave lab every day feeling like I know nothing, like my classmates are going through the dissections actually learning and understanding and getting practice for their surgeon careers and I am just there, zoned out, feeling like I'm wearing a big stupid dunce cap on. Coming in to this I know that I wouldn't be top of my class, but it sure feels like I'm at the bottom. Coming into school I wanted to do surgery, or radiology or any other interesting specialty. But every single specialty that I've really wanted to do has been slowly getting killed as I continue through school. Anatomy has made me hate wanting to be a surgeon. Beyond that, nobody really tells you that it doesn't matter if you get into med school and want to be an orthopedic surgeon, if you don't have top 10-20%ile scores on your boards then you simply. Cannot. Be. An. Orthopedic. Surgeon. Even if it was your dream. Been wanting your whole life to be a neurosurgeon, got into med school, studied your butt off, and applied to be a neurosurgeon? Nope, sorry, don't have enough training spots to take someone with \*your kind of scores\*. Have fun in family medicine, or peds, or whatever else you can get into :) \[this is not to say that there aren't brilliant family med docs or pediatricians out there, it's to say that every single person that is a neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon or ENT or whatever is an absolute savant, a real cream of the cream, top of the top\]. Doesn't help either that I'll be $400,000 in debt by the time I'm done with school.

I know this is going to come off as a whiny post of ""He's finally figured out that you can't have everything"", I know. But it's so fucking exhausting, and lonely, and depressing knowing that what I've wanted to do pretty much my whole life is just not turning out like it meant to be. Have I thought about suicide? Yes. Tried it three times before starting school, told myself I'd never do it again. And I probably will never try again, I couldn't do that to myself. I just simply wish I could cease existing.

Fuck, it's lonely at the top."

This guy is dumb ass rocks. They set him back 1 year cause he couldnt get good enough grades, never even tried. We were close back then, but eventually we grew apart because we had our diferences.

Years later i realize i always want to feel superior to him, i get angry, this guy that is dumb ass hell, spoiled, pampered, literally had a job at his dads place that was ""counting dollar bills"". This mf has mad pussy. Legit, this guys only saving grace is that he uses all of his parents money shamelessly to get pussy. He had around 3 girlfriends at once 1 time. And i get jelous i cant even have 1 girl, let alone 2.

He has lots of friends and goes out very often. In contrast to me, that work and try my best to do well in college, along with doing workout routines.

My problem is that i dont wanna go to the party because i dont wanna see him. He reminds me of my shortcomings and honestly that makes me be very angry at myself.
Should i go? Should i do something else? Am i insane (probably)?

lonely,I find it hard to make fulfilling connections/friendships.,"I find it hard to make fulfilling connections/friendships. - I find it extremely difficult to be able to become genuine friends with others. I can count several people as my acquaintances but I don't see myself being really close to them. In general, gaining that connection with others is something I struggle with. Hanging out with some people is so draining because I feel like I'm being someone I'm not - someone that is just nice and nothing else. 

To be frank, I find it hard to be myself around others. I don't think I'm a super interesting person because I don't relate to others much. I grew up in a strict household so experiencing things has been difficult and thus, I don't really have much to talk about. 

I just feel super lonely having realised this. I only really have 1 or 2 people in my life I'm comfortable with. (which, I acknowledge isn't a bad thing at all) Other than that, I feel so drained hanging around everyone else. They're all lovely people don't get me wrong. I feel so lucky to know them. I just really value having a better connection with others rather than all this small talk I engage in most of the time. Am I doing this whole making friends thing wrong? Maybe I'm just a super introverted individual. Maybe I'm just weird. I don't know. It just feels super lonely sometimes - not having much people to just be comfortable with and be able to talk about myself freely with."

lonely,"My friends always have to leave, and I always have to leave my friends. (21M)","My friends always have to leave, and I always have to leave my friends. (21M) - When I graduated high school, I never realized how lonely life became. I went to a charter school full of aspirational kids who wanted to go off and conquer the world like me, and we got along amazingly. I could not have been happier. Every single day was something fun and special, and we were all there for one another to keep ourselves motivated. But then, we did go off to conquer the world at the universities all around the nation we got accepted to, and we've never been able to get back together since. Exams, work, internships, the pandemic, cost of flights, lack of a place to stay, etc. Eventually, digital communication no longer scratched the social itch for us, and we pulled the plug on life support. 

Ever since, I've had trouble making friends, because anyone who is remotely like me wants to go off and do stuff with their life, which normally entails them leaving forever at the end of whatever thing we're doing together. I gave up on making friends in university once I realized it'd all just happen again when we all leave for our grad schools in separate states. Then, when I'm in grad school, everyone will be chomping at the bit to leave across the country for lucrative jobs once they graduate, leaving me alone again. What's the point of friends if you're always ripped away from them by your or their need to go to a different location for school or work? Is my 20s just supposed to be a blur of transient faces and names I can barely remember, constantly being torn up by my roots and tossed someplace else by economic or academic forces? I want actual, long-lasting IRL connections, but I feel like that'll never happen until I'm finally settled into my career at like 27, and that thought just drives me up the walls.

There was a very friendly cat in the street let me play with her. There was a dog in my sister's house, and she always acts so happy whenever i come over. There was a soy milk store near my school that sells yummy soy milk. There was a bus driver waiting for me when its very late and I almost missed the last bus. There were strangers at the MRT help me pick up the coins I accidentally dropped. There were rainy days and I lay down on the floor, enjoyed my favorite songs.

It feels weird.

It's like , look at them all! Look how they interact with each other and how they all are happy and socialize.

Look how they are friends!

It feels like watching a movie. It's like I'm a ghost. I'm just here observing how others interact and are happy.

I used to be jealous when i heard people laughing and being happy. Now i just feel pathetic... I'm pathetic beyond belief.

Everytime I go there I'm reminded of my loneliness.

I just go to school, go to the lessons, then in the break i go to the toilet, sit there and sometimes i cut myself and sometimes not. I've been trying not to but it makes me feel alive and happy 

I just do that. 

Literally all year. Just go sit in my own specific places isolated from the world. 

I just sometimes go there, wait for the lamp to turn off and sit in the dark.

It's not always sad. I'm sometimes happy too. 

But it's just same cycle. 

No human contact. No friends nothing. I'm tired of this shit. I just want to die already.

It's not even like i can do that Much 

It's not I'm socially anxious, i literally don't know how to socialize it's not I'm worried just, I'm stupid at socializing.

When i tried i was so fucking loud and obnoxious. I used to be sk fucking annoying back in 5-6th grade. 

I tried exercising, i tried eating healthy, i tried good sleep it doesn't work. Exercise makes me feel good Wich is nice, eating healthy maximizes my brain power Wich is also nice. 

But they don't do anything about my ability to socialize. It doesn't affect it at all.

I tried already to die but i was drunk and i  blacked out and just got injured and didn't die. 

It's a joke. It's matter of time before i try again.

I just fucking suck at socializing. Getting drunk or high doesn't even make me better at it. I just suck."

Sometimes I want to reach out to someone or post something on my socials but I feel like projecting my insecurities would only further my loneliness. I started this semester off great, I had a clear vision of what I wanted, I was active an pushing myself to the limit. Now, I feel lost again, questioning everything and feeling like I'm at square one. I hope everyone else out there is doing alright, let's not give up."
lonely,being not wanted at all is better than feeling unwated by someone,"being not wanted at all is better than feeling unwated by someone - the feeling of no one caring about me at all is better to me than being with someone, or people who make me feel unwanted.

lonely,How to deal with rejection from a family member?,"How to deal with rejection from a family member? - Growing up my older brother always rejected me. He is roughly 6 yrs older than me. I understand that because we didn't have the best parents (they were young and mean and they themselves didn't have the best remodels) . He had a lot of pressure to be more mature. He use to do a lot of messed up things to me. Like gang up with my dad's gfs kids and tie me up and blind fold me and put me in a closet while everyone then went to eat breakfast.  I had to have been six or seven.  He'd always do things like that. Always chose others before me. One time he pulled me out of the car by my hair and threw me on the ground because his gf wanted to sit where I was sitting. Despite him doing things like that I always looked up to him. Seeked his approval, etc. 

As adults I feel like I've done a lot to help him. Let him borrow money that he never paid back. There was a few months where he borrowed my car and gave it back in pretty bad conditions.  I know he's had a hard life and at the end of the day he is my only family. Still he has continued to play on my insecurities (I don't feel like it's intentional).  I always figured it's just because of our upbringing. 

He recently married. Is was very intimate.  Mainly just her family because we aren't close to our family and because of covid. The way they talked about my brother was like he was sent from heaven. A knight in shining armor. The wife's brother gave this speech of him always being there for the family in their time of need. They went on and on about how much of amazing family member he is etc. I couldn't help but feel my heart break. Let me say I am so happy for him.  We have very little family and they are so toxic. I am happy he found his place he found a family that loves him. His wife is perfect for him. But my heart hurts because I feel like it must be me. Whats wrong with me? I just always thought he wasn't capable of being better but I know see I wasn't worth it. 

He and my mother(who is dying) are my only family. My biggest fear was that once she's gone(we don't have a great relationship but I have to be with her) that I will be truly alone because he has said he doesn't like her only love her because of responsibility to be there(mind you he does absolutely nothing for her only comes when I can't handle a situation). Now I know for fact when she's gone I will be alone. I mean I already feel alone but I'll take her abuse over actually being by myself. 
How do I get over it? Should I just go ahead and cut him out of my life? Should I try to be a better sister?  At this point things hurt too much. Idk what to do. I just feel so lonely. Idk if this is the right sub for this. Sorry if it's not."

lonely,Just being nice isn't enough,"Just being nice isn't enough - Just being nice isn't enough to make friends, I learned that the hard way. Books and TV shows always tell the story of a protagonist who has people flock to them because they are nice and caring. If you're kind to others, people will like you and you will make lots of friends. The first part is true, people will like you if you are kind to them, but they won't necessarily be your friend. They won't want to hang out with you unless you're actually fun to talk to. 

I think I'm a nice person, or at least I try to be. Doing favors, helping others out, being respectful. I'm a very good listener, and even though I often don't know what to say, I always try to be there for people. As far as I know, people generally have positive feelings towards me. But... I'm not an interesting person. I'm boring to talk to, especially because I don't talk a lot. I'm never the friend you want to hang out with on the weekends, never someone from class you want to talk with outside of school. They'd all rather hang out with someone who they can have fun with. I used to have friends, people who wanted to spend time with me, but now they're all drifting away and want to spend their time with other friends. I wish I was more interesting, so they would stick around longer. I guess my novelty has worn off."

lonely,No one wants to talk to me,No one wants to talk to me - None of my friends ever start conversations or invite me to stuff unless I say something first and its really making me feel isolated
lonely,Denying self the opportunity to connect with others?,"Denying self the opportunity to connect with others? - TLDR fiancé and I (both mid 20s) moved away for jobs and I’ve found it really difficult to make new friendships or to connect with the friends I had before the move. Have often been feeling lonely and envious of fiance who regularly connects with his friends and family. 

Lost touch with many high school friends while in university and also didn’t cultivate any new friendships during. Left home town three years ago for a job, shortly after finishing school, with long term partner to a city where neither of us knew anyone. 

Partner connects regularly (at least 2x a week) with his friends, work friends, and family for game nights. This routine has been in place since we’ve moved away. Been having lots of resentful and envious feelings towards partner and his connections - I really wish I had the same for myself. Maybe 70% of the time, I’m able to entertain myself during his game nights but usually do something independently from him. The other 30%, I feel very lonely which then leads me to distance myself from him. I feel like the only people in my support network (discounting therapist) is my partner and my two close friends since high school; however, I don’t communicate with them anywhere near the amount that my partner does with his network. I’m lucky to FaceTime them once a month and exchange text messages on a monthly basis too. Partner sees otherwise and says that I do have other people but am refusing to connect with them. My partner says he invites me to game nights with his family and friends and that I am more than welcome to join them, that they ask about me. I won’t deny that he invites me, but I feel more like a distractor/outsider the occasions I do listen in - I don’t really join. Also, am just not interested in playing games as they are. Also, even if I wanted to join, I don’t have a computer of my own (I could be using this reason as an excuse but there is honesty to it too). 

At my last job, I’ve come across a handful of people who I could have developed a friendship with but nothing really became concrete. Was friendly with them, even met outside of work a handful of times, but things have since stopped. At current workplace, coworkers are more or less around my age and again, friendly with them, but I can’t call them “friends” and I don’t feel like they could be. 

Have my own issues and struggles that I feel play a factor in all this: anxiety, depression, low self confidence and feelings of low self worth. Trying to process what partner said, that I’m denying self the opportunity to make connections even though they’re available. I feel like that’s not the case but maybe it could be. I want to have connections of my own that are not his friends or family, but I  feel like I don’t know how to connect with others on a deeper level."

lonely,"In college, but I still feel like a kid","In college, but I still feel like a kid - It’s odd how social anxiety works. When you are a kid, people say you are very quiet and mature. Now in college, I feel like I’m treated like a kid. My roommate is a friend from high school, and I noticed that both him and his friend talk to me differently. I can’t really explain it but it’s their tone and also what they talk about. One time I walked with them and my roommate was talking to his friend about this girl he wanted to ask out but he didn’t want me to know about it. This is just one example, but I feel like this happens to me all the time and I can’t really blame them.  and I have never dated or even had a first kiss, never went to a party or drank/smoked, never really did anything of that sort. I know it’s silly for me to want to do these things just for the sake of doing. For some reason I just get this sad feeling every time we are told to be safe over the weekend, or when we talk about avoiding alcohol at parties l, because I know I’m just gonna be alone in my room over the weekend."

lonely,I don’t want to be alone but I never do anything proactive towards making friends,"I don’t want to be alone but I never do anything proactive towards making friends - I just glide through the day, without saying a word to anyone unless necessary. I’m at a university and it’s just so sad for me seeing lots of people together laughing constantly or talking to each other so easily. I think I’m just scared of breaking the barrier and speaking but I also long to be social it’s an odd dynamic. Even if someone starts a conversation with me (a rare occurrence I just simply can’t engage in a fun social manner even though it’s exactly how I want to act. I’m just permanently pessimistic outside my house, for some reason and it just makes me unable to create any fun. I just hate myself for how I have determined my life.  When I hear about socials or meet-ups happening I just think about how awkward it will be and that I’m 4 weeks in and therefore friend groups have already been established and that I will be a permanent outsider.

This might be melodramatic but I believe that loneliness is a form of hell, my inability to express myself just makes my brain hurt


Anyway week 4 of Uni and still no friends, it makes me feel so different to the normal person, like I’m inhuman to same extent. Maybe one day I’ll make a friend.

lonely,Profoundly miserable,"Profoundly miserable - I literally have nobody I’m caught between wanted to overdose on my stash or just drop everything and move somewhere far away. At least then if I do want to end it I’m far enough away so nobody would really be affected if I’m gone. I might be missed by a few but not enough to affect many. I want to set an example of how someone can try so hard to do good and still lose and to care for people like me who are still struggling. Suicide isn’t the answer but I haven’t found a better one, so it’s the closest answer I have."
lonely,Woke up today with that intense longing feeling in my stomach,"Woke up today with that intense longing feeling in my stomach - Don’t know if anyone else ever feels this too, but it’s that kinda pit-like feeling that’s somewhere in between nostalgia, longing, and sadness? Idk but it’s hitting me pretty hard this morning. 

I just kinda woke up and realize I spent all of high school and college trying to make friends, and never really succeeded? Sure, the people I live with like me, and I have acquaintances in my major that will study with me when it’s convenient, but I never really had people to make real, lasting connections and memories with. 

And it’s not for the lack of trying either. I wish there was an alternate dimension where I could ask these people I’ve been trying so hard to please for 4 years what I could have done to make them accept me because I really did try, and I know “they don’t matter if they’re not willing to accept you” or whatever, it’s just hard to contend with that when you’re not accepted by anyone besides those who have to out of necessity. 

Anyways, the tl;dr is that I woke up feeling intensely isolated and sad so I decided to rant about it on the internet. Thanks for reading if you did lol."

I struggle tremendously with social interactions. I don’t know how to carry on a conversation and I don’t know how to not make things weird. It makes me so upset to see friend groups where everyone shares the same nerdy interests, while I’m stuck getting called weird for being into nerdy things. It’s all I’ve wanted in life, but I’m getting too old for those kind of friend groups (22). Yesterday I spent the entire day in my bed watching anime in my dark room, and I’ve spent many other days doing just that. How sad is that? This is so corny but sometimes it feels like fictional characters are my only friends and that’s why I like binge watching stuff so much."

lonely,Just wallowing in self pity,"Just wallowing in self pity - So today I found out the guy I like started seeing someone else.

We've known each other for quite a while so if anything were to happen between us it would've happened a long time ago but it still hurts. And we got a lot closer recently too... But in a way I'm also relieved cause it means I can finally move on. Reality checks never feel great though. Being invisible doesn't feel great.

I feel so unlikeable. Unlovable. Everyone else seems to be jumping from one relationship to another but I'm always alone. I don't even really have friends. I feel like a background character in my own life. Someone who's not even worthy of a storyline. People don't mind me existing but they wouldn't miss me if I was gone either. I feel like everyone else moves forward but I'm always stuck in the same place and people don't even see me when they pass by.

Anyway, my plans for this weekend: eat chocolate, drink wine, cry, repeat.   
Maybe I'll feel better by Monday."

I can't get a job (GP's orders because of my crippling anxiety), I'm still not driving (DVLA not trying to do their jobs properly), and my family while they're close, I'm almost always overshadowed by my three younger siblings.

lonely,Tired of putting in all the effort,"Tired of putting in all the effort -  

Every time i try to make some friends it's always me who puts in all the effort. I have to approach everyone first, i always start conversations in person, i always have to text them, i always have to invite them to hang out. Nobody really does stuff like that for me. And more often than not, every invitation attempt ends with some lame ass ""sorry i'm busy"" excuse last minute, even when previously they enthusiastically agreed. Sometimes it's hard for me to figure out wheter i should believe them or if to take it as a ""sorry not interested"" and move on.

I'm just really sick and tired of this. With every year i just feel even more lonely and humiliated. I also feel like i'm going paranoid from trying to figure out what the latest ""sorry i'm busy"" meant. I'm just really tired of trying, but if i don't i'll just end up rotting inside my house and playing video games all day. I try to pick up new hobbies, join new groups, try to make myself more interesting. Nothing really changes.

I tried to open up about this to a few people. That is my mother and a chick who claimed to be a therapist. My mother told me that i should just put even more effort and ask them out a million times more. Surely they won't be busy eventually. My ""therapist"" started insulting me that i'm selfish and entitled for even so much as asking people to spend their precious time on me and that i'm a whiny bitch for being upset that they don't."

lonely,An unfortunate combo,"An unfortunate combo - It hurts to be a hopeless romantic while dealing with intense loneliness. I (M19) am currently 3 days into my quarantine since I tested positive for the coronavirus and nothing else has made me more lonely and alone than this isolation that has been forced into me. I never felt accepted nor loved by anyone and at this point I'm starting to blame myself and constantly changing, reconstructing, rewiring the way I am just so that I can be more loveable to others. All I want is to be loved the same way I love a person, I want to feel like I'm someone's most prized treasure, I want to be made important. I have never felt that reciprocation. 

Last time I clicked with someone romantically, they broke it off by saying ""You loved me too much."" and that hurt me. It made me feel as if I don't deserve to love nor to be loved. I'm feeling hopeless and I feel like I'd die alone."
lonely,(TW: Abuse) Struggling with being alone and loneliness.,"(TW: Abuse) Struggling with being alone and loneliness. - I don’t have faith in humanity. For the past decade or so, majority of the people I’ve dealt with have either sabotaged, betrayed, defamed/ran a smear campaign against, used/took advantage of, ostracized/excluded/isolated me. 

On one hand I want to have relationships with others (family, friends, acquaintances, romantic partners, etc), but at the same time I don’t. I’m at the point in my life where I now believe everyone is just awful (evil), that the average person is an awful human being. I now believe the only time people are “good” to me and others is for self serving purposes, and not from a genuine place. 

I didn’t think like this before, but the longer I live my life and see people for who they really are, the more I just don’t like people :( I feel really disappointed and hurt. I haven’t done anything wrong to these people, but I think because they see that I am obviously alone and lonely, they can continue doing this without any repercussions/consequences. 

Being alone and lonely places a target on you, because when people know this, they can weaponize it and get away with absolutely anything they do to you. No one cares, and if they do, no one cares enough to punish perpetrators with consequences/repercussions or hold them accountable/responsible. People are more likely to engage and/or be complicit in this, even when they know they’re in the wrong - simply because they would rather be part of the “pack”. People are more likely to gang up on a loner and side with perpetrators in the wrong than to do right to that loner. People are more likely to befriend and be buddies with the perpetrator.

To me, people are like a pack of predatory wolves…and I find it disgusting. The more I see it, the more I dislike people, and the more I give up on the thought of having any sort of relationship. 

I wish I wasn’t lonely and alone - and it’s especially more painful that this was something imposed on me via circumstance. If I knew what was wrong about myself and what I could fix it so I could have any relationship, I would gladly do it. But I can’t even do that - abusive people (who are “normal”, “average” even “good” in the eyes of others) in my life just wanted me to be the designated scapegoat/black sheep. 

Anyone else feel like everyone in their life absolutely failed them. I mean, I’m not just “feeling” lonely - I am alone. I’m actively, deliberately ostracized, excluded, and isolated by others. So this “loneliness” isn’t a feeling, some illusion, etc. It’s intentional. And I don’t think this is something that can easily be fixed or resolved. 

I think/feel like the only way back “in” is accepting my designated role as the scapegoat/black sheep and going on apologizing tours when I haven’t done any wrong - but I don’t want to be mistreated anymore. I don’t want to apologize anymore because those people just weaponize it as admission that I have done something wrong and therefore deserve to be mistreated."

Whether it's irl or online - People seem to come and go for me and I get socially rejected a lot and recently it's been beating me up making me depressed and feel lonely and I fear soon I'ma get a heartbreak from my current partner and I won't have any friends to get me through the sadness I will feel.

lonely,always the one behind the glass,"always the one behind the glass - this is my first post ever (on mobile, sorry for any possible formatting issues), and i’m only doing so because i have nobody that i’m comfortable venting to irl. 

i’m in my first term of uni, and i’m struggling so hard with the loneliness that seems to surround me constantly. i’m friends with my flatmates i suppose, but oftentimes i feel like they’re friends with me only by obligation, and that when we all move out next year, i’ll be left again with nobody. i have extreme social anxiety and am in the process of being diagnosed with autism, and i’ve been blaming my lack of social interactions on these things, but i’ve been trying so so hard in the recent months to reach out to people and so far it’s fruitless. 

i don’t feel like i can connect with anybody, and the thoughts of loneliness permeate my mind every hour of the day. all i could possibly wish for to be happy in life would be a friend that i feel a connection with; one that actually wants to be with me, too.

i have a therapist that has been helping, but it’s been months and while i’m seeing change mentally, it’s just not happening socially. i don’t know what to do. i don’t fit in anywhere, i feel like i’ll lead my whole life as the person behind the glass looking in.

to anyone that reads this, thank you for listening. i hope you have a good day today, please make sure to take care of yourself! know that despite any loneliness you may feel, you are loved, you are appreciated, and even if we don’t know each other, i’m here for you if you need some support!"
lonely,How much can one deal with loneliness,"How much can one deal with loneliness - Maybe I have a good life, and there's really nothing to complain about.

But how long will I hold on to this eternal pursuit of looking for someone who will love me.

I have tried so many times, and each time falls and is disappointed, and comes to the conclusion that I may not deserve to know what love is.

Maybe I'm young, and I have time, but loneliness affects me, and I get depressed and afraid I'll not be able to get out of the situation I'm getting into...

lonely,I'm convinced that nobody wants me around.,"I'm convinced that nobody wants me around. - 19M and in uni. This semester we got divided into groups of people in a class and I have made attempts to get out of my shell and socialize more. Small talks, convos on things I have in common with others in my year group, saying hi, and all that. I'm a shy person but I'm doing my best to change. 

On Tuesday I got paired up with a girl in my group for a project, so I did my part hoping we can discuss it tomorrow. The next day she messages me saying she already started it with someone else. So I'm stuck with doing it alone for next week.  (I honestly don't know if it's because she felt uncomfortable with me or some other reason but I couldn't stop thinking about It. It made me question myself like there's something wrong with me), and about a week ago I found out the majority of my group casually go out and have fun (to the movies, going out to eat, and even have a separate group chat for stuff like that.) and study in the library with each other sometimes. I know I'm not entitled to just go up and join them without an invite or anything but a lot of times it's just painful sitting around alone doing nothing on the weekends. I just want to be included in something, anything really.

sorry for the rant."

lonely,El fin de una vida,"El fin de una vida - Primeramente quería escribir esto para descargarme emocionalmente ya que nunca me ha pasado algo parecido.
La historia comienza en que conocí a alguien en un momento muy random en mi vida, a esa persona la conocí por Facebook y extrañamente me enamore y intenté mucho (alrededor de 6 meses)por qué pasara y gracias a Dios se dió, la historia de noviazgo dura 6 meses hasta el suceso.
En el mes 5 pasa unos de los acontecimientos que más me cuestionó, y claramente me arrepiento, y es hablar con otra persona, esta relación yo en este momento claramente tenía novia, la cuál teníamos una relación envidiable, y con muchísimo futuro, pero no sé el porque esto paso.

Esta persona y yo comenzamos a hablar por un mes en Instagram, al comienzo era de chorra que hablábamos, pero luego el asunto se fue poniendo bastante intenso.
Cuestión en que intercambiamos nuds, y salgo aclamando su cuerpo 

A finales de este mes a mi me da el COVID y permanezco en aislamiento.

En este momento recapacitó y me doy atras con esto y lo dejamos en nada.

En todo el momento del aislamiento en lo único que pensaba era en estar con mi novia, y la extrema falta que me hacía, y hablábamos de cuando nos volviéramos a ver, paso todo y gracias a Dios me encuentro bien, nos llegamos a ver a los pocos días. En estos momento quise hablarle de lo sucedido, pero egoístamente quise mejor reservarmelo, y seguir con mi vida, cuando más bien estaba por comenzar los últimos días de lo que era mi estabilidad emocional.

A los 15 días de mi recuperación, una persona X contacta a mi novia, y la cita a verse en un centro comercial, con el mensaje de tu novio te estuvo engañando.
Sin yo saber nada de esto ella accede y claramente esa persona confesó todo.

A los pocos momentos yo la voy a traer al centro comercial, pero yo muy en el fondo sabía que algo estaba raro, ya que la veía muy inquieta y hablándome con que quería traer sus cosas de mi casa (ella en momentos se quedaba a dormir en mi casa).
Con lo que me resulta raro, ese mismo día yo me iba de viaje a otro país, con lo hablo con ella por teléfono antes de irme y claramente con todo el cariño del mundo le decía lo que sentía por ella.

Pero antes de yo irme, ella me dice que quiere hablar conmigo un momento, a lo que respondo ""no me lo puede decir luego amor"", con lo que ella insistió.
Con que lo que proclamó ""Terminamos, se que me estás engañando, no tengo por qué tener a alguien en mi vida que me ve la cara de babosa, con solo decirte amor me da asco"" recalco que mi novia, es una persona de las cuales, las oportunidades se aprovechan y no se presentan de nuevo del buen sentido. 
Me voy a mi viaje por chequeos personales, y en todo el viaje me sentí muy pero muy mal, (algo que yo nunca había sentido, y he tenido relaciones anteriores, pero está me ha marcado tanto que es la fecha y no dejo de tener un vacío.) El viaje fue arduo y claramente trate de no pensar en eso.

Aclaro que en su momento no me dió explicaciones y únicamente tomo la decisión.

El día en que regreso a mi país, solo tomo una ducha y me voy directamente a su casa, a hablar que había pasado, de forma ruda, decepcionada y triste me dice "" terminamos por el simple hecho en que se que me estas engañando con otra persona por mensajes, me enseñaron las cosas asquerosas que hablabas con esa persona y creeme que ahorita con solo verte me da decepción"" (el trato mío con ella a como muchos hombres en esta vida, fue única y siempre poniéndola de razón número uno, pero en este caso falle por completo y tropecé en la piedra más pequeña que había, y no saben que ardor en el corazón me hace sentir cada que hablo de esto) con lo que le respondo con la verdad y le digo ""antes que terminemos quisiera que habláramos un poco más"" a lo que me responde ""Ya te termine, te queda claro eso"", con lo que esa frase me destruye por completo y me destroza por completo el corazón.

Más adelante trate de todas las formas posibles disculparme y tratar de solucionar las cosas con lo que eso implique dar tiempo a la relación, ya que personalmente, mi felicidad , sentimientos de seguridad y tranquilidad era completamente todo esta persona. 
Pero claramente nada de eso funcionó, posteriormente como buen hombre lo digo, me suelto a llorar por la gran cantidad de sentimientos reunidos, (y eso que no soy mucho de llorar y por lo general solo sigo adelante) en mi sentimiento sollozante le decía ""tenes toda la razón"" ""discúlpame"", repetidas veces, una vez calmo le confieso todo el sentimiento verdadero hacia a ella.

Con lo que ella responde ""te agradezco absolutamente todo, y reglamente yo también te amo, pero vos mejor que nadie sabias cómo soy, y aún así buscaste la forma de decepciónarme"".
Con lo que lo único que me quedo fue ir a buscar al coche la bolsa con sus cosas (antes de partir a su casa guarde sus cosas, por qué realmente sabía que ella no era así, y sabía que era una decision tomada) y se las entregó a ella.

Con lo que ella me entrega mis cosas, posteriormente paso a guardar las cosas y tratar de hacer el mayor esfuerzo por tratar de reparar el daño y tan siquiera hayar una forma para solucionarlo. Pero todo quedó en un beso de despedida 
Actualmente ella hará un viaje a EEUU, y me da tanto dolor saber que se vaya con las cosas en este estado. 

Es el momento y cuando estoy en la uni con costo me concentro, me siento muy mal, me duele el pecho, las ganas de llorar nacen de la nada, cada que entró al coche sollozo. 

Cómo pregunta personal digo ¿Habrá gente que apesar de estos problemas siguen adelante? Y si es así ¿Cómo sigue funcionando la relación? Por que personalmente se lo que es la desconfianza y es una enfermedad terrible 

De igual manera no hay momento que no desee de forma egoísta, querer que esté aquí conmigo y hablarle de todo y decirle completamente todo lo que siento hasta aburrirla desearía que se quedara conmigo apesar de todo 

Pero claramente se que a ella le dolería no solo en lo personal, si no también el dolor social al tratar de reparar esta situación

Esta es mi historia un muchacho con lo que andaba en la vida vagando y saliendo de fiesta que un día se enamoro de verdad, y talvez pecados anteriores pasaron factura. 

Y ahora siento realmente todo los que la gente con problemas como estos, amigos míos, gente de Facebook hasta mis propios padres, sienten o sintieron 

Mi madre días después me llama y entre tanto sentimiento encontrado ella me pregunta por mi novia con lo que no me pude contener y de forma sollozante le conté lo sucedido, y ella aparte de un reprendimiento, me da una lección de vida ""Si alguien ama de verdad y desea el seguimiento de la relación, busca siempre una forma de solucionarlo, por qué las heridas sanan, aunque dejen cicatrices, pero son lecciones de vida, de uno depende si ser feliz y aprender más con ese alguien o retirarse y aprender algo nuevo con alguien más"" 

Lastimosamente la vida actúa de forma dura y dolorosa, pero apesar de todo me ayudó a aprender, me alegra saber que la persona que más amo, le hayan dicho la verdad para ahorrarse una vida con una persona tan basura como yo, que con el dolor del alma, le desea un grandioso futuro, con amor propio, externo y si ella lo decide, encontrarse con alguien que además que la ame más que yo, que la respete en todos los sentidos, ya que verla sonreír, seguro es lo que hace que el sol brille y haga tanto calor acá donde vivo haha.

Si a ti te ha pasado, ¿aprendiste de la anécdota?, De que forma restablecerias tu estabilidad emocional?, ¿Sería buena idea hablar de esto con alguien más o autofunarme en mis redes sociales?, ¿Sería de mucha ayuda escuchar a más gente que han pasado por el engaño para así entender más a mi ""ex-novia"" y hacerme ver más profundo el sentimiento?

Si has leído todo esto te lo agradezco de corazón, y si no, igual necesitaba desahogarme de alguna manera, por qué realmente no aguanto más, se que hay problemas más importantes, pero es muy dificil esto, solo espero salir pronto y dar el paso...."

This is an update in regards to my post in r/relationships about the GIANT shopping center cashier who happened to be a huge crush of mine dating back to the 9th grade. This is NOT about the girl in my AITA post, that girl is completely different. Background is on my profile for those who care. So basically I went to the GIANT, saw her working the cash register like she did last time, and decided to make my move. I entered into her lane (giggity) without anything in my hand, a stupid fucking mistake I made cause I was so nervous and just wanted to get a closer look at her. Anyways, there was a guy in front of me with a bunch of bullshit. As she was ringing up his items, she said to me “do you have anything to buy sir?” And I fucking froze. I knew it, I goddamn fucking knew that walking up there empty handed was fucking stupid. I just grabbed a bunch of gum, candy, drinks and shit until she didn’t look so pissed. I was up, she was ringing my shit up, and all the rolls of gum  had a hard time rolling up the conveyor belt because they’re cylindrical. She said to me “next time just use the self checkout please” and that’s when I snapped.  

 I took the rolls of gum that weren’t rolling up, and I furiously ran them over the barcode scanner for her since doing her job as a fucking GIANT shopping center cashier was akin to being the President of a third world country. Once I had all my items in a bag, I threw her several dollar bills (trust me it covered it) and grabbed my stuff. I ran outside, against the protest of many onlookers and staff members who were concerned by my behavior or some bullshit. I went outside, and threw all my shit at the wall, which made a huge glassy mess. I got in my car and peeled off, got some cans of dip at 7/11, and tried to lay low in my house. I haven’t been back since, and I don’t plan on fucking returning. Somehow and someway, this always happens; the very notion of me engaging in conversation with a woman is enough to make them vitriolically angry at me, while simultaneously pulling the victim card when I try to defend myself and fight back against their injustices. I guess that’s just another brick in the wall, eh? Another girl that I invested my entire heart into, another girl who said Hi to me a few times which led to me imaging our entire lives together, happily married and living in a huge house with multiple beautiful children. Crushed, because I cannot seem to relate to anyone in any meaningful way. Such is life, onto the next flame within a few months I suppose, oh my brothers!"
lonely,Im emotionally exhausted,"Im emotionally exhausted - Im in a serious relationship with a guy who im pretty convinced that im going to marry. He is amazing, self-aware, funny, smart, wild, everything that i can ask for he gives me.

But he has dealt with depression in the past and still struggles to this day with a lot of insecurities and relational wounds.

I myself had gone through a lot, i understand where hes coming from. I was there exactly where he is right now and i feel like self-esteem wise, i got myself to a healthier relationship with myself. Which is not really the case for him yet.

I want to help him. I want to be there for him, support him when he feels his worse. And it was easy at the begining.

But now, its getting more and more difficult for me to do as well as i used to. And to be honest, i'm starting to feel emotionally exhausted. I know that because i get annoyed and irritated easily whenever i sense that he needs my attention, i can hear in my tone when i talk to him that im annoyed and he notices. 

I feel bad for feeling that way. But i dont think that i can handle this for much longer, its getting really tough. He is in therapy now because i recommended him to go, not only for him but for me too, for us as a couple.

Idk, right now i need to hear from people who are in a similair situation than, how do you feel? I think i need validation that im  not the only one who feels that way, i feel like i should be stronger, more patient but i dont seem to be able to anymore."

When I find a movie, book or game that I love, I really allow myself to immerse into that world. It's almost as if at times, I'm standing next to the main characters listening to them talk. Or walking beside them feeling and hearing snow crunch under my boots.. They become my comrades and friends and I journey with them.
This also means when that book, movie or game ends I feel intense heartache. I yearn for true adventure in my life, not the day to day grind that we have to adhere to. 

Some games and movies I've fallen in love with have been:
The Last of Us 1 &amp; 2
The Walking Dead
Game of Thrones
Stranger Things
Locke and Key
Red Dead Redemption 2
Tron &amp; Tron Legacy
Elder Scrolls series

I am incredibly lonely, mostly and I'm aware this is massively my own fault and issue.

Over the last 5 years I've gained an unnatural amount of weight that I haven't been able to shift (thanks to many unchecked medical issues and my own lack of care), became a raging alcoholic to the point that seeing certain posts on r/alcoholism makes me laugh myself to sleep, somehow become so unfit I cannot WALK for 10 minutes without being reduced into a dripping ball of disgusting sweat and moved to a new city in a desperate attempt to start fresh. Which was an awful idea, obviously, being too slumped by health to even integrate or attempt to meet/try new things with new people.

I don't even know where to begin with myself now, I can't lose weight without quitting the substance abuse, I can't handle daily stress of my studies/work without the nightly release of it, I can't quit the substance abuse without medical care which I don't have the financial ability to stop working for.

lonely,"I wasn’t lonely before, but I have nobody now.","I wasn’t lonely before, but I have nobody now. - I’m a freshman in college, and I’ve recently turned away from drinking and partying and casual sex because of a lot of different factors in my life right now. I’m too far away to see friends I had in high school, and I’m starting to realize now I don’t think many of them were true friends to begin with. I have trouble doing small amounts of work and find myself in bed most of the day for the past two months or so. I’ve never been lonely before but I think that might be what’s wrong. 

My roommate is almost never here, always at a party or sleeping over with his girlfriend, so I usually speak to another person once or twice per week, aside from trying my best to make casual conversation with people in the cafeteria when I can. 

It’s hard because almost every time I talk to someone they always ask “what frat are you in?” Or something like that and as soon as I say I’m not in one they literally stop talking to me. Or like a girl from one of my classes had a bunch of people over to study one day (highlight of my week) and at the end they broke out alc and as soon as I said I didn’t want any they basically stopped talking to me.

I don’t know how I can get people to like me if I don’t like hedonistic pleasures. I’m not like mean about it I want people to have fun and drink and fuck if they want to, I just don’t because of what I’ve recently been through with a few personal things. And that makes me weird and they don’t like me because of that. 

I really try but everyone seems to just write me off. I’m not ugly at all, I’m pretty attractive and I was popular in highschool so my personality can’t be that awful, I just don’t understand why I can’t connect with anyone, they’re all like already locked in to their groups and all only think partying is fun. 

My grandfather is the only person who tries at all to keep contact with me, and I shared a little with him and he told me I sounded suicidal and needed to see a doctor. I’m not suicidal and I don’t think I’m depressed I just can’t get out of bed because it just feels silly to try to talk to people. It’s like I could say one or two of the right things and instantly have friends, like everyone is just pre programmed to only like specific things in a person. Does anyone have any advice? I’m scared of this continuing but I don’t know how to start fixing it. Can I be happy alone?"

lonely,Feeling alone with wife and daughter,"Feeling alone with wife and daughter - For some weird reason, my wife seems to be like a roommate more than a wife. I'm being ignored and feel like I'm being wished away. My daughter shows love but keeps her distance when I get home as the second I see my wife I get flustered. No hello, no how was your day, no more cooked meals. I work usually 10-14hr days 6 day work week, even through the beginning of Covid. When I leave for out of town work I'm ""abandoning"", when I stay in town, im ""in the way"". Smh. I used to have really bad temper which I have managed to control, now it seemed as though its creeping back up, have no idea wtf. I feel like just digging a hole in the backyard and go to sleep in it. Pretty sure I won't be noticed gone.. Oh well, that's my piece for today"

I also realized that social media probably won’t help me either since I’m gonna see literally everyone I know at parties.

lonely,I will be alone forever,"I will be alone forever - 24F. I’ve never been in a relationship. I’ve had sex one time in my life snd it was really embarrassing and I don’t even really remember it. That was 7 years ago. I went to a high achieving high school where everyone went to top tier colleges. I went to an expensive liberal arts school for 2 years and then dropped out because I was depressed and moved back home with my parents. I got a boring office job but I was only making $40 in a HCOL area and I grew up upper middle class so I have to go back to school to maintain my lifestyle. I’m back in school now. It’s a good school but everyone is either much older or younger than me. I’m not unattractive by the way. 5 foot four 113lbs 30G boobs 36-25-36 measurements. Average face, can be above average with makeup. I had a few boys interested in me in middle and high school. I had one high school “boyfriend” for like 2 months. We kissed maybe 3 times? Yeah, I’ll never kiss anyone else in my life. Its depressing but I need to come to terms with it. I’m coming off really stupid in this rant. I’m actually very intelligent but I’m high which is the only reason I’m typing this. I forgot to mention ai have many mental health disprders (lik, dug I’m typing a screed no one will read on a depression forum for fellow losers on reddit.com, of corse i have mental issues. Typical depression, anxiety, ocd, adhd. But also have a tic disorder which is my number one issue why no one will love me. It is pretty mild and I can cover it up for hours in public. But once someone sees me get anxious at home and clearing my throat and grunting repeatedly they could never love me. Its really sad too bevause I want to be a mother so bad i would be a great mother. I have a one year old dog and she is the only reason im still on this earth. so this is probably how my life is going to go: i’ll finish my degree and get a half devent job but not one that will pay enough to maintain my upper middle class upbringing. i will eventually move out of my parentshouse and into a sudio apartment once i can afford to. maybe age 28 or 30. by then nonone can come back from basically being a virgin and having never been in a relationship. Once my dad dies I will be able to sell his house and put a down payment on my own. i also have several wealthy relatives who are old and might leave me money but indint know if it will be like $100000 or $1 mil or $10mil. I know im very lucky. but who knows maybe they will give it all to chartiy. ill be an aunt to my brothers kids. he is normal and will settle down and have kids. yeah i dont know what will happen other than that. but i know i will never hold someones hand, bever  kiss someone, no one will ever fuck me or make love to me or make me come. i’ll never have that person i can rely on and tell everything to . ill never experience raising children with someone or growing old together. i dont know if ill ever have a friend agaij either. my best friend of 11 years ghosted me 4 months ago. we grew up together and went to college together and were roomates and she just decided to stop talking to me one day. i tried texting her back and she replied hut then never again. i have no idea what i did. we share a lot of the same mental heslthb issues but she has alwya managed to find love and a biyfriend. i was going to say at keast ill walasy shave my sogs love but dogs die and my seeet baby wewill not be here one day. i guess ill just keepi getting new ones and hopefully they will love me as unconditionally as my current babay. wow i look like a fucking idiot typing buttyoes for so long that my phone is flitching and im weiting like 4 sentences abreadZ ne way peace and live to everyone."

Which I usually respond to with ""It's good"" or ""I'm ok"" but the last like 10 times it's not that way and finally I got asked by my mom ""how's it going?"" I responded with ""well I have no friends, my tooth chipped,my $200 controller broke 8 months into it's lifetime, and my dog is dead "" and my parents simple small town people so it's always ""well God has a plan"" or "" its just a part of growing up"". All my life is everyday is wake up- slave away at some job that I don't get paid enough for- come home and shower- maybe muster up some energy to play a game- and then bedtime. I feel like less and less of my old self every day. I don't want to lose who I was and still want to be. I used to be so kind and helpful and just loved all people. Now Im just quiet and hate the general public. I don't know how to keep going on. I don't know how to do social stuff anymore. I just feel so far gone."
lonely,I hate tripping out in my head sometimes.,"I hate tripping out in my head sometimes. - Before psychosis, I was a drunk lol. I would go out drink with friends smoke weed typical teenage shit. Then I hit a ballon of nos and it led to my downfall, I started developing psychotic features. It has led me to psychosis and now I am winning pretty good. 

But what trips me out is the past. And the present. In the past I moved a lot faster. A girl always come sto my head when I think about this. We where on the run and messing around. We never did it tho. Or I never got to 3rd base. But she matched my energy.

Now im slow. Frozen kind of. And it freaks me the fuck out. But ive learned to live with it. 

I want to move faster like before. But that causes psychosis again. If I move slowly I just trip out. I need a middle ground and find a way to really control my stress. 

I come here to lonely because I feel like Incan share this shit here"

I feel a bit mad, cause we were so happy and excited and now shes going without me and I'm staying home with the dress I bought infront of me, taunting me about how I always have bad luck. I want to fucking cry, we haven't hung out in so long cause shes been hanging out with her other friends and that would be the night we'd finally see eachother outside of school.

I guess I should just buy a box of chocolate and gourge on it on halloween night?"

lonely,This is pretty lonely........,"This is pretty lonely........ - I've been rejected 9 times (though out mid school and highschool) in different ways so I have been so scared and experience stuff I wish I hadn't, which causes my to have feelings for a girl but I never make a move because of what happened. Its like I can't make a move or even start a conversation about anything. Don't get me wrong I'm not that attractive I get that, but that's not a concern to me."
lonely,Why?,"Why? - I’ve been feeling really low. I wake up experience the same thing everyday. I wake up tired. I shower early, to try and wake up, I still feel tired throughout the day. I am an observer. I see people talk. I see people laugh and smile. I see people share emotions. I see people tell jokes and offend each other. I see people get filled with anger. I see people cry tears of joy. I see everyone. But no one sees me. I listen to music almost all day because I don’t have anyone to talk to. I don’t like talking to people, because it seems like I annoy them. I go throughout my day not trying to compare myself to others but it seems impossible because I live in a nice area but I don’t have the same great life qualities as the people around me. I feel like I’m different than the others. I don’t seem to be important. I don’t have motivation for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I don’t have motivation for education. I’ve always been the chubby kid, the poor kid, the outcast. I struggle to socialize sometimes. I fucking hate it. I feel trapped. I can never go to sleep. I always just lay in bed and stair at each fan blade spin for what feels like forever. I feel lost. Everyday I lose touch with myself. I just feel like I’m here for no reason. I feel like I don’t have a purpose. I shouldn’t even be here in the first place. My parents had me as an accident. Sometimes I think about what am I really doing? Why should I be alive? Why don’t I just run away? I just feel like my soul doesn’t belong in this body. I want help but I don’t know how to ask. The thing that helps me feel normal is smoking weed, I don’t want my emotions to depend on that though. I don’t know man."

It’s like a punishment almost. Everyday, it’s like living through hell for me and I’ve been frustrated about it. 

The last time I cried was months ago and ever since, I haven’t shed a single tear, but today, out of anger and jealousy, I broke down for the first time ever since the school year started.

I didn't even react, just kept sobbing as I slammed on the brakes. I'm so fucking miserable.  

I've done maybe 1 hour's worth of work in the past 4 days (32 hours). I usually play 2-3 hours of games a day over the work-week, I've played maybe that amount total in the past week. Rest of my time spent on YouTube watching ASMR and girlfriend roleplays to help cope with the insane loneliness and hopelessness that makes my chest feel like a dagger has been run through it.  

I can't take any more of this shit. When the weekend hits, I'm fucking done. Drive back to that bridge I was at 6 months ago and finally fucking jump. Nothing fucking matters anymore. I don't care about anything anymore. I just want it to fucking end already."

She is also on the spectrum and we met up a couple of nights ago and had a great time, ended up sleeping together and it was just fantastic. 

Then after she left I started thinking back to all of the awkward things I said or all of the things I might have misinterpreted. I messaged her and sort of apologised and then overshared with how anxious I was about it and how much I like her. She said it was okay and she really liked me but she wasn't really looking for a committed relationship at the moment (when we were chatting before meeting she made it sound very much like she wanted to be in a relationship with me). Now she's gone silent and I just . . . I dunno, if she wanted a FWB situation I'd be into that (she mentioned previous FWBs multiple times). I just want some kind of human connection again. It has been so long and the other night felt so good. But I messed it up and having had that small taste makes me feel so much worse than I was before chatting to her. At least before chatting to her I forgot what it was like to have actual feelings for someone, now I'm back to feeling like a failure.

I mostly spend my day working/taking hot showers/re-watching sitcoms/sleeping and I just got rid of some social media apps. I got sucked into a lot of influencer accounts through the Instagram discover page and every time I look at them it makes me feel really terrible about myself. I really don’t like this influencer culture and I feel like I don’t belong in this society for not enjoying social media the way everyone else seems to. It’s not jealousy, it’s more like I just don’t see value in supporting people who flaunt their lives and monetize off of it by promoting random products. All these people are starting to morph into the same thing, they all look and act the same way and even promote the same brands. I feel more isolated than ever for not participating in this follower/influencer culture. Can anyone share their thoughts? I would love to learn something new or hear someone else’s opinion on it, even if you disagree. If you feel the same way as me, it would also be nice to know I’m not alone in this."
lonely,Tired of missing him. Losing myself…,"Tired of missing him. Losing myself… - So I’ve been diagnosed with depression anxiety codependency add/adhd and ocd. I don’t have a diagnosed personality disorder but the symptoms of what I do have basically look similar. I’m on psych meds, I take them but mostly I use street drugs to cope. Uppers are my jam. Because of my addiction I’ve been in nothing but dysfunctional abusive relationships. I don’t blame my ex’s even though a majority of them weren’t very nice to me. I blame myself for my shitty choices. 

I had 2 years sober 6 months ago and then I cut off my family and left home to move closer to some of the less volatile addicts I know. Push came to shove and I started getting high again. Why? Because I’m lonely. I don’t have a partner. Drama with my ex-fiancé and lies his friends told about me ruined my  relieved me of damn near all my friends. I don’t have social life. I don’t have any hobbies. I don’t have any desire to do anything but get high and disassociate from my world right now. There’s nothing keeping me alive but God. 

I attempted suicide at the beginning of this month and almost succeeded. I came so close! I had it all planned but I can’t even do that right. For some reason not dying made me just accept that I’m alive. So I won’t try again for a while. But I’ll probably try again. I wish I wasn’t so codependent. Then maybe o could find my own reasons for living but that’s hasn’t happened. 

I’m seeking therapy but connecting with a therapist has been difficult. I don’t wanna get committed so I’m not honest with them with nullifies the potential for therapy to be helpful. Annoyingly true. But, I don’t expect anyone to care or want them to help me. If they try I’ll just end up pushing them away or doing something selfish to disappoint them. People online tell me that I’m nothing but a piece of shit. They buy into whatever crazy shit has been said about me because of my crazy hacker stalker ex. I honestly don’t care anymore. I’m too tired. I just wanted to get that out.  Please don’t reply."

No friends, no calls, no texts, no nothing. Not even my family likes me. I recently stopped playing online games since I realized playing with randoms just makes me feel even more pathetic. There's no funnt conversations while playing, no ""hey, wanna crack a cold one tomorrow?"" No, just... indifference. 

Got scammed by my employer recently. Lost my job. Who can I trust? Nobody. 
Tried to get a tattoo today, the guy raised the price by a lot when we had a deal already. Couldn't afford it cause I'm broke. 

Tried dating apps. Nobody likes me. Not even when I lower my standards. 

What's the point of being fit and having an interesting hobbie? I know, I did it for myself, I should be happy by myself. But... it'd be nice to feel appreciated for once. Just once. 
I get ghosted all the time. And I don't blame them. I've been lonely for so long, I no longer know how to keep a conversation alive. Also being short sucks, nobody likes short guys.

Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real 🌟), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"
lonely,The void created through chasing a dream.,"The void created through chasing a dream. - Hello, I haven't really done anything like this before so I will apologize now for bad formatting.

I would like to hear from people who have worn a mask for so long that they truthfully can't tell which version of themselves is the real one.

I (24M) have been doing the back and forth dance with the depression monster for the majority of my life. I have a loving mother, a wise father, and a little brother who looks at me like I am Iron Man. I have 2 dogs and a cat, but not really anyone that I would say can be classified as a ""friend"" and I haven't in a few years. 

I have been incredibly fortunate in my lifetime in more ways than just a few. I love my family and my pets, I have a car, a house, and a good job. However, I recently realized that as much as I try to care and as much as I am able to fake it around loved ones, I truly don't give a damn. But I am completely lost as to which emotion is the real me and which emotion is the depression monster... I can't remember if I am a happy bubbly person that fights with depression 24/7 or if I am a hollow shell of depression that pretends to be happy and bubbly for the sake of the people that hurt when they see me hurt.

My question is for anyone that has asked themselves this question (winning or losing the fight). How do you know which of your faces is the real one? Especially if you forgot one was a mask all together.

Thank you to anyone that read all of this, I really hope I hear from you. And I will apologize again for the terrible format/grammar"
lonely,I'm 23 and I don't know how to get over the fact that I've never had a relationship,"I'm 23 and I don't know how to get over the fact that I've never had a relationship - I've never had a relationship before and by the looks of it it'll probably stay that way for the rest of my life.
Everyone I used to know has somebody or is married with kids. I really want that, I honestly do. I've always wanted to be a mom and I still do but with the way my life is going, I'll probably never experience that.
I hate that I'm so unattractive, I've never been complemented by a guy before. Everyone around me complains about guys cat calling them but I secretly want that. I'm so damn desperate that if a guy harassed me on the street it make my day.
I'm so desperate for attention it's pathetic."

Some days, I feel like I could be a good, loving, supporting boyfriend/husband.

Most days, I think it’s probably for the best I’m alone and will probably always be alone. I feel like my body and my mind are just too messed up. So, I think I’d end up being a bad partner in a relationship because I’d feel like too much of a burden. So, I just avoid relationships because I don’t feel like I could live being a burden on someone."
lonely,If this post gives you any warmth,"If this post gives you any warmth - People are really missing out on having you in their life.

The love you give out into the world is the reason why things are still a little bright. You don't have to do anything to make me believe that you are amazing, and it will still be fun around you if you and I had nothing to say or do together. But I would still love to hear \*you\* tell me about something that you love. The way your eyes must sparkle when you talk about that \*thing\* you like, it makes me so hopeful. There is so much to see in you, to experience with you. You deserve to be loved and appreciated. And I wish you all the strength in life. I love you, and if we ever met I would love to know you."
lonely,I wish I could hang out with my favorite characters,"I wish I could hang out with my favorite characters - I have a hard time making friends. I've always been pretty reserved since I was a kid. I usually just stand there and wait for someone to talk to me. That doesn't work so much as I get older. Being called the quiet or shy one at school and other settings really takes a toll on your self esteem. I wish I could hang out with some of my favorite characters in real life. When I'm not doing anything, I like to imagine hanging out with Kirby, Sailor Moon, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Ralsei, Princess Peach, and Fluttershy. We would hang out at my house and play games and watch movies. Sometimes we would eat out at a restaurant (like Olive Garden) or go to the movies. Sometimes we just sit at the park and enjoy the fresh air. Man, I wish it wasn't just a dream. Does anyone else feels this way?"
lonely,Broken and hopeless…finding it so hard to function. I need help and communication.,"Broken and hopeless…finding it so hard to function. I need help and communication. - I’m slowly giving up on life. I got broken up with 3/4 months ago. Im really trying to get over it…because I was treated badly and I’m sick of feeling unhappy. I don’t want to miss this person anymore. Everyday I miss him and also get reminded of how I stayed in that emotionally abusive relationship. It’s tiring. My family and friends are not available to me in my times of need and I don’t think it’s from a bad space…they’re just unavailable. 

I feel so alone and trapped in a bad phase that I really don’t see an exit from. Convinced I’m going to be unhappy/single/ around unavailable people. I’m feeling so mentally exhausted and I have nowhere to go. This is my lowest I’ve felt in a while. I usually help myself but this time, I can’t. I need help but there isn’t anyone around me who can.

There's something that I've been doing pretty much my whole life, but I only recently started to realize that it's probably not normal. I have a small group of friends and when they organize something and ask me if I want to join them, I often say that I'm not interested or make up excuses to not go. It's almost like having plans with people gives me anxiety and I feel better just being by myself. However, at some point I end up regretting my decision, feeling lonely and sad, but at the same time I don't do anything to make up for it cause I almost feel like I ""deserve"" to be left out. It's like I make myself suffer on purpose but I really just do it unconsciously. I was wondering if anyone else did the same thing maybe?"

lonely,Emotionally exhausted,"Emotionally exhausted - TW: not overt but suicide-adjacent thoughts; mention of self-medicating

My whole body is starting to hurt from loneliness I think. It started in my chest and was only there when I was feeling anxious or depressed, but now it’s there all the time and it just feels like a hollowness from my throat down through my gut. I haven’t had friends in years. My family isn’t really close and everyone can be pretty self-centered. 

My partner of almost a decade and I just broke up after a year apart. They barely reacted to the breakup, which really feels like I’m dispensable and wasted years on someone who didn’t ever actually care, but also I guess validates that breaking up is the right thing to do. Still I would do anything for one of their hugs right now. I feel like they never really loved me and when I really think about it, maybe no one ever has. The more I try to connect with people, the more I feel like people only like me when they’re using me for something. Whenever I need something, nobody cares.

I don’t even want another partner right now. I want a community. I want to go on adventures and sit around a campfire every night laughing with people I feel safe around. Instead, I’m home alone all day every day working or scrolling on my phone. I just feel so stuck.

I don’t think I’ve ever posted here but I feel really worthless and alone rn and thought maybe someone out there would get it. I am seeing a therapist and I’ve been both medicated and self-medicated but no matter what I do, it just feels like nothing’s working and I’m stuck in this groundhog day type hell loop of work/eat/sleep with no end in sight and no love of any kind to make it bearable. Even my cat prefers my ex. I’m turning 30 soon and it just feels like I have nothing to look forward to anymore and like I’m getting old before I even got to enjoy being young. I think the only reason I’m alive at this point is because I’m afraid to die."

My life started falling apart 2 years ago. I was madly in love with someone who just needed me to love and support unconditionally until they found someone better. I was left without a word and that shattered my heart. So, I drowned in depression and alcohol.

I quit my job and moved to another country for a fresh start. Sadly the pandemic did not help to find a good job, expand my social network or make new friends. I dated a couple of amazing people in the meantime but I realized my heart was not healed.

Two months ago, my mother fell severely ill. So I returned home, used up my savings for her treatment and she is now out of danger. I am very happy to be with my family again but having the other aspects of my life stand still make me sad. I am 34 and everyone I know are celebrating a new job or a wedding or a newborn child while I barely have control over any simple task.

What scares me the most is that I do not have the urge to achieve any personal milestones. I am neither suicidal nor depressed. I do not get stressed or even angry and I lost interest in everything. In terms of love and trust, I have nothing left to give. I do not want to die today, I just want my life as I know it to end. I have had a beautiful life so far and I am ready to let go."

I am also very socially awkward and on the rare occasions I start to talk with somebody I spend a large amount of time in silence. I'm turn when I find somebody I enjoy talking with I talk a lot, but that usually drives them away, I assume because I overwhelm them or l because of personal problems.

But for the past year and a half I've had almost no social interaction except with family members. And now I'm back at uni with nobody around. 

Sadly, during night I experience intense moments of emptiness and what-ifs, which I cannot control. I've made conscious efforts to replace these thoughts with positive ones, but it just ends up delaying the inevitable.

I can't focus on my work, because my emotional needs which I put emphasis on, are not satisfied and in turn lack the motivation and energy required to do what I should. I also want to continue swimming but I have self-confidence issues because of my weight which is one of the reasons I want to swim again in the first place. 

Any advice? :("

I am (19M) when I was in school , I was kinda funny guy like but in reality  
Ha no one's going take him seriously not even teachers.

So it all started when I feel like.. I am outcast in different groups then I  feel like left out always because I used to be friends with all guys but am probably the last priority.

Same thing happened in high school too , In fact I only hangout with two friends so same thing don't repeat.

And now I have 0 people in my contact list. I know I can make few friends easily but I don't want to go though the same pain like it's really hard to lose a friend . This shit is really awkward like now I don't like them neither hate them and am confused.
I am always confused , what to do ,what to not do ,so I decided to stay alone.

I have been in my room since COVID . I spend almost a year alone but I still don't feel lonely because I have alot of fun hobbies .

The lonely part is not someone wishing me happy birthday in three years(today is not my BHD)

The lonely time,every time I open Instagram then all the loneliness hits me .
Like I became super jealous with my friends because there whole page is filled with memories and friendship.

So to come at the point : I feel lonely because I really want a friend in my life so you thinking this kid  just want friends to post on Instagram (not really I just friends to make memories , that..I want to cheers my whole life)."

lonely,"Pls, does anyone has an idea?","Pls, does anyone has an idea? - I am so tired. Of good news from my family and friends. Of things they tell me what they experienced.
I am so tired. Of always not to know how to get through the next day. Of ups and downs. Of being social acceptable and justifying my whole life. Of starting and failing. Of pinching and scraping. Of fighting against the hole. Of being the third wheel everywhere. Of hoping. And disappointments.

In January my therapy is going to be over after so many yrs. But I don't know what to do alone. Since 2012 I always fought against clinical depression, agoraphobia, complex posttraumatic stress disorder and most of all suicidal thoughts. I have done so many things to improve my life and my symptoms. 
But after a while I am always at that point. 

Can... someone... Please tell me what to do?
Any thoughts?"
lonely,I feel alone and lonely,"I feel alone and lonely - Let's start with the reason why I feel depressed. I feel depressed because I don't feel connected to anyone. I feel lonely all the time. I'll be laughing at something then I'll immediately be hit by sadness since I have no one to share my happiness/laughter with. I started talking to this person because we play the same game. As months go by I realized we have similar interests. Our friendship made me feel connected. I can vent, share my happiness, and talk about other stuff. I didn't feel insecure in that friendship. We were both happy with it. We both talk to each other about problems. We both genuinely cared abd supported each other. I finally felt connected. I finally have something I've always wanted. That friendship made me feel less depressed. Just knowing I have someone helps a lot. That friendship allowed me to help myself do better since I'm mentally ill.

Now I feel this crushing loneliness because that person cut me off. We're both mentally ill. She cut me off because it was the best for her mental health and I understand it. She cut me off because I was toxic. I was doing something toxic without even realizing it. I didn't know I was being toxic because I didn't know anything about trauma dumping. I wasn't aware that I was trauma dumping. I was under the impression that it was okay, but it wasn't. I know is venting is good, but it wasn't venting that I was doing. It was trauma dumping and I was hurting the person I really cared for. If I knew about trauma dumping, I would have stopped doing it. I never knew I was doing something wrong all this time. Now I have nobody. I lost the feeling of comfort, closeness, and connectedness I've always wanted. I lost the friendship I wanted to cherish because I didn't know that I was doing something toxic.

I hope we could be friends again. Now I know my mistake and made myself better. I miss our friendship. I'm alone and so lonely again. Drowning in my thoughts. Bottling up my emotions because I don't want to accidentally trauma dump on anyone. I'm back to the pit of despair. 😭"

I deleted my fb about a year ago and switched numbers too, so that leaves me with no one but myself.

Scew it i'm going. Hope to make some new friends there lol"
lonely,people disappear for months or years and then appear again suddenly.,"people disappear for months or years and then appear again suddenly. - not gonna text a lot about this, i don't even consider it a rant to some extent, but it now makes me laugh internally that in a lot of ocassions i had a friend,we suddenly stopped texting eachother for months, and not 1 month or 2, but like 6,7,9 months, a whole year or a year and a half, and they suddenly out of nowhere come back only to ignore me again after i am empathetic and help them with their problems.  
wish i could say that i only had this problem back then with girls, but it's funny how it also happened with male friends.  
Pretty much the structure is the next one:  
Friend A texts and hangouts with me --&gt; we have fun for some weeks or a couple of months--&gt; Friend A disappears out of the blue for like a whole semester or a little bit more --&gt; friend A comes back and when we hangout or we talk i find out that basically they came back to me because their gf or boyfriend broke with them or because they are having personal problems--&gt; i pay attention and show them empathy,give them support --&gt; friend A feels better in the next couple of weeks or months and we talk regularly--&gt; Friend A disappears completely again out of the blue for other 6-16 months --&gt; friend A reappears again in my life--&gt;repeat the whole cycle.  
last semester my ex texted me basically because she was having issues with his current boyfriend, last month a male friend of mine texted me because his girlfriend was being apathetic and ignoring him, and now my best female-friend texts me again out of the blue after like 8 months.  
A whole year ago i would've pissed myself out of excitement about these situations of them coming back in my life, nowadays it just makes me feel apathetic and it costs me showing them empathy and interest, specially when they start with that bullshit of ""i am busy/don't have time"" only to then brag about how they did 1000 things with other friends or with their s.o in that week,LOL.  
i just texted them basically 1 day again only to delete them completely the day after.  
in 2020 i got tired of crying, being heartbroken and loving other people.  
i shutted/closed my own heart off for most people i used to love madly...and i don't regret it.  
call me resentful or ""edgy"", but it was the best decision i made, i don't feel much love for others anymore, and i like to spend my time with things i truly enjoy instead of letting my heart become black and cold due to carrying their problems,negativities and issues.  
My only love is reserved to myself, my 2 or 3 important family members, my only 3 true friends and my Goddess, no one else.

I've worked from since March 2020. Yes, I'm lucky to have a job still. But I miss the daily interactions with colleagues and friends. I don't have family anywhere near me and my dog is my only company.

lonely,Being a loner in my senior year,"Being a loner in my senior year -   It’s my senior year of high school and I have literally zero friends. I haven’t had any friends really since elementary school. I always thought that I would get over the loneliness and be able to be happy by myself but I can’t. No one has ever reached out to talk to me not once though the entirety of high school. Seeing everyone around me have friend groups and relationships just make me so much more depressed. I’ve missed out on so much and I will never get over never having a high school experience. I hate being invisible to everyone and the only time I’m noticed is when people make fun of me. I have no one to talk to in my phone or anyone to talk to about my problems. I know when I get out of high school my loneliness is going to get worse. I wish I was more attractive so more people would approach me. I wish I knew how to talk to people. I wish I had something to remember of high school besides sadness, depression and loneliness. I just wish I was normal."

Even criminals have friends and well wishers and here I , a simple and good natured law-abiding citizen (I am a doctor) am treated like I am the worst possible organism that has existed ever on this planet. Better I shouldn't have existed at all. I think there should be a courses on how to mix with people and make friends for emotionally disabled persons like us or atleast rehabilitation programs to help us just leave. Isn't it fair to help the  emotionally disabled as other disabled people are helped. Just because we continue to function and contribute to the society in a postive way but what about our emotional health which is like a slow poison.
And at last we end up in some sort of substance abuse, and people consider the cause effect relationship between drugs and loneliness in a reversed manner."

lonely,Concerned I'm being used,"Concerned I'm being used - TLDR at the bottom

For a while I was talking to an acquaintance from college and we eventually grew closer, someone I could definitely call a friend as we talked every day and about even personal issues, and often she would ask me about what something meant when a guy was talking to her or tell me about how excited she was for a date. However recently she's decided to be single due to her coursework getting in the way and several bad relationships one after another, and basically just doesn't talk to me anymore, even getting angry with me when I make a light joke about something she says. Now pretty much every time I contact her via Snap hat, where we always talk, she usually just sends a reply of her face and says nothing. To me this says ""fuck off, leave me alone"" in the rudest way possible and I'm worried I was just being used as an ego boost or some such this whole time.

TL:DR
Worried friend only using me as an ego boost or emotion sponge"
lonely,I hate being me,"I hate being me - My life fell apart 4 years ago when my mom died. I was only 18 and had to move out of the house and start my life. I found a minimum wage job, started renting an apartment with some friends, and contemplated going to college. Everything was going great until the pandemic started and I was laid off from my job. 

With no money and my friends about to kick me out, I didn’t know what to do or where to go. I eventually moved back home with my dad and his new girlfriend. Now I'm 23, living at home, have no money saved up, never went to college, no future career and I have never had a girlfriend. I feel so pathetic sometimes. 

I go on Facebook and see people I went to high school with are graduated from college, have someone that cares about them, and already has a kid. It's depressing because ever since I lost my mom I have just felt so lonely and unloved. I can't even tell you the last time someone said: “I love you”. I have just been thinking lately about how much I just want a family. I want a wife who cares about me and some beautiful children. I wanna come home after a long day to my family, that cares about me and loves me for me. I don't wanna die nor am I suicidal but I just want to be someone else. I hate being me.

After talking to her both on the internet and in person. I feel like we will just be a normal friend, but part of me wants more than that. 

I tried to suppress my feelings. First, we are not knowing each other for a long time. Secondly, I am not sure about my feelings. Is it love? or like? or simply enjoy her companion? Lastly, is that feeling derived from my fear of loneliness or something else?

I'm slightly hating myself for easily ' fall in love ' with someone and cannot identify my feelings. And for her, I just want to be her friend. Not necessarily bestie, but at least a nice one. 

I want to get my mindset right. I want to be comfortable around her, not nervous. Anybody can give me some advices or share your experiences with me."

Some kids are lonely and you can tell why. but you can see that they are still good people though. im 16 btw male and my grandma says im handsome so that should sum it up for you, Im also kinda awkward around new people but not socially impaired, just more quiet that's all

anyways Im not a kid that hunches over and looks all depressed or sits in his basement and plays video games, I really try to meet people I know im ""cute"" that's what I've been told by my female friends and i have a small hand full of them about 4 or 5  and by all means im not trying to sound cocky. im quiet low on friends i hang out with the same 5 people 

Anyways just everywhere i go i get hit with shit. I mess up once and people give me crap for it for months, now this sounds like a normal teenage thing but i assure you when teachers and adults walk up to you and ask ""why do they treat you like that"" you know somethings up. Im told im insecure and that's why people  pick on me, Its like getting out of hand its too much

&amp;#x200B;

one of my big insecurity's by the way is i just get really nervous around new people girls i don't really know. And so it make it hard for me to ""pull"" like the rest of my friends that always have girls crushing on them. 

im piety secure about everything else im insane at wakeboarding and one of the top competitive swimmers in my state utah 

&amp;#x200B;

anyyyways

&amp;#x200B;

 Now im just gonna back up for a sec to explain what happens

 one example i was painting my friends basement with other friend. And i painted a penis on the wall and took a picture sent it to my friends and then painted over it. However my friend drew the N word and took a pic and sent it. Now fast forward a month and im talking with them and all of them just thrash me to peices about how i was so dirty and terrible to draw that word.

Another example i was sitting at work after i went on a lunch date with one of my close friends im not gay btw this was a chick i when with not that it matters but yeah. anyways. Someone asked how my day was and i said it was good i went on a date and yk like 3 or 4 girls were like eww who would take you out on a date your a total idiot, and they weren't kidding either i promise you

so for anything i do wrong i get crap i hear people trash talking me in conversations ( people i barley know) I promise im not immature i know the time and place and in fact I OVERFILTER myself a lot but whenever i say something people act irritated. and i don't say awkward thing that would make someone irritated I just say regular normal things. Its like in every situation i am the scape goat, in my old friend group everything was blamed on me in fact I had some people come back and apologie to me about what I was accused of, things that i never did and i was pushed under and gossiped about for months. somethings the people you think love you will literally rip out your heart and stomp on it

&amp;#x200B;

and to be honest when people aren't being jerks people say Im funny and i make them enjoy times. some of my friends took a trip ( many of which trash talk me at times) and they came back and said something was missing it just wasn't fun, there wasn't a person to say random stuff to make people laugh and that they needed someone to mess with people and to get people to do things. They actual said it was me that the missed WHICH FELT GREAT 

&amp;#x200B;

But most of the time people step on my and trash talk me and call me anoying and awkward and push me out, they want me at their convince . My own dad treats me like a problem that need to be solved I've heard him say it to my mom many times. From childhood I've always been alone. I love being with the people but I just can live as people doormat scape goat and anyother words to describe it.\\

&amp;#x200B;

pleas help me if you are like me if you know someone like me i just need someone to tell me what the heck is up with me or what im doing wrong if im annoying i just don't know,"

lonely,"Despite being in a community with over 200,000 people...","Despite being in a community with over 200,000 people... - It still doesn't stop the pain of loneliness in those quiet, late midnight hours, when you're too sad to go to sleep but you get high off your own depression because **that's** how you get your dopamine nowadays. Either that or porn, but hey-- you can't watch porn anymore because all it does it make you sad when you realize you'll never be able to share an intimate moment with a girl like how these guys **GET PAID TO DO**. That's right -- something some guys do for a living, WE'LL never get to do. 

It doesn't fix anything in the real world, except make me feel slightly better for a fleeting moment because I was able to get my frustrations out to maybe a whole **five people** that will read this fuckin thing, myself included. 


It doesn't make me feel any better about myself, in fact it makes me feel worse because there are all these positive messages that get sent in the form of a post that appeals to such a wide variety of people that it's **too broad** therefore I should ignore it because it just *doesn't* apply to me. 

It doesn't make me feel any better because all my real life friends (all two of them) suddenly decided to stop messaging me to make plans because one made new friends at his job and the other one got a girlfriend so there goes all HIS free time. 


But the worst part of it all, the icing on the cake?

Just shows what a pathetic piece of shit I am. I just wish I was special to someone. The sad reality is even if I died no one would notice or would care. I’m just invisible to people, I have no personality, I’m so boring and dry, I’m physically so ugly. It just hurts a lot cause you want someone to care but no one does. My attachment issues are so fucked up that I get attached to any girl that gives me attention, I just wish I was fucking normal. I’m sick and fucking tired of getting invalidated. Like I’m not dead yet but  maybe if guns were legal here I would? People only care about you if you’re rich, white or fucking pretty and I’m none of those things unfortunately.

The result of lacking any sort of love or physical affection, i’m sure. So touch starved. I don’t know how long you can go without any kind of meaningful connection with another person without losing touch with reality. 

I’m sure it’s not healthy. You can’t focus on the present or even the future when you’re stuck in the past and all that used to be. But I find myself constantly replaying scenes from an old chapter in my life like a movie stuck on loop. All the kisses. All the “I love you’s.” Every single embrace. Desperately trying to feel what I felt back then. As if it’ll do anything for me today. I find it absolutely pathetic.

I’m a kind guy, I don’t judge at all, but I can’t seem to find someone like me. Almost everyone here in Montreal aren’t appealing to me. I don’t know why, I’m just trying to be cool to everyone, I don’t judge, even stupid mistakes because I don’t want to hurt others in any way, because i know what bad physical + mental health can do to you, and I don’t want anybody experiencing what I’ve been though. If there’s anyone, anyone here willing to chat, or play some games, watch movies, go ahead, tell me, I’m no prick nor chad or anything.

lonely,Read if you're lonely,"Read if you're lonely - ***It's not your fault.***  


Not that long ago, before industrialization destroyed family group, you would have been born into a large extended family - parents, grand parents, nieces, aunts, counsins, etc etc.  


These people would have supported you. They would have watched you grow from a child into adult. They would have supported you with all of your flaws. Warts and all. If you would have cried, they would have held you. If you were lonely, they would have found you a mate. Yes, if you were mateless, they would have found you someone because they care about you and your well being and they don't want you to be alone.   


So it's not your fault. It's not because you have flaws. It's not because you're short, skinny, fat, ugly, mentally ill, whatever it is you may think is causing you to be alone. Not that long ago, even with these flaws, you would have had a shot at friends and mates. Your family would have provided it for you. Warts and all, **you would have been taken care of**. Because you don't just throw out a family member because they have a flaw. Family is family. You take care of your family. That's just the law. Basic human law.  


But this family group was destroyed, and that's not your fault. Because it is destroyed, you are alone. And that's ***not*** normal. This is ***not*** how human beings operate. It is ***not your fault*** you can't cope with it.   


**This is entirely not on you. This is not your fault. It's not because you have flaws. Humanity bears a mental scar that you had nothing to do with - you didn't cause industrialization.**   


If you're looking in the mirror and are blaming yourself for being lonely, please know now that it's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong and it's not because you are imperfect. Were you born a bit earlier, you would have been born into a family that would have supported you. Family that would have held you, hugged you, kissed you, tickled you, gave you gifts, cherished you, found you mates, and basically took care of you.  


**It's not your fault** that you got born into a century where that has been destroyed. It is not your fault that your parents were likely overworked, exhausted, bitter, angry and as a consequence unloving. None of this is on you. You can relax. You didn't cause this, it's not because you are unworthy of love or companionship, the human society itself is fundamentally broken and your solitude and isolation are just symptoms of this.   


**Not. Your. Fault.**   


**You. Are. Good.**  


There is nothing wrong with you. There is nothing wrong with you. It's the society that's fucked. And if anyone dares to say otherwise, just show them the homeless. Show them mentally ill people who can't take care of themselves and don't know where they are or who they are, freezing to death, while we spend billions on rockets that we won't even use anyway. These insanity examples don't stop, but the point is:  


There is nothing wrong with you. It's the society that's ill. **What kind of healthy society wouldn't embrace someone as lovely as you? You have value. Any society worth it's salt would have cherished you and loved you and cared for you and made sure you had everything that you need that they could provide. You are a human being and you are worth this. Remember that always.**"

I'm struggling to make friends in uni, my old friends from school have their own lives and are super busy so other than occasionally checking in (nothing deep just a ohhh hey how you doing its been a while) we don't really talk - like if I have anything I wanna talk about I don't feel comfortable because I know its a forced convo. I just feel like the person who's never invited and I do often message people to say we should do something like get coffee and its always a response along the lines of ""oh yeah 100%"" but then they'll say they'll let me know when they're free and after several times of asking I kinda feel embarrassed.

My 21st bday is coming up and a couple people have asked what my big plans are and I don't have any. Some of the people I was debating asking told me they were going on a night out that night and I'd mentioned it was my bday and they asked if I had plans and I said not yet I'm always last min I suppose (not true but I felt awkward haha) and they were like well I hope you have fun with whatever you do!!

Idk I just feel like when I did have friends I'd always invite the lonely person or whoever wasn't properly invited cuz I hate the idea of someone being alone and I just assumed id always have said friends, or that people would be like me and invite me if they saw I was lonely, but now I'm older it seems like people just assume you have friends so don't bother, and it see,s to be embarrassing to message people to hang out? I've tried real hard to hit up people with common interests but they just always come across weirded out that I'm randomly talking to them whereas I'd be over the moon if someone went out of their way to include me/talk to me about something I said I'm interested in.

lonely,Tired of loneliness.,"Tired of loneliness. - Hi all, just wanted to vent a little bit. I'm a 25 year old guy, and I'm just really lonely, and tired of feeling like this. For the most part of my life I was never too bothered about dating, having a relationship. I mean I always thought it would be nice to have someone, but I never searched for it. 

I have never had a romantic relationship, or anything close to it (virgin, never even had my first kiss). But I'm at a point in my life now where I just really want a companion, someone I can have fun with, be romantic with, the sex side of things would be great too I'm sure aha, but I really just would love to have a partner right now :( 

That said, I have no idea how to relationship.. I have very little experience talking to girls (or anyone), I'm a very quiet/awkward guy, and don't have a lot of confidence. And am also afraid of the physical side of things because of the whole 25 year old virgin thing. 

People keep telling me it will happen, I just need to go about my life and not search for it. But it might not, and that's terrifying to me, the years keep going by (I know I'm young but still) and it just gets harder and harder :("
lonely,"If i had to describe myself in one word, i’d say « despicable » .","If i had to describe myself in one word, i’d say « despicable » . - My past shortcomings, how shitty of a person i was before, my lack of humor, my inability to stop people from walking over me, my inability to speak up for myself, my past decisions that i have to live with to this day. All combined are the reasons why i don’t like what i see in the mirror. I’ve become a shell of my former self. 

I force myself to choose the hardest paths in my educational career just so I get the validation that I’m doing something difficult therefore I’m worth something. But i just end up falling apart and not being able to keep up , failing classes. I try to surround myself with people that are better than me just so I can feel like I’m on their level. I’m a female who seeks to give mother behavior to people around her and i do it way too much it becomes annoying, just to get the validation that i’m a good person. I never feel worthy unless i have to prove it to myself through my deeds, which...aren’t that many lately. 

With only a few people around me, my regrets keep piling up, my self esteem is non existent, it’s so intense to the point where i can’t like a meme online because i don’t feel deserving of a good laughter. I can’t double tap on a post i like because i don’t feel deserving enough to relate to a positive post. I can’t post a picture on my socials because i don’t want people to be reminded of me or think that I’m delusional to think i’m pretty enough to post my picture.

Living off of two hours of sleep a day,energy drinks and dry shampoo. Looking like a skeleton covered in hyperpigmented pale skin and dark under eyes .  No mother around to tell me to do better because cancer took her last breath. My father is a depressed single man who lost the woman of his life, and has to care for three girls and deal with life on his own.

I can’t allow myself to speak about this to anyone, it will most likely come off as self victimization and i’m not ready for that talk. I don’t know how to convince someone that it’s not a cry for help, but a reality where « getting on your feet and working hard for a better life » is easier said than done. And for someone as despicable as me, a sane life isn’t really in the cards for them."

It's only gonna be for an hour to take a test, but it's gonna be pure hell. I really hope I don't see any of my former friends. If I do, they probably won't recognize me bc I'll be wearing my mask. Thank God! I'm still really anxious though. I hope I don't do anything to make a fool out of myself. Also some guys used to make fun of me and I really hope I don't see them. It's gonna hurt if I see my friends. I really miss them, but I know they don't care about me. None of them have texted me since the pandemic last year. I know I'm better off being alone, but sometimes it can be painful"

lonely,Lonely Enough To Cheat?,"Lonely Enough To Cheat? - I am so lonely and I contemplated cheating with a married woman today.  I took my truck to the repair shop last week.  I hadn't seen the receptionist, let's car her B for short, in a very long time.  When I took the truck in B made a point to say how she missed me and was glad to see me.  B looked much more glad than an old customer coming to visit.  I could see she was a little nervous and then she followed me outside as I was leaving, which was unusual.  B then came toward me wrapping her arms around me the first non-familial touch I've had in a very long time.  Oddly something went wrong with a car I have and well I was back to the repair shop.  This time again, B followed me outside and I could see this little smirk on her face and she timidly said I should have her number, she still has mine and I should call her so we can get together for coffee.  I guess we exchanged numbers from a service appointment thing in the past.  Anyway, I thought back to the earlier appointment and remembered B told me that her husband who had a bad accident doesn't touch her anymore and he doesn't want to be touched.  B really doesn't seem like a person who would cheat and I don't want to be the home wrecker.  Honestly, I couldn't stop thinking about her on the way home from the car shop.  I am so lonely I would actually consider calling B?  Is this where I am at in my life?  I know very well that would be a mistake, but damn I am so lonely.  If you saw her eyes you could see how she desperately wants to be held.  I feel the same way.  Why does the person who shows interest in me have to be married?  What a cruel twisted world.  I feel like this is a test.  How desperate am I for affection?"

lonely,[23f] Loneliness really startin to sink in..,"[23f] Loneliness really startin to sink in.. - To keep it short, I recently got a new government job which is life changing for me. I don't have friends and actually haven't had a real one since high school. I'm really close with my mom and little brother and I keep in contact with my ex and one close online friend that I've both met through Playstation years ago. 

I told all of them about the news because I was so excited and they're all I have. And I essentially got the old ""congrats"" and ""good job"" from everyone and that's about it. Now I'm at a point where I'm starting to realize how lonely I am. I wish I had someone to share things with, someone to listen to me talk about my day, my accomplishments, and my dreams. I want someone to be able to accept those things and build with me. 

I've only been in one relationship but it was long distance and we're no longer together. A lot of people like me and I know I can make friends but for some reason I mainly click with guys and they all just end up wanting sex or to force a relationship on me. I'm honestly not sure what to do, any thoughts? Also I don't use social media and I know that doesn't help but I hate taking pictures. This isn't as short as I thought it'd be lol."

I’m really excited for it tonight even though I won’t have any company. Being lonely isn’t always so bad after all.
lonely,"I am lonely, but I stay this way because he broke me","I am lonely, but I stay this way because he broke me - 9 years in a relationship. Gave my all, pushed myself to be better every day, wanted to financially be on his level and he fucking cheated. 

He lied about so many things, he had been fucking his coworker for a year or so in the parking lot at his workplace.

Then he came crawling back when she dumped him, and I bought the bullshit. He told me he’d buy a house with me, move to where I was. Well we bought the house but he didn’t come through with his other promises. 

So I dumped him, come to find out later he was messaging his howorker trying to get back with her.

I’m so drained on relationships. I’m so absolutely fucked up. I want to love, I want to be loved but I don’t want to be vulnerable and thus I talk myself out of ever bothering to get into a relationship again. 

To top it off this jerkhole walks around crying about his emotions yada yada like he’s some sort of victim in all of this and never acknowledges the crap he put me through. 

I’m having a day right now… where I feel trapped in myself because i can’t bring myself to trust anyone. I want to go to the mountains and just scream til I lose my voice, I wish I could just drink some sort of memory potion to take it all away… and on my worse days, I think about drowning myself in my bathtub."

Perhaps it's a fool's dream. Perhaps my entire issue is that I cannot be alone and be content. But I have been alone and not felt lonely. It is the prolonged, lifeless nature of this loneliness that hurts me. I can't see when it will end. What I want is not lots of empty friendships but a few or even a single enduring companion, a friend who liked me and understood me and valued me for who I am - in spite of what I am - in spite of all of it.

Back home I didn't have many friends, and I'm pretty sure most people in the circles I was somewhat in would hear my name and groan, I'm sure they're happy that I'm no longer there, but a family back there that's treated me better than anyone in my own family ever has is there, and they've always been super supportive. I miss em dearly.

That and my childhood friend, he and I have known each other for over a decade and one of the last things I did back in st. Louis was hang out with him, I miss him like a brother.

lonely,"A family built on love, but I am more alone than ever before.","A family built on love, but I am more alone than ever before. - You know when you’re young and dumb, walking through school with all of those other people talking about meaningless things and dreaming about impossible futures. I miss that. Then you grow up a bit more and your friends group gets smaller and smaller until eventually it’s just you. You fill the impossibly large hole in your heart with the idea of trying to make something of yourself. You create even more impossible dreams filled with hope only to be smashed down by the capitalism and history of your parents. You sign your life away for four years with hopes to be a hero, to be someone who has contributed to something in their lives. And right when you get out on your own you grasp onto the first person you meet and do things you never would have just because you can’t say no, you can’t speak your mind like everyone thinks. And suddenly you’re under the control of someone else. And trapped. Don’t talk to them. Don’t go there. Don’t dress like that. Don’t do that to your body. Don’t care about your family only me. Be shaped and molded into what I want, act the way I want you to and do what you’re supposed to. 

Maybe I’m just emotional. Maybe I need to breath for a moment with someone who listens and cares for me. It’s so tiring to continually care for everyone and everything while never receiving it. I want to have a conversation. A real one, a back and forth. But I can’t interrupt you when you have your headset on. How could I possibly ask you for help or love when you go to work for me. I should constantly be in debt to you. I’m surrounded by people but I feel so alone. I am constantly responding but am I really saying anything. I can’t leave, I can’t continue on.

Even with all of this, I feel lonely and lazy all the time.

I have been getting more and more addicted to reddit which seems the main reason for my deteriorating mental state

I don't know if I am being lazy by not keeping myself busy with friends and study stuff or if I feel lonely because of some other void in my life

lonely,Introverted 24M looking for a long term friendship with a girl who likes anime and or gaming,"Introverted 24M looking for a long term friendship with a girl who likes anime and or gaming - 





Who am I?

I’m a 24 years old guy from Europe and I’m not gonna lie I feel kinda lonely these days &gt;.&lt; It doesn’t help being introverted at all. I also have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) so don’t expect me to call you soon xD. 


What do I hate?

Okay so people who will talk for some time and after that they completely vanish. They don’t “ghost” but it’s more like that they don’t write on their own. Most of the time I’m the one who has to send messages or else they just don’t message. I really hate that. It shouldn’t be one sided. I really lose interest when that happens. I get it if you can’t message me all the time. I can’t either. But please communicate with me so I know the reason why you’re not responding to my message(s). Or else I’m just gonna think of the worst case scenarios in my head and that’s EXHAUSTING honestly. But this only happens when I get attached to someone. It can happen when I get good vibes from someone and when I like that person.


What kind of person am I looking for?


So I’m actually looking for someone like me. Literally. Someone who is kinda lonely too, someone who has anxiety, someone who likes games or anime so we at least have like a mutual interest. We can also play games or watch anime/movies together on discord. I’m not that active on discord nowadays but I know most people like to communicate through discord so its fine, I can be active on there. :D

What games do I play?

Currently I play rocket league but I played a lot of games in the past. Like: overwatch, dead by daylight, csgo, some valorant, some league of legends and a lot more. So I’m sure we can pick a game we both like. Also roblox is a great game to play together in my honest opinion. I’d love to play that together. ＼(＾▽＾)／

What are my other interests?

I like conspiracy theories, history, psychology, music, stuff about the universe (planets, stars, more life and stuff) those are the things I can think of right away.

Oh and I type a lot with keyboard emojis so if you don’t like that then don’t message me.. (like these: :) :D c: etc.)


So if you’re like me then please send me a chat message. Don’t reply to this post. See you &gt;.&lt;"

lonely,Stress/Anxiety when thinking about the possibility of a relationship,"Stress/Anxiety when thinking about the possibility of a relationship -  Hi, I am not sure if anyone here might be able to relate or help, but here is my issue. Whenever I (22M) think about being in a relationship with someone, I get this sort of anxious feeling in my stomach. It's not like I don't want to be in a relationship... quite the opposite, I often feel lonely, especially when I see two people that are great together, and I long for a feeling of connection like that with someone.

I can only think of one time when I can explain this feeling in my gut: leading up to breaking up with my ex (21F). In hindsight, I know it was a toxic relationship for me, and my ex made the break up process atrocious, so I guess it's only natural that I felt this way. However, I am not sure how to explain the anxiousness I am feeling right now just thinking about being in a relationship with someone.

As a bit of background information, I am mostly an introvert, and I haven't dated much in my life (I've only had one relationship that lasted 7-8 months). My parents divorced when I was in fourth grade, and while my relationship with them is for the most part better now, there have been rocky times with them, especially surrounding them dating new people. Anyways, I am not sure if this information helps at all.

I hope someone can enlighten me on the possibilities of why I might feel this way. Thanks everyone."

lonely,Sunday is my 23rd birthday...[vent],"Sunday is my 23rd birthday...[vent] - ...and I'll be more alone than I ever have before.

Apologies in advance for the long post. Maybe I need someone to hear me. Maybe I just need to get this off my chest. But in any respect, thank you for reading.

When I was 18, I was homeless because I got kicked when I admitted that my stepfather was sexually abusing me. When he got put into jail, I lost contact with the rest of my family--adoptive mother (adopted at 5) and siblings. My biological mother passed when I was 12 and my bio father struggles with addiction though I never met him. Because of this family dynamic, I have 2 grandparents whom I love dearly as they protected me throughout the trial but (even if it is accidental and subconscious) who do favor their blood grandchildren. And I understand, I don't have resentment for them. They were social workers and are just generally good people, and it's never been their responsibility to house, feed, and clothe me so they do what they can. But their daughter--aka my aunt--and I have always had a volatile relationship. I am biracial, Black and Jewish, and my adoptive grandparents and aunt are white. Once, my aunt and I got into a fight because she made a racist joke using the n-word with the hard ""-er,"" and we didn't talk for years. We made up, and time went on. 

I don't know what happened, but she recently started just drifting away from me. \*Disclaimer,\* I work a lot. I usually work 2 jobs to support myself and bring in extra income. Well during the pandemic, I lost both jobs. On top of that, my car got totaled the day I got fired from my full time job. I had to use a lot of savings to buy a new car/pay bills/miscellaneous expenses and so on. I also lost my health insurance which means I lost my therapist and psychologist. So, it was a big loss for me to suffer. And I never, ever asked my aunt for money or food or rides or ANYTHING, all I maybe did was need some more emotional support because of stress, but she started hanging out with her friends more and her other nieces and nephews. When we used to hang, we'd go out for food n drinks, or go shopping, or do something else. Point is, it usually required spending money, and she hasn't held a job consistently because she lives at home and doesn't have big bills like rent. So, I would often pay for the majority of expenses and never ever minded because giving is my love language. We eventually got to the point where we just didn't speak, and when I went to go to her IG to look for something, I noticed she had deleted any pictures of me, and it kind of made me feel like she was choosing a side of the family's and it wasn't mine. 

I would never ask my family to choose me over anyone else--it's why I would stay away from my grandparents, because their grandchildren's mother wouldn't let them around if I was there. But for some reason, this felt different...my aunt cried with me when I was homeless, drove me to the job interview that allowed me to secure housing, wanted to be there when I graduated with my associates...and suddenly I was just deleted from her life. So whatever, I blocked her on everything. She reached out to try to get back into the Amazon Prime account, and I just didn't respond.

I was also dating this guy for about two years. It was also a very volatile and toxic relationship. We both have a lot of trauma to unpack and heal from, so I don't want to place blame on anyone and won't. All I'll say is, he's the first person I fell in love wit. I have loved before, in HS and early college, but never like this. At this point, we haven't been together for some weeks, but still seeing each other and hooking up and saying ""I love you."" I found out he has a girlfriend/is dating someone else. He's Caribbean/Black-American, brown skin, and I'm a little lighter than him. Well, I'm the first black girl he's ever dated, and he cheated on me with a white girl earlier in the relationship and is now dating a white girl. Which maybe wouldn't even bother me as much if the same thing didn't happen in my last relationship (being the first back girl a black-American guy has dated and cheated on with a white girl). Lol. Anyway, I know I shouldn't be upset because we are not together, though based on the dates I know they started dating while we were together, but c'est la vie. 

All this to say, I am sad. I have a best friend but she's not very sensitive and emotional like I am. She gives me space to be sad but she's not someone you can easily vent to. She's an amazing problem solver and a good listener at times but she's not someone that will pull up with snacks and tissues while I cry. And that's okay, that's who she is, but I am deeply missing something more. 

So Sunday is my 23rd birthday. I am not doing anything and I don't want to. I just want the day to pass by unnoticed. I feel very alone and unloved. I know I am loved, but I want to be...a priority, I guess. 

If you've read the whole thing, thank you so much...have a safe Halloween."

One person from across the world ordered me flowers and a candle with a note card saying she lived me. She did it from halfway around the world to show that to me. She showed me love that no one else has in my life.

Now she's gone and I'm always that my birthday is going to go back to being lonely and sad again. I'll have my family around me but it will be as it always was. I'm going to be alone again and knowing now what it's like to be loved and appreciated I'm scared about going back to that. 

This is just what happens to me though. I'm like a cactus that you can't get to close to without getting hurt. Everyone always leaves when it becomes to much or I have to leave because of my own shame.

lonely,Here’s my vent,"Here’s my vent - I’m only 19 years old. I’m fully on my own. I’ve been slipping in and out of some pretty intense depression for the past year now ever since my girlfriend broke up with me. I pretty much have no friends or family I’m able to speak to. I feel so lost everyday I think terrible thoughts I lose my awareness of the outside world and I am constantly in a drift in my own mind, always thinking of all the negative thoughts. I can’t stop thinking of it all, it keeps me awake every night to where I’ve developed insomnia. I want to better myself, I’m trying. I try everyday to do better but I can’t stop these thoughts. I have this feeling, this feeling of pain deep inside my chest, it’s stabbing me and I can feel it every second of the day. It doesn’t make sense but I feel that pain grow stronger every day. Whenever I talk or do anything on the daily , In my mind I’m not thinking of what I am doing. I am thinking of her, of the pain, of my failures and the people who I have let down. I just want to scream and cry and stop living. I’ve lost my motivation to get any better tbh right now. Today at work I observed everybody else. I watched them wondering “How are they simply going on with their lives?” “How can I be like them?” “How aren’t they completely hating existence?”. I wondered this because i am so hurt to where the first thing before and after my shift is cry my brains out, why am I so pathetic? I want to be happy again. I remember that feeling. I crave that feeling so much. I just want a long hug from somebody that genuinely cares. Just a quick breath of joy again. I never talk to anyone about my feelings usually and that is why I am on here. Hoping somebody hears me at least just one person. And if you are reading this I want you to know that you are loved. And that I care about you. 

Also I tipped this girl $60 on a $20 bill today. I left b4 her reaction. But I hope that it made her day better. Because I believe we all need a little appreciation. And I hope one day I can pull myself out of this and earn that appreciation."

lonely,I had a dream today!,"I had a dream today! - I'm a 24M loner just existing as life passes by me. I do have a few friends but no real connection. I've mostly been a loner. I was bullied a lot in the past and it caused negative changes in me, I was toxic to some really close people and have this shield around me where I present myself as I want to be lonely but in reality I dont want to. During the past few months, I have withdrawn myself from the last few people I know, hobbies, etc. Just hating myself and waiting for the next day to arrive so that I can waste another day. 

So, coming to the dream, I dreamt that I was with a group of friends, at my home and enjoying playing video games together. I was genuinely happy and was having the time of my life. There was good food, lots of smile and laughter, etc. 

The other part of my dream was that I was with this girl, just sitting and talking to her. We even cuddled in my dream. It felt good, I felt loved and wanted during the dream.  I have always felt that im unwanted and unlovable but during this dream I was living my best life. I just long for a connection, human affection. And in the dream I had everything.

And then bam! i wake up and realize it was all just a dream. I literally cried after waking up. Its been 5-6 hours since I woke up but can't forget about this beautiful dream. I was happy and just talking and enjoying myself with people. 

I wish I never woke up!!

But when midnight strikes, I wake to no light

Before I know, in walks the fight

To not accept - nor fixiate my blurry sight - on a mere pillow, lodged to my right

Sometimes it's tears, though it takes some might

Pathetic whimpers with lips shut tight

Thoughts too grim to mention, roaming like pests - the one's I know I'll never best

""I do need you"", ""I know I do""

""Don't let this lead you to think it's not true""

lonely,It’s a sad life.,"It’s a sad life. - 
Sorry in advance for the long post. I just need to vent somewhere to get the burden off. I moved to this city years ago and I think it was the worst best decision my parents have ever taken because  I haven't travelled much out of my province or even my city really, but I hope to on day. I moved here in the beginning of grade 9 leaving all my middle school friends which i know usually don't last and my family, But ever since I moved here from grades 9-12, my life has been absolute garbage. My life pretty much consisted of going to school, coming home and staying in my room. I made some friends but they were only friends in school. I'm going to be 18 in a few months and graduated high school a few months ago and I've never been to a party, hung out with friends, am still a virgin while everyone my age is out partying every weekend, doing drugs, going to prom, having sex, going on adventures and travelling with friends and it just makes me sad. I know that people are going to say that these things are overrated, but I don't really care because I want to do those things as well instead I'm in my room, no friends and alone for the past 5 years watching netflix and playing video games to escape reality. Also, making friends in this city is really hard because they usually have had their friends since they were in the first grade and have always lived here while I've been moving constantly and have been to 3 high schools in four years. I'm taking a gap year right now and working full-time to make some money and I will be living at home to save money which means life in university will also be the same. I guess I just need to accept my life for the way it is and that I will die a loser. I think if I don't wake up tomorrow I will be okay with it because then I won't have any of these worries and life will be done with and I don't plan on doing anything, but I will be absolutely fine with dying because my life is pretty much the same."

lonely,Imagine being school age and having no friends,"Imagine being school age and having no friends - I’m 19 and have no friends. Even in high school I had none. How tf do you manage to have no friends at the primary social age? And all the adults tell me it’s just gonna get worse after school because you have no opportunities to make friends once you get into the workforce and have no time or place to even socialize. So I guess I’m just gonna be lonely and a failure for the rest of my life (if I don’t end it all soon, which I probably will). Humans were meant to be social animals, yet here I am talking to myself just to keep myself company and from going insane due to lack of social interaction. I’m so desperate and I’ve tried THOUSANDS of times to make friends and always FAIL. They always leave me on read, never text back, never make plans with me, never speak to me again, talk shit to me or about me, etc. My friend on the other hand just has friendship applications falling in her lap. Doesn’t even really have to try. She claims you have to “bother” them, but you shouldn’t have to keep texting someone to make plans or get together with them. It should be mutual. But I guess coming from someone who has friends fall in their laps, it sounds easy. It honestly pisses me off because I’m just worthless/expendable to all my “friends”. If I’m busy with work or something, they can easily find one of their 20 friends to hang out with instead. Me? I only have maybe 1-3 options AT MOST. So if someone is busy? Or can’t help me with something? I’m FUCKING doomed and DONE for cause I have NO ONE and NOTHING.

I just don’t get it. I know something is wrong with me or this wouldn’t get happening. I just can’t take it anymore. It’s LITERALLY CRIPPLING ME mentally. No one should have to feel this way."
lonely,As an introvert with a crush on someone.,"As an introvert with a crush on someone. - It sucks. We barely know of each other. She certainly doesn't think about me as much as I think about her. 

I hate that I can even get like this with someone so easily, but the little I do know about her I like. She seems really cool and has a lot of interests that I am into. For example, cartoons and stuff. 

Well, I used to be into cartoons more, before I got really depressed once and all of my interests and hobbies were taken away from me.

She's also very cute and pretty. We only interacted a couple times though, and one of said times she actually went out of her way to approach me. She sarcastically said something to me to tease me, and I guess I was just having a bad day, was sad, didn't know how to respond, whatever. In the moment I took it as her making fun of me /bullying me.

Anyway, I replied with some ""you're annoying me"" type tone like I was really bothered by her :(. I felt bad and stupid for that because I don't even want to be that way. It makes me wonder if that made her think less of me.

I've already wasted so much time, just with my life in general. I always just do this and the truth is I'm never going to take any initiative or dare approach her. 

I'm incredibly insecure and anxious. I already assume she dislikes me at worst, or at least doesn't really have any thoughts about me at all. Even if I did, I'm out of her league and she probably is interested in someone else. In fact, I know that she was/is into my brother which kinda hurts. But either way it would be easy to find anyone better than me."
lonely,vent,vent - no one in my life gives two shits about me. I can’t remember the last time one of my so called ‘friends’ cared enough to check in on me or even ask me about anything in my life. just because I’m not having some crazy party college experience like they are doesn’t mean my life is insignificant. I spend so much time listening to their problems and talking about their lives and no one ever lets me speak about mine. its also hard to see them all get boyfriends/partners and become overly consumed by that too. wish more than anything that was me guess I’m just boring and unlovable

lonely,Found out my high school crush is dating the guy who bullied me.,"Found out my high school crush is dating the guy who bullied me. - I haven’t seen her in 5 years. She clearly liked me but I moved to another state before I could ask her out. On my last day of school, she told me to come find her when I was about to leave because she said she had something to tell me. When the bell rang, it was too crowded and I couldn’t find her anywhere, and my mom was waiting for me, so I ended up leaving without saying goodbye. 

I keep having these dreams about her where I always work up the nerve to ask her out, she says yes, we set up a date, the date goes well, and we either hug or kiss afterwards, then I wake up immediately after that, usually followed by depression.

I’ve been having these dreams for awhile now. I finally decided to look her up after the dream I had last night. I found out that she’s a model now and is literally fucking the guy who used to bully me in high school. He used to stab me with pencil’s in class and use is size to threaten me. He used to stick his finger in my ear and slap me because he said I needed to stay awake and pay attention in class when we would be watching a damn movie. He used to tell people that I was a public masturbator. I used to fantasize about beating the shit out of this guy and now he gets to fuck the literal girl of my dreams."

That's it, literally no one gives a shit about you. All I wanted was someone to talk to and someone to care about me but that just isn't a thing. I get treated like a doormat cause I'm desperate for friends but they just like playing with me and then ditching me. It's hard to accept no one cares but that's just how it is. No one cares about me and no one wants to know me. Even if I disappeared no one would look for me or even want to. 

I just wanted a friend."
lonely,Losing a friend.,"Losing a friend. - I used to spend a lot of time online with a friend. We never really met up a lot in person even though we had mutual friends. But one day we randomly started playing Call of Duty together and kind of bonded over that. We would play almost every night and I would feel sad if we could play. We would play other games with other friends in group situations but it was always nice if it was just the two of us. We would be on call and talk about all kodms of things. We didn't actually have a lot in common and wouldn't agree on most things so we'd end up debating stuff but even that was nice. But maybe over time I noticed how sour his personality was and maybe he was always like that. Or maybe I got tired debating with him since I felt like the debates wouldn't go anywhere. And maybe as he felt more comfortable he would say more and more agregious stuff, stuff that I wouldn't be able to ignore in good consciousness. Then these debates would turn into arguments. And then one day it got pretty bad and I knew that that would've been the last time I'd have spoken to him or gamed with him. At the time I felt nonchalant about it. I mean this wouldn't be the first time he'd lash out and then isolate himself, but he'd always come back. And I told myself that even if he didn't come back, if he never comes back then it'd be whatever. Then he never came back. It's been a year. Either he stopped coming online or I stopped checking. And I can't stand to play that game with anyone else. Who would I even play with? It wouldn't be the same. I miss him very very much. But I know that I would never reach out. Again, I couldn't, not in good consciousness. And I would hope that he would change, that he could change and be better but I also told myself that he also couldn't or wouldn't and that I'd have to come to terms with that. I really do miss him. I feel so bad not being able to talk to him. If I just could speak with him again I'd say ""Wow, I'm lonely. Incredibly lonely."""
lonely,So much pain is built up,"So much pain is built up - It’s so hard to let past stuff go. Ever since I was a little kid, I remember pain. It always comes back, in my mind. Being in elementary school, having a highschooler kick my ass in the dirt for fun. I don’t know why, but it’s what comes to my mind when I experience so much pain inside. I can understand a lot of things about myself, since I’m always interested in learning more about myself every chance I can, but it’s so hard to figure this one. I can feel the emotional pain in my chest, burning every time too. I have any anger, or sadness building up, yet I always cry. I don’t have a clue what it is, but I’ve always felt it since I was a child. I feel like I was built so different from everyone else, whether it’s mentally or what. Like I’m on a different level, not smarter or anything. Everyone says I have a gift, how my thought process is. Not being smarter than people, but how I understand things, people, or etc. to myself. I’ve been told I have so much apathy for others, and can understand almost anyone. Its more like a curse if anything, i feel it’s the reason I’m so alone. I feel more people see me as some kind of calculator, once they find the problem they’re done with me. I don’t feel like a human, I don’t feel anyone treats me like one. I’ve noticed that when I’m interested in a show, or movie. I tend to enjoy them because I project myself onto them, and convince myself that it’s my life. I know obviously it’s not, but I believe it anyways. It’s so much easier than believing the life I have now. I feel like it helps my mental health, both good and bad. It helps me feel attached to some kind of world, since I feel so out of my own. It’s so hard to enjoy this world, I see the best in everyone, and the potential they have including myself. Yet I can’t do anything about it, with others not wanting anything to do with me. Myself not having the motivation to, since I feel so unattached. I wish I knew what to think or do, my mind feels like a huge mess and empty at the same timr"

I'm looking for people who are interested in platonic and are around my age. Prefer from Canada/US (I'm on the west coast) but I'm open to other time zones if there's no serious language barrier. I only use discord and reddit.

My general interests are history, sociology, biology; random wikipedia articles, reading, games, anime. I learn conservative &amp; it'd be cool to find others with the same values.

I'm not socially anxious, and not a hermit. But I've been finding it very hard to meet new people, even online. I don't have a whole lot to talk about, as I've been spending a ton of time trying to make work/school more bearable. My down time is spent avoiding life via youtube.

Basically, I know what it's like to find yourself quite lonely, and be relatively unable to fix it. We could try a game (PC only), to break the ice."

I reached out to some of those friends and made new social medias in hopes to reconnect. Though they did add me back and accept my apology for being stupid enough to ditch them for a traumatized and mildly abusive girl, they don't seem interested in talking to me.
In the past 3 hours I messaged nearly all of them, and I haven't gotten a single reply, and though we only broke up days ago, I'm tempted to get back on dating sites just to have someone to talk to throughout the day, but I never got many matches on tinder or such.
I'm not really sure what to do to combat this loneliness. I don't know how to make new friends, and and I don't know how to fill my time without being reminded of her.
It doesn't help that after being with her, I've grown picky of who I talk to now, and have higher standards by leveling with her so much. 
I don't know what to do."
lonely,I have been alone for 11 years and face a moderate chance of staying that way for good.,"I have been alone for 11 years and face a moderate chance of staying that way for good. - I had a relationship Eleven years ago and it made me realiza that I needed time to understand myself.

I have friendships but my country went to hell so I had to leave it, thus leaving my family and my friends are scattered around the Earth.

Tho I'm a pretty sociable person, I am accustomed to my freedom of movement, personal space, inner thoughts and loner way of living, which comes from the acceptance of my character... However, being so adamant in knowing the realities of existence and finding my own purpose, along with the realization of deep inner truths and perhaps my nihilistic self, I have come to a bottom that I cannot seem to come out of:

A feeling of burden towards mankind somehow has taken over my mind where I want to help the world as much as is possible to utterly ridiculous extents and am not really able to do so... (fighting corruption and awakening minds takes a toll and being successful at it usually leads to an early death)

Which I find sometimes absurd that I would be almost obsessed with this idea. But such is the way of the soul.

On the other hand, I would just like to be ""a normal"" individual with a woman next to him that can bring a small family together, picture the ""dream"" (house in the outskirts, two or three children, dogs, cats, the whole nine yards) and just be content with fulfilling my biological and social human purpose (be born, grow, reproduce, die).

And perhaps we ought to find the simplest way to happiness and healthy complacency in order to live a healthy long life with cherished ones around you.

The difficulties of any loner or lonely individual apply to me: I have flaws and insecurities as the best of them.

But I feel I can overcome the ""common"" barriers of social courting with certain 'ease'. The problem lies within this idea deeply embedded within my brain that I should exhaust every possible thought avenue possible and commence a never-ending campaign towards improving humanity with all my energy, thus rendering my ""normal"" side behind and becoming the other thing.

Why not be balanced and do both?

Why not start doing this or the other?

Here come the issues I can perceive:

I am not within my own culture (Hispanic) thus the chances of a real long term relationship is lower than 10% (there data backing this up, don't remember where) 
And those who have left their original countries and/or alike cultures will understand what barriers this brings. 

I believe that my dichotomy underlies a probable mental condition (delusions of grandeur or alike) and might not be the only psychological difficulty I face (Adhd is a main suspect). This leaves me with the feeling of burden that the 'other half' might face in dealing with me. As I stated before I am very sociable but the more a person grows closer to me, the more aware I become of my shortcomings as a human and as partner. I might become colder, added than I'm somewhat already stern and silent. 

For the more common but not less difficult issues:

It poses as a somewhat difficult task to find that right person on this side of the world (Europe) since not only there are a myriad stereotypical misconceptions and just perceptions about my ethnicity and culture (some with basis, others mere speculation) that already make me self conscious when just thinking about approaching someone else around here. There also lies the fact that in all probability the chance I find that someone more or less aligned to my moral compass or that we may share at least the level of thoughts with solid enough compromise on keeping respect and understanding as a core of our possible union seems fairly low. Therefore the ratio of effort made:favorable result seems overwhelmingly imbalanced. 

I am not without vanity, although I'm definitely not what women nowadays demand for in the appearance of males, I have a fair share of features and racial qualities that have been appreciated and praised in consistently in the past. My confidence does not dwindle due to these facts, I simply am superficially out of the scope of what women look for. Namely, I'm not a tall person. 
Doesn't sound like big deal, but it would surprise the unaware (or the tall) how much is this overestimated as a physical feature over many others. 

And since I am not without vanity I also have a scope of what I want as my partner as well, which any sane person should have, naturally, the picker the narrower the chances of finding that person becomes. In my defense, I do not search for supermodels but I am attracted to the female body and standard of feminin beauty. Other than that of course what was stated above regarding our moral compasses aligning and her psychological/social qualities interest me as long as it is a person tilted towards good and justice, knowledge and progress. 

So... To sum up. I find that this recurrent discourse of vague calculations that I have almost unconsciously developed and keep running in the background has become a main detriment towards my impulse of approaching women. The instinct and want is definitely there, but the mind staves them off quickly after with 'it's not worth it' or 'don't waste her time' thought. 

I believe this is a very specific pitfall, and am doubtful of what approaches to use to surpass it. This, writing about on Reddit, is one ""outside of the box"" action I'm taking towards it. Although I'm not truly expecting anything out of it, maybe just reading it myself would help. But if I am honest, I would appreciate the human interaction. 

Other than that, I hope to anyone that reads this and is subscribed to this sub is able to find that significant other when the time is right, and if you haven't given yourself the time to learn about your inner mind I would recommend that you do, so as being a more complete individual when finding that cherished partner. 

Many thanks to you that read this,

lonely,i’m not even joking…,i’m not even joking… - i was at the mall waiting for a job interview and a little girl maybe like 5? comes up to me out of no where and she’s like “do you have a boyfriend?” and i’m like “no why??” and she points at this random couple and says “everyone has boyfriends why don’t you?” and i didn’t know what to say so i was like “i’m not sure why” and she was like “your pretty” with these big like puppy like eyes and it kinda made my day then her mom came but it was kinda funny like that was so random 😭
lonely,Feeling Lonely,"Feeling Lonely - For the past couple of months, I came to the realisation that people don't want to talk to me or have anything to do with me. No one in school talks to me since I'm the quiet one which means call me a school shooter and that hurts. I only have one friend but its an online friend and she recently got a boyfriend so she has had to cut down the time she spends with. Whenever I'm talking to her I feel happy I forget about my problems, but as soon as I can't, I hit rock bottom and get extremely sad. I try to socialise with people online but I get extremely nervous so I tend to be uninterested and that makes them not bother but I do want to talk to them. It's just everyday I feel the same, I get into bed and realise no one has texted me, nothing. Makes me cry myself to sleep."

Around thing time last year me and my ex broke up and I was in a pretty bad place but I got through it and now.. I'm feeling all the same things again it's like we broke up again or iv been in a time machine and gone back to that time.

I don't know if I'm happy or sad or what I'm just nube right now nothing makes me happy or sad and I just feel lost. I'm not talking to any new girls or trying to get a new girlfriend because I want to be happy with my self first and I'm not.

lonely,"It's all I can really do anymore. God, it hurts.","It's all I can really do anymore. God, it hurts. - I have no life outside of world social apps, like Vent, TalkLife and sometimes Reddit. I have no job (mentally unable to), no true hobbies, never caring or have found any excuses or interest to get me out of the house, which all leads to having no social life and limited validation, social opportunities, and compliments. 

It also doesn't help that I don't come off as interesting, fun or intelligent to people, with not enough physical looks to compensate and bring them in, nor the ability to change it or improvement. I'm absolutely screwed and have been for the past decade, with the limited affection and acquaintances I have made and received end up imploding, unhealthy or fall apart. It's beyond hopeless, with my confidence, self-worth, spirit, and mental health staying the same or steadily getting worse and more painful. More complex trauma affecting me and my core being. A living hell that is becoming more hopeless, damaging, desperate, and  complicated--unable to be remedied, fixed, or altered, even by many mental health professionals that stretched up well into the double digits over the past and ever-growing 17+ years.

As trite as it sounds, I'm all alone, by myself, unable to be understood by anyone, lost, exhausted, unlucky, irritatable, affection-deprived, and broken. I don't know what else to do. I don't know what else to do. 

All I can do is signal into the void, get lucky, and want to cry. I have nothing else. I have no one. No love. No life. No spark."

lonely,Just “broke up” with the only friend I’ve ever had,"Just “broke up” with the only friend I’ve ever had - Not once in my life up, up till 2 years ago, did I ever have a friend. I spent my elementary and middle school years bullied by my classmates and teachers alike. Even then, other than school, I spent my life in my room playing Sims or doing homework. 

High school was the same except I was homeschooled — even more isolated and stressed do to high expectations. The few years I went to college (online) went the same too. 

Years of social interaction other than family, a few social workers, and my dog.

And I was fine with that for the most part. I think fear, and not really experiencing anything else clouded my judgment.

Then two years ago I asked in some writing circles if anyone wanted to be my beta reader. One person answers and by pure chance I connected with her like I’ve never experienced with anyone else. 

It was during the beginning of the pandemic so she wasn’t working that summer (and i’m jobless) and we talked every single day. For hours on end. Always making sure to say good morning, goodnight — Never missing a day for almost a year. I think that summer  was the happiest I’ve ever been.

This is where things started going off the rails for me and her, I think. And probably where things get more unrelatable. 

We both joined twitter for a fanbase we shared. And she also started working more. Not talking to her didn’t effect me as much at the time because I got the small daily interactions I now had become used to with other people, and we’d still talk later at night. 

Slowly I realized how toxic the fanbase I was in, and a lot of the bigger accounts would bully others — especially if you didn’t conform to their particular tastes (which I didn’t have). It was very much a situation where if you didn’t try to make nice with them you’d be hated by the community (I promise this all is related to my vent).

tdlr after about 9 months i got harassed off the site and i slowly lost some friends after they made it clear they didn’t care about the bullying that their friends were doing to them, me, and many others. 

i could handle all this until my second closet friend on the site just chose my harassers over me bc she wanted to stay popular on the site. 

then on top of that my dog of 15+ years died. i still haven’t recovered.

so i took a break. and just like that i lost almost every single social interaction and friendship. not being on twt meant it was hard for ppl to keep in contact with me.

and after a month of being off there, it hit me that my best friend and me sometimes didn’t even msg good morning anymore, let alone good night. well, i would msg good morning — it usually went ignored until late. so i stopped. 

and it also hit me I’d been using twitter more and more to cope with me and her not being as close anymore.

i get she was busy. but it still hurt. especially when i saw she would go on twt in the mornings, and she made time to hang out with other ppl on there, but not me.

i spent a lot of time trying to rebuild our relationship. did my best to be understanding, recognizing i was just being jealous, and it’s my isolation that’s making me feel more intensely abt not talking as much. 

nothing was working. and i had felt more lonely than I’ve ever felt in my entire life. before the isolation and no human contact was easy to ignore. i hadn’t experienced what it was like to not be completely friendless and to communicate with others so often. 

and my best friend and me went about a week of not talking for the hundredth time, despite my effort. and i couldn’t do it anymore. i couldn’t repeat me messaging then her hours or days later responding, me responding soon after. and repeat.

i couldn’t keep being this clingy waiting for that notification that would tell my brain that she cared. because that’s what i was being. clingy and dependent. don’t forget being jealous and scared of being replaced. it was unhealthy. and making me complacent to keep living my life in my room. 

she deserves better, and so do i.

i “broke up” with her the other day. basically doing the whole “it’s me not you” bit, and finally saying the worries i had that i had been keeping inside, and that i need to branch out. stay away from online circles. delete all my apps. not talk to her anymore — at least until im in a better place and have other irl friends, maybe go back to school and actually go inside it instead of online. have a life.

this probably could’ve been handled better if i communicated my worries earlier among other things. but what’s done is done. 

i really do miss her. i’ve been crying nonstop. i feel just as lonely. and now i’ve realized how big of a hole i’ve dug myself in. I don’t have the 21 years of experience of making friends or existing in the world that other people my age do. 

It’s so overwhelming to know where to start. I can’t drive so maybe i’ll do that. Not even sure how people make friends outside of college so i guess i’ll just work on my application or something.

but this is all stuff that’s just to a point where i can make friends. ngl i just wanna speedrun this so i can stop feeling so alone. and honesty, so i can go back to being friends with her.

it all feels so bleak rn…but the first step is recognizing that there is a problem, right? so i guess i’ll leave this here with my first step taken. 

NOTE: just realized. For this vent I should mention that I am disabled! This should fill in some blanks for context."

They reminisce about the past and make up fake social scenarios in their heads much more than others do. They also become bias to their own internally-directed thoughts, which are more likely to be negative ones. So what can we do? Stay in the present? Face our social anxiety? Practice social interactions? 

Any thoughts?"

lonely,Haven’t felt this way in ten years,"Haven’t felt this way in ten years - I’m 32, been casually hooking up with people over the last ten years since splitting with my high school sweetheart of 6 years at age 23. 

Found a girl on Tinder three months ago that I had a real connection with. Things went fast. We were on the phone 24/7 with constant attention. We live two hours apart and met for the first time after a week. Spent every weekend together from then on with falling asleep over FaceTime every night we were apart. We were up each other’s asses hard.

We had a falling out this last weekend, I pushed her away, which led to us splitting and I’ve been really struggling without the attention. Making me sick. Can’t eat. Can’t sleep.

I had to completely wipe her from my phone and social media to cease all contact in an effort to get her off my mind. 

Normally would just fall back on a side piece but I don’t have any right now since I went exclusive with her. I’ve been waking up at 4:30am to workout and been diving into studying for an exam I have coming up.

I’m not used to feeling this way. Any tips on how to get this girl out of my head without finding someone else?"
lonely,Should I try and save this potentially toxic relationship?,"Should I try and save this potentially toxic relationship? - I met sunshine at university during our master's degree. We  both chose to study one of the hardest and longest routes to qualification in the UK. Sunshine was born in another country and grew up initially in a single parent household relatively hand to mouth. She moved to the UK when she was 6, her parent worked very hard and is now extremely well off, remarried and has another child. Sunshines step parent is lovely and they have a good relationship. However her family moved to America when sunshine started her first degree, she has a strange relationship with her mother who seems to compensate for this with money. My background is the picture perfect childhood, very supportive and loving parents, financially I have never wanted for anything although I wouldn't class our family as rich. 

Although sunshine grew up without much she is now very wealthy. We got on very very well at uni, we clicked and she was so much fun. Particularly important as our course was so intense and hard with extremely long hours. She's a little older than me and took some more time out working instead of studying so that she could follow her husband for his career. It was really important to me to qualify as fast as possible in order to get a better salary- I've always been upfront about this. Sunshine got engaged during our final year of our master's degree. She knew my plan was to do my diploma required to qualify fully asap after masters. She was planning her wedding and chose it on a date where I was booked into a residential weekend as part of the course. I couldn't qualify without attending this weekend of lectures. Her wedding venue was a 2.5 hour drive away and my lectures were 8-8 for 3 days. I was supposed to be her bridesmaid but I had to respectfully decline as I had already paid for the course when she announced the date. She was very upset and distant with me and asked if I would consider deferring my exams. 
I said no, this was something I had been working towards for 6.5 years and I was 1 year from finishing. I'd also already paid for the course and our salaries are crap until we qualify. I have a lot of student debt and wanted to progress. 


Sunshines entire wedding was extremely affluent, she had chosen bridesmaid dresses in excess of £300 each (which we were expected to pay for) a venue with a minimum 3 night stay at £280 per night. Plus hair make up hen do etc. I simply couldn't afford this as a student! This was the first issue in our relationship as I felt like she was slightly out of touch with reality and had turned a little bridezilla. Prior to this she had always been a little snobby but never to this extent. A few months after her wedding we did fall back into our normal routine and things seemed much better. 
However, over the last couple of years I feel like she has changed a lot whereas I'm still exactly the same person (personality wise). 

I had a rubbish time during covid 2020 with my employer and had to switch jobs as it had become untenable. A guy that sunshine used to work with was hired as my replacement. Sunshine has done nothing but bitch and complain about this guy for several years - I soon saw why when he joined my place of work as he was awful and I was scared for my clients as I didn't want to leave them in his hands but there was nothing I could do. Sunshine called me to chat and asked me how he was getting on. I then told her and ranted a little about how rubbish he was in terms of his attitude and she just completely 180d. she was saying I don't want any negativity I am close friends with this guy this makes me feel uncomfortable I don't know where you're coming from etc. I was so taken aback as she had brought this up and asked me. It turned into a bit of an argument over video call and I was very upset as I don't like confrontation or rowing. For me I felt like I didn't recognise the person she had become, we had always been supportive and compassionate to each other and she was so cold and detached. I distanced myself. Sunshine has recently turned to veganism, yoga etc which is absolutely fine, but she's become very very judgemental about anyone who doesn't subscribe to this. She has restricted herself from so many things even sugar and refusing to eat anything pre packaged! I do not subscribe to this lifestyle but I was very mindful to arrange lunch dates at places which would accommodate her etc. I felt like this was becoming a one way street and I was being judged and critised for just being myself- the person I have always been around her for years. My partner is a big meat eater, we love to entertain and go out for drinks, party etc when we can due to our stressful jobs but it became really difficult to include her in this.

I really pulled back further during 2021 as I have been having bad health issues and was waiting for an operation this year. She only wanted to schedule calls on a Thursday after work and it was extremely awkward I felt such anxiety on Thursdays trying to come up with safe topics of conversation that it was so draining. Due to work commitments it became virtually impossible to stick to such a rigid call routine and since July we haven't spoken at all. I stopped replying as I felt like I had nothing 'safe' to say. I didn't feel like I could share my health worries with her as my best friend because she was so judgemental and cold when I tried to broach the subject.

I feel awful. My parents regularly bump into her as we live relatively close by and she never asks after me so perhaps she doesn't care anymore? I feel such a loss for the friendship that we once had. My other friends have said that the relationship was toxic and said that I was trying to change myself around her to fit her needs. I agree with this to an extent as I felt so drained, but perhaps toxic is a very big word and not appropriate? I can't bear the thought of us ghosting, but I'm also so nervous to contact her to try and patch things up as there hasn't been a specific incident recently. I just stopped replying as I felt like I was being hurt and I didn't have the emotional capacity to deal with things due to my health worries.

Her birthday is coming up in a few weeks. Should I send her flowers and perhaps write her a letter explaining my feelings? She is very, very extreme about covid so I doubt that she would want to meet me for coffee unless it was outdoors (we live in England it's too cold for me to do this at the moment while I'm healing from surgery) 
 
Any advice would be so much appreciated and I'm sorry for how long this is!! There's a million more things I could say.

If this should be posted in a better suited forum please let me know!

lonely,A poem for my lonely people,"A poem for my lonely people - This world is dark and full of terror
I wander alone, scavenging, travelling off the beaten path
This life is lonely, dangerous, nothing but me 
If I am not enough, I’m sure to die 
But I’m not dead yet

A town I see, I do approach, it’s full of people happy 
I sit and watch, as people run and stroll and scurry
Laughter, talking, debating, bonding, what would I know about it
I’m just a lonely soul watching in envy as people shuffle proudly 

I take my stuff and journey on, the road is tough and hard
All that keeps me company is sadness and old scars
I think about the ways I’m hurt, how sad it is to be me
There’s no one here, nobody cares, just me, my scars and lonely

But I will not give up just yet, no matter how rough the road
No matter how hot it it gets, how windy, how painful, how cold
Cause one thing I have learned from this is living is not easy
The strong endure, we carry on no matter the odds against us

To all my brothers and sisters, I shine a light
Do not give up, not yet, we must continue to fight
Because for us it’s not yet done, you have so much to give
And maybe if you give to life, it will save a lonely soul like you or me

For a knight in shining armour has never had his steel truly tested."

lonely,What is wrong with me in particular?,"What is wrong with me in particular? - This isn't a sob story, or at least I'm not trying to make it out to be one. 
Growing up I've always had struggles with making friends, I HAVE friends currently, but most of them treat me like shit. As in, me asking if they wanna hang out, and they make some bullshit up how they're busy or they already have plans, and I see otherwise on their social media stories. Or only hit me up if they need something. Not all of them, other friends either just never text me, or leave me on read when I invite them to things. I have friends that invite me over to things, very rarely, but when they do it means the world to me because it's so rare that it happens, and I have friends that we talk sometimes or hang out like once a week or so. 
My big thing is I don't know why people don't like me. Ik one guy that everyone thinks is annoying and talks bad about, yet he is always hanging out with a group of people and always doing things. So I don't understand why I have like 2 friends I barely talk or do anything with. I see everyone has a friend that they're always hanging out with, like they're a brother to them. I don't. I want that relationship with a friend. I want that type of friendship, I try with new people I meet, and then will just never talk to me even after I try starting conversations multiple times. I'm not saying ""poor me I have no friends"" or am I saying ""I deserve friends"". 
Growing up I've realized I like being alone, cuz everyone is fake nowadays and toxic. But a small part of me still wants that type of brotherly friendship. 
I'm married to the love of my life, with 5 animals in a small apartment, I'm not ungrateful for the friends I do have, I just don't have someone I can talk to when I'm feeling down, or want to rant, (other than my wife, it's a different type of conversation with someone else and I still tell her everything). I'm not ungrateful for what I have. I just feel lonely outside of my wife."

lonely,Depression and IQ,"Depression and IQ - I’ve had depression since I was 11, I’m now 21 and wondering how depression has affected your affinity to keep your brain operating at an optimal level intellectually?

Before I was affected by depression I was in fourth grade and always received awards for academic excellence. But the following year my grades dropped to average and all in a short space of time.

What triggered me I think was when our house got repo’d and I remember crying so hard once it was time to move out. It was like my sense of security and stability got ripped out and I was struggling to find my ground.

I don’t have the energy to focus on my intellectual needs anymore as I feel you first need to have your emotional well-being in a good place first. 

It drives me crazy that I feel like my brain is degrading everyday and that I have lost all desire to seek knowledge and information. I just sound dumb when I speak these days hence I choose to not say anything at all."

I'm lazy and stupid and I make the same mistakes all the time. I'm embarrassed of how shameless I've been living sabotaging myself for all these years. 

I've been wasting away content and blind to how I'm my own worse enemy. I lie to myself and make excuses for myself and I cant keep doing it anymore. I'm an alchoholic, I might be narcissistic, I sabotage myself all the time. I always dig myself into a hole and try to put it out of my mind content and ignorant. I'm literally the ""This is fine."" Dog in the fire meme. 

I dont have anyone to tell them about this. I have some people to say sorry to, for always saying sorry and never actually putting an effort in to mean it. For the people I always let down in my life. These are empty words to those people because I've done this song and dance so many times. I cant keep doing it. I need to change I need to act like an adult, take responsibility for myself and actually do something for a change. 

I hate myself so much but I need to stop hating myself and start loving myself so that I can change. I'm a delusional idiot and I'm yelling into a void. I dont want pity, I've had too much of that and all it's ever done is encourage me to fail more."

lonely,"🥀My Story of Love, Loneliness and Content🥀","🥀My Story of Love, Loneliness and Content🥀 - If you manage to get through reading all of this, thank you for reading. If you have anything to share, please do anyway.. I loved this girl, we had this undeniable chemistry, she was the most beautiful soul I've ever met. We met through my older sister. Spent a lot of time together after that. It was love at first sight and I professed myself and she felt the same.. but wasn't meant to be when my sister found out. I told her it didn't matter what my sis thought of us but she told me it mattered to he cause she was her best friend. She then started calling me 'kiddo' as I tried persistently to convince her it didn't matter. Eventually gave into her wishes and we departed. She remained friends with my sister but we grew apart. As time went on, I've tried to find love in others but it wasn't the chemistry I found with her. A few years later, by chance we met again. We hung out and that spark reignited for me and she told me how she wished we had just stayed together. We would be married, maybe with kids.. and my feelings after hearing that began to feel that love for her again. But turns out she was already in a relationship of 4 years and she told me about him and how she loved him but it was falling apart. Her pure love of him kept them together, I gotta tell you I was jealous of the guy. He also had the same first name as me too. I thought wow, coincidence? Anyway, he cheated, abused and lied to her but she loved him unconditionally. Honestly, I would've given her the world. Anyway, I hate admitting this but I was a shoulder for her to cry on when he cheated and/or disappeared on her. Any excuse to be by her side. I was lonely. We would flirt but I couldn't bring myself to let her cheat with me the way she talked about him. But I continued to be there for her. I started feeling confused, I loved her and she knew this. One night, I realised this wasn't healthy for me or her so I gave her a reason to stop talking to me. We drank and I let it all out, I told her adamantly I was just a distraction for her and she was lonely, as was I but I never told her that. She got back with him eventually. I left the city and went back home to the sticks and stopped talking to her. I was destroyed but knew I did the right thing for the both of us. A year goes by, I finally get over her and move on. I think to myself, well Im ready to get back out there and have fun. So I did.. then she tracks me down out of nowhere with my sister to visit. She professes that she has always loved me and she finally broke her toxic cycle with her ex-boyfriend. She wanted to give me a chance after all these years and my sister told me she's speaking from the heart. I just thought it was weird that she would vouch for her after what she thought of us first time around. Again.. I was confused! I thought about it so I sat her down and kissed her. I look her in the eyes and said she once had me wrapped around her finger and told her it took a lot out of me to get her out of my head. I knew her heart belongs with someone else and my name would only bring her pain. That I would always be known as the other guy. It made her cry and made me feel a deep sadness. She'll never know how much I truly loved her and in a way, it was the closure I've been seeking. She was just lonely and had commitment issues as I know I did. I thought of her when I heard this and expresses how I felt at the time. I guess its better to have loved and loss than not at all. As Steven Stilles puts it as well, ""If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with"". My story of love loneliness and content. Thanks for reading."

And somehow i actually predicted that this was going to happen, because the past 2 weeks i feel like she has been avoiding me and not saying much. 

She still told me that we are still friends though, but idk if she's really telling the truth. She just blatantly admitted that she's no longer trust me anymore and wants to hide things from me now on. And hearing that just makes me so devastated and depressed. It was like shock to me. Can u imagine hearing that from your best friend? I never asked her why though, because im afraid the truth is gonna hurt me even more. She did say that she found new friends though, and she told me that she likes them very much and pretty much talking and having fun with them 24/7. 

Im not saying she's a bad person. She's definitely a really nice person. And its perfectly fine for her to be making new friends, but I just dont like the fact that she's distancing herself from me. I still remember how she told me that she was very grateful to have me and would never leave me. I just miss her so much and she was my only friend, the only person I could talk to.

22M, never been in a relationship. Farthest I've gotten with someone is about 3 dates in. Once they begin moving things forward into intimate territory (not just talking about sex), I never contact them again because for some reason everything about them gives me maximum anxiety. 

I'd say I have major depression, anxiety, chronic loneliness, etc. However I believe all these issues have the same root: Negative self worth. I have zero confidence, none. It effects my ability to socialize, how I work at my job, how I react to failures, basically everything I think and do. I'm not sure if my inability to develop a relationship past a platonic one is related, but hopefully it is. Has anyone realized something similar and made any progress whatsoever in improving their self esteem?

Now about the touch starvation. I cry myself to sleep about 80% of the time, and spend at least an hour or two each day ruminating on the fact that I've never been in a relationship. I'm not a virgin, but I am not focused on sex. I've told a few of my closest friends about this touch starvation, hoping that if we began hugging each other occassionally it would be enough to stave off the touch starvation well enough that I could focus energy on my other issues. It actually made it worse, and this makes me believe that it's intimacy starvation, not touch starvation. Has anyone got any ideas to deal with intimacy starvation? Other people obviously are not a reliable source lol"

It feels empty and hollow. All my joy has seeped out. When will I ever experience a deep connection with somebody which is what I’m yearning for with every inch of my being?

They dont feel shit for me. 

Im so alone it hurts. 

I just want a nerdy likeminded girlfriend, where we bond on shared values and maturity. 

Im not a clubbing person, I dont like drinking or drugs. I spend time with loads of people including girls, why am I constantly not being taken seriously? 

Its not like i dont have things going for me. I have plenty, career, passions, plans, I take pride in my appearance and  hygiene. Im outgoing. What the fuck.

lonely,Sick and tired of being a virgin.,"Sick and tired of being a virgin. - I am 20 year old male and I have never kisses, been out on a date, held hands or had sex and it really is just driving me to insanity mainly because of the way my peers in the past of treated me and bullied me over it, comments such as ''virgins are lame lmao'' really get to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I completely wasted my high school years and was extremely shy back then (I am on the autistic spectrum but only mildly) and I missed out on possible high school encounters and everytime I hear someone younger than me having sex or in a relationship I just snap and get upset/angry and have repeated thoughts all day long of fear/dread and regret.

&amp;#x200B;

I did have a girlfriend and I dated her for on and off for about 4 years however this was long distance as I never met her in person so I never got to experience anything intimate, unlike her who did in between our breakups. (she got laid when she was in high school) and I really got jealous over it and I felt it personally it strained our relationship. and looking now I still cannot get over it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know people will just say ''oh losing your v-card isn't important, oh having a girl in your life isn't a big deal'' well it is to me when allot of peers make it seem like a big deal while at 20 that I still HAVEN'T experienced these things. I don't see women as pedestals or objects. I do value them as human beings but I still haven't experienced what 80% of people have done by my age and it is just ruining my life totally, I cannot concentrate ever, I struggle to keep friendships if they have had these things, I often just cut things off.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been seeing professional help (3 different psychologists believe it or not) and I explain and they just tell me to get out in the community more which I have been doing but with 0 confidence left, insecurity about my appearance. hurtful things said to me by peers and my ex, How could I ever woo a girl? I feel my depression will get worse and worse and worse and I will never be happy and never get to experience encounters that is all part of evolution.

lonely,A quote I found on the internet,"A quote I found on the internet - Realize one thing and remember it well:

Your pain doesn't matter. Your sadness doesn't matter. Your depression doesn't matter. Nobody cares, and no one is coming to save you.

You are a child, alone, and crying on the floor, hoping somebody will come and help you get out of the hole you're in, and take you away from the pain and the burden you call your life. But no help is coming, and no greater force is looking over you.

It's just you.

You need to realize that it's just you that cares for you. If you don't get up and get things done, nobody will come and do them for you. All of your pain comes from hope. The hope that somebody else will carry you through the pain and it's even more painful because nobody is coming and even if they wanted to, you are the only one who can help you.

So accept it.

Get up, do the things you need to do to make your life better, to make yourself happier. Nobody can tell you when you will be truly happy again, but you can be assured that struggling while standing up will feel alot better than struggling lying on the ground."
lonely,"Everytime I think I am lonely, it just only gets worse","Everytime I think I am lonely, it just only gets worse - You know, I always felt pretty lonely ever since I was a child. Had like three close friends and felt like that's not enough, I suppose?

Well, guess what. Ever since then it only got worse and worse. I went from having three close friends in primary school, to having two people that I talked to but never felt really connected to in high school, to literally never talking to anybody throughout the whole week in college. 

I do have a boyfriend now, who is my only friend, and considering how the trend is going for me, I am terrified of losing him too. He has a bunch of friends and I feel like I am sort of holding him down when it comes to social life. When we're not together
I am always completely and utterly alone.

The worst part is I don't think there is something inherently wrong with me. I don't have anxiety, I have lot of thoughts and can actually have a decent conversation when it comes to it. Everything that happened to me is due to my choices and its my fault only. I never felt this shitty before and I am prepared that it will only get worse for me."

Even throughout school and on car rides.

lonely,Big decisions ahead and feeling overwhelmed,"Big decisions ahead and feeling overwhelmed - I don’t even know where to start so sorry if this is all over the place.

My husband and I have been together 7 years and married for 4. We have opened up the relationship a couple of months ago and it’s definitely been a learning experience. I have found a boyfriend who is really important to me and he has a girlfriend now.

There have been a lot of discussions since I felt that my husband was prioritizing her over me. We all met up for a weekend and he was holding her hand in front of me when I specifically had told him not to. Granted, I didn’t react well to it and stormed out instead of pointing out the boundary he was crossing calmly. He also was drinking so I wanted to cut him some slack.

Then last week, I visited my boyfriend for the first time. Since I was going out of town, I agreed to letting my husband invite his girlfriend to our apartment but established a strict boundary that she couldn’t be in our bedroom. She had gotten a tattoo and was in pain so he didn’t want her to sleep on our cramped couch so instead, he decided to let her sleep in our bed and had sex with her in it. My trust in him is utterly destroyed.

We’ve been talking things over for the past few days. I can’t bring myself to tell him I love him or let him touch me.

He told me what happened on Wednesday when he picked me up from the airport, which was also the day she left to go back home. Then on Friday night, he asked me if he could go see her since he knew I would be busy with my gaming stream. He came back Saturday around 8pm and we had dinner together. We hiked together on Sunday, watched a movie and grabbed ice cream then he asked if he could go see her until Tuesday morning. Granted, I spent that extra time with my boyfriend, gaming online.

I just feel like he betrayed me and I’m supposed to just figure it out on my own. I don’t feel supported in a time when he should be there for me. On the other hand, my boyfriend has been extremely understanding and supportive. Letting me vent and treating me to dinner even if it’s not in person. 

It makes me feel that my husband takes me for granted and that my boyfriend is a much better partner to me. It’s just frustrating and confusing since this relationship is so new. I’m scared that I’m falling into a grass is greener trap or that I’m letting go of a long relationship without fighting for it enough. Relationships are hard work but is it worth it when I’m letting go of my pride and self respect?

My husband had cheated on me in the past, he came clean and we worked through it after I understood that he felt abandoned by me as I was focused on a close friend.  The fact that he was so ready to risk our relationship again makes me feel worthless and that I’m not enough for anyone.

Sorry for the wall of text but I just needed to let all these feelings out! I have therapy on Friday so I will be getting help for my obvious self worth issues haha"

Every day is a new challenge I have to survive.

lonely,I yearn for companionship...,"I yearn for companionship... - I have never been popular in my life. When growing up, I was always the shy girl who had a couple friends here and there and usually spent time alone because I didn't like attention from others my age. I was into the arts and drew a lot on my free time. I grew up with 3 brothers and mostly male cousins and family members. I found it difficult to hang out with girls because I wasn't super girly but also not totally hoyden. In high school, I made a best friend who was like me in many ways but as we grew up together, we grew apart. She turned into one of the ""mean popular girls"" and I stayed true to myself. I made a good friend who is a male, who I consider my best friend. When we graduated, I had few friends who kept in touch for a couple months. Once college started the only friend I had was my male bff. Sadly, he doesn't go to college and we both have lives to attend to so we rarely see one another. 

I often think about joining sororities or clubs to make social connections, but often times is hard because of COVID. I haven't had a good laugh in years, I have been single for years, I haven't had a good female friend in years... I am lonely. 

I went through a depressive phase 4-5 months ago. It wasn't good, but I got through it myself. I have trouble staying in the present reality when I am in social situations and it feels like I am self sabotaging, but for some reason I can't control it. I feel like an outcast, like a weirdo. I often look back in high school and reminisce over my relationships. I have come to the conclusion that no one really cared about me. I have always been the loyal friend who no one takes a deeper glance at. I don't understand why people aren't attracted to me, on a social level. I am approachable and personable, never hurt a fly.

I wonder who my group of people are, because I long for relationships. I think that if I had a sister we would be best friends, and I wouldn't need anyone else, but that's fantasizing. I long for female companionships because we would relate better, not to say that I don't appreciate my male bff because I do. 

I'm tired of being lonely. It's exhausting."

lonely,"I just want to be lonely, and I realize it’s never going to get better so I’m going to embrace it","I just want to be lonely, and I realize it’s never going to get better so I’m going to embrace it - I have been lonely my entire life, struggled to connect with people, I was abused, and I was bullied as a kid no shocker. I got assaulted/raped recently and no one was there to comfort me or even said they were sorry this happened to me, because I have no one  who actually cares about me. I genuinely have tried so hard to not be lonely but I just fail miserably, I try so hard to connect to people and I can’t, people say I take things so out of proportion and don’t understand me, like I have given up, I feel like I ruin every relationship and try to be a good person, and it just doesn’t work, so I’m just going to embrace it. I already work a job where I’m alone/loneliness is part of the description, I live alone, I don’t really have friends, I don’t like or really have any connection with my family. I can’t have any romantic or sexual relationships. I only have my cat. I live in a big city so I don’t have to interact with people to get things done. There have been weeks where the only person I talked to meaningfully or really at all was my therapist. Im just going to embrace my utter loneliness, I’m mourning a life I could of had, but it’s just easier this way. I’m not going to try to get better or try to connect because it always fails. It’s painful but for the best to not get my hope up anymore."

lonely,How to stay positive with no one to rely on?,"How to stay positive with no one to rely on? - I am a single child (28F) to a single mother. My grandparents help raise me, but passed on when I was young. Most of my life it has been just me and my mom.

The issue is my mom isn't... she doesn't really feel things the way most people do? She lacks awareness, sensitivity and emotional maturity, I guess. While she isn't intentionally cruel for the most part, it really hurts. She is distant and puts little to no effort in maintaining any of her relationships (though she does get heartbroken once she notices a relationship has withered away). She is incredibly paranoid, to top it off. The older I get, the harder it becomes to be doing like 95% of the emotional legwork in our relationship, especially when she is in a particularly stubborn or difficult place. My entire life I've been her therapist, housemate, shoulder to cry on, hell, plenty of times I felt like the parent in our relationship. It's exhausting and as time passes, my own baggage piles up and I'm not sure how much longer our relationship can maintain before she cuts me loose in a fit of paranoia or I reach my limit. This is incredibly depressing - despite our issues, I love my mother. She is practically all I have. I am unsure how to operate emotionally on my own. It's frightening, like jumping off of a ship in the middle of the ocean without a life jacket.

TL;DR: Has anyone else struggled with an emotionally dependent single parent, and the potential pain of losing them as a part of your life? How did you cope with it?

lonely,ALONE,"ALONE - alone alone. condensed

Wife moved on instantly and it eats at me CONSTANTLY

sudden realization of having not a single person who cares

no friends

no confidence

no self worth

afraid of socialization and meeting new people

0 tinder matches

family distanced enough where i dont think i matter

the only reason i am still here is i have young kids that keep me somewhat busy

i feel nothing.

there is no joy in anything i do anymore

video games give me nothing anymore

i used to watch any nfl game with enthusiasm, now i cant pay attention to a game

masturbation helped me feel something but now i cant even do that

I thought having sex with a random woman or escort would give me something, but i think it would sink me lower.

not sure what to do anymore, life is so emotionless and i have legitimately 0 people to tell all of this without feeling like a whiny bitch"
lonely,Care turns to hate.,"Care turns to hate. - 
I work at Walmart for now. and this post will only be up for a few hours. 

Girl. Works upfront she’s cool and all. 
Me. Works in a few departments and can’t see her too often but wants to be her friend.  

So I’ve tried to walk up and talk but mainly it’s been me giving her gum and being like how are you.  Little chat. Leave. A day ago it was bigger. I asked if she was thirsty so I bought her a sprite and a whole pack of gum cause I just do things like that for my friends that’s normal for me. 
We have called eachother friend a few times. This has gone on for like 2 weeks. But yeah. 

And the issue we have is I was like we should call soon if you have the day off as I do.. she did. 

Because we would be able to actually fucking talk. Oh yeah btw she has my number. 


But no. Today it didn’t happen and I did call her. 
It didn’t happen and it made me very upset. 

Why? Because I have no one. I have no friends. 
The only friends I have are far away and don’t have time to really be friends with me. 

So what do I do. 

Because what I thought I would do is: 

Not talk to her tomorrow (or the next day or the next or the next) at all. Unless she comes to me.  And that’s that. 

But I don’t know

lonely,I'm just relationship repellant,"I'm just relationship repellant - I don't want to sit here and pretend that I'm suffering as much as other lonely souls do. I'm likeable on the surface. Friendly, sometimes outgoing, plenty of interests, funny on occasion, handsome in the right light sometimes. I can be the life of a party with a light buzz. The performer in me makes me good in crowds I suppose

But...I just don't hold up interpersonally. Maybe i'm boring to people. Maybe it's my ADHD.  I'm not really sure. 

I just like the presence of someone when I'm alone with them. Listening to their reactions during a movie. Laughing with them when they make a joke or find something funny. Listening to their problems. If they ask me something, I'm happy to answer it. But I don't want to play twenty questions trying to get to know you. I just want to be with you.

My public persona seems to convince people that I excel at leading conversations. In reality, if I'm alone with someone I don't want to perform. I don't want to make small talk. I want to be myself. I want to let my mind wonder so I can experience the feeling of narrowing down to the thought of the person I'm without needing to force it.

I just want to be allowed to be boring with someone if I care about them. People don't seem to like that. I know it's a problem with me. There's a social process before getting to the point where being interesting doesn't matter anymore. I just really struggle with the in-between.

The last person I developed feelings for really messed with my head for a bit. She made the first move, and I grew to adore her. There was in her heart a warmth for others and while she had her flaws, they were easy to accept. I was happy to be around her and she made me want to be a better person. And then she stopped talking to me and found someone else. 

She's still a wonderful person in my eyes, but the feeling that I had something but couldn't be normal enough to see it come to fruition (good or bad) makes me sad. That I can't hold up to my own public image.

I don't see a relationship in my future, but there are still other things I know I can bring to this world. I can still change the world, even in small ways. This opens up a door for me that I've dreamed of since I became an adult. When I have the means to support it, I will probably come to adopt some children. I can dedicate what remains of my life to create a brighter future in kids who may never have known what it was like to be loved and supported. Something I know would likely be an issue in any relationship where kids are on the table

It's a strange silver lining, I know. But it's something. And I hope fellow lonely souls find one too."

lonely,My body has ruined my life.,"My body has ruined my life. - I posted this on the depression topic, thought I might post it on here too :( 

I broke up with someone I met online, we were both madly in love with each other. This person was like no other in the world, we were perfect for each other. I’ve never been cared for or loved like that before, and i’ve never care about someone like that before. I made us part ways before meeting because I knew we wouldn’t just go out for dates. If we had sex he would’ve seen my body. 

I used to be morbidly obese, I’ve lost the weight but my body’s ruined because of it. Not only that, but the way my body looks regardless, its naturally extremely ugly. No exaggeration, it really does look extremely ugly, I would describe it but I literally don’t even know where to begin. 

It definitely would have put him off. 

I’m so digusted by the appearance of my body that I never even look in the mirror, let alone let anyone else see me naked, it makes me feel sick, and would make anyone else feel sick, if I were someone else, even I wouldn’t have had sex with me, thats how bad it looks. 

He deserves better. He deserves beautiful, and i know thats what every guy needs. I didn’t want to be selfish and hold him back in this regards, so I made us part ways before we met in person. I made us break up without a proper explanation. 

The level of mental and emotional pain I feel right now after losing this person, someone I loved unconditionally, more than anyone else I’ve ever loved, and respected so much, is unbearably torturous. 

I’ve never felt so unstable before in my life. I feel so alone, I feel suicidal, I feel very sick mentally. I have no one to turn to. 

I’ve always been depressed, but this person no longer being in my life is what pushed me completely off the edge. I feel guilty for causing him pain by ending it, but I know that someday he’ll forget me and be able to move on and find someone new. That thought breaks me.

I don’t think I can live without him, I don’t think I can grow old completely alone and misreable without a partner, without a family. Being alone like that while watching everyone around me able to live their lives is my biggest fear. 

My body has ruined my life, it’s taken away the chance to be with the love of my life too. How pathetic is that."

lonely,A one year update on my loneliness,"A one year update on my loneliness - A year ago I posted a thread [for one week, I wasn't lonely](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/kjzw3f/for_one_week_i_wasnt_lonely/). This is an update on how this experience changed me, and where I am now, as well as the lessons I've learned along the way.  For those of you too lazy to read the thread, I will summarize it for you: I thought I started a relationship with a wonderful girl and it changed my life, but she thought we were just jokingly planning a future together. These were my feelings at the start:

&gt;I felt motivated. It seemed so strange. You know that dark veil that you see when you try to look ahead into the future? It was gone. I started working out again, had to put on some weight and muscle. I remembered my ambition. I am a postgrad student and I had nearly given up prior to this. There are three years of research in logic I've done that I haven't published. I used to happily spend the entire day thinking about that stuff while drinking tea and pacing through the house. It's been so long since I've done that. I faced some failures and got scared. But now, when she says she believes in me, it felt like I couldn't let her down. And funnily enough, after looking at it again after so long, I've had a breakthrough in my research. A lot of good things happened so quickly. I made some phone calls, and I even demanded a promotion from my job.  
&gt;  
&gt;And you know what's really funny? I always thought it's really selfish to have children. How could I possibly drag someone into this world, and condemn them to be living, when I myself didn't think it is particularly worth it? But we were talking about starting a family and making this a serious relationship. I told her, I couldn't believe this is what it's like when you have something to look forward to in the future.

And then she broke the news that she was just kidding, and that she wasn't really looking for a relationship. It broke my heart, but I was optimistic about healing:

&gt;What happened sounds like a nightmare. But strangely enough, if I could rewind time and stop myself from doing this, I wouldn't do it. I am glad I misunderstood her. It hurts, but it feels good to be hurting. For the first time in so long I have realized what it takes for me to stop being sad and to look forward to the future in a genuine way. A flame was rekindled within me, and I thank her for it, even if it was done so by an accident. I'll continue working out, and I will finish my studies. It's good to be reminded that I don't hate life itself, just the one I am currently living - and I can change that if I just brave through it.

I have remained close friends with her over the past year. We still talk regularly and I deeply care about her, although now in a non romantic way. She apologized for the entire ordeal, and we moved past it. This experience led me through some emotional rollercoasters and toughened me up. Overall, I thought that it made me more resilient when it comes to trying my luck in love. After all, what could possibly go worse than being in a relationship and then finding out it was just for a joke?

Either way, this is why I wanted to try falling in love again. I knew that I looked forward to the future when I thought I was in a relationship, so I wanted to have that again. There was a girl who really liked me at the time, and I thought that I should give her a chance and see if it leads us anywhere. We quickly made a connection and started dating. However, our relationship was overly sexual, and any time we disagreed it would turn into a huge deal. Three months later, she cheated on me, and I broke up with her. As bad as this sounds, it wasn't so terrible. I feel like an awful person for saying this, but I feel like we were both mentally checked out of the relationship before it happened. I still talk to her from time to time, and we rely on each other emotionally in tough times, but I wouldn't call us close friends.

A couple of months afterwards, I started talking with a really nice girl. I've known her for a few years prior to this, but we've never really been close. It was incredibly difficult to earn her trust, but we shared so many hobbies and it is really nice to talk to her. She's funny, she's cute, she's smart, she's caring. If you bundle every good quality you can think of into one person, that's her. I would marry her if I could, but you see that's the trick: I didn't know she's a lesbian. We still talk daily and are great friends. She's had a profound influence on who I am as a person and on my beliefs. But once again I was unlucky.

In the meantime, I had some quicker-lived attempts too. I chatted up three friends and it turned out that all of them had long term boyfriends.  

Last but not least, I offer to you my final failure. There's a really caring girl that I've known for years now. She would check up on me when I felt sad. If any one of family members died or got seriously sick, she would be there and help me deal with it. We have recently been talking more and more, and I found myself slowly developing feelings for her, all while I helped her deal with her trauma and abuse. However, today when I joined a new discord server, I accidentally found her there. I couldn't resist the temptation of looking up her messages, only to realize that her personality is a lot different to how she had been presenting herself to me. Not only that, but she's had a boyfriend for four years that she hasn't mentioned to me, despite me asking if she was single, and giving her opportunities to mention him. I left the server, and am feeling like I've just eaten a sock.

At this point all I can say is, fuck lessons. Fuck having to constantly rationalize bad experiences and trying to grow from them. I am really tired of trying. I promise I'm really trying. But life really can't throw me a bone from the looks of it. I don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, and I don't know where to look for a girlfriend anymore. You see, one year ago I was full of hope thinking ""if I really just tried, I could get out of this mess"" but now I see that the pit is deeper than what I naively thought. Even when I try, I can't seem to get out of it."
lonely,Change almost feels impossible,"Change almost feels impossible - I (early 20) had reached out to a bunch of new people and I was wondering why no one really wanted to meet past a couple times. Then I thought maybe it's because I'm not really offering what they want in the friendship. (Like I want to meet and I don't know if they) And it wasn't because I didn't offer, it was because I didn't know what they want/they wouldn't say/I couldn't. 

I felt like everything socially was taken from me, now how I had to battle whether my family is there for me or not, years of trying to make friends, doing therapy and not having results; I don't know, it's hard to want to really be there for people if it's not reciprocated. And sometimes it is the first few times but then it falls away and they fall away and maybe it's self-hatred or something from all the negative internal voices I had to hear and now I get to wonder how to change that from years? Just thinking of all the work I had already put in, and how I still couldn't make myself want what I wanted or how the roots may have gone down into the child where the effort for change required I can't help but think it is almost impossible. 

I am literally reaching out, and they are not wanting to meet, I've been doing this for years if it has to go down to the way I'm reaching out or what I'm suggesting then the process is hopeless, but I know it's not which drives the frustration (and the anger)."
lonely,I’m lonely with a headache,I’m lonely with a headache - I’m tired
lonely,I just want to feel appreciated,"I just want to feel appreciated - I have no friends. In a literal sense. I have zero friends.

I've had a rough year. High school is mammoth pain in the ass and everyone around me is either boring and uninteresting, or just plain horrible. I'm in grade 12 now but I have had problems with my emotions for a while, specifically moderate depression and mild anger management issues, both of which have gotten worse with the latter of the two taking a toll on my life. I feel unbelievably angry over the smallest and most insignificant things. It could be the volume of the classroom, what people are talking about, the smell of someone's perfume, or the fact that we're in school. I'm always angry and always lonely and I don't know what I can do about it. There have been incidents where the anger got to an unhealthy level and there were some altercations.

It's been a persistent problem throughout my childhood. One that began to drive me and others apart. It doesn't help that I'm also a huge nerd about anime and death metal, interests where I have yet to find one person who really likes at least one of the two. I can't relate to anyone and as a result, I stopped trying to be friends with anybody at around grade 10.

Most of the friendships I did make at the time either grew boring, or we simply stopped talking when they moved away. I've never had a longtime friendship that lasted more than 1-2 years.

Honestly, I'm scared that I'll either never find a meaningful relationship, drive away those I do find, or even end up in prison as a result of my emotional problems. I feel trapped at school and have considered skipping but haven't followed through. 

I'm lonely and scared for the future.

I want to see people who are excited whenever I enter a room instead of going away. I want people I can sit around who can make me laugh and smile. I want people who don't avoid me or try to escape a conversation with me.

I want to be happy.

I will lose everything. What breaks me is that i have to do this for the rest of my life. You know, wake up, go to work, come back to an empty house and repeat. I do not want this. I dont want any of this."
lonely,I’ve never had a single sexual experience and I’m 21,"I’ve never had a single sexual experience and I’m 21 - Hi all,

I’ll be using a throwaway for various reasons. 

I am starting to get really depressed that my time will never come. Even though I’m a good looking guy and have a good personality, I feel the girls I’m attracted to are not at all attracted to me. I go to a big party school where frat culture is very prominent. I live in a house with my friends (who are all in a frat - I’m the only one that didn’t get in) and they can’t invite me to anything since only females are allowed in. Along with that, my roommates (including the girls) all pregame at my house and I’m left out of that too. 

The reason why I brought up the frats is because the girls around here only seem be interested in frat guys. Also my school is predominantly white and I’m Indian so that could play a role too. 

I’ve only ever made out with a girl once. Every weekend my roommates come home with stories of who they got with and it makes me so jealous. It’s getting hard to handle being alone. 

Sorry I had to vent this out. It’s a uncomfortable situation for me."
lonely,Is it ever going to get easier?,"Is it ever going to get easier? - I feel totally flat. I try to keep the depression and loneliness away, but no matter what, it finds its way in. I’ve been on and off meds, gone to therapy, and none of it helps.

I feel like I’m stuck on a carousel watching everyone spin around me in their happiness, and I can’t catch a second of it. I’m sick of being by myself with no support system. I’m sick of feeling so low and soul crushingly hopeless.

you’d think after years of dealing with this it’d get easier to cope with, but I’m struggling so much. god, I just wish one person truly cared."

Hope everyone here has a great day tomorrow 💕"

I feel like because my boyfriend doesn’t live in the same city as me and I only have a couple friends to talk to where I live, I just constantly feel unhappy and like I’m not really living life at all. I have school, which helps somewhat with that because I like my program, but since covid I’ve had a much harder time making friends in classes so I don’t really have anyone to talk to there either. aside from talking to my boyfriend over the phone and hanging out with my two friends here sometimes, I just don’t have much to do with my time and it constantly leaves me feeling sad. I’m trying to get into more of my hobbies again like reading and cooking, but I don’t want to constantly feel like my life is a failure because I don’t really have close friends to share it with."

lonely,(You won't read this),"(You won't read this) - You won't read this, not only because this very sentence is my petty attempt at reverse psychology, but because what I'm about to talk about is very boring.


Chess used to be named Chaturanga, which is a sanskrit word translating to ""the four limbs"", which alludes to four military divisions. The divisions: Infantry, elephantry, cavalry, and chariots. The elephant in Chaturanga, later changed to the bishop in the 15th century, moved diagonally two squares at a time. When the elephant became a bishop, it could move as far as it wanted, no longer restrained to the two square rule. This new rule, along with the advent of the queen and other rules, intensified chess play as games became significantly sharper, shorter, and ultimately more consequential. The elephant, an animagus, became more powerful as a bishop.


In chess, pieces which have access to a high number of squares are generally considered stronger than pieces controlling a low number of squares. Like I said, the bishop moves on the diagonals as far as it wants to. Unlike the knight, which can hop over shit, the bishop can be obstructed by pawns and other pieces, limiting its scope on the board and the number of squares it has access to. Are you asleep yet? It's interesting, you know. The knight and bishop have the same point value (3) and are generally considered equal, but they are good at different things, and are preferred over one another depending on positional circumstances. A bishop is considered stronger than a knight in the ""endgame"", which is when most of the pieces have been removed from the board. Because? Wait, are you listening?? I knew you weren't paying attention. Dumbass, the bishop is stronger in the endgame because that is when it is least obstructed!


Here's the point. I wondered why the simple acquisition of space made the bishop stronger. It's obvious, isn't it? The question is self-explanatory. Apparently self-explanatory. The question seems to answer itself because ""space good"". But what happens in that space that is so important? ""Because you can attack more!"" seems to be the obvious answer. In fact, I've heard this space axiom communicated roughly through the question: ""How many squares does your piece attack""? 


This gets worse. And it's not going to be worth it when you're done reading, either, which is why you aren't reading this. Which is why you stopped reading! Which is why you never started reading. Your ass is stinky.


Ok ok, here's where it gets even more boring. I made you a diagram. I'm really sorry. [Refer to this image.](https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/contents/view?contentsToken=1635202251246LOEv31p&amp;currentIndex=1&amp;linkUrlVersion=V1) Notice the bishop's potential squares branch off into potential squares. Every square you ""attack"" is a square which you can go to, which itself contains a number of squares you can go to. Not only do the movement possibilities of your bishop increase exponentially when her obstruction level decreases, but the possibilities abruptly shift when your bishop actually moves.


The hard part is over. Congratulations on reading like three paragraphs, genius. Now let's go over some key terms:


space

movement

possibility


I'm sure you're anticipating a nauseating metaphor now, and how could I not take the opportunity to hurl allegorical shit at you when chess is such a powerful and quintessential starting point for symbolic thought? I've been really depressed lately. I don't like to talk about it, so I don't. When you're alone everyday, alone with your thoughts, there's this sort of quietness that settles within your heart. And you feel still. And time becomes serrated. And you think of all the reasons you're alone. And walls begin to close in on your consciousness. After what we have all been through during this bullshit pandemic, I'm sure you all can relate on some level. I think about what I am doing here. I think about how I was once not alive, and now I am alive, and then I will no longer be alive again. In the context of time, even a long life is a flicker in the sky. I went on a date this summer. I asked my date what made her life worth living. She told me she was born with a natural desire to live. To live through such a time of isolation, and to come out of it only to hear someone actually say something like that... I still don't understand. The subject of conversation naturally changed and I continued to eat my tacos. 


space

movement

possibility


I take comfort in this system as a metaphor. It's so natural and obvious. It's weird the things you don't see until you're ready to see them. I think as human beings we are, for whatever reasons, inclined to reject possibility under the pretense that what we already have is working for us just fine. And that's cool, and that's fine, but we are products of what we have seen and experienced. What happens in the space outside of ourselves, outside of what we see? I think some seriously vital truths are always in a state of natural deviation from our individual journies for self-actualization. I am tired. I feel like fucking shit, and I'm so tired of feeling like I'm not able to say that outloud for fear of coming off as some kind of defeatist sadboy. Let me break it down: Where I come from, deciding that life is not worth living is deemed a medical emergency rather than an informed opinion, and I can tell you from experience: people don't like being around you when you are down, ugly, poor, or wrong, as if all of these things were not consequential of a natural process which exists beyond ourselves and our dumb opinions about anything.


If you're reading this, know that you are not alone in your loneliness. Imagine your loneliness as a new square. Space. See the possibilities and feel confused. Feel the instability and discomfort. Admit to yourself loneliness is the wooziness of some kind of freedom. Take pride in your blunders, because not everyone is capable of admitting to fault. Take reality at your own pace, be good, and have the integrity to recognize when one inhibits the other. If you are not confused, then we have nothing in common, and I like you. Life is a flicker in the sky. Emptiness is space. I don't know about you, but I'm here to do some cool ass shit."

I don't know how to go and make new friends. I mean I could sit at a coffee shop and ....wait for someone to notice me.... but that wouldn't really be realistic would it. I'd be waiting for a century.

Nobody keeps me hear but I've just secluded myself from the outside world so much. I hate people and purposely distance myself because I know I have pyshgcopathic tendancies, but im just so lonely and depressed. I used to be a severe alcoholic and my body is breaking down too :(

I fight a struggle knowing that I want friends and people to talk to, but at the same time I just know i'd end up trying to manipulate or abuse them down the line.... idk what to do... and no a doctor or therapist is no option as I have no money to my name as i dont work or have ever had a job (I live in a 2nd house paid for by my mom, alone since i was 15)"

Few hours ago she texted me she saw her ex again last weekend… And she wants to take a step back from me. I haven’t been in a single serious relationship yet, nor had the chance to show who I fully am to a girl. It always ends up like this before it even gets to that… I don’t know what to do or think anymore. This just puts my social anxiety and insecurity even more into the ground again. 
Why is it so hard to find that 1 other person that cares for you in a different way theb anyone else, do I even deserve it"

i sound so desperate but i can't stand this anymore omg
i can't live without conversing whatsoever it's driving me crazy"
lonely,Where do you find the girl of your dreams again?,"Where do you find the girl of your dreams again? - My girlfriend left me on our two year anniversary. We spent all this time together in lockdown and I felt I met the girl I wanted to marry. She didn't feel the same. 
I do rockclimbing. I read comedic poems at poetry nights. I go out and party. But I still feel like, at this rate, I will never find someone for at least a few more years.
I know being alone can also be good for you. But where can I find a girl to talk to during these sleepless nights? Is reddit a good place to meet girls? XD (probably not right?)"
lonely,Can I Tell You About Her?,"Can I Tell You About Her? - God. She's beautiful. Everyday she's always been beautiful. A beautiful soul, a beautiful woman. A beautiful human. And faithful and Godly woman as ever could be. And look at her. She's so beautiful.

And happy.

It was her wedding and I've never seen a smile like that before. We've grown up together for practically our whole lives. And I've never seen that smile before. It's so pure and beautiful. And it's like today was the first day she smiled without holding back. It's like today was the day she would show God Himself that how happy she was with her brilliant smile.
Watching her smile like that...it crushed my heart to bits. I've never had the privilege of seeing her like this before. And I suppose I never will as she walks with the man of her dreams, and the love of her life.

Someone else.

I'm happy for her. God knows I'm happy for her. But...I'm jealous. I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't be, but I am. I am so incredibly jealous that he makes her smile like that and out of all our years of friendship, I couldn't. I hope nothing but a nice long happy life together. Filled with memories. Filled with years of happiness. And laughter. And joy.

But today. Today is the last day I'll ever have my friend. And it'll be the first day for their adventure together. And I'll have to learn to be happy, sitting on the sidelines. I guess.

Hey! I'm happy for her!
More than she'll ever know.

So long, my friend of so many years. May your life be filled with nothing but blessings, joy, and adventure with your new partner for life. I'll...I'll see you! Next time. Yeah...next time...

I wish her and her husband well! And maybe, I can be the reason someone smiles, the way she did that day. Until then, all the best, and may God take care of the rest!"
lonely,Touch starved and depressed,"Touch starved and depressed - I really miss physical affection and feeling like I’m cared for. I don’t have many friends and the ones I have don’t ever want to hug. I mostly rely on relationships for touch and praise, but none of my relationships ever last long, and I’ve been single for awhile now. 

I guess I could really use a hug right now and for someone to act like they cared about me, even if it was for a little while. My depression makes it hard to do things, so the idea of someone looking out for me, encouraging me to do simple tasks and praising me for completing them feels like a fantasy. Maybe some of you relate to how I’m feeling"
lonely,somebody to fix me,"somebody to fix me - or at least comfort me with saying ""I'll stay by your side"" or ""Im here. everything will be alright"""
lonely,Well it finally happened,"Well it finally happened - Everyone I managed to meet this semester has stopped responding to my texts. They are also skipping class or sitting somewhere else so I guess I'll never see them again. Everyone else is already in groups so I can't talk to anyone new. If it wasn't happening to me I would find it funny. Am I that unpleasant? I seriously can't pin point anything I did wrong. Whatever, I'm tired"
lonely,How to separate your decisions from other people?,"How to separate your decisions from other people? - I'm in the process of trying to figure out what I wanna do about college, and I'm finding it really difficult to separate the decision-making process from my attachments to other people.

I was at UCLA last year and decided to withdraw for a quarter to figure out what I wanted to major in. I also withdrew because I believed I chose UCLA for the wrong reasons: prestige and the fact I had friends there. But part of me also worries I chose this path because my boyfriend would live 1-2 hours from me if I were at UCLA. I'm at a community college rn, but the loneliness has become pretty intense. I see my boyfriend pretty often, but he's a student with responsibilities too, so it gets lonely regardless. I sometimes get tempted to go back to UCLA because I feel so isolated - because I have close friends there - but I keep telling myself that's not a way to make a decision. I'm also worried part of the reason I keep convincing myself not to go back is because my boyfriend is closer while I'm at a CC. I honestly don't know how to separate making a decision from other people. UCLA *is* a great school, I just don't know how to view deciding where to go to school post-CC when I'm so fucking lonely. I've always considered transferring somewhere else post-CC, but CC has been so lonely. I don't know how to tell what's best.

Do you have any methods that help you separate making decisions from your relationships with other people? I know my loneliness can't magically be fixed by being around people more often and that it's a me issue. I need therapy tbh, but I can't stop thinking about all this college shit."

But i'm actually not.

Now i realize that these people that i see together at bars and parties are just as lonely as i am. They don't hang out because they actually care about each other. They are just desperate for company. They will spend time with anyone in search for affection.

My cousin was like this too. He would spent time with anyone who would take him to parties and stuff. Even if he didn't really like that person. 

This is so sad. For them... not for me. This time i feel like i'm the one who's taking the right path. For the first time i'm glad to be alone."

The reason you're lonely is probably because you're a bad conversationalist - After countless encounters online and irl, it still amazes me how some people see no issue in replying to whatever you say to them, without returning the interest shown towards them.

Or they'll ask ""you ?"" in return but, once you reply, the conversation stops.

You expect me to keep coming up with all the conversation starters here?!

lonely,I know I was born for more...,"I know I was born for more... - Idk what to say to be honest
 I rarely allow myself to be open like this to strangers, nor am I eloquent with my wording, so look over my mess. I am a married SAHM with no friends. The only ppl I see and talk to daily is my kids and husband. As postpartum kicked in I alienated myself from the world. Here I am almost 15 years later even more reclusive  depressed, and lonelier then ever. I crave attention (and hell tbh affection as well. this isn't ab my relationship 🙄 I'm sure it isn't helping. Not everyone has enough money to drop everything, get a divorce, and start a new life. If change was that easy, I wouldn't be here in the first place. I don't have family so I have not outside help what so ever. )
Ive slowly began going through some call a spiritual awakening (other could say I'm going crazy 😉) It has opened my eyes to so many things. I feel sad of what we've done to the ppl of this land (USA) as well as how were destroying our earth. It makes me mad how the government lies/steals/kills us. That's just a few straws on the camel's back. I won't get into my discovery of past lives and reincarnation. I honestly think that I've woke up to realize alot of bullshit around me, that only I can choose to walk away from. 
I've wrote this several times since finding this board over the past few months, only to just discard it. I feel weak and afraid of what ever someone will find to pick apart. Please be nice. I just need someone to tell me I'm gonna be ok 😞

The only thing I ever want is just a warm hug for goddamn 5 seconds. I don't need anything else. I'm tired of hurting myself by watching videos where other people cuddle, yet still coming back to them. I feel worthless, agonized and useless. I never had true friends who take me seriously.

It may sound stupid and I’m not looking for potty or anything like that in case that’s what it seems like. But recently I’ve just felt like I’ve been feeling really down. I could have a crush on a girl but I never follow through with it because I don’t want to be rejected and I hate it. I’m not a bad looking guy. A few girls have been attracted to me but that was like 4 years ago and now I just feel lonely and find myself questioning whether I’ll ever find the right person. And tbh I’ve been losing motivation slightly to do things I normally enjoy like going to the gym and doing hobbies I like. Anyone have any suggestions on how to get over the feeling of being single?

I’m not happy and I would like to make friends or even a relationship but on the other hand is it to late too. I don’t have any mates and the only person I hear from is my mother lol I knew I was lonely but it hit home the other day when my eldest came home from school and said he’s going back out to meet some friends at the park. 

I’ve been single for 3 years because I just wanted to be a good dad and put all my efforts into trying to raise my kids right and be there for them. But I miss not having someone relationship or friendship for myself. I was in my old job for 10 years of my life and when I choose to leave to be there for my kids I never heard from any of them again. 

Be nice to hear from someone else besides my mum I guess lol kinda bring a a man down. I miss laughing and having good banter ya know. Feels good to say it. Thanks for reading of you got this far.

lonely,I just can’t do this happy horseshit anymore…I’ll never have a GF,"I just can’t do this happy horseshit anymore…I’ll never have a GF - So the other day, I saw this absolutely gorgeous cashier at a GIANT shopping center near my house. Just so happens that she’s a girl who goes to my school ( senior, I am) that I have had in some of my classes the past years, and one I’ve always loved from afar cause I never had the cajonès to say anything to her. Really- if I’m being Frank here, what the fuck am I supposed to say to a girl like this? It’s one thing if I’ve known them from working in a group project, sitting next to them etc. but if a girl is smack dab ACROSS the fuckin room, talking to 50 million of her Friends, how in the everloving shit am I supposed to mosey on up, interrupt their dialogue, and just look like a total fucking bitch?? I have NEVER seen anyone do something like this in my 18 years of living, yet everyone I know is swimming in girlfriends up to their fuckin ears. Makes no sense. Anyways, I saw this girl working the cash register at GIANT, I was with my family so I didn’t say anything like “hey do you remember me” because she most definitely has no fucking clue who I am and I didn’t want to be embarrassed in front of my family. Anywho, I decided to visit the GIANT after school today (we had early dismissal so we left at 12) and my darling was working a cash register. I walked up to her aisle, and there was a guy in front of me with a bunch of bullshit. As she was ringing up his items, she said to me “do you have anything to buy sir?” And I fucking froze. I knew it, I goddamn fucking knew that walking up there empty handed was fucking stupid. I just grabbed a bunch of gum, candy, drinks and shit until she didn’t look so pissed. I was up, she was ringing my shit up, and all the rolls of gum  had a hard time rolling up the conveyor belt because they’re cylindrical. She said to me “next time just use the fucking self checkout please” and that’s when I snapped. I took the rolls of gum that weren’t rolling up, and I furiously ran them over the barcode scanner. They were all accounted for, I took them in a bag and I spiked them to the ground like a fucking football, like rob gronkowski does. She let out a scared exclamation, I left the rest of my shit there and stormed out. I got in my car, peeled off, and I’m laying low 2 hours away so the police don’t get me for this shit. Idk what to do anymore; I just can’t fucking deal when it comes to women. I’m a fucking loser. I can never step foot in that GIANT shopping center again."

lonely,"I feel like an NPC, And its killing my slowly","I feel like an NPC, And its killing my slowly - Since I can remember I was fearful of death, the thought of not existing anymore hunts me every second of my miserable life.

It can be weeks before one of my “friends” will make any contact with me, and even when we do meet up or talk in group chat, i always feel like an outsider.

I feel like a shell of a human, just a body without a soul, without any emotions but sadness and despair.
I never had hopes and dreams, the only reason i am somewhat stable is because i am highly medicated.

never will I fit with them, never will I fit anywhere, What is the point of even trying?

I was never a popular kid, barely had any friends growing up, always alone at lunch time, always alone after school. 

I don’t think it will get any better, No it wont, i guess its at least will all be over soon."

Not really. My parents are disappointed in me, my siblings just tolerate me and whatever word vomit I have to spit at them. I feel like no one honestly cared about me. My family might love me, but they don’t really care about my thoughts, feelings, what I have to say. I know I can ramble and sound really stupid but just wish someone cared enough to listen.

So I have a cuddle pillow which I hold tightly when I sleep so that I don't get much lonely and sometimes I just hold that pillow and watch some wholesome relationship tiktoks which I have saved, and I kinda feel like that I am watching them with my love cuddling with me when I'm holding the pillow sometimes I even feel sad while holding the pillow and sometimes I just cry to it but recently I haven't been getting these feelings and I am kinda sad about it because it was a good feeling you know like even though it's a non living thing but it sometimes filled up my emptiness you know like it filled the void temporarily and I want to feel it again but I can't I just cant and I feel extremely sad about this dude like please I need that feeling back. I love attention because I have been deprived of touch attention or any active love .  I hope someone could relate to me and understand maybe this is just a stupid vent out but who cares."

I don't know what to do. 

This isn't the first time something like this has happened. I always end up delaying on things and don't do then on time when I'm supposed to. My parents often scold me about this but I tell em to shut up about it, even though I know they're right. I'm easily distracted by everything around me for the silliest reasons. I am not reliable to do anything properly. So in a way, I was never trusted by others.

I'm sick and tired of it. I try to change this about me but I just can't. It's like it's embedded in my DNA. I don't talk to people about it because I know it'll only be them angry at me instead of offering me a solution to get out of this mess I get myself into. I'm sick and tired of myself."

I watch tv shows where there is a group of friends (Friends, Big Bang Theory etc) and I wonder what is that like? To have people love you unconditionally , to belong somewhere.

I feel like I’m being punished.  I’m just such a fuck up, I’ll never find acceptance much less happiness.

I’m such a fuck up, even my brother has disowned me and won’t talk to me.

lonely,No friends,"No friends - A close co-worker and I were having a beer this weekend. We got into a really deep conversation about life and whatnot. He mentioned that he really doesn't have any friends. Sure, he has co-workers that he calls friends, but they aren't really good friends. More like work buddies. I'm probably the closest to him. He said, I'm the only one he gets drinks with from time to time. He said most of his real friends are back home where he's from. He's hasn't lived there in nearly 20 years. I said so, u don't have anybody here. He said he has his wife, and one other friend, but has nobody else to go hang out with. I asked why that was. He mentioned that he's met many people, gets close and something happens. Either life gets in the way or betrayal. Because of this he just doesn't care anymore about making friends. He's ok with being a bit of a loaner. But I can tell he's not very happy.

My question to you all. Is this a form of depression? It just seems so weird that he's okay with being alone for the most part. I'm worried about him. He's a good guy, but his lack of friends is a bit concerning. Or is this normal behavior?

Thanks in advance."

lonely,I’m feeling at my lowest rn,"I’m feeling at my lowest rn - I live in a household that encourages toxicity, negativity, and drama all the time. My friends are busy most of the time with work so I don’t even have a chance to talk to them much. I lost a couple of friends that I’ve been close to for 10 years during this pandemic. My bf is usually at work so I don’t even see him much either. Hell, my insurance is denying me my medications (I live in the US) and I’m physically and mentally withdrawing and it HURTS so bad right now. I really need those medications to treat my anxiety too. 

The only thing that’s keeping me busy are my virtual college classes. But they are so mentally draining because I have four classes that I need to be on top of. My own job is getting more and more difficult everyday because I’m teaching students with atrocious behavior from the pandemics effects of staying inside the house all the time. The only thing that’s keeping me calm right now is either smoking weed or taking edibles. 
I think I lost another online friend too because apparently I’m “too talkative” and “too boring”. 

All I know is…I’m feeling so lonely. I’m trying so hard to hold out and stay calm but I feel like I can’t. I don’t even know if anybody will even reply on this post or not.

lonely,It's getting harder to cope with my unending loneliness,"It's getting harder to cope with my unending loneliness - I will share something that happened to me earlier. 
While I was walking home, I spotted a homeless man sitting on a chair surrounded by his belongings in ripped trash bags. I felt bad, so I went to give him a dollar when I noticed there was another figure there, covered completely in a hoodie. I couldn't see their face. They sat next to the man, their head on his shoulder. I gave the man a dollar, took the 5 minute walk home, and cried on the Lazyboy. 

He was much richer than me because he had someone that wanted to be around him. I think that this is the only meaningful wealth. My mind then started racing, thinking about all the things I would trade for a friend or even a lover. 
My eye? My kidney? My lung? The special rock I got from Hawaii as a kid? Or my soul. Definently that. 

I had episodes like this all of my life, but it is recently becoming longer and more often.

A little backstory. My last relationship ended when I was 19 after we had been together just over a year. We hooked up a couple times after we officially broke up but eventually I decided to move on. I spent the next couple of years moving from one casual relationship to the next with one timers from tinder and other such places. I got pretty good at finding these hookups for a while which if you saw me, you'd be as impressed as I am looking back.

Then that all stopped when I spent a few months in new Zealand. I think that going there must've knocked my confidence a little bit as it didn't go that well (I had fully planned on being there at least two years and yet it ended being a few months, story for another time)

I'm not bothered about a relationship, i wouldn't turn down the right one but I mostly like my life how it is. I have good mates, a decent place to live and a good job.

Is it sad to just miss the sex?

TL;DR

my last relationship ended when I was 19, I spent two years of having random hookups and then I haven't had any since and I miss it"

lonely,"If your lonely, this may help","If your lonely, this may help - Perhaps the most difficult thing to bear is loneliness or aloneness. What to do when circumstances force us into solitary existence? First, if you are fortunate enough to have a variety of interest, physical or mental, you must make a real effort to develope them. If that don't work, you can search out and help the less fortunate. If you are not up to that, you are thrown back on the conscious cultivation of your five senses and intellectual powers. At the very least, you can tell God every mourning that you hold yourself available for use as his instrument, if only by praying Him to bless everyone whom you meet.

If these alternatives don't work, there is only one thing left; plain, simple, rock-bottom acceptance. Stop pitying yourself, stop rebelling, throw in the towel, and surrender to the obvious fact that since God allows it and you cant escape it, it must ba best for you and everyone. Pray for the faith to believe and accept it."

Were those just sweet lies?

I honestly feel like there is no hope for me.

I am not ugly and somewhat fit, I treat women with respect and I can keep a conversation flowing. I am funny and creative and some other good things. Yet women don't find me attractive. I don't know what is wrong with me.

For a while now, I've been liking a friend of mine. When she texts, she seems like she just might be interested, but when we meet, it feels like she is so distant. Mixed signals usually mean that she's not into me. It makes me feel like a fool and heartbroken.

Other than her, I don't think there are women who could find me interesting in any way. Plus, I am not a guy who really likes discos, which are places where people often hookup, and OLD has always given me a bad time. The few friends I have don't introduce me to new people and the few times that it has happened, nothing really came out of it, not even friendship.

And I'm tired of advice such as ""you have to stop thinking about relationships and it will come when you least expect them to"" or ""focus on improving yourself"". I've been doing that for a while and nothing comes out of it. I think that those are just empty words that are easy to say if you have evidence that people liked you in a romantic way such that you know it can happen again.

I don't know. I want to give up. I feel like noone really likes me and probably noone will."

But things are going so slow. I think she likes me but I’m scared she might not be into me in a romantic way, and instead only see me as a friend.

I’m 32 and been single most of my life. Had a couple relationships but they all lasted less than half a year. I have so much love to give and I hate the dating game.

Another thing is that I'm on the spectrum, but I really only have a mild form of autism, I never relate to how autism is portrayed in movies and TV shows like Atypical. Even the Netflix documentary series Love on the Spectrum is unbearable to watch for me. I may be neuro-divergent but it manifests in subtle ways and I actually hate routine and love being with friends.

I'm just scared I will keep on dating women for short periods and that I'll never find my forever person. But I'm posting here and not in r/ForeverAlone as I have dated before."
lonely,i think its time to force myself to do things which are good for me,"i think its time to force myself to do things which are good for me - Im talking about things like forcing myself to go exercise every evening.

Or COMMIT  to a project that might not be fun in the beginning.

im inspired by this quote  “Ultimately, **man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked**. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.” ― Viktor E. Frankl

I forced myself to do things like study and exercise before, it didnt end well. Ended in burnout. But im beginning to understanding that in small amounts, forcing yourself to do things that are good for you may be necessary. It may be key...

I know you may have replaced me or have enough friends to fall back on, figuring out a life after you was the toughest thing I've had to do this year, it's drained the lifeforce out of me, I've cried enough for  a year's worth. 

I miss you so much, I miss you more than I express in words and I wish we could go back to the good times and not screw it up, you'll always be the one I love most, my best friend and favourite person

But I have to let you go, you're toxic to me and I can't treated like I'm optional, I deserve better than that and I know I will get that someday"

lonely,An Invitation to Friendship. Something like that? Titles are weird.,"An Invitation to Friendship. Something like that? Titles are weird. - Hello all, 

I will try not to make this depressing for anyone but here goes.   I'm in my thirties, I have a decent job, I have my own apartment, I am in relatively good health and working on improving that.  I have no major disability or health issues, but have been diagnosed in the past with ""generalized anxiety disorder"" and depression.  I have several hobbies and interests that are somewhat enjoyable and a select few I am deeply passionate about.  The would be things like photography, writing, and more recently some basic woodworking, building, painting, general handyman type stuff.  I'm also not terrible at things like cooking, video games, etc.  

Yes I am of course grateful for what I do have, and that many of my concerns can be very ""first world problems"", but the things I do not have can be unbearably painful.  I haven't been in a relationship or had a close friendship for years.  I have no relationship with family aside from my mother and father.  This includes not seeing a single photo or having a single visit with my newest nephew in the 6 months or so that he has been on this earth.  I would explain the backstory on this, but its painful to think about.  Maybe once I've connected with some of you or developed some trust.  I've had some extremely low points in my life, but have come to the realization that I would never do something to myself or end my life.  And in some odd way, because of this, I am now prompting myself to make efforts to make my life less lonely and sad.  I'm not sure if that part makes sense but its how I feel.  Ask me to explain it again if I am a rambling mess.  haha

I am open to talking on here, on kik, or whatever app you are comfortable with.  I won't put information in this thread as its a sub rule, but feel free to ask me.  I also have XBOX Live, don't have a ton of games for it but its another fun way to communicate while doing something.  I'll warn you though, 90% of the time I prefer cooperative/teamwork situations in games.  I am not really a play against eachother all the time type of gamer.  I'm also a patient gamer, meaning if you enjoy the ""planning"" or slow play of tactical or strategy type games we would get along great with that.  Or even the ""grind"" type games where you keep playing to find specific rewards or special items.  You know what I mean.  Looter shooters?  That might be what the cool kids call it.

As a random aside, and a little insight into my interests, the name QueerSkyBall actually comes from an old newspaper article about a UFO sighting.  The old-timey headline indicated people in the town had seen a Queer Sky Ball (as in a strange ball of light in the sky).  Yes I am one of those UFO/alien types. :)

I am a very open and warm person when given the chance.  I find if I am treated fairly and respectfully I can connect well with anyone (which makes the need for this post all the more ironic, right?).  Anyways, I would ideally like a fairly close and strong friendship but am open to more.  I am not specifically looking for a relationship, just someone or some people to talk to.  I am pretty sensitive and empathic so I could be someone you came to for advice and support, and vice versa.  Not sure what else to say, but let me know if you want to talk.  I will check my messages.  

Thanks for reading!

lonely,I feel left out in my friend group.,"I feel left out in my friend group. - So i always had trouble making friends and maintaining friends ever since i was a kid. I can’t approach other people because i’m such a coward. 

I’m now in a friend group, but i mostly don’t really feel like i’m their friend. I’m second year middle school (system in The Netherlands is different i think that would be Junior High), and there are these kids i knew since first year. But this year i moved classes because i also moved levels (i can’t really explain that, you usually move “levels” if you have very high/low grades) and we coincidentally got in the same class. These 2 kids are now friends with the other kids. One kid (from that group) told me i can always sit with them, but i usually don’t because i feel like i’m bothering them. And they do invite me to events they are planning sometimes.

They also have a group chat where they talk and have fun, and whenever i try to say something i just feel excluded. Mainly because they don’t really pay attention to my messages mostly. And whenever i sit with them i feel like i’m just there, it’s like they completely forgot me.

I have 2 friends but they live in a different country so we can’t see each other every day.

I really wish i had friends and that i could be more socially confident like a normal person. Mainly because i don’t want to be lumped in with a certain boy from my class (he is pretty much of an outcast but he still did some bad things) and it just makes me so insecure.

Also please refrain from calling me an “introvert”, mainly because i’m afraid of being one and i hate it with passion."

I've had guys call me cute multiple times, but never a girl.

Before social media, the world was your oyster, even if you were a social reject of some kind, but I feel like with social media having gotten more expansive over time, this gave people more ability to be selective of people's circles. I feel like since more people talk to eachother now using social media as their main platform of communication, it really makes you wonder if social media was bastardized from its very original purpose. After all, you can have as many new friends added on social media as much as you like, but just remember the more friends you have, the more you're going to probably to be used. Idk I thought it was something interesting to talk about."

lonely,What happened to me?,"What happened to me? - Sorry I wrote this in a frenzy I’m 22

Long story short. I was suicidal, the one girl invited me to a gathering, a girl I was acquaintance witha couple years before. I am aware that this girl is out of my league, and she has a boyfriend (a chad version of me, Middle Eastern, almost exactly the same unique name, weird coincidences god knows). Now I hadn’t socialised in years, I had gone through some seriously tough things in my life and was constantly considering suicide, I went to the bathroom and cried. She barged it open caught me crying and gave me a look I’ll never forget, something in between disgust and boredom. Later we were chatting and I was planning my suicide, she then messaged me about something work related. I shared my suicide plan with her, because she was the only one there with me in my life. I had nobody. She said she wanted to help, then for the following two months made ‘chat appointments’ that she would ghost out on me for, she out wardly insulted me, manipulated lied and gaslighted me the moment I brought up my social issues (not even remotely sex related) she started treating me like garbage (while posting pro mental health bs on social media). I could not believe her hypocrisy she made me wait for weeks and weeks just for 10 minutes of chatting, lied and lied about times, then when I told her about my life she accused me of ‘breaking boundaries’ it turns out she was only prepared to have small talk with me, but even when I tried that she continued to ghost me. I don’t understand why I’m treated like this, even in a non sexual context. Is it just because she is out of my league? Is the world that shallow that she can’t even look past this petty thing? I humiliated myself over and over in front of her. I’m nothing now, I have had social and sexual and physical anhedonia since my suicide attempt.  She was a part of my suicide note because at that moment I was so lost and alone that I genuinely believed she was trying to help me. I didn’t care about her fucking alphaboyfriend I wouldn’t have even cared if she called me while getting banged by this guy. The guy studies the same subject as me, drives a bmw is fit, was in sports clubs, multiple girls flocked him, now he graduated first class.Meanwhile I failed my uni course even though my studies were the only thing i had my teachers always said I’d win the Nobel prize, people are asking me where I am in life they would never. Believe what happened to me. I used to be so smart and had a successful future but depression and social anxiety ruined that. My social anxiety prevented me from opening up to a therapist or to friends because I d be afraid of being seen as weak and gets even more ostracised, well it turns out that my social anxiety was once of the most rational things iveer  ever done socially speaking. Now ever since my suicdie attempt I’ve had full blown anhedonia. Physical mental. I have a numb penis, I’ve lost my sexuality have no pleasure during orgasm, I cant taste food, I can’t feel satisfaction or joy from anything it even eating. My uni counselling service shamed me for giving her a suicide note essentially saying don’t be a cringe weirdo in the nicest way possible. It’s been a year. Since then my balls have stopped producin semen, when I cum I get a clear liquid. I have not been able to feel any pleasure at all since not with orgasm not with. Anything. I’ve lost my attraction to the opposite sex. I’ve lost my drive to socialise I’ve been living ij pure isolation for 4 years.

Even if she didn’t care about me , she could have at least guided me towards a place where she could. She essentially said ‘do you not have anyone else to speak to?’ No my therapist replied every 3 weeks and my parents are part of my depression, I can’t speak to them my grandma died of suicide she had schizophrenia and my other two grandparents died of covid 19 that year. I have no friends don’t you understand. I wish I was this bold with her instead I let her lie and I believed her lies ‘im busy’ when she was having fun all the time. I let her drive me crazy. I put the blame on myself and asked her to forgive me. Then after about 10 interactions in 6 months of pain she forgave me, essentially implied that I was weak and ‘needed help’ and that once day i would laugh at how weak I was. When in reality  actual I was stronger than her stupid chad who she w worshipped would ever be. I have suffered with mental illness my life has been filled with unbelievable struggles I come from a poor background and I’m an immigrant. The least. Deserve is some respect and dignity while I am suicidal but I think she would rather make herself believe that I’m a weirdo who needs to be blocked than believe that a lonely beta deserves an ounce of dignity or friendship during a time where he has no other options


Why. I’m tired, I used to care about how attractive I was. Now I’m practically asexual, my life is over. I’m broken. I can’t feel fear, hope, happiness, satisfaction, I can’t feel anything I have severe anhedonia. I’ve never even held hands with a girl or expressed my feelings towards a girl. I barely talked to a girl in my life that way, I grew up in a conservative Muslim household.

lonely,Lonely student living off-campus: should I DM freshman students to make friends?,"Lonely student living off-campus: should I DM freshman students to make friends? - I’m currently an international student (freshman) living off-campus. I’m almost two months in, and I barely have any friends. I feel super lonely and depressed, I honestly don’t know what to do.

At the beginning of the semester, I hung out with a group of friends but I quickly realized we don’t have a common ground. They quickly picked up on it and stopped inviting me to their hangouts. Even when I suggested to do things like hiking, they’d completely dismiss me. I feel super lonely seeing them meet new people everyday, living the dorm experience. And before you say it, I tried getting to know students in my classes but that’s the only time we talk and though they’re sweet, they don’t seem interested to hang out. I’ve also joined a club but haven’t found luck yet; most of the people I met were sophomores who have already formed their social circles.

I’ve been occasionally hanging out with my sisters friends but they’re graduating soon anyway, and it doesn’t help my loneliness either. I hear them recalling instances of their freshman year, the funny encounters, and it saddens me that I don’t have any stories to tell (sorry if this sounds cheesy). Now halloween is soon, their schedules are packed with parties, and i’m embarrassed to say that i don’t have any plans or someone to hang out with.

I wish I could live off campus but I don't want to overwhelm my father with the dorm fees + tuition fees.

I found some cool freshman students on instagram that I feel like I’d get along with and thought of dming them and telling them that I live off campus so I’ve been trying to meet new people. I feel like now is the perfect chance since we’re only 2 months in but I don’t want to come off as creepy. I’ve told my sister the idea and she called me lame for it, and that we should at least have something in common. I honestly don’t know how to go on about it, and as embarrassing as it sounds, I’m desperate for friends. I don’t want to spend the next 4 years of my life like this. There are just so many things I want to do but I don’t have friends to do it with and it just depresses me."

I usually think I'm in an okay mindset but it only lasts until I get home and am alone for the weekend. My cat of 17 years died last Monday so it's been so weird and empty to come home to my empty bedroom. I want to get a fish tank and have something to give attention to until I fully process the loss. 

My birthday was the Monday before that and I was depressed the whole time...not because I was getting older but because I had realized how lonely I was under these circumstances in this part of my life. I want to do things to help myself and have slowly done things off of my list (i.e. therapy/meds, self care, work/sleep schedule) but have still had issues being social and finding new things to enjoy or even keep up with due to my bipolar II depressive episodes. I don't really know where to go from there.

I had the thought lately to try doing online streaming (Tiktok? Twitch? Reddit?) but I have never done any of that before and really know nothing about it aside from the fear of being sexualized because I'm used to that response any time I had ever tried to make friends.

lonely,"I had a sudden realization while reading a book on Depression, and nobody to share this realization with :","I had a sudden realization while reading a book on Depression, and nobody to share this realization with : - According to the authors, there are a set of identifiable signs in people who are depressed. And these signs include being emotionally exhausted and stressed. Being low in energy and enthusiasm.  
And although they look tired and 'low' on the outside, they are actually overly stressed on the inside. Flooded with cortisol.

The realization I had after reading that had to do with my observation of how some people respond to their children.

I have seen countless times in families around me, and especially in my own Nfamily, that adults respond with ""Oh he/she (the child) is just wanting attention"" and ignore the Childs tantrums. ""Oh they're just tired"" ""oh they're just angry i didn't buy them their toy"". This sort of generalizing on the Childs behavior is a form of abuse that they do. 

Its known as Neglect. And its so difficult to identify whose neglecting their children because of the excuses the parent is making.

Thats it..thats the strong realization I had. That people who make excuses to attending to their kids/friends/family members are neglectors. Abusers."

lonely,having friends doesn’t help with loneliness,"having friends doesn’t help with loneliness - So, after awhile of reflecting on my relationships, I’ve realized that having friends or people in general to talk to doesn’t cure loneliness. 
Truth be told, it just makes it 10x worse. 

It’s knowing that there are actual people out there who know you and know how you are (mentally), yet they’re not really there for you. I’m not sure if that actually makes sense, but when you have a lot of people who you’d consider friends not respond to your texts/calls when you need them to, it’s just a super lonely and gut-wrenching feeling. 

It hits a lot harder when you always tend to their needs and wants, yet all the do is just ghost or barely put effort into a response. It feels like a reoccurring experience, no matter who I meet or talk to, they don’t actually care about me.

It’s almost as bad as not having anyone to talk to. However, in that case, at least you know for certain you’ve got no one to talk to, and you know you’re not purposefully being ignored or hurt. 

All I want is for someone to genuinely and equally appreciate my presence and thoughts. However, I know deep down inside it’ll take years until that happens."
lonely,"Even when I'm with others, I feel alone.","Even when I'm with others, I feel alone. - My whole life, I've had this heavy sense of dread and loneliness clouding every interaction I have. With the somewhat recent realization that I am a transgender woman (17MTF), this is slightly less surprising. Anyways, even with friends that claim to be supportive, my interactions all feel hollow. I feel like I'm always being patronized to and that nothing I say is meaningful or important. This feeling has resulted in me always feeling lonely, even when I sm doing okay socially by conventional definitions. Above all, I feel like I have no friends, or maybe one, though that is up for extreme scrutiny.

Can anyone else relate to how I feel?"

lonely,"How long, I wonder, before I forget how it feels to be wanted","How long, I wonder, before I forget how it feels to be wanted - You’ve had so many names I’ve nearly lost count. I see you, living your lives, miles from the ones I knew, and I wish for all the ones that could never be. Where we’re absent the flaws that so clearly defined us, and instead we take the form I lust over in sleepless nights like this.

I meant neither everything to you or absolutely nothing at all. What’s given is not gone, but the days when I would weave my way into your dreams certainly are. So many of your names don’t even know the one I go by now.

I’ve been careless with my love and trust. I’ve seen too much. I check my pockets but can’t find the toll required to keep crossing. A tax paid in naïveté and flutters that my heart recalls so freely but can no longer produce. I am scattered embers aching for the light I once thought was the whole world.

lonely,lonely in a city with few friends. really missing my ex. struggling with addiction.,"lonely in a city with few friends. really missing my ex. struggling with addiction. - all my friends live on the east coast while i'm on the west. i recently bought some street xanax which i'm certain is just some unregulated research chemical. my anxiety is worse than ever and i want to quit but i'm all alone here. going to rehab isn't an option because of finances.

i'm so unhappy with my life. i miss my ex. i miss my former friends (people i pushed away with my mental illness). i miss my parents (on the east coast). nothing brings me joy anymore. i've gained 20lbs from overeating and i hate my body. i just want to be loved. i want the pain to go away."

lonely,Finding it hard not to wallow in self pity,"Finding it hard not to wallow in self pity - One of my greatest overriding fears for as long as I can remember is coming off as someone who feels they are owed affection. I’m a 28 year old cis male, and I am horrified by misogynistic communities in particular because I fear falling into the same stream of logic that leads so many lonely men there. I have been single for three plus years, I see myself as a fairly intelligent, affable guy, and I am terrified of falling into the “but I’m a nice guy” trap.

Despite this, I cannot deny the fact that I am so fucking lonely. I would give anything to feel wanted by someone else, not just as a friend but as a romantic partner. A few weeks ago a female friend that I otherwise see in every way as a platonic friend gave me a hug, and I almost broke out weeping.

I’m not really sure what I’m asking for here, just putting my thoughts out there I guess."

Growing up I struggled a lot with making new friends, probably because I was considered a bit weird. It wasn’t until high school where I met more people. But even though I’ve never been too big on social media, and never really cared for it. However it wasn’t until a break up where I felt like I just wish that I had a bit more of an audience, Ik it’s stupid. So, to my main point, I’d like to create some sort of community where we can all just help each other out with this type of thing, I hope I’m not the only one who’s thought of this, maybe we can all just help each other grow, I know it sounds stupid, but please, I’ve never asked for much, but please, just this once."

So, as I was quite irresponsible for my isolation problems, I left on their luck my cats. Then my new and actual 3 kittens were born years later, I promised by heart to do all the thing I could do to all searching for redemption and forgiveness to myself(the others included). Now I’m the one who give them the most attention I can.

lonely,I've never had friends.,"I've never had friends. - I just turned 24. Throughout my entire life I never had friends. I'm not kidding.

I never experienced being invited to someone's house, a birthday party, the mall, movies, etc.

I never hung out with anyone outside of school.

I've met various people in school and at work, but our relationship never goes beyond its context.

When school or work is over, the relationship is over.

School and work brings us together because it's a place you have to go to out of obligation, but I never did anything voluntary with anyone.

I’ve never maintained contact with anyone I’ve met in my life. It’s been 6 years since I graduated high school. I don’t keep in touch with anyone. It’s been 3 years since I’ve been out of university. I don’t keep in touch with anyone from there.

I live with my parents. I work in a cafe. When I get off work, I go straight home, go to my room, and just go on my laptop. This is what I do in my free-time.

I’m starting to get lonely.

Growing up I dealt with a condition known as Social Anxiety. I had a pretty severe case of it. I would get debilitating anxiety around other people, in public places, in performance situations, etc. I was very self-conscious and was always worried about what people are thinking about me, how I come across, people thinking I’m weird or awkward, embarrassing myself, etc.

Because of this condition, I didn’t go out much and I had a hard time opening up and bonding with other people.

I hardly left the house. I spent the majority of my time in my room either watching TV, playing video games, or going on my iPod.

In school I was quiet and kept to myself. I would get asked all of the time by people “Why are you so quiet?”

My Dad would get on me growing up on not making friends and spending too much time in my room. He would tell me, “You need to break out of this habit. I don’t want you ending up alone. I don’t want you to be a hermit. Who do you hang out with in school? Why are you always by yourself?” I would get mad and irritated.

However, now I am starting to see what my Dad was talking about.

I even feel like my siblings are starting to kind of exclude me out. I’m the youngest of 4. I’m the last one still living at home.

They all text each other and what not. They meet up. I don’t really participate.

I just feel like it’s too late to turn this around. It’s hard to make friends at this age. Especially starting from scratch. I’m just starting to get discouraged. I’ve had opportunities to develop some good friendships, but I wasted those opportunities.

I’ve missed out on a lot of things and a lot of experiences.

I worry I’m going to spend the rest of my life being friendless and reclusive."

I actually felt like I had something to offer.

Now in my 30s most of the energy is gone, many days I just barely pull through. After years of loneliness, depression and endless therapy sessions I find it extremely difficult to find hope.

I can't go anywhere, do anything, or say anything without someone being a jerk — I'd understand if it were me, but someone came out of nowhere and said something terrible to me, then got their pals to gang up on me and harass me.

And this isn't the first time this has happened to me; someone else jumped on a friend of mine for no reason other than boredom, and of course I chastised them for it, but as soon as I did, this person's entire mood changed and they began hurling death threats at me, and OF COURSE it was race-related; the dude told me I'd end up like a little girl who was murdered, I don't remember the details all too well but I do remember it being a racially motivated attack. I don't think I can take this anymore, yet I'm told to endure it as taking action would mean that I'm giving them what they want, maybe they want me to go off so they can use it against me.

I'm now realising that perhaps these dreams I once took comfort in are beggining to become more and more unattainable and as such, depression is beggining to catch up to my waning hope. They say it's normal to question your life as you enter adulthood, but I've questioned mine and trust me doc, I'm pretty certain that it's not looking sunshine and rainbows. Honestly I feel like I've wasted my teenage years, usually people say that when they've prioritized partying over studying, but maan atleast they have something to show for it, I have neither ffs! I feel like I havent done my existence justice, I know that's a weird thing to say, but if I was extroverted I'm sure my life would be a flamin cool one! My life is honestly 
quite tragic, as narcissistic as it may sound it's a fact that I have everything going for me, I'm intelligent, good looking, strongly emotional intelligent and a genuinely good hearted guy, but my life has made me the biggest nobody I know. I tried to become a somebody through sport, but I soon realised that to give my life meaning  it was love that I needed in my life, not self love, but for another human being to accept me, to be attracted to me, for someone to actually emotionally depend on me for once would give me a reason to love life as much as I did when i was an innocent kid.

Hey!

I’m into rock, sci-fi, space, nature, food and new cultures. My last book was Nemesis by Asimov and I’m reading The End of Eternity at the moment. Before Covid I’d go to rock festivals and concerts. My last one was Tool (over a year ago!) and most likely the next one will be Tool too in 2022 (fingers crossed). 

Anyway, hit me up and let’s see if we connect."

lonely,My social life is HORRIBLE,"My social life is HORRIBLE - So my social life has been terrible since covid started. At the time covid hit I was a junior in high school, now im a 1st year college student. Things haven’t gotten better since everything started.

I’m fairly introverted, however, im trying to put myself out there more. The problem is, it hasn’t worked very well. I don’t have many friends to talk to that I can maintain a conversation with.

I’m also trying to find a relationship (eventually) and I know that’ll take time. But, ive never been in a relationship and everyone I know has. Im sick of being the 3rd wheel for multiple people at the same time. Ive joined dating apps and haven’t gotten ANY matches, NOT A SINGLE ONE! So I don’t know anymore.

Im so tired of being lonely and feeling like I don’t fit in. It’s definitely taking a MAJOR toll on my mental health. 

I feel so alone and isolated. Does anyone have any advice or kind words?

If you want to chat I’m open to that as well."
lonely,You can laugh as much as you want but this is how I feel,"You can laugh as much as you want but this is how I feel - Hello stranger, it might sound stupid and funny to you but I'm experiencing love withdrawals, even though it sound ridiculous. (I've just joined this sub and I never related to something more than almost all of the posts here.)

Let me first introduce you to my story. 
I am feeling this way because a ""friend"" of mine was staying over here for a couple of days. In reality I was always repeating to myself that I am not in love with her and we are just really good friends, but after she broke up with her bf I couldn't take my shot properly(literally I am loving her that much that I don't have the balls to admit my feeling to her, because I'm weak piece of s**t and I fear I will lose her as a friend as well) so we just remained friends and she started dating another guy, because of this and other things I decided to move out of not only my town but my country too(I mean she was not the only reason I moved out, but the situation between us was one of the main reasons).

I moved out and started working in another country, its been a few months since I arrived here and everything was going on alright - ish. I didn't talked with her for quite some time then out of nowhere she called me and said she will come in a week or so to visit me for a few days (not because she had to do something, but purely because she misses me)(I'm talking about big distances, few thousand kilometer to be precise). I couldn't be more happy about it, because of the fact that I felt wanted again.

Long story short, she came, we spend the last few days doing everything together, basically these were maybe the best days for me in years. But as always, everything good should come to an end, now that she is gone, I feel even worse than before, I mean I almost forgot her man, I was almost ready to move on, and now I'm at the starting line again if not even further back.

Sometimes I think the feelings are mutual, but maybe it's my head playing tricks to me. Internally I know that we will never be together, but damn, in the past I did some drugs, and I've never experienced withdrawals as strong as these from knowing that I will never be enough and she will never love more than as a friend.(sometimes I am even questioning if she feel something about me at all) 

If you think stimulant and opiates withdrawals are awful, try love withdrawals, nothing worse than these. I started doing drugs mainly to forget the situation between us and the fact how big of a coward I am, and she totally disapproves everything related to drugs, if that's not an iron E than I am not sure what is(she don't know about my problems with drugs and the cause of it, but if she eventually found out it will be the end to everything between us, I just can't stand myself)"
lonely,"Got scammed but I’m not mad, because I got to talk to someone","Got scammed but I’m not mad, because I got to talk to someone - So yeah, I got scammed by a woman on Facebook dating. It was a crypto scam, so I lost money I could afford to lose, it’s a gamble anyway. But that’s not the point. 
I’m actually kind of glad it happened, because I got to talk to a woman every day for about a month and a half. Of course it sucks, but at least I got something out of it I guess…. Idk I’m just lonely"

lonely,A battle with loneliness,"A battle with loneliness - I hate being lonely. It makes me feel helpless and unloved. 

Realising that sometimes I could disconnect from the world, social media, etc. and when I return not even have a message wondering if I’m okay. 

Then I also realise that people are busy with their own lives, sadness and stress. 

I don’t notice if other people go away for a bit. So why would they notice me? I’ve got to get away from this complex where I think I’m somehow special, and on people’s minds. 

Thing is, we are all struggling somehow, and we don’t have the time or headspace to check up on each other all the time. 

Conversely, if I do start getting messages from people, I feel overwhelmed. In fact, I leave them on unread until I can get the energy to reply and be social. 

So when people are gone, I’m lonely and sad. 

When people are present, I feel overwhelmed. 

Why are our brains never happy. I’ll never understand this."

lonely,I'm done with dating,"I'm done with dating -  

Back in 2016 I dated this girl, Fran. She was the most wonderful person I'd ever met and I think I was the happiest I ever was when I was with her.

She broke up with me at the end of the year and I was in a fog for a long time. I tried my hand at dating again in 2018 and it hasn't really been good. I've tied a lot of my self esteem into my profiles and it hurt being ghosted. I ended up with some people who really weren't right for me.

In 2019 I get out of a bad relationship and I decided to focus on myself and my new job, but covid hit and I got lonely so I tried to get back into dating around 2020. I bounced around from date to date and I feel as though I am lesser for the experience and I gave up in November of 2020 to focus on myself again.

I once again tried dating this year and I've been on and off with a few people for about 2 - 3 months and I honestly feel drained. I am just so tired of being ghosted. I am tired of meeting people and not having that spark. I am so tired of being hopeful, that this is going to be the right person.

All in all I am just tired of being lonely. I want to get back to the way I was in 2016 when i had someone to be tender with, someone who I could hold and be held. I just want to feel loved and to love someone else... but it's sorta feeling like those days are far behind me now and I'm not going to feel happy like that again.

Anyways I don't have the strength to go back out there anymore and go through the same song and dance anymore. I don't want to get hurt anymore."
lonely,18 and things are just a mess in my head,"18 and things are just a mess in my head - Feel really shit and lonely rn.

I blame myself for feeling this way, it is my fault, I'm being stubborn.

I was so stressed to the point where I felt physical symptoms, sore/tense muscles today, eyes are dry, talk slower, feel and act like a zombie.

The thought of being alone forever scares me. I feel like I'll have to swallow that pill and accept that will be the case.

I'm unemployed, antisocial, not much to offer. I know that I'm unattractive because of this negative energy that I give out, such as the ones on the post.

Just feeling so sick of everything right now. I want attention, but even that won't do anything to change my mood. 

I'm just pathetic."

I’ve been so close to ending it all so many times. The people I still talk to online barely talk to me due to the 9 hour time difference.

lonely,My 30s have been the loneliest years of my life,"My 30s have been the loneliest years of my life - When the pandemic came around, I realized how drastically everyone's life had changed except mine. While everyone else longed for normalcy in their social life, nothing unusual was going on for me besides the fact I couldn't try on clothing in a store anymore. 
I realized I've been this alone for years, probably since my engagement ended in 2017. I decided I had to change it. I am desperately craving companionship but every effort I've made has been a failure. 
I'd be fine with a relationship in any form, I just want company. I want someone to go visit or someone to come visit me.
I want to not eat every meal of my life alone. I want to wake up and have someone to make a big breakfast for on Sunday mornings. 
I'm just so tired of having no one to cook for that I rarely cook anymore. I'm an excellent cook but what's the point of making a mess in my kitchen, for me to enjoy a meal by myself? If it's not frozen, I don't eat it. 
I miss going out to eat. It's been years since I sat in a restaurant and enjoyed someone's company and I don't have the confidence to go alone. The same applies with going to the movies because I just feel so pathetic not having someone to go with. 
I tried to reconnect with people that I had grown apart during the pandemic but everyone was either too preoccupied with their own life or just uninterested. 
I tried Bumble friends. I've tried dating apps. I just have such a hard time forcing a connection with strangers online and I still haven't met a single person via swiping in over a year. I work from home so there is no one to try to form connections with at my job. 
My soul is starting to feel crushed by the loneliness. I wake up and cry so many mornings because I'm starting to feel stupid for craving human interaction. Is it wrong to want a friend or to want someone to love?"

So in their community post, they were saying how their discord is inactive and they were starting to feel lonely and forgotten. It wasn't the first time they had those kinds of posts. I will have to say that this particular Vtuber used to play mobile games and translate them but rebranded. 

I was one of those people who watched their translation videos so when they rebranded as a Vtuber it was interesting so I tuned in and after watching them...they were bland personality-wise and having a good, memorable, is what Vtubers is known for. In some of their community post, they sounded pretty mean to others. For example, if people highly demanded something from the creator they would snap at them saying “stop requesting it, I won't do it.” 

So when I saw this community post, I'm going, to be honest, it was hard to sympathize with them since they had a bland but rude temperament that pushed people away. If you guys read this what do you think about this? What would you do if you were in the person’s shoes?"

Now that it's been nearly a year since my last one and I start developing myself and I see that a crush will only hurt me.

But the reason for it is I am no longer interacting that much with people and also not getting to find new people. I have like encapsulated from the world more and more even though I don't really want to.

People only hurt me. I've made a lot of bad experiences with people which made me the way I am and I totally can't comepte in this world. Every time made it worse. I really wish I could find someone in this world (even a real friend would be nice) but I gave up. They will only hurt you and make it worse.

It's a different pain I am feeling now but it's not as bad as being hurt by someone. So I will accept it and wait until I die.

I believe moral seeming is more important than the social commons especially considering it's a moral seeming that first informs a social commonality.

I hate that social and news media has only become an echo chamber where one regurgitates speaking points on conflict but no one is attempting to find real solutions that fix things from the ground up outside of the institutional framework. Both sides do this and you know it, partisan.

Doesn't it hurt that the people you care so deeply about can't even bother to give two cents of their time for you?

Since all of us have had it at least once we know that during this time we need someone that is there for us and supports us. And I do understand that people are scared because what if it's COVID. But I wasn't asking any of my friends to hold my hands or sing me to sleep, a simple ""how are you"", ""Can I get you anything"" would've been enough. But instead, they completely looked over those aspects and isolated me. I was crying and they could see that but none of them seem to ask why or console me and it hurt. I am someone who wants to be there for other people and I go above and beyond to help anyone. And this is how I get treated in return. I guess I was expecting too much from people but is asking for a simple ""how are you"" too much?"

These idiots don't realize who I am. I could vaporize this whole city. When I lived in Oak Ridge Tennessee I was at ORNL. I have two degrees in nuclear physics. But here, I'm a fucking loser. I'm not boasting either. It's just, they don't realize!!"
lonely,Back from vacation with friends I never get to see,"Back from vacation with friends I never get to see - I just got home from a week long vacation with friends that all live super far away and hardly ever stay in contact through text or social. I had an incredible time but I’m sitting here alone at home crying because now I have to return to a life of having no friends. I was comfortable being alone before this but now that I’ve had a week of socialization and bonding, I realize how badly I miss it in daily life.

I’m not really asking for any solution to this, but rather just need to tell someone. I’m scared that if I tell this to any of my friends they’ll think I’m crazy."
lonely,I feel like I don't exist.,"I feel like I don't exist. - I have only one friend but he lives in another state, so I basically don't have anyone,  I'm not part of anyone's life, it's hard to try to talk to new people because all of them have a lot of friends and already knows a lot of people, and then there is me, like a ghost, sometimes I talk to someone for a month or two, and then the connection ends.

I dropped college because I was doing terrible at the online classes, I don't have a job, so I don't see anyone all day, all week, the whole month. I have some plans for 2022 but until then I just sit on my room listening to music and playing games living in this limbo.

I know all of this sounds like self pity but I know next year things will be better, its just that the pandemic hit me really hard even if didn't got the virus. Thanks for reading."
lonely,Okay with being lonely,Okay with being lonely - I think it’s okay to come to terms with I’m just going to remain alone. It’s not so bad…I have plenty of time for thing I love and enjoy doing. I was in a “relationship” if you wanna call it that it was only a month or two long but I realized that I didn’t have much time for things that I enjoy (alternate gym days and didn’t pick my guitar as much as well as other things) also I feel like my day of R&amp;R (Sundays) didn’t feel the same just kicking back and watching football was filled with “let’s go grab brunch and other things that couples do” I know I’m rambling but what I’m saying is this morning I woke up on my terms and ate what I liked for breakfast and peacefully went and going along my happy way. What I’m trying to say is this realization or epiphany of being single or “alone” really isn’t all that bad.

lonely,Another boring weekend...,"Another boring weekend... - I try to be thankful for what I have, but in my heart I know how unhealthy  it is to be lacking in human contact. So many weekends have gone by where I do nothing but scroll and surf, nap, take walks, and watch TV. I'm just tired of it. Rarely do I ever feel engaged with anything. Occasionally I will find a good program to watch, and it's like a narcotic. I know I'm not totally wasting my time (like I feel most of the time watching tv) and I get to take a break from thinking about myself and my life .

I like it when Thursday comes to a close and I have a few days of rest and relaxation to look forward to. But then when the weekend arrives, it's so unhappy.  The worst part is Sunday knowing I have to do it all over again, only to again have a boring weekend at the end.

Sometimes I'll go visit another part of the city for my walks. I just look at people, check things out, get a coffee or something, and then I wonder what the heck I'm doing. I just want to be back home in bed."
lonely,Feeling it extra bad today,"Feeling it extra bad today - Will be seeing my siblings and extended family today. They are all dysfunctional, there's a history of abuse and general tension felt in their presence. My nieces will be here to visit and that's the only reason I want to be here. For them. 

I've been living in a difficult situation for a while. I've been in therapy and trying to cope with the fact that i can't be close to my family of origin. Trying to cope with and get past the bad stuff. 

There's no family worth being a part of if they abuse or have abused you. The cost is too high. 

But the girls don't know any of this so they're innocent. It's hard for me to fake smiles and laughter around them knowing that I truly don't feel happy or safe around the rest of my family. 

Im a grown adult and more than capable of shutting them out. Its something I've fought with for a long time, because that also means the girls would miss me. We are very close/bonded. They are still little. 

I'm just venting. I feel so lonely and it gets worse when you're around people who make you feel even more lonely."

I live alone, and that is surely part of the reason for this loneliness. But lately the loneliness feels more like depression or melancholia...it lingers, stews, sits like a leaden weight in my stomach. What I want most of all is to find someone who cares about me. What I want second most is to sleep, endlessly. No work, no play, no drugs, just sleep, serene oblivion.

I feel like I’ve only ever had 1 true connection with someone and they’ve sadly passed away. 

I feel stuck and trapped. I don’t know how to talk to people or keep conversations going without feeling like I’m just boring. I didn’t get to learn how to be social or date or anything while I was a teenager.

The two people that have tried being friends with me the past one and a half years of my life haven't stuck around. My first friend blocked me when I asked him not to send me nsfw pictures, my second friend (lives in the same dorms) made me cake for my birthday but is randomly awkward around me now when I try to talk for... Some reason??? I don't know what I've done wrong. 

Am I lonely because I don't meet enough people or do people hate me or do people like me but maybe they're scared because I'm vegan or what? What is it? My brain can't figure out sh\*t and I'm having an existential crisis. I hope I can have friends and everything before I perish at least.

lonely,Heartbreak and loneliness,"Heartbreak and loneliness - I'm 23(M) and really just looking for an outlet for how I've been feeling for the past few months. 

About six months ago I got out of a long distance relationship. I had been with her (24F) for 6 years, and slowly we were bullding up our lives to be properly connected. Covid hit, and we began to struggle. She broke things off with me... Well, not really. She was cheating on me, and I found out about it from her Facebook page. She forgot to edit the seeing preferences on a post about being enganged to another man. Turns out I had been her dark secret all these years. When I confronted her about it, she didn't give a damn. I like to think I've had a lucky escape.

Since this relationship was long-distance, and we only met up a few times, I have very rarely had the much-needed physical contact. A hug, holding somebody and knowing the loving feeling to be mututal. I've tried to meet people, but with the current state of the world, it isn't easy. 

I recently befriended someone at work (27F) who was a new starter. She made me laugh, we shared similar interests - and I interpreted a lot of her mannerisms as flirting. Sadly after 6 weeks, she has quit the job due to indifferences with the management. This happened on my week off, and she told me over text message. I was very sad to hear this. 

I offered her the chance to meet up sometime, which she agreed. She added me on Facebook, but a couple of days later removed me. We haven't messaged one another since, but I was really hoping to have found someone to socialise with. Even if it didn't lead to a relationship, having a friend to talk with would be a huge comfort. 

In general, I don't have many friends - and none I can really open up to. I suppose that's why I'm here... Any comforting thoughts would be much appreciated. I've never felt that ""down hearted"" feeling so often, where the pit of my stomach feels empty and bottomless. Trying to stay optimistic, in the hopes that my time will come to meet somebody special... We shall see."

lonely,"Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real 🌟), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀!","Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real 🌟), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 4500 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"
lonely,Lack of friends,"Lack of friends - I get so irritated by people who look down on others regarding money, beauty, ambitions, unconventional personal choices, intellect. That leaves very few people. Of course everyone has certain faults including me. But if that's the first impression I get from someone, it's sort of like they're blacklisted unless we were to work together due to belonging in same organisation or institution. But I really dream to have a group of people who i can hang out with. I had few close friends in college but towards the end, I found more and more reasons to keep safe distance even from them. 

I don't keep much people close. The ones I do, I like to spend amount of time with them. But after I lost connection (to that extent) with my college friends, I don't know if there'll be people in my life. I'm now placed in my company with pretty good salary and that settles me financially. I've expected my close people to be happy. But most people weren't as excited as I thought they would be and it kept me wondering if I'll have close people in my life. Otherwise, what's all this for?"

lonely,"I have never felt more disconnected from my closest friends, and I can't see what I have gained from it.","I have never felt more disconnected from my closest friends, and I can't see what I have gained from it. - After living a year and a half in Japan (planning to stay longer) and managing to create a life here, it was not without sacrifice that was at times the most painful. As the months went on, I started to feel disconnected from friends. Probably because I have changed a lot as a person, set up new goals and really discovered myself after struggling much of depression, loneliness, and so on. I have managed to become much happier than before, especially compared to several months ago. I love the fulfillment of my hobbies, I really like my job, seeing my family every now and then, and going to the gym. While I have good days, bad days, awful days, and yes even great days, I feel like I lost family, like they have died from my life. I am a very introverted person and yes I am awful at reaching out to people at times, but the biggest reason of all, whether it was my fault or not, is that I am on the other side of the globe. It almost makes me regret making the decision. Schedules just never align in this situation. I have created a life here but I lost my closest friends. I miss talking about the stuff I love but life gets in the way, whether it is in my life or theirs.  Things start to look like they are coming together for my wellbeing, but the pain comes back every now and then. There was a bit of anger involved early on, since I had suicidal thoughts several months ago and none of them responded. I have managed to pick up all of the glass pieces all by myself, and hold no grudges towards my friends. But sometimes I question what was the purpose of friendship? Knowing things change? People come and people go all the time. Sometimes I send a message, no response comes. If I have gained anything from this, all I can get is that life just...changes. It is just the way it is. I made the decision to leave. I feel like it is more of my fault, and yet I can't be there for that person because I have to live my life, my journey. And yet I feel guilty. I have abandoned them. It is just really hard to keep up with people. I am always open to having new friends, but what I don't know is if I want to show a hundred percent of myself to that new friend. The more I show my true self, the more painful the friendship is if we ever part. People come, people go. It can get really  painful, when you really have that friend to share things and they just disappear in your life. I don't even know if I will ever see that person again."

lonely,would you forgive this for the sake of having a friend?,"would you forgive this for the sake of having a friend? - (long ass detailed explanation of an argument i had with my friend incoming)

here's something i never see anyone talk about on here: being basically forced to forgive people who treated you like complete shit, purely cos you dont have anyone else and both of you know it. ive spent my whole life being treated like shit by people who were meant to be my friends, just cos the alternative is having no one at all.

my only friend does this thing where i'm kind of their backup friend who gets ignored and/or ditched whenever they find their way into a social group. these groups of friends they make never last long, but they always idolise them, changing everything about themself to be like the group, and not only ditching and ignoring me, but also shutting any attempt i make at trying to also befriend said group. (people who know this friend have backed me up here, people can see them doing this, and have even told me that they dont seem to like or respect me the same way as the 'cool' people they try to be friends with)

 this has happened too many times to even count, with every group my friend has been involved with. i became used to it. the last few times it happened, i was chill, i just thought, oh they always do this, they'll come back to me when this friendgroup doesnt last. which, on its own is already fucked. that is my best and only fucking friend, and i tolerate being treated like that purely cos i dont have a fucking choice. 

this time though, its worse. a couple months ago, i was going through the motions, they just started another random hobby they picked up, and were spending all their time with this new group of people. i didnt get to meet any of them, despite my efforts. but im used to that, im too embarrassing to introduce to people i guess? whatever. i'm cool to just be ignored until they get bored of the hobby or fall out with the group, i'll be there waiting as backup, like always. but then, my friend invites me to an event put on by their new friends. not exactly the kind of thing i'd usually be into (a wrestling show) but i was super happy and excited to get a shot at being social, maybe even meet some of their friends cos i never usually get to.  

the plan was, my friend meets me from the bus, we go to the place, sit together and watch this show. that is not what ended up happening. i get off the bus in a place i have no idea where i am, i message my friend, they say they cant come get me cos their busy working the tshirt stand. i'm like, uh okay i guess i'll try and find it myself but i dont know where tf im going. they dont respond. i walk around this town aimlessly, lost, no idea where im meant to be going, randomly run into 2 drunk guys who decide to help me find where im going, and eventually find where the show is happening. i walk in, go up to the tshirt stand where my friend is. i greet them, happy that i found it. they blank me. like, i stand there for a good 5 minutes trying to get anything, a hello, even a glance, but i get fully blanked to the point other people were wondering what was going on. it's a really busy really loud, packed show, i have severe anxiety and my friend is fully ignoring me to the point other people are staring at me. i say something like ""uh.. okay i'll be outside? its really busy in here and i thought we'd be sitting together...."" and walk back out like an idiot, have a full on panic attack in the hallway, and look back in at my friend who still hasnt even registered my existence. 

i stand in the doorway watching the show for like 20 minutes, then defeatedly walk back out to where the two drunk guys are who helped me are, i sit down with them and order a drink. i text my friend saying i'm still outside, no response still. i proceed to just hang out with these drunk guys, which was quite nice (i dont often get to socialise), i keep texting my friend throughout the afternoon, no response ever. i hang around outside of where the show  is when its finishing and people are leaving, text my friend im there, still no response and i dont see them. i end up going home, and even the next morning my friend hasnt responded to me at all. it doesnt make any sense to me, i couldnt stop trying to work out what had happened during the time between that morning when we were excited and planning the day, and me arriving at that place. i couldnt stop obsessing over what i had done wrong. 

i dont hear anything from my friend, for 2 weeks, all the while they were posting about hanging out with their cool wrestling friends. i eventually gave up messaging.

after 2 weeks, im scrolling facebook, and i see they've posted this: ""i'm going to do the impossible! i'm going to get my lighter back!"" literally just as im looking at this post, trying to work out what they mean, my doorbell rings. i instantly know who it is, cos post has already been and literally no one else ever rings my doorbell. i look out of the window, utterly fucking stunned. i then go onto my phone and open all message logs i have with them, and tripple check i havent missed any calls, i havent. starting to get annoyed that they would show up unannounced out of nowhere after ignoring me for weeks, i dont let them in, i call down from the window and basically just ask ""wtf?"" they respond by saying they want their lighter that they left here. what fucking lighter did they want, you ask? a literal 50p disposable lighter that they left in my flat god knows how long ago. that they were now here unannounced to demand back, like collecting their things after dumping someone. at this point i was fucking angry, who the fuck do they think they are. i say ""go away, man"" and shut the window. 

this is where they start to freak out. they start to scream and shout, for like half an hour they screech up at my window, until some idiot decides to let them into my building. once in my building, they literally kick my flat door as hard as they can, repeatedly, and scream. i shut myself into my bedroom, and turn the music i had on right up, with my hands over my ears, trying not to have a meltdown. (i have severe ptsd, especially when it comes to violent or aggressive men) im not sure how long they bashed the fuck out of my door, because i was quite distressed at the time, but it was at least a good 20 minutes before the banging and screaming stopped. after a few hours i looked outside and they were gone. (i want to stress just how unlike them this is, theyve never been aggressive like this before, i was more just shocked than anything)

when i checked our messages again, just to make \*double double\* sure they hadnt messaged me about what their fucking problem was, they still hadnt, and now i was blocked. this was 2 months ago i think? i decided to stop trying to work out what i did to piss them off, because its not fair that i drive myself insane over it when they should have just told me. i knew that they'd come back, when they run out of cooler friends. they always do. but this time, i wasnt going to fucking be there. i wasnt going to take this treatment, i have self respect. thats what i kept saying to myself anyway. 

now, time has gone by, just enough time to remind me what it's like with literally no one. and today, i got a message. short simple message. ""hi""

hi????????? it's not even an apology. fuck, it isnt even an excuse! its fucking nothing. hi????????

i now dont know what to do. should i respond?

is my self respect worth damming myself to loneliness? what would you do?"
lonely,I hit rock bottom and I can’t get up,"I hit rock bottom and I can’t get up - I’m struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I’m generally an optimistic person who thinks that things will be alright in time, but this time I am actually enveloped in darkness. I’m starting to neglect my own health, my school work, the people around me, and I can’t seem to do anything about it. I lost my lover who was also my best friend. The only person who understood me and listened to me. I feel abandoned; I feel homeless despite being at the place i was born in. My family doesn’t understand emotions at all, and can only seem to offer financial support. I know i’m lucky for that , but it’s so hard to feel like you belong nowhere. I really can’t see where my life will go after this. It’s so difficult. I just want to give up, but i know that it will make things worse , so i make the effort to reach out to other people. I never wish this upon anyone else. This loneliness, this feeling of being discarded, of having nowhere else to go to. I can knly wait for the sun to rise again while i make my way through the dark.

Anyways, i’m open to chatting. I hope to have company and be of company to other people as well."
lonely,I don't enjoy it here anymore,"I don't enjoy it here anymore - I haven't felt truly happy in a long time. I can't remember what its like honestly. Eventually I'll be more by myself than I am now. People come and people pass. I don't know if I matter. I wish I didn't have to be here anymore. 

I try to distract myself and keep myself busy so I don't have to be stuck with my own thoughts. This life feels like a waste of time if my mind is my biggest enemy. Do lobotomys still exist? I'm so tired but I sleep all day. I don't think it should be this way. 

Every day feels the same. It is not fun being lonely. I stop myself from doing more because I don't feel good enough for anyone. Some days I dont feel like me. Some days I feel like routine and its a blur. I try my hardest to just get by. 

I don't like being awake. I'd rather not. I can't tell who I am anymore really. I don't remember who I was in the past either. Life feels like it just happened. I'll try to be better. I just want to feel accepted before I die."
lonely,Loneliness despite not being alone,"Loneliness despite not being alone - Hey folks, this is a weird thing for me to post because I can see so many people on here dealing with problems bigger than mine, I have a handful of friends (I don’t see too often but talk to constantly) and I have a gf and a nice job but I still just constantly feel somewhat alone, like I’m missing that one strong connection to someone who truly gets me. Some of my friends can fill that role in certain ways but the feeling still persists and I guess I just needed somewhere to sound off where someone may understand.

Thank you for reading and of anyone would like to chat, feel free to message me :)"

lonely,Feeling so alone tonight,"Feeling so alone tonight - I’m 17 weeks into my first pregnancy and I’ve had another fight with my husband. 

We fight all the time. We are terrible team mates. We get into huge blowouts about hanging curtains. 

I know I feel alone because I always have this gnawing feeling that he doesn’t really know me. Nor does he really want to get to know me. 

Most days I don’t really feel heard and I feel put down when I have opinions because he doesn’t think that we’re allowed to have differing opinions. 

It really hurts me to type all this out as we’re in our first pregnancy and in the process of buying our new home. We’re in couples therapy but my husband refuses to see a therapist on his own to do work on himself - something our therapist has advised for years. 

There has always been fundamental differences between him and I but we’ve always chocked it up to “opposites attract” but this pregnancy has really put our issues to the forefront. 

Tonight feels so suffocating."
lonely,This is the objective of LIFE,"This is the objective of LIFE - The objective of the life game is *to SURVIVE* 
And what matters in life is how you choose to survive. 

Someone will decide :
1. Let me Go and be a farmer. I will plant to get what to eat. The rest I will barter for timber to build my house and buy cattle. 

2. Another will decide : Let me go to school. I will learn wisdom and come back and build for the farmers in exchange for food and timber to build. 

3. Another one will say: let me join army. I will protect my people from enemies and in exchange I will earn what to eat and where to sleep. 

4. The 4th will say: let me go to far lands and bring things and sell to farmers, to elites, to guards, and in exchange I will also survive. 

5. Another will decide : I dont have a land to farm, money to go to school, energy to join army, and capital to travel to far lands. Let me remain here and help any farmer or builder who needs help. 

6. Yet another will decide : People want to be happy after work. Let me dance and sing for them. I will also survive from the little they give me. 

7. And the last one will say: I am born poor, but I am destined to be great. Let me invest my time in creating some thing that no one has ever seen and I will earn from it to become very rich and more powerful. 

ALL THESE PEOPLE WILL SURVIVE but will have different levels of wealth. Wealth is just a measure of how well you survive.  It's the road you choose to take the makes all the difference in life.

lonely,Just another pretty face....and a little bit of a rant.,"Just another pretty face....and a little bit of a rant. - So I know the title sounds a little cocky.....but to be honest, I am so sick and fucking tired of people looking at me and thinking I am perfect simply because according to others, I am ""so pretty."" Well, after years of abuse from so many relationships (boyfriends, friends, family, etc) I don't see myself that way but am working so fucking hard on just being okay with myself.....because every person that meets me, talks to me....just expects me to be so perfect and pristine all the time. Then the glass shatters, the filter eventually fades and they realize I am an actual human being. They finally see that I am a person with severe PTSD. That every single time I said ""I am constantly fighting self harm. I have a history of severe depression and suicidal attempts,"" they took for granted until reality finally came through and I break down because I can't fit that perfect image they expect of me. My best friend always just leans on me and just takes full advantage of my patience....breaks down, cries, late night calls.....but if I reach out to her because I can't sleep, because my heart hurts, because I am crying and can't stop because innately I am scared of myself.....she doesn't answer.....she won't even give me a response the next day. Instead I get posts from instagram, or my boyfriend isn't being as open as he should be. 

No one ever asks me if i am okay. No one fucking seems to care about me unless there is something I can do for them.....because all they see is a god damn fucking pretty face and they just expect me to be perfect, and strong and omnipotent.....but i am not. I am human. I am sad.....i am incredibly lonely and depressed.......i just want one person to genuinely ask me if i am okay and to actually care about me when I tell them ""I'm not okay....I am avoiding going home so I don't have to be alone in bed again, crying because I am severely traumatized from years of abuse."" No one wants to hear that....no one wants to even try to understand....so I avoid home.....I attend therapy.....and I pray to my gods that tomorrow is better than today and that at some point....i will finally stop crying."

I understand now why so many people hate low effort dm's, but at the same time in so desperate to make a friend that I'm just try to go the extra mile and respond to those low effort texts. it's really disheartening that the only way someone can get attention is by being in a place so dark that they want to end everything, then only do people want to care. I've even gotten to a point where I myself don't want to try to put in any effort in making dm's cause I try to put all this thought and sincerity in the first message I send someone but I never get a reply back, now I just copy paste the same message to everyone so it looks like I put in effort cause I'm just tired now"

I was in an abusive relationship with a narcissist off and on for about 3 years. Broke things of a year ago and I’m still dealing with the repercussions. 

I spent this last year single. Working on myself, practicing self care, trying to figure out what I even enjoyed doing anymore. I’ve grown leaps and bounds since that time, but the feeling of loneliness has gotten progressively worse. 

I decided to try Bumble again, thinking that maybe I was ready to date again. I matched with a guy who lives in the same apartment as me, in the room right next door. This sounds like fate, right? Atleast that’s what I thought, until I realized all this guy wants is something casual. 

I’m such a fucking idiot, for sleeping with him after only one date, I literally hate myself for it. I should never have even met up with him in the first place. Every time I walk into my room, my heart starts racing because I have no idea if I’m going to hear him in the other room with another girl (It’s already happened). I have no peace.

I try making new friends but idk, it’s so hard when I have nothing to talk about especially on call as I’m just a anxious wreck.

lonely,Longing is worse than loneliness,"Longing is worse than loneliness - I guess it's a part of a larger whole (you could consider longing part of loneliness), but I much prefer just being generally lonely; desiring a relationship with someone but not thinking of someone in particular. That's at least easier to rationalize and compartmentalize away.

Longing, more specifically, pining for someone you know doesn't reciprocate/have no guts to confess to, is so fucking awful. Especially if it's a friend. I don't want to feel this strongly about someone. I don't want to ruin our friendship, I don't want to make her uncomfortable, yet I am probably doing both as I act more and more awkward around her. There's no out. I'm thinking about her all the fucking time, and anything that makes me think it's not possible pushes the knife deeper and deeper into my chest. The feeling of emptiness is intensified when there's someone specific. I didn't choose to like her. I can see exactly why I like her, she's awesome, but I didn't make the choice. It just happened. And I'm just being fucking pulled along.

I just want to stop feeling this way. I'd be fine never loving anyone. I just don't ever want to love anyone who I know won't love me back again. Infatuation is fucking evil."

  In my life, I didn't have a good start.   A long time ago, my ex-husband embezzled my money and company money without my knowledge and used it to gamble.   All lost.   He owes a lot of money.   When I finally divorced, my debt was 50/50.  

  I was in my darkest time.   With the help of my friends, I started a new job, repaid debts and gradually accumulated funds.   I have reached this point.  

 But my recent performance is very poor.   I spend every day in nostalgia, sadness and loneliness.   It has been more than five years since my marriage ended.   My failed marriage is a short story, but it has brought me great pain and unimaginable process.  

  The pandemic has made life difficult for everyone.   It is difficult to meet a suitable person in life, but the good thing is that I still hope that I can meet some mature and stable men, preferably from Canada and the United States.   When the pandemic is over, plan to do meaningful things together!  

 Over time, we will make new friends, but I believe that few people are fortunate enough to meet some kind, positive and sincere people.   So I will look for it slowly.   Maybe it's not just about being friends, we all need to wait and see"

This is oversimplified but I just had a nightmare about her treating me like shit and genuinely not caring about while just being verbally aids. I might be suffering with schizophrenia but I genuinely have no clue anymore. Anyway I tried to reach out to her to talk to her for comfort she was sleeping and I woke her. She offered 0 comfort told me to basically see a doctor about it and went to sleep. I have no one else to talk or call to and every person I find on Reddit she has a go at me about it and just straight up claims that I’m creepy and weird for it so I lose genuine connections of people who I felt would’ve cared. I’m just tired of no one caring about me. I feel like shit and I have no one and no one does care. And I hate how it’s getting confirmed straight to my face that she doesn’t give a shit.
lonely,Loneliness has no cure no matter what you do,"Loneliness has no cure no matter what you do - For context I switched to a better paying job a more interesting problem to work on, more hobbies, going out with friends. Trying new things, traveling and nothing makes me feel happy. Nothing cures my loneliness and I’m stuck in the endless loop of misery and depression."

lonely,It might be time to deactivate this Instagram account temporarily.,"It might be time to deactivate this Instagram account temporarily. - I already have deactivated my Facebook, Snapchat, and my public Instagram again. The only accounts I don't have deactivated right now are this Reddit and my private Instagram account. I love both of these accounts. I might keep Reddit for making posts at home, but I really might deactivate this IG for a few weeks. 

I never delete these accounts since I usually revisit my accounts every few weeks/months for a day before deactivating again for a while. Just have been clearing my mind as I continue to try and combat my loneliness."
lonely,My life is...blah,"My life is...blah - I'm 35 been with my husband since 2003 married in 2010. 1 daughter. Which I am blessed and love them so so much. But That's it. My relationship with my mom is ok. I just lost my dad in Feb. I have absolutely NO friends. The couple of friends I did have did me wrong. My husband and I talk but mostly about bills, responsibilities normal marriage stuff and that's it. I have 2 sister in laws...one is new and older much older. The other one I feel is just that..another in law. My cousin's live out of state. I have no siblings. So when it comes down to a problem I have none to talk to. My husband is a black or white kind of man there is no in-between...an is what it is man. So venting or complaining or just holding a Convo with him on a feminine level is a no-go. How sad is it that I basically hold a Convo in my head with myself. I envy those who have a best friend."

lonely,Always feeling lonely,"Always feeling lonely - I recently just moved to a new town for college. I went to a college that nobody else I knew really went. My older sister goes to the same school and I think the biggest reason I wanted to go here was because I wouldn't be at home, but I would have family. When I accepted myself into this school I was in a very different place emotionally, and now that I am actually here I am miserable. Not only do I miss being home, I also am having an issue making new friends. I've met a very good amount of people, but I haven't been able to connect with anyone, everyone had just been annoying me. But because of this I spend most of my time alone. My dorm roommate is gone most of the time and usually at home, and when she is here she doesn't invite me to a lot of things. When i'm alone in the room and hear all these people walking up and down the hall with all their friends I start to get really sad. I've cried a lot, been pushing away my boyfriend back at home because I feel like I can talk to anyone. I never tell anyone my issues which makes it worse, but I think its just because I've realized i've just grown to be a loner. If anyone has advice, I would love to hear it:)"

lonely,Person to vibe w,"Person to vibe w - Someone to just go on adventures with, hiking, long drives just listening to music, jus chill and look at the stars at night, go try new places to eat, do random stuff like bird watch, read books, jus enjoy each other’s presence. Not even a relationship jus a legit connection w someone that gets me n I can vibe w. I always think about this and thought that person would come around eventually, but everyday jus seems more and more like it’s never coming."
lonely,Broken or broken hearted?,"Broken or broken hearted? - I’m truly grateful for Reddit, as I’m often a coward who cowers at the thought of being emotional in person to people so I often hide my deepest feelings, to start my parents never taught me anything about growing up or being in a relationship, they didn’t warn me about sex, relationships, life, literally nothing, my mom was a gambler and she constantly put herself in bad situations that made her poorer even up until now, she doesn’t visit me,And hounds me for money, I was able to get away from her at a young age as the court declared her unfit for a parent so I got emancipated and my friends mother took the guardianship title of me, 

anyway I’ve never had any love I truly felt to begin with, in high school I kept getting my heart broken or used by guys that would sweet talk me into uncomfortable situations,I didn’t know any better and wanted to feel some kinda love even if it was fake, I met a few guys who mostly tried to rape me and I didn’t know what sex was because I wasn’t taught about it so I let it happen, I met my ex in high school and we quickly fell in love with eachother, we had a great relationship, he was super loyal, loving, patient &amp; then my grandma kicked me out because I wasn’t important to her and I had to live  with him and his family, 

after 2 years he would make comments about other girls being attractive that upset me, whenever I tried to talk to him he told me shut up bitch, or go away. I was in love with him so I stayed with him despite the mental abuse, then it got worse he started physically abusing me( slapping, grabbed by the throat, pushed me into the wall) he would also call me stupid and useless, I was so stockholme syndromed for love that I kept forgiving him, 

then after putting up with years of suffering,  I had the courage to end the relationship, for the first time I opened up to a guy I had met at work about the situation and that I didn’t understand what was happening to me or why, and the guy was their to comfort me and he gave me the affection I desired, so I went behind my ex’s back got drunk with him and we hooked up, I felt guilty but I was hurting and wanted someone to show me some love, 

anyway the guy had left the job and we didn’t talk much, I began meeting new guys at work and one I liked very much but he used me for sex and bought me gifts and said the sweetest shit ever to get me to fall for him, he got promoted left the job and came in person to my job to come break my heart, he said he found a girl that wasn’t mental and crazy, and that I’m too much to handle, 

I’ve been through so many hookups that I generally can’t feel my heart anymore I solely rely on pleasure and I end up being emotionally dead to any guy I meet,yet I’m flirty and I’m full of hormones but since being abused and heart broken I have no interest in guys romantically, dating itself actually makes me sick to my stomach, 

I have lots of guys I talk too but I cannot feel anything for them, even pleasure Is becoming too much of a chore to fake, truly I don’t know what is wrong with me but my heart physically feels shattered, I’m only 23 but I just don’t care for love anymore and truly lost in finding my heart, I feel lonely in the sense that I push any guy away and never acknowledge their feelings because I’m hurt."

lonely,25 and no friends,"25 and no friends - I am 25 and will be turning 26 in 3 months. I have no friends, no social life, absolutely no one to hangout with. It's just getting to a point where I'm worried that my life will continue like this forever, it's been this way for almost 3 years now. I workout everyday; I have a pretty hectic job so I'm pretty busy all day, but at night and on weekends the blues start kicking in and it's all downhill from there. I recently removed all my social media except reddit because it just makes me sad and I feel like a loser when I see people my age having fun and enjoying their lives. What do you guys do when you feel this way? I'm sick of watching movies/shows, playing video games, going for a run whenever I'm feeling low; I just don't know what to do anymore."
lonely,"Newly lonely here, how do I cope?","Newly lonely here, how do I cope? - Just a summary: I have like three friends and two are far away. All of them kinda dropped off the face of the earth out of nowhere and I was trying to tell them I needed them emotionally that moment (I’m not overly clinging-it was the first time in months). I’m having relationship issues. I have zero family support in my life. When I have struggles, I literally have no one to turn to and I’m feeling so alone. It feels so good to be at least one person’s number one. 

Also it seems like social media people post large get together photos and it makes me feel so confounded that people can have so many others in their lives. 

My boyfriend’s friends speak with him daily, spend time with him via video games for at least an hour a day, and see him mostly every weekend. 

I just don’t get how I’m supposed to develop something like that at 25. It seems too late, and I hate feeling this isolated and unsupported. How do you handle it?"

Says it's too much pressure for him, even though I keep telling him that I don't expect him to fix me. It just makes me feel so bad, to be rejected because of my deepest insecurities. Estranged from my own family, I just want to find a place that I can call home, where I can feel seen and accepted. The way I am. I know I deserve it. I try to give that to myself. But somehow it just doesn't feel the same. Here I am. Sitting in my apartment alone staring at a burning candle. Wrapped myself in a blanket but I can't pretend that it feels as good as being in someone's arm. I guess for now it will have to do. Good night everybody."

It’s sad to say I have not outgrown from it. I been through so much trauma and pain  it feels like that’s the reason why I feel down so much. My adolescence years wasn’t what it should’ve been. I never had a group of friends I can go around and just do things with, let alone have memories. It is so hard to just be out and about because I have no idea what I am doing.

I am at a loss for what to do. It feels endless. I struggled with substance abuse for a year due to loneliness (have been nearly 3 months sober) but it all seems futile and I am getting increasingly allured by relapsing.

My mood seems to wildly fluctuate from positive and focused to suicidal in an instant several times a day and I don’t know why. This cycle becomes extremely tiring by the end of the day.

Usually, it doesn't really bother me but It made me sad knowing that all my life (I'm 17) I have never talked to a girl that I loved and that it will continue that way. She was cute, and I'm never gonna be able to have a conversation with her. I'm always in my room listening to people that I will never meet and imagining myself doing things I will never do. I want to show affection to someone. I have always daydreamed about starting a conversation with a girl, and that's so sad. I lived like that for so many years, it's starting to be just really sad. Honestly, even if a can talk to one I'm probably not gonna be happier, I have so many insecurities and my self-esteem is way too low, it's gonna ruin everything."

I cannot seem to attract normal people, it’s always creepy older guys that want sex who message me and give me attention. 
I try to make plans with people, but they never have time for me. Even my own “friends”, they rather hang out with other people instead. And I try to make new friends, I go out to parties and other public places, but afterwards I never hear from them again. 
Nobody cares about my feelings, they only care for my appearance. People use me for their own benefit. They only hang with me for my money, car, or to gain status.  
I sit home laying in my bed on the weekends all the time. My only escape are online apps where I can meet new people, I have more internet friends than in real life. It’s truly depressing and I’m tired of this loneliness. I’ve even felt suicidal because of this, I wish I had friends, I wish I had a boyfriend, I wish I had a social life."
lonely,I wish I didn't have to lie to have a good conversation.,"I wish I didn't have to lie to have a good conversation. - I just got off the phone with another person I catfished. Man does it suck, knowing whatever connection is there won't last forever or move towards anything in real life. I have a few friends at school, both of who have bigger friend groups they're closer to. I just try to act busy during lunch if I can't find one of them which is easy because I'm class president. I could just join a friend group but the things they talk about are just so absurd sometimes. For instance, I overheard someone complaining about a grade they received and wanted to ""smack"" the teacher in the face. They drag their feet about school being so hard but if you put some genuine interest and effort in, the work isn't so bad. But I'm not going to tell them that of course. So I resort to talking to older, nerdy men who understand the value of putting the work in and who will laugh at my nerdy astronomy jokes or genuinely congratulate me after running half marathon distances. People might say to go to your parents for that. My dad doesn't even bat an eye when I tell him the distances I run and my mom forces me to be caught in the crossfire of her hatred for my dad. She told me to call my dad to ask him to pick up my brother and me from school on Wednesdays because it was his day off after he's already told me to tell her he's busy on that day too. She knew he was going to say no. After I called him to ask he said he was busy and my mom said, ""Your dad is always busy."" Like what do I even say to that while my dad is on the phone? Who do I talk to about my catfishing addiction as a result of emotionally neglectful parenting? I guess just a subreddit. At one point I was talking to a twenty-something-year-old who had a thing for younger girls so he was half-willing while paranoid to talk to me. He was nice but at some point, he recognized he shouldn't be talking to me, someone who openly said they were fifteen. I get it. But when he stopped talking to me, I was so incredibly sad. I never told him about my catfishing issue and he still left because of my damn age. I didn't even enjoy talking to him too much but just having someone to know the half-truth about me was so so nice. I wish I could go to therapy or go on SSRIs. I know I need help. Sometimes I promise myself when I'm really sad at night that I'll get it one day when I'm an adult and I don't need to worry about my parents knowing from insurance. But I end up crying more because that seems so far away. Will I even make it that far? I will because I have too much going for me. I have a one-centimeter diameter growth superficial to my Achilles tendon. I finally told my mom about it after two months of working around it because it hurt to wear closed-back shoes. Turns out I have to get surgery to find out what it is. I was so incredibly scared and I kept asking my mom if I should get the surgery and miss the first month of school as a class president or wait until December for my winter break. I just got yelled at in the car. I felt so alone when I went to go cry in my room after holding it together. I got my first B in my summer anatomy college class that Friday. That's great for my GPA. It isn't everything anyway. My dad told me if I can walk fine it's probably nothing. I was terrified that it was cancer. Now I don't really care. That's one way to take me out. So I currently don't even have a surgery date. My mom's scheduling things during winter break as if I'm not getting the surgery. So I probably won't be even though it costs fifteen dollars after insurance. It doesn't hurt to wear closed-back shoes anymore and I'm not vomiting blood so they're probably right. Just leave it I guess. I overshare with all these men on the internet because I have no one to really talk to about these things. I wish I didn't have to lie. I really wish I could tell someone all my worries and childhood trauma and all the things wrong with me. But I'll have to settle to pouring it little by little on thousands of men. Because I'm pathetic. Other people have bigger issues than me, I shouldn't be complaining. I have a roof and food and all the basic nessesities. That's how my dad sees it. ""Oh, my child should be happy because they have all of that so I shouldn't have to be involved."" My mom likes to use my dad's absent parenting as a rebuttal during her screaming sessions. She's an angry parent. She screamed at my brother and me that my Dad never pays attention to us, never wonders if we've eaten that night, and doesn't love us but we're too glued to our screens to notice and we're stupid. She was yelling at us because she heard my brother playing video games at 12PM on a school night. I think my brother and I both realize it. And we distract ourselves with the online world. I need to wipe my tears o go eat dinner soon. I'm really grateful to have a space where someone may hear me, even if that's it."

lonely,Had a emotional breakdown 2hrs ago after burning my legs.,"Had a emotional breakdown 2hrs ago after burning my legs. - I apologise for any grammatical mistakes.
I just had probably my first ever emotional breakdown. I have been having rough couple of days, barely had 4 hours of sleep and only had one meal yesterday and I live alone in a shitty rented room. I usually don't communicate my feelings and just push them at the back of my head and have been doing this for years now. I woke up today around 3 because coz I was hungry and decided to boil some milk to make something, and the shitty thing happened. It started foaming and I panicked, It slipped from my hand and it all fell on my right inner thigh and most on my left foot. I shit you not now I'm laughing at my pathetic self while writing this. I got rid of my lower cloths as it was buring like hell. And I don't know what happened but for some reason I started feeling freakish nausea and extreme  dizziness. I felt like vomiting. Ran to the toilet and🤣 took a shit instead. I came to my room stumbling, naked from the waist down and just passed out from pain for like 5 mins on my bed door fully open (mind other tenants live across the hall). After that I woke up to this unbearable pain and burning sensation. I didn't know what to do. Tried to call my parents but their phones were switched off, could call other because never I have talked to them and was naked. AND THERE I WAS realising I am truly ALONE, in PAIN and SHAKING, no one to ask for help. I started crying (can't cry loudly because of childhood stuff).Thinking what a worthless pile of crap I am. Not fit to live alone. No one who I can count on . All while am in pain I started remembering that at the age of 22 I have achieved absolutely nothing even without comparing myself to my sibling or my cousins(which my parents love to do). This thing went for half hour. Then I just applied the only thing I had, an antiseptic petroleum jelly and sat here. It's not as painful as before. It swelled up a bit now the swelling is gone and there are couple of blisters. What should I do? Physical pain always go away but this thing in my head is worse."
lonely,everyone i get close to leaves me,"everyone i get close to leaves me - so much so that i'm scared of getting close to people. 

i've always been guarded and on high alert with people, and selective of who i let into my life because i'm scared they'll get to know me so well enough, that they'll find the door themselves and leave. i know people come and go, and i've grown up teaching myself that i'm fine by myself, that i love my company and respect myself enough that if someone wants to leave i won't beg, but it's honestly getting hard to say goodbye to people i wish would just stay. 

during my uni days, i had one close friend who i could talk to about personal things, would hang with outside of class, and even once had a huge breakdown in front of (about the topic i'm talking about now). he was the one who reassured me that although people come and go, better things will come and all you can do is wait for the next best thing. i really trusted and felt like i had made a life long friend who understood me, but after getting a girlfriend, he stopped talking to me. i've been left on delivered for over 3 years now, haven't seen or spoken to him since. i wish i could reach out and catch up but i don't even want to bother if he's the one who let me go. i don't hate him for it, i just don't really understand. i thought our friendship was meaningful but i guess it was something he could let fizzle out. i guess i was someone he could live without. 

i try not to care because like he said, that's just life. but i've been saying that way too much lately because history keeps repeating itself and the people i open up to and get close to always seem to find a way out of my life and t hurts. i want to be able to trust people but they just keep proving why i shouldn't. 

i'm just getting tired because as much as i try to lie to myself that i'm ok by myself, i'm still human and slip up and wish people would stay.  i wish i meant enough to someone that they'd be scared to lose me the way i'm scared to lose the people i love. but i cant imagine that happening with how guarded i've become as a result of losing people. it's a terrible cycle. what a scam"
lonely,Family gatherings are torture.,"Family gatherings are torture. - 22M.

You know the feeling when you go to a family event and everyone starts asking if you have a partner?

No. I am ugly, introverted and haven’t even kissed a girl before. Nobody wants to be with a kissless virgin. Is that what you wanted to hear grandma?

Don’t get me wrong, I love my family, but it’s embarrassing being a single loser when all your similarly aged cousins have a significant other. They all had a great time with their boyfriends/girlfriends while I sat alone in the corner.

lonely,I think I’m happy… I don’t understand it. It feels nice tho!,"I think I’m happy… I don’t understand it. It feels nice tho! - I finally met someone. It’s only been a little over a month but we are living together. We’ve gone on a small road trip and we seem to be each other’s opposite in the perfect ways. We’re always laughing and having a good time, plus the sex is unmatched by any of my previous experiences. I’ve definitely been lacking in communicating with friends and colleagues. Then I think, hey I was alone for a lot of damn years, imma give up all my time if I need to!!! A lot of my prev posts were about finding someone, and I’ve found him. I haven’t had any bad thoughts while he’s been here. Ofc he does some annoying things like not cleaning up behind himself and changing where I put things but I feel we truly love each other. I’ve met some of his family and friends and everything seems to be heading in the right direction. I just get the feeling that somethings wrong or somehow shits gonna go bad and I’ll be devastated. So although I’m not lonely at the current moment, I figured I’d still post here since I’m somewhat understood in this sub. Am I crazy for feeling like this??!"

I crave new sights, spontaneous adventures, and open-minded people. My boyfriend is that person, but we’re long distance. He’s on the other side of the country. My one roommate does not have those same desires and lays in bed all day scrolling through tiktok. I feel alone, to say the least. I’ve been having on and off suicidal thoughts (I’m not going to do anything) and it’s because of how alone I feel. I also can barely speak to my family and I don’t even know why. I feel misunderstood but I feel like that’s normal at my age and being out of state. How could they understand me? I want friends with similar interests as me. I’m pretty open-minded, empathetic, and interested in a lot of things but my anxiety actually ruins everything. I’m just feeling a little lonely."

I thought perhaps if I moved from nyc to a more rural southern town, I’d be able to find myself a bit more and also make honest connections with people. People here are nicer and easier to speak too. However, whenever I speak to people I feel like I’m living a lie. Like I’m not the person people believe me to be. I also feel like starting a relationship is impossible for me. I’m demisexual and most people don’t understand or even believe me when I explain my feelings regarding my sexuality. It makes me feel as if I’m fake. Almost as if I’m lying to myself. These feelings prevent me from putting myself out in the dating world and even social circles. It feels as if things would just repeat as it always has. There has never been one moment for me where someone physically in my life actually understood and acknowledged who I am. I’m a flawed person and still broken from my past mistakes but I’m glad I am able to turn my life around and strive to better myself in anyway no matter how slow the progress. But damn most days I just feel like with all the time that’s passed since I moved I don’t see the cloudy days ending for years to come.

lonely,Feeling the withdraw,"Feeling the withdraw - On a 24 hour basis, day to day, I remember I would talk to these two people everyday. I would talk to these people on the phone constantly. They were like a second family.  Especially since my normal one is homophoic. We would talk about everything and anything, crack jokes, tell stories about crazy people we have encountered throughout our lifes. It was ""perfect"" you could say. They honestly formed my identity when I didn't have one to admit sadly.Of course we had our issues and arguments like any other friendship. These two were in on and off relationship. For two years if I can remember. The crush was always be one sided or they would have crushs on each other. While they were dating we call but everytime we didn't. I would always assume they would be on call with each other. Even when we were on call they always have a conversation between each other. I would sometimes mute myself so I would interpret them. In most friendships I was the third wheel.  I didn't complain because I was happy to talk them. All of three of us stopped talking to each other. One moved away to a different state, cut off one due to issues I wish to keep private. I am finally feeling the withdraw of constantly being the third wheel. I have noticed that if my freinds are talking to someone or talking to their partner.  I go silent and listen to music. I don't text anyone because I think they are busy, talking to someone more important, or busy. I feel like a bother to put it plain and simple. I just wish this feeling would go away. I know my freinds aren't bothered my existence but the feel that they are is always lingering."

Fast forward to yesterday. I do have sexual needs and I was talking to this guy on a hook up website. We exchanged emails and chatted and then agreed to meet at my place during the day. He started to go down on me and then got super nervous and said that he’s going to bail because he feels bad about cheating on his girlfriend. I didn’t try to convince him to stay and just said “Oh. All good then”. 

Not sure if he made it up because he thought I’m uggo, or he’s genuinely spoken for.

I’ve decided I’ll be solo for now on. I’ll be solo to save myself from anymore pain, heartbreak, betrayal.

I won’t commit to any romantic relationship. Not right now. I won’t be extremely close with people over the internet that I’ve met this year. Anyone that I meet over the internet I personally will do my best to keep heavy boundary. I used to be super lenient on who makes jokes around/about me. But now when I say “Keep my name out of your mouth” I mean it whole heartedly.

I’m not gonna beg anyone to stay in my life. If they leave, they’re gone for good. If they wanna come back after realizing I was never the problem, I’m not gonna say much. I’ll leave it up to their delusion that everything is “okay” between us when reality they’re just another mundane person that I no longer trust. 

I will reclaim what I lost in the name of my own happiness. If I come across mean then so be it. If I come across nice then, I really am flattered, but I just have a lot of trust issues right now. It’s not like I want to see compliments as people being fake but right now,, I wanna survive. I wanna come out of this alive, and nobody will drag me out of this hole except myself.

If this ends up prolonging for more than I intended then, I really won’t mind. It’s not the first time and it certainly won’t be the last. I thank those for making my memories actually worth remembering, but at the same time those are the same people that casted judgement to me and expect me to eat shit and make me fend for myself after I gave them all the moral support I thought they deserved, never again.  No one will get anything from me that easily ever again."

Love is easy to get along with difficult, only constant change and adaptation, to love for a lifetime!Some people do not see each other for a while, they feel hopeless, do not want to contact, it is not a desirable way, if this is really the case, it is not called love, can only be called passion or impulse, love needs time to operate, distance knows horsepower, time shows people.

I have a good personality, generous, easy-going, cheerful, optimistic.But it's okay if you have your own principles and you don't violate [mine.Love](https://mine.Love) love laugh, sometimes very sensitive, love tears.Stiff and awkward in front of the person you like.Don't like arrogant people, pretentious people, not kind people and boring people.

lonely,Met a girl that made my heart beat again,"Met a girl that made my heart beat again - I'm from Taiwan. Sorry for bad English. 

I'm a college freshman and I major in electrical engineering, which consists of mostly male students.

Anyway, one day a girl who also major in EE asked me the direction of the department office. I took her around and introduce different placess such as study rooms and department library. We just casually walked around and talked about classes. 

The next day, I found out that she has the same logic design class as I. After class, when I walked beside her, she recognized it's me. She said hi and I responded too. ""Wanna have some dinner together?"" I asked her.""Of course. Let's head to the restaurant."" She replied. Then we had dinner , chatted and told jokes together. At this moment, I really feel my heart beating faster. Something about her attracts me more than other girls, though I cannot explain it. 

I feel like I probably fall in love with her, which I really concern if that's the case. I had no experience with lover relationships and it would be bad if I fall in love with someone I just met and did not understand.

Now I think what I need to do is to suppress my desire to get more intimate and closer to her. I don't want to rush it and let it flow naturally. You all can feed me some advices"
lonely,It's been over six months since I've really spoken to anyone outside of a club or concert.,"It's been over six months since I've really spoken to anyone outside of a club or concert. - Honestly, half the time I go out, I don't even enjoy myself; I'm just that desperate to be acknowledged. But superficial smiles and meaningless hellos just don't cut it (though I guess it's better than the canned ""thank you come again"" at the grocery store). I understand that a lot of people I know are busy with work and family, but a few texts throughout the week checking in, or better yet a phone call, or god forbid hanging out somewhere quiet and uncrowded, like a park or restaurant would mean so much (closer to nine months since I did anything like that with someone).

I've told a few people, but they just seem to laugh, and think it's all hyperbole (I mean I do have one person I text, but I'm always the one to initiate--unless she wants to talk about how she's having troubles with her other friends or work or some such). Or they act like the fact I have pets should make it all okay. Maybe they're just so far removed from such a lonely life, they have no idea how hard this can be one someone's mental health. It's obvious no one thinks they have any responsibility towards me--which I get--but then they seem surprised or annoyed that I'm not always happy if I do see them out.

I do a lot of things alone; I enjoy a lot of things alone. But I need a little more company / friendship than this."
lonely,Fresh Start,"Fresh Start - After YEARS of ongoing abuse (childhood to adulthood) from my family, today is the day I silently cut them all off. 

I changed my number, deleted my well known social medias (Facebook, Instagram) 

I feel relief but also a little guilt (which is to be expected) I’m working with a counsellor to get through this initial adjustment period. 

Has anyone else done this? Do you have any helpful advice? 

Thank you in advance ❤️"

Just a couple things you should note are that i'm really busy these days so i hope you're from europe because of time zones, i have some mental issues so please understand if i seem sad all the time and also i have trust problems so i won't share all my info at the start of the conversation (we have to get along with each other first so i know that you won't be an asshole to me because i've met many here...).

lonely,When you reach out and there is no one at the other end to hold your hand,"When you reach out and there is no one at the other end to hold your hand - In February 2021 my boyfriend broke up with me. We had been together over 5 years, living together for over 4. I thought we would be together for the rest of our lives... I was 100% invested - I gave it my all.. Now it's rolling around to Oct 25th, the date that would have been our 6th anniversary. I had surgery 3 days ago and am having to recover on my own.  My friends are busy or far away. 

It's so hard for me to ask for help, but I'm in pain today and I reached out to a few friends to see if they could stop by and help me out for a little while. No one is available. I already felt lonely going through this... missing the person I thought would be my life companion, but when I reached my hand out for help and there was no one at the other end....  in that moment, I don't think I've ever felt more utterly alone in this world.

What makes life worth living is time with those you care about. Well he's gone. Others are busy. I don't blame them and I'm not upset with them for it... it just simply *is*.

I know if he were here, he would have helped me recover.... done the laundry, picked up that tissue when I dropped it on the ground and can't bend over to get it.... instead I'm using a grabber, doing all these things alone. You know when you cry and you hurt so deeply that you feel it from your heart all the way down to your toes? That's what I feel right now... drifting away on a cloud, curled up, scared, looking down at everyone else... they seem so happy, so close, but just out of my reach."

lonely,Lonely,Lonely - I feel lonely. My parents don’t really like and I am not good a keeping friends. I told my mother that a few friends forgot my birthday and I was actually totally fine with it but then later when we were fighting she kept saying look at you no one really likes you. My mother has been abusive towards me from a very young age. As a kid I never remembered receiving any kind of affection from her. I was not born very good looking and she always called me names because of that. She is really pretty and is married to my father who is very smart but ok looking. What pissed her off even more was that I was not even smart. My parents keep pointing out traits in me ~all undesirable traits from one another. To top it all off my brother is a olden boy extremely good looking very smart sociable charming extrovert and just a lot more. I have realized that ppl keep me around cause I am funny (I just say stupid shit to make people laugh) they call me when they are bored and down but not when I am bored and down. Sorry if this is not coherent
lonely,Always listening but never listened to,"Always listening but never listened to - How damn lonely I felt during my last birthday (turned 24 a week ago),realizing that I didn’t mean anything to most of the people I “was always there for”. It would’ve really made my day if they sent me the simplest text to wish me a good one. I have never cared about this specific day of the year, but for some reason I felt really sad not getting a notification from certain people.

I wanna tell myself that I’m a nice person, always there for people, listening to their problems, hearing them out, and offering help when I can, but situations like this just makes me feel used and not liked by anyone.

I never show these emotions to anyone and act like everything is fine and living life even if I had problems (which I don’t mind having some of them here and there), but I sometimes feel legit lost, unwanted, and wanna delete every social media account I have and disappear from everyone’s virtual shitty life (of course other than my parents and siblings who have always been by my side)

But in the meantime, I don’t feel like I have anyone that I can turn to and tell them the silliest thing that happened in my day or what I am going through, and even when I open up a bit, I’ll either get ghosted for days if not weeks and then get the standard reply “sorry I was busy”, and by that time I just stop giving an F about telling anyone anything. 

So yeah, always listening to people and trying hard to help them but never listened to. And apparently the only thing I can think of right now is to just stop communicating with anyone and not caring about them as well (which sounds like a horrible trait for me, but whatever, Time to  look out for myself I guess)

Sorry for being lame and whiny, I hope you all have a good day, and that you get through all your problems, it will definitely get better."

lonely,I snapped at my mom and I feel like shit now,"I snapped at my mom and I feel like shit now - Today, I (21F) snapped at my mom out of no where when she was jokingly pulling my older brother's arm like a child while asking to buy my little brother a winter coat. My brother didn't seem angry about it but he did express how he didn't really want to and seeing that made me so upset that I snapped and yelled at her to stop. I told her I'd buy the coat instead and she just proceeded to yell at me back saying I make her feel bad and that she wont ask money from us again. Now I feel like shit because quite frankly idk why I snapped, it was clearly my brothers problem and yet I got angry for him.

For a bit more context, my mom does pay for a large part of our monthly bills with some help from my dad, my grandmother and my older brother considering her job doesn't pay that much. As for me, I just graduated this year and only really started saving up since I got my first real job. I've been paying for my own personal expenses such as phone bill, medication, gym pass, bus pass, therapy, etc. and I just recently started giving 150 bucks every paycheck to my mom to help out.  
 

My mom has given me and my siblings so much and I feel so ungrateful, but another part of me just wants to leave this place so I can just focus on myself."

lonely,I have no one to talk to and it’s so lonely,"I have no one to talk to and it’s so lonely - In my household, I am not allowed to express my emotions. I get told I am being annoying and my siblings tell me they’ve had enough tolerating me venting about serious topics. At school, I get told indirectly that I should die because of my beliefs. I cried about that to my siblings and they told me they’ve heard me mention that numerous times and there’s nothing I can do about it so I should either change my beliefs or move on. Then I said sarcastically “yea because it’s totally normal to tell people they should die” and then my sister said “you’re driving me crazy and I’ve had enough trying to tolerate you for this” and when I cry in front of my siblings I get made fun of and ridiculed. My emotions always get dismissed. I just feel like I have no one I can truly confide in because the message I’ve been getting for all of this is to just suppress my emotions because they don’t matter. And that I don’t matter and that I’m a burden to my family. I just feel so sad and depressed. I even sometimes think about how if I were to die, I wouldn’t mind because it’s not like anyone would miss me anyway. And I’m unloveable. I don’t know what to do anymore because everyone I tried to confide in, dismisses and invalidates my emotions. I wish someone would hear me or care."
lonely,making friends as an adult?,"making friends as an adult? - i'm a 20 year old girl in the uk that dropped out of high school when i was 14 (severe mental illness). i didn't study at all in that time and i also ruined all my friendships and now i'm completely alone aside from family. i'm used to it but having no friends has seemed to destroy all my confidence and motivation and i honestly worry that i won't be able to get my life together until i find a real friendship because it upsets me so much and i struggle to do things. i hope that doesn't sound dramatic, i think it's just been such a long time that now i'm really desperate to connect with someone again. 

i'm wondering if anyone around my age has had a similar experience and managed to get out of that lonely place? how did you do it? i feel like college is my only hope since i'm struggling to get a job with no gcses but that's something i would have to work towards and idk, i already feel too old for college :("

I've cut off everyone I know. My family, friends and well, soon my colleagues too. Technically speaking I'm already off the grid. Why am I doing this? Well that would be cuz of the pretentious people I have hovering over me and giving me toxic positivity oh nooo you have so much to live foooor. Stfu please and thank you. I know I don't belong with them. In this world there is a league for everyone. And I know my league doesn't match the people around me I'm from the fucking hood, the ghettos. What I have around me are those privileged little shits that think they know 1 or 2 about mental health cuz just they watched a documentary about it and saw a few tiktoks. Oooooo I like placing my pencils color coordinated I have OCD. Shit makes me sick. There is one person that I will regret having left and honestly I miss her already. But she is happy, and that's all that matters. I love her a lot and she knows that. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I can't risk anyone knowing about what I had planned but it's gonna be fun. I'm gonna be proving to everyone that they only fucking care when it's too late. For now no one seems to bat an eye even though I'm leaving traces of information of my attempt. But soon I will be revealing my method and everything, following that will be a video of myself doing it later it will be me found dead in a hotel. Antifreeze poisoning is how I chose to do it.

lonely,Being personless is so exhausting,"Being personless is so exhausting - Recently moved off to college to pretend to be smart. Back home I actually had friends yet I still felt lonely so out here my loneliness is through the roof. Its so hard living life without an individual I can depend on to be there for me. In terms of past relationships I have never once had someone who was truly mutual best friends with me and I've longed for that for the last 3 or 4 years. I did once have a gf for 2 years but I realized I was showing her who she wanted to see instead of who I really was and that we wanted completely different things. However it was nice to be her #1 and have her be mine. She was the only girl I've ever felt truly connected to. Since then I met another girl and we hit it off but we were only able to share a month together because of the upcoming school year and neither of us wanted to do long distance. She was much more ""my type""and was the only girl I've ever truly related to. 

The reason that I feel lonely despite having people around is because people rarely ask me any questions about me. It also goes without saying that no one asks me things I consider important: Stuff like ""Is there something on your mind?"" or ""How have you been feeling?"" It sucks because none of my long time friends seem to care whats going on in my head, let alone anybody I talk to at all. I would just love to have one person, one best friend (or long time gf) who i can look out for and vice versa, to take care of each other. Having one single person in my life would make all the difference and help tremendously with my anxiety and depression.

As of now I am practically alone out here, I barely open up to anybody partially because barely anyone even asks me any questions. I am trying new things to make new friends and ideally also make a best friend so we will see how things pan out.

(also im new to reddit and this community so idk if i did this right)"

lonely,People only reach out to because of my helpful nature,"People only reach out to because of my helpful nature - Another vent post. It's weekend and I really got nothing to do. Full disclosure, I don't hate my long distance best friend. She's a lovely person and I love her. It's a story about how we met years ago. We didn't start of really well at first but became closer by the end of third year of high school. She's the typical attractive, tall, fit and fashionable girl who can easily attracts guys. She is not academically gifted though. Whereas, I'm just an average good looking girl. Most people tell me that I'm cute I don't believe so maybe they're just being nice. I admit I'm not that attractive or fashionable as compared to her but I'm smart. I went to a really good law school. I'm kind, humble and emphatic. I don't mean my bestie is a bitch in comparison to me. She's a nice girl too. Anyway, so the end of my high school experience was third wheeling on her dates, movie nights etc. I remember her bf ( now ex) called me out to help pick up a gift for her which was really sweet of him. They would make out or kiss in between movie scene while I was on the same room as them. I wasn't jealous at that time but looking back I'm jealous rn lmao. She used to hide the fact that they had sex or night outs together. I really don't know why she hid that fact. I wasn't going to judge her 😅. Anyway after high school, we both went to separate college and field so we weren't in touch with each other at all. In my third year of college, I made plans to visit her as I wanted to have some fun because my college life sucked a lot. I made good friends in college but felt left out most of the times. It was nice seeing her after a long time. She set me up for blind dates with her guy friends xD. I felt really good hanging out with her guy friends lol.

I always wondered why it was difficult for me to make male friends let alone date someone. It definitely has to do with the fact that I'm not conventionally attractive. Although, I believe I'm a nice person and have girlfriend potential. My experience so far with dating has been disappointment. I can't manage to go beyond the talking stage with guys on apps. If a guy ever reach out to me he would do so for some kind of help. Lol, I guess some of us are not worth for romantic relationships or platonic friendships and that's because of appearance or looks. As I have seen I'm resourceful person and people do reach out to me for work. 

Yesterday, a guy texted me casually asking for help with his start up. I declined and said I'll look out for someone else if he wants. Then he said bye 🥲😂"

All day all I ever see is women complaining that all men are evil or that all men are assholes who just play games.
Meanwhile I just sit here... Alone... Wishing I could meet just 1 person to fall in love with.
Wishing I had 1 person I could really talk to and be with.

But I'm a man and men are the enemy and the whole world just be better off without me in it.

Fuck everything."
lonely,30f - phillyarea - watching Dune alone,"30f - phillyarea - watching Dune alone - I’m excited for this movie but not excited that I’m watching it alone. Alone without a boyfriend. I already watched Venom 2 alone. Going to see Eternals alone. Going to see Spider-Man no way home,  alone.

I think from my movie taste you can figure out what type of girl I am. I am a nerdy, gamer, Otaku and movie buff. I love going to the movies and watching movies. Especially if the movie has a lot of the cast that I’m interested in.

I mean look at this movie. You got Khal Drogo (Momoa), you got Cable (Brolin) who is also Thanos. I love MCU movies. You got Poe Dameron (issac) Who was also that ahole in sucker punch. Yeah I saw that movie and I love that movie and I’ve cosplayed as baby doll. I don’t know who the kid is that’s the lead but he’s pretty cute.

Ideally if I had a man, we would’ve had dinner maybe at Buffalo Wild Wings, then saw this movie, nerded out and discussed this movie, went home where we live with one another because we’re in a long-term relationship like that, fun time in bed and then go to sleep. Oh and we would’ve totally discussed any movie trailers. Because I love the previews and I get mad when people wanna skip the previews. 

But alas, I’m single. Looking for a long-term monogamous relationship with the goal of marriage.

lonely,Bye,"Bye - Forgive  me for my bad English because  it is my second language. 
I was born with a family that isnt really rich nor poor . But i live in a neighbourhood where most of the people are poor . I was raised by an old maid who basically is like my mother at that point. Growing up i didnt had to do much . I did not learn how to do laundry , cook , anything  really. I never asked anything from my parents. But i do sometimes complaint a bit because i was and still dumb.  everyone from middle school to highschool treat me like i was the villain. But yeah that was pretty understandable i would hate too if someone live nicer and had it easier too. Everyone would look down on me. Being picked on alot of times asking money and bullied a lot and criticized  . To a point everything they hate about  me made me hate it about my self. They hate how I had it easier and I hate it how I had it easier.  They laugh how I lack knowledge  about living and I hate how I did not experience  what they had . They hate how I have a maid to babysit me and i hate how i grew up having someone taking care of me . They hate how soft I am and I hate how weak I am . They hate what a waste of money I was and I hate how my parents  would waste  money for me. They hate how ugly and disgusting I am .They say I don't deserve it and I do feel I don't deserve everything I have and I feel guilty  about it. They say I wouldn't understand the suffering they had and I wish I had suffered  the same because I don't deserve anything good .pretty  much made me insecure  about myself. I feel like I deserve to be treat like shit . I hate everyone , I hate smiling , I hate taking a picture  of myself  , I hate my whole existence.i became very insecure that I always try to hide everything I have and wore things that are either torn or broken , but that was when I was a high schooler . Now I am 21 and I live by myself in a car. And I think I am going to end myself.  Because I deserve it . I had given most of my money to charity and people in the street because they deserve it . I remembered I fell in love with the only girl that was helping me in my art class when the art teacher yelled at me and told me to figure it out myself. I wish she is doing fine . She even told me good luck on the day I was about to be sent to a chess tournament (spoiler alert I only thought about her the whole day that I lose the match lmao) . Because she smiled at me a lot,  I thought maybe she want to be either friends with me or something more. I guess  I was wrong she was just a very kind person. Her father died before I met her and one day when I was asking her about math one of her friends came to me and drag me away from her and told me "" you are disgusting "" "" don't you know today was the day her father died last year "" or something like that I don't  remember what she really told me but it basically  mean I was disturbing her or something . And then I learnt that she also were from a poor family. I was simping so bad   I gave some of my saving with rubber band  and my math tool or whatever you call it including my scientific  calculator under her table with a cat drawing on a paper (because I knew she love cats ) without telling her. And after that I left her alone for good. she probably have a boyfriend  for being that pretty ( and I was correct she had a boyfriend she probably  just broke up or something idk ) I feel guilty for just taking her attention. I don't  deserve to meet someone like that . I regret making her wasting her time on me . But yeah that was when I was like 16 or 17 . I guess  this is where it ends . Thank you for reading my broken English  essay of my undeserving life. I love you mimi, I will never forget for what you had done that had inspired me but this is the end ."
lonely,I think I’m afraid of people,I think I’m afraid of people - Whenever someone is kind to me I usually will think “what do they want from me?” “are they just playing with my feeling?”. I don’t like interacting with people I don’t know so I’ll probably never have an IRL friend again.
lonely,Another year alone,"Another year alone - Tomorrow I will hit 23 and like every years I will say to my self « another year alone ».
I never had a girlfriend before and nothing shows me that this will change any time soon. I try to have one but I always end up in the same situation wondering what am I doing wrong, what’s wrong with me and why do I always have to go through this.
I thought it will be less painful with time but no, the more it happens the more it hurts.
Is it that hard to find someone to who you can say « I love you » and get an « I love you » back ? 
I just want to love someone, to get hugs from her… I just want to be truly happy for once.
Every time I thought I’ll finally get what I want the most, it disappears and I end up alone once again.
Tomorrow I will have 23 and it will be another disappointing year alone. 
I know there’s more difficult situations than mine and I shouldn’t be complaining that much but I wanted to say what’s on my mind for once. 
I’m still young so I will keep searching and hoping for my happy ending but time fly…
I hope for everyone in here that you will find your happy ending as well."

She’s no longer in my life like she said she would be. “No matter what,” she said. She left me in this space where I don’t recognize who I am. I feel alone and empty here. She’s the one person I want to talk to right now but I know we’re not going to anytime soon. Instead, I have these pretend conversations with her in my head but it’s not the same. I know it’s like talking to a wall and I know it’s very pathetic of me but it helps me get stuff off my mind. She would always bring a smile to my face, even when I would be very serious. Why am I still reminiscing about things in the past? Why can’t I just live in the present and be happy like everyone else? I see others living their happy lives while I walk among them putting on this fake smile to fit in. It doesn’t help that my mind gets wild around this time of night. Why do I want something that I can’t have? Why can’t I just move on and begin to be happy again?"

lonely,Confusion,"Confusion - Some days, some weeks are harder than others, especially when you feel stuck in life. It’s frustrating when you don’t know how to interact with people and feel like the world is out to get you. It kind of stacks up from there. The only time I feel positive is when others say good things about me which is very rare. I naturally want to be kind and help others out but it’s disappointing when you never get anything in return. I know I’m not the only one that experiences this, which is why I want to make a new friend and find people I can vibe with, without being judged right off the bat. I have an extremely low tolerance for that these days. You can have one super bad experience and then a pleasant interaction 15 minutes later which at that point you don’t even care for anymore. It’s not hard to feel like you are being trolled by the world. I kind of know at that back of my mind, that Im right about my suspicions, some will just do anything to prevent you from pursuing your dreams in life and trying to steal that light within you, have some control over you. I mean what is wrong with having visions for yourself?"

I just had a nice fun chat with a stranger who I thought might be nice to write to regularly, so I said she could send me a message any time. The message I received was pre-written spam. It's actually really got to me as I was very open and enjoyed the little chat we had in a thread, but I feel like it was just to butter me up into joining her kickstarter project.

Spiritually and emotionally I’m exhausted. I hurt a lot, constantly. All of my relationships have failed, and I don’t think I’ll ever have a healthy long-term relationship with someone any time soon. I’m okay with that, I’m not in a position to be in a relationship anyway. I’m not rich at all but I’ve managed to build relatively comfortable savings during university with a range of hustles and investments. I have zero debt. After graduating I’m considering leaving the country for some time, somewhere less developed and cheaper than California. I have no idea where. I just desperately need change. I can work remotely for income so I can eat, I’m okay with living humble. I speak spanish and French and my parents were avid adventurers so I feel fine navigating the unknown.

lonely,26M I don't know anymore I'm broken [chat] [friendship],"26M I don't know anymore I'm broken [chat] [friendship] - I'm just a lost broken soul trying to find where he belongs.. if that's anywhere 👉👈
The past three months have been torture literally being broken down to literally numbness by someone who was supposed to be there. By someone who supposedly cares for me... as they say this continuing to knock me down and drag me through the mud and not even caring. 

In all honesty I have no friends. No one ever stays, so all through this I have been and I am alone. I am just looking for a friend... anyone who would be willing to just talk, laugh, and connect building a friendship. 

I guess I should tell a little about myself. I'm 26. I live in the US and would like it if anyone who responds to this is also from the US or nearby I suppose. I have social anxiety, so along with my weirdness comes socially awkwardness as well

My likes/hobbies are photography, playing games, listening to music, going on walks at night, and anything horror or conspiracy related. 

I don't really know what else to put, so I guess if you'd like to talk to someone who is broken, awkward, weird, numb, and enjoys horror then feel free to message me...
If not I understand and I hope you have a wonderful day/night 

I do have discord if it's easier. Sometimes notifications don't work on here for me, so just throwing that out there. 
Also I have a cringy tiktok.. so yeah there's that too."

lonely,My only friends are fictional characters,"My only friends are fictional characters - This sounds weird, but genuinely right now, and for a while, it feels like the only people I have in my life are fictional characters. 

I'm 19F, and have always been told I'm a likeable, intelligent, fun, ambitious person who would make a great friend. I've been told by the friends I've had in the past that I'm a kind, loving person and always have the best intentions. 

But for the past six years or so, it's seemed like making friends has become extremely difficult. I only have one friend right now, and that relationship is seeming to fade too. I was talking to a guy I was interested in for awhile, the first one after having an abusive relationship a few years ago, but he recently seemed like he came up with an excuse to stop talking to me. It feels like with genuinely everyone I try with I get rejected. 

I have a tendency to become obsessed with media I like , and right now it feels like some characters in a show I like are my only friends. Like I actually have a connection to them and have been there with them throughout their journeys. (I'm aware it's fictional just as an fyi) 


I escape into their world so much it feels like I'm there and a part of their adventures, but when I get out of that mindset and realize I'm as lonely as I am I become very depressed. 

It's as if I lost someone. And I so badly wish they were real and my friends.

Started school last year and fuckin hate my life. 

I have no ability to talk to or get girls while everyone around me is in a relationship or fuckin someone. I smoke weed literally 24/7 throughout the day. I have two friends that I knew prior to even getting here. I don’t leave my apartment. I skip class. I literally do nothing but this every, single, fucking day.

Here I am on a Friday night, sitting on my phone in my childhood bedroom. I come back home often cause there ain’t shit for me at school. But here I am doing literally nothing at all other than being alone on a fuckin Friday night when I should be having fun and getting laid and all that shit.

I had dreams of what life here would be like. I really thought getting here a year ago would change everything for the better, and that being in a new environment would be good for me. I thought I’d be going to parties, meeting lifelong friends, and doing everything the ever so bullshit college experience that was illustrated for me was supposed to be.

lonely,Alone and no one knows (20M),"Alone and no one knows (20M) - (Please read) This issue has been going on for the past 3-4 years although the main problem has happened on/off since I was 8 years old. 

Basically most of my family were born into Jehovah’s Witnesses. My mom and all her siblings, and my grandparents on my moms side. 

I was born (twin) in 2001 and my mom shortly after had an aneurism that basically left her paralyzed her whole left side. She was a great mother looking back, surviving another 20 years before she passed away this year on Jan 1. While growing up tho, even though she was a Jehovahs Witness, she hardly showed the qualities you would expect. She wasn’t great but she wasn’t bad. She was strict and was on disability with social security checks every month so my childhood wasn’t as memorable as most other kids. I didn’t make many friends because of this and just kinda floated my way through school. High school was good but I wish I did more. Looking back I wish I participated in sports, in order to make friends and less about the Witnesses.

The congregation I grew up in is probably the exact opposite of what you would expect from Jehovah’ Witnesses. They are supposed to be kind and caring. The congregation did hardly anything to help me except push me to get baptized. They aren’t supposed to gossip or talk badly about others. They always spread lies about my family. And gossip spread like wildfire. Looking back, I know I was never ready to become a witness because I had a bad addiction to porn and kinda still do but I’ve moved on now. The serious problem was I realized I was bi and absolutely nobody knows, most likely due to the addiction. Ever since Covid started, the witness’ have been the last thing I worry about because they aren’t my friends and they don’t actually care about me. And being bi, I have had quite a few hookups with guys that no one knows about either. All during Covid because why not? I’m happy with myself and don’t feel bad being a witness while also being bi. I plan to denounce my faith soon, probably when someone finds out. Basically every problem in my life has been caused by the witnesses. I couldn’t make friends at school. I couldn’t pursue dating or relationships with girls. I couldn’t participate in school activities. I had to go in service every weekend and meetings twice a week. I had to stand in front of 100 or so people and read or lecture them, which stressed the hell out of me. And now that I’m 20 years old and seeing how the witnesses could have actually helped my mom but didn’t, I no longer have friends who I’m honest with, and someone who knows my whole story. I’d love to at least have at least one good friend."

Today I went to my parents room so I could at least talk with them, bond with them and my father literally shouts at me: ""Your actions were bad.""
I seriously didn't expect my father to tell me that just because I didn't have much sleep or genuine fun. They see me everyday playing video games and then call me fine like nothing is going on. I find it really difficult to even open up to my parents, I feel like I can't do it.
The only person I can be honest with is my best online friend. She's been with me for two years now and hasn't abandoned me and neither am I planning to, but I just don't want to flood her chat with me ranting about my issues in real life. I don't have any other choice but to do so and yet I don't understand how she manages to understand me or just try to cheer me up or support me in general.
""Will I be able to talk to other people?""
""Will I be able to live properly?""
""Will I be able to smile like it's not a big deal?""
""Will this pain go away?""

I don't know anymore, I can't feel anything but sadness, pain, misery, anger and loneliness."
lonely,people suck so much,"people suck so much - you meet faceless strangers online and they have no meaning to you, or they shouldn’t considering you had such a brief interaction. but they can do the most annoying things and they’re the people that make you sarcastically go “you must be fun at parties” knowing full well they probably don’t even know what proper friends are. I’m just super upset right now when i realize that every amazing friendship i had online i’ll never have it again bc people suck. except the person reading this cuz ur super cool. but to all the weird and rude people that pissed me off today i hope they start to have a sneeze but never actually sneeze. i hope they think they charged they’re phone overnight only to realize they never actually did the next morning. but anyways cheers to not having friends 🥂"
lonely,I have no one anymore,"I have no one anymore - All of my friends irl have abandoned me. I get ghosted by friends, and partners. I don’t know whats wrong with me. I call and no one picks up or I’m just plain blocked. After everything I’ve been through with the person. Eventually I give up. The only person I have left is my mom. I swear I call her about 8 times a day no joke. I have no one else. It’s so hard to meet people irl, I’m afraid I’ll always be this lonely."
lonely,Anyone experience not being able to do anymore?,"Anyone experience not being able to do anymore? - Early 20s.

I had to endure not having any real friends, that I would hang out with in college, though I probably had a lot of acquaintances. I definitely thought it was a problem then thinking 'I don't think it's healthy to not have anyone...' I still am not sure if it was a preference or something out of balance in my life. Even after self-imposed therapy and getting to know people, now that I'm older and have tried harder, I find myself reverting to the solitude where I feel alive.

After putting myself out there again, and connecting with another person, I found myself contacting him. It was forced. I hadn't done that for a year, at one point I would meet new people, but I would not contact them unless they did first from a mixture of my own hurt and anger from someone who used me when I put myself out there. Well we met and I thought maybe I would do the impossible and keep a friend. 

He wasn't the only one so I went out again and tried to find strength to try again. I stood there alone, I saw a person and made a comment which he responded but that was it. When you can't push yourself anymore. I knew tomorrow I'd wake up and face the day and forget it, but the limits were painfully there. Even if I forced myself it look like I was going to cry than meet someone. I'm still trying, but it once again feels like no one can really help me, almost like I don't have a problem. If you think having no support system/real friends doesn't constitute a problem. It felt like nobody could help me until I cared but I was trying to care and I couldn't."
lonely,I have lost hope,"I have lost hope - Hello. This acc is new but I made it as a way to find communities where I can find someone, anyone, to talk to. The past 3 years have been kind of hard because I haven't had a solid friendship (or friendship period) and my attempts have seem to fail. I believe its all on my behalf. You see, it takes me awhile to come out of my shell, but when I do I know I joke and talk alot. I think it may come off as ""attention seeker""- ish, but I just get really excitable talking about things I'm passionate about. I've tried making friends online, amongst the fanfiction/writing community and the art/fanart community, so I can see if I could find friends who share common interest. But I either get to shy to talk in a conversation or get steamrolled and can't recover. I've joined discords, but the thing about those is that everyone is already friends and seem to prefer the ones they know over randoms like me. I understand. I just wish I wasn't so awkward and didn't ruin the conversation.

An example of this is yesterday, I joined a new discord for a writer/artist bang for a ship from a show I watch. I come in and see the 5 mods talking in general and I say hello. One says ""welcome"" and I get so happy that I feel inclined to join the conversation. It immediately switches to more personal things like work and lunch. I add my input with an open ended question and the subject changes abruptly. I was immediately filled with shame and humiliation for even thinking to interrupt what was clearly friends talking to one another. I wait a day for others to join, but by then, more popular and well known fanfic writers are dropping in and people are going wild for them. And they have great, loveable personalities. My inadequacies has never been more apparent.

I have no one to talk to. I work from home and even in school, I was alone and people never really wanted to talk to me. Based on how things are going, I don't think there's really any hope for me. For anyone liking me. For me having any friends. And having no one to talk to besides my mum and my therapist. 

It really does hurt to know I'm not likeable, enough to make me cry even. But I think I'm done with trying. Feels like the more I chase it, the more easily it escapes my grasp. It wasn't meant to be. The sadness is crippling."
lonely,It's so loud yet so quiet,"It's so loud yet so quiet - I don't know if I have the plague or something, but how hard must it be to make friends or even just acquaintances? I spend my days around people, but the only time I talk is when I'm alone. It's probably not anyone else's fault because I have anxiety issues that make it hard for me to put myself out there, but even when I do and I try to engage my classmates in conversations, they seem uninterested it makes me wonder what the hell is wrong with me.

I don't really have places in uni where I can make spontaneous social encounters, so joining clubs or associations isn't really an option. But how do these people form groups and make friends so easily? It's only the beginning of the year and everyone seems so busy with their friends that it's hard to really befriend them, and the ones who are by themselves don't seem that interested in making friends."

People come and go and I understand these things happen. Most days I get on just fine, but every so often, I’ll see people just having fun and enjoying each other’s company and I’ll think how I wish I had someone I could relate to in that way. Someone I could care about and someone who would care about me."

Extroverted by nature and I lift daily. *muscles mwahahaha*

I **don't** play video games. They're a waste of time for me.

I read **a lot** of reddit and self improvement books. Robert Greene, and Mark Manson to name a couple. Currently studying to be more articulate and influential, with an interest in pursuing sales. I'm hitting it off well with people at my local gym. But don't have many opportunities to connect with people outside of that. (I even created my own meetup group). It's in the evenings when my mind is already fatigued that I start to feel the effects of loneliness.  So then I turn to netflix or something else to occupy my brain.   


Anyways this can be a challenge, but challenges are good. I know I'm not the only one on here who's willing to put in the effort to MAKE a difference. I've been lone wolfing the past 6 months or so, but life is better with bridges of friendship. Hey, I already feel better writing this. Lets help each other and unite on something reddit."
lonely,Why can’t I make friends,"Why can’t I make friends - I have no close friends, not exaggerating. In high school I had 3 close friends, ended up dating one, then lost him when we broke up. The other 2 went to college far away and made new friends, while I went to a local university and lived off campus. In college I was involved in 3 clubs, a sport, and a sorority (for a semester), but made 0 friends. A lot of people were nice to me and would text me about school, but I never got invited to anything. I tried to initiate friendships and text people to check in, but they just died off because they were busy and had other friends groups already. After college I started working and found out my coworkers were friends and were planning a party and they forgot about me… I’ve worked there for almost 3 years and I always do anything to help them. I’m involved in volunteering and a small group for church, but still no friends. 

I’m obviously just sad, lonely, and feel like this has to be my fault. I live with my boyfriend of 3 years and it’s just embarrassing to sit at home all weekend while he’s with his friends. How do I make friends??? I’m so depressed and alone. I feel like everyone has their friends already and they don’t care to involve me. It doesn’t help that I’ve gained 40 lbs from depression and now I just look like an ugly friendless loser. If you can relate, I’m so sorry. This is just pain. Any advice is welcome!"

I (30M) live alone and only have one friend to talk to, and he lives hours from me. I wish I had more people to communicate with on a regular basis. When I was 17 I was in a relationship for one year, then went into a relationship for 9 years, then had a thing with my first ex up until July. This is the first time in 13 years that I'm completely alone and I hate it."

Read on, readers. 👇 - Recently lost a friend I deeply care about so now I'm down to very few people to talk to, going through some stuff but totally don't need to discuss that but I'd love to hear you vent If you feel the need to. 

What I bring to the table as a potential friend:

Great listener, If there were a leaderboard for listeners I would definitely be ranked up there. 

When I'm miserable (spoiler alert: often) I've found a new positive way to deal with is it is make people laugh, I also like going to subs where people upload selfies and ask for compliments and gas them up by pointing out attributes about them that they may not be aware of.

I don't hit on friends, I highly prefer a female friend because I was raised by and around females and there's also a history there that makes it hard for me to open up to dudes, having mostly female friends since I was a child I have a predisposition for recognizing that it's not appropriate to put friends in an awkward position by being inappropriate.

I'm interested in learning about hobbies that I don't have, it doesn't matter if we don't have much in common because I love hearing about topics that I don't know much about by people who submerge themselves in it, I'll totally make you feel like a rockstar for your interest.

Aside from that my hobbies include walking (mostly to the park) songwriting, playing acoustic guitar, photography, and watching YouTube. I've also made it my mission to win over the affection if my neighbors cat, which has proven to be a task.

Anything else about me you're wondering you can probably learn from my profile, and if you don't see it there then it's probably something that I don't think matters.

I'm LGBT friendly and nontoxic.

Some of the topics I'm prepared to blow your mind with are the following:

Ants: Their super secret plans for world domination.
Snails: How they are classist and selfish creatures.
Robots: How you may be one without knowing (I can administer a questtionaire to help you find out)

I hope to hear from you, just hit that chat button, and if I don't I wish you luck on your journey finding a friend."

A year ago yesterday I gave birth to twin sons, they both died only hours after being born. Not one of my friends or family members (other than my husband and mom) reached out. And then this morning my mom showed me all the messages her friends sent her yesterday. Meanwhile I’m forgotten completely. It would be nice to have those kind words sent my way sometimes. 

I’m grateful for what I do have. But my heart hurts. It’s so lonely being a grieving mother. People don’t want to reach out or talk to me about it (or anything for that matter). It makes them uncomfortable. So I’m left alone. And maybe I should reach out to someone but I don’t want to be that burden. I don’t want to bring people down. So instead I post on Reddit I guess. At least it feels good to vent to random internet strangers."

I started doing things for myself to feel better like cleaning my room everyday, taking care of myself, changed my whole wardrobe to something more of my age(24). All for what?  It's been over a year since I left the house with someone other than my mom. 

I'm tired of feeling so alone in the word. I don't feel like a 24 year old at all. I'm tired of being single my entire life. Depriveed from physical touch completely and having no friends just tops it all off. To make things even worse I live in fucking Virginia."

So the thing is, im dependant in affection, and it wouldn't be a problem if i was a part of any community, of if there were people like me.
But i feel like there's not.
See, i'm biracial which means i dont belong to any community.
I'm bisexual, but i feel uncomfortable around other lgbtq's
I love old movies, classical music 
I feel like i dont belong to anything
Not something very common for a sixteen year old, especially where i live.
I dont know what i'm looking for, maybe just validation.
Thank you."
lonely,If I don’t reach out no one speaks to me.,"If I don’t reach out no one speaks to me. - the whole thing has been going on for years, whether at work or at school. That makes me sad every time, because it just works so well for the others. No matter what I do, I sneeze, nobody says bless you. I stand next to a colleague, classmate, nobody asks what I need. I have to start talking every time, and when I do, few care. I fcking hate being myself.

lonely,Pathetic,"Pathetic - It was recommended to me that I do group therapy. I would have been doing it 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. But I needed to take off work to do that. I talked to hr today. I figured I wouldn't be able to, but I tried to see if I was eligible for medical leave anyway. They said I needed to work there for a year to qualify for leave. I've only been there for about 6 months. It's the outcome I expected. But I didn't realize until I was for sure not going to be able to do it, just how much I was looking forward to just talking to people. I broke down and cried in the bathroom at work. Im pathetic. I hate how alone I am. I'm tired of it but Im no good with people. I don't have any friends and I don't see that changing any time soon."
lonely,I'm tired of being the one initiating all the contact,"I'm tired of being the one initiating all the contact - So I never got invited to things as a teenager. Always made me feel heartbroken.. 

Then, as I got a bit older, I said ""screw it, I'll invite people! I'll make my own happiness"". And you know what, they often said yes! Man was I over the moon. I didn't have to be lonely anymore.

Well it's been a little under 2 years now, and I've realised I still never get invited to anything. If I don't initiate anything, nothing happens.

It's made me realise it's not just social interaction I crave, it's being wanted. Knowing that people care enough about you, that they wish you a happy birthday, invite you to do nice things, to have fun... To know that they don't just stand having you around, but that they actually want you with them.

So I've gone back to not inviting them. Honestly it's better to not have any social interactions, than to almost have to beg people for it. I still have a little pride left that I'd like to keep.

Fuck em. They're the ones missing out"

I work and I go college yes I see people but I wouldn't call them close friends so I guess I'm not completely alone I may speak to 2 people on text but despite all that yes I had many friends in the past and in the end it lead to toxicity alot of talking behind people's backs and just not fun experience constantly worrying if I'm saying the right thing incase and worrying that I'm going to lose my friends because they were my source of happiness now I have things to occupy myself when in irl and when I'm off from college and work do it is possible and it's not a burden just the spirit is talking to me giving me good signs for the future. Wish you all amazing futures.

I can't seem to find a way to write this.

My best attention:

Everything seems to be going downhill for me, i have friends and yet I still don't feel great, I had a girlfriend and I still didn't feel great at that time, just a few short weeks of ""happiness"" almost kinda like a drug that you get used to easily 

I like being lonely and at the same time I hate it.
It feels like there is a chemical in my brain that requires people but so far I've found no one willing to fulfill that part of me.

They've tried and I felt that I self sabotaged it.

There might as well be 2 ""I"" within me.

I've given up on relationships cause honestly that's not what I want nor need.

In the end of it I guess I don't know what I want."

lonely,Men should share their gfs,"Men should share their gfs - I think it would make it a lot easier for guys to find someone if there was a system set in place for a lonely guy to work out a deal where they can spend time with a woman who's already in a relationship. It's not fair when you're attracted to a woman who's in a relationship and you get that feeling of her being ""off limits"" why should it have to be like that ? Just because those two happened to meet one day and now they are just off the market for 10+ years. Our society is so dead set on monogamy and I feel like it's actually hurting the dating market. People like to pretend that ""there's someone for everyone"" and that there are just single/available people everywhere but it's just not true and if they are single either they are extremely picky or they are choosing to be single so they are not actively looking for someone. Being attached to one person has become the norm so much that women will just say ""oh I have a bf"" wether it's true or not, just because they think it means I'm not allowed to be attracted to someone else. I'm not saying they have to be interested but rather than saying they are not interested they just say they have a bf as if that's going to make a guy any less attracted to them. Look it it were up to me I would like there to really be enough single and looking people available for everyone but it's just not reality, go to a restaurant, movie theater hell anywhere and look how the entire society is designed for couples, friends, families etc. Society is not designed for single free spirited individuals to meet up. Everything is about being associated with particular people and from my perspective it's like an exclusive club that you're not invited to. A single lonely guy is just treated like an outsider and you're left looking like the odd man out."

Holding ourselves to stay sane... Healthy... And happy.. I like autumn, you can wear your warm and soft sweaters, you can hide yourself behind scarfs.. It's hard to feel full in this big world.. It's even harder to find things that makes us happy.. For some that could be that girl with short skirts and goosebumps on her naked legs.. For some that could be that fancy man, who walks by you with black coat wearing his best perfume. In both situations you turn your head back, when they pass you... But have you ever enjoyed how wind is shaking off those colorful leaves? Have you ever seen little leaf tornado in front of you?
Have you ever felt difference between summer and autumn air?
Why we feel more depressed in autumn, maybe it's because it's getting colder outside, winter is coming. And we, as a human beings with feelings want someone near us.  We want those warm touches on our cold skin.. We want some hot summer memories to share with.. We want someone to kiss and snuggle next to fireplace.
Wind... It's windy outside.  And my sanity is barely hanging just like those few leaves that are left on those branches..."

lonely,No one to talk to.,"No one to talk to. - So today I got a job, I got so excited and wanted to tell my ex (we broke up 3 months ago) then I remembered we don’t talk anymore. I wanted to tell someone else but I have no friends. I’m so alone, every day is practically the same. I hope this job changes my life in some way. 

I just really wish I had someone to talk to, someone who understands me, someone I’ve known for awhile. But when I got into my last relationship, I pushed everyone away. I just wish I could go back and change it all but I can’t. I miss her so much and she is always on my mind, everything reminds me of her.

Sometimes I get dressed up to go out, I go out and walk around by myself, listening to music or taking photos, I wish I had someone to share my ideas and thoughts with. I cry all the time knowing that I’m all alone. It was my 17th birthday the other day, no one I used to know said happy birthday to me, I waited all day to get a message from my ex saying happy birthday, she always said it to me. We knew eachother for 5 years, I never thought she would leave me.

How do I get rid of this feeling? I genuinely think I’ve thought about her every day since we broke up. Everything reminds me of her, I make so much shit up in my head, I hate it. I hated it so much to the point where I considered taking my own life, I was at my lowest and no one asked if I was okay or checked on me. Do I just not exist to them? 

I feel sick to my stomach making things up about what her and her new boyfriend do together, it’s gotten so bad to the point where I can’t even watch porn without thinking about them. She pushed it in my face that she had sex with him before we stopped talking (we stopped talking like 2-3 weeks after the breakup). Now I can’t stop thinking about it, I try to convince myself she was just lying, but I feel like I need to get back at her wether that’s by hurting him or destroying stuff he owns. I won’t do any of that but I just think about it to make me feel better.

Little rant over.

TL;DR - I feel lonely and I’m extremely hung up on my ex."

-Would like to have game night/movie night. Maybe play some tabletop dnd or rp on a game. I’ve never played tabletop dnd so it would’ve been fun learning with others.

-Go to anime conventions. Friends I had in the past liked anime. Would've been nice to cosplay, walk around booths and take pictures. 

-Kpop random dance events. I usually feel awkward going to one by myself even though it's fun. 

-Have an inclusive guild in a game that do activities together. It's difficult to find those kinds of guilds without being subjected to cliques, isolation, and sexism (because “gIRL gamers” like me don't exist). Just logging in and talking to others, getting close would be enough for.

Then after being with these friends for years we can look back on all the fun things we did together. But I know that’s unrealistic. I'm getting older and seeing how I can't get integrated into communities let alone make friends throughout the year's show. I've tried making my own but they died out. I can do the things above by myself but again if I had friends those are the things I wanna do with them.

Do not give me advise or hope/luck I can change this. I'm just sharing my thoughts."

lonely,I didn't think posting on this subreddit was gonna turn into a daily thing for me but here we are again,"I didn't think posting on this subreddit was gonna turn into a daily thing for me but here we are again - So my Grandmom fractured her hip a day ago and we got the xrays today. My mom is really the only one who completely supports her and taking my grandmom to the hospital is going to be a massive challenge and pain for her (physically and mentally). She told me to go the hospital for a second opinion (I'm a med student) but I already know that my grandmothers' gonna need surgery but what's the harm in asking, maybe I'll chance upon a miracle where treatment is possible at home. 

Anyways, I told my friends about it and they deadass laughed in my face about it and told me what I already know ( like bitch I know she needs surgery, chill with the fucking doctor ego) and it literally took me almost crying in front of them and practically spelling it out to them that right now trying to take my grandmother to the hospital is gonna be mentally taxing for my mom (they know that my mom's the only one looking after her) and me (since feel super guilty I cant help her) and that I'd probably miss a ton of college to help out post surgery. After that, they shut up, one of them tried to apologise for laughing which I just tried to play off ( I'm not in the mood for confrontations and fights rn) and the other I haven't seen since (it's been a couple of hours since this happened).

Wtf is wrong with these people. Could they seriously not read in between the lines ? Do they think I'm really that stupid that I cant read a fucking xray and know what's up?

Nobody will even check up on me, why would they. I'm the emotional trash bin for others and that's completely fine. I like to listen to others about what they are struggling with and maybe even help them 

I really want to help but at the same time I crave for some comfort myself and nobody could give me something like that. Why? Because even if I like anyone in any way and let them know anything all I do later is pushing them away so why would I even let anyone get this far.

lonely,My friends? don't ask me to hang out with them anymore,"My friends? don't ask me to hang out with them anymore - I'll admit that over the years I've grown apart from my friends for several reasons...

I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since high school and at the time they didnt really provide the support I needed. I didn't feel like they cared all that much either when I'd muster up the courage to talk to them about my true feelings so i started to keep things from them. Gradually, I let myself grow apart from them because I didn't feel cared for and we all got busy with more important priorities like college and work.

But last summer, we all started hanging out again. I tried to tell them about my new job and how the adjustment has been hard, but again I felt like they didnt really care so I stopped. Then, they'd still invite me out from time to time and every single time I'd accept the invitation I didn't feel like myself. I felt the need to put on a mask everytime I was with them and I hated it so I went back to keeping contact with them to a minimum.

Now, I see them hanging out with each other on social media and it just makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I keep wondering whether they hate me for not communicating with them enough or for not being more positive and joyful. 

I don't know what to do, I've already started therapy 2 months to deal with other problems, but I jusr feel so lonely and they are/were my only friends.

Am I in the wrong for keeping communication with them to a minimum? Are they people that just don't have what I need in a friend anymore? Do I just cut them off completely? Do I have to explain myself if I cut them off? Am I just sabotaging myself?"

There were times when i thought about suicide but i know how upset my mom especially because she is so sensitive. So, my life is a vicious circle and i can't jump on it. I can ruining myself constantly, feel weak, sad, unhappy."

I love people and I love talking to them but I can never do anything right, I always seem to run people away from me because I'm so awkward and too open. I don't know how to change to get people to like me because I don't even realize how much I say or what I say until afterwards. I don't know what's so wrong with me but sometimes I think it's just better off for me to not even bother with anyone anymore."
lonely,"I’m married but still feel very lonely in the day, I lack purpose and routine.","I’m married but still feel very lonely in the day, I lack purpose and routine. - 
I just graduated from uni last may I’m (26f) and I feel incredibly lonely in my house in the day. I work full time as an illustrator/animator but Im finding it difficult. My world revolves around my husband arriving home, I know how most dogs feel now when you leave them for work. I do go on walks during lunch time as we live in the country side but it’s not helping much. I’m getting very depressed.

No one ever visits we are always visiting others, I had a best friend but she’s got a bf and now hardly has time for me, she’s texts me maybe once a week.

I don’t how to address this, my husband is a very quiet person and has never been into socialising and cant really understand  my feelings. I wanted to go to a cinema event at our village hall yesterday but he was too tired after work so we didn’t go and I felt a bit sad going on my own so I just left it.

I thought about taking my life a few times. I know I’m getting worse, but I feel stupid sometimes because there are people out there with much worse problems. I don’t feel able to ask for help.

I saw a good friend yesterday at least but seeing her with her children, husband and mum all at her house made me sad to go home. I see her once a month ish and I know some people on this group go much longer so sorry for complaining but it’s eating away at my soul."

lonely,Alienated,"Alienated - Fuck. Just realized I'm Jerry from rick and morty. Not how I planned on opening this post I didn't plan on posting. I know this is useless. If nobody cared about my problems in my real life why would anyone here. My wife and kids don't like having me around. Everyone purposely interrupts me when I speak, changes the subject. 6 years in this marriage and I have always felt alone. I can't connect with anyone. Especially my own family.  I have always just wanted better for them. But I'm evil for not stocking the cabinets with fucking oreos and soda and letting them have free reign on the internet 24/7. The whole fucking family is so dysfunctional and my efforts over time to improve things have only alienated myself. My wife was living with her 3 yr old son from a previous relationship in her parents apartment with the worst bed bug infestation I could imagine (only one I've seen). Her son was always covered in bites, everywhere he went bug's would crawl out of his shoes or clothes. After we courted I got a house and moved them in and changed so much.  But at some point along the way I started developing some self awareness and realized the insane lack of structure we had, and how hopelessly unprepared we were to raise children. I have spent the last few years reading and learning from self help books and spiritual texts. I've learned so much about responsibility and integrity and rightful action and humility and the importance of relationships. I feel like I finally have a hold on life in one way. I've become more responsible. But my wife on the other hand, wants nothing to do with any sort of improvement. Won't sit down and plan our bills with me. Won't talk about how we're raising our children. It's just so fucked up. I was under the impression that a woman might feel lucky to have a man who cares so much and takes action in the things he sees is wrong. I got my head put of my ass and put 100% focus into our life, and she starts going out drinking after work all the time instead. Some nights now the kids will cry asking when mommy will be home and I don't even fucking know the answer. Just remembered this is a waste of time"

I have severe abandonment issues and i just feel like basically everybody i ever meet is just going to leave me. I have been so fucking lonely for basically my entire life and it's got to the point where i just practically gave up on trying to find a bf but then i found one unexpectedly and he has severe depression and he goes through periods where he just ignores me bc of it. Not only that he works full time. I'm so confused bc every time he has talked to me it genuinely seemed like he liked me so much. He always comes back and apologizes when he ignores me but this time he blocked me so idek what's going on w him. I would literally do anything for him I love him so much and I don't want to let him go. It's all my fault bc i was spamming texts all the time. do u think its really over or is it his depression and i should just give him time bc my heart is literally fucking broken tbh im going crazy

My xbox live just ran out and I'm too broke to buy more, it was essentially my only social interaction and where most of my friends are. Feel so disconnected from everyone. Have a an ED, I cut myself and drink alone when I can't cope with my feelings. One of my few friends is being super flirty with me even though I'm gay? It's like my sexuality isn't valid to him. I care about my friends way more than they care about me. I have no aspirations or dreams, I really just want to die at this point. 

I know people probably have way worse problems than me, most of this shit is temporary. That being said, I feel like even more of a pussy because I can't handle this stuff right now. Fuckkkk life"

I saw that they were genuinely interested in seeing me and were saddened when we pulled a prank and made it seem like I wasn't there. My dad was genuinely confused when I told him that they showed interest in me and he said ""Why would anyone want you in their house? You're so filthy and crazy and have no desirable traits."" This makes me hurt so much. I've dealt with so much loneliness in life(never had a best friend, recently made one but now he's too busy all the time and only calls when he's available) Seeing these people actually want me in their presence brings me so much joy.

I'm starting to think that maybe I'm the problem and people just don't like me.. why is it so hard to connect.. or even just have one person to talk to consistently. I mean not everyday all day all the time, just enough times to not feel completely alone. like I have friends.

and yea, if you go through my profile, you'll see that I am sort of looking for love, but I also know nothing online is ever really real until it affects what happens in the real world, so I know that I may be over reaching, looking for love online, but atleast something platonic maybe? a really close friend? idk..

lonely,Today is my birthday and literally no one knows,"Today is my birthday and literally no one knows - Alright so I just turned 26. I don't care or didn't think I care about people wishing me a happy birthday but I just keep thinking how everyone is supposed to have at least some people like a significant other or close friends that know when your birthday is. It's kind of sad when the only birthday wishes you get are automated emails from companies whose services you use. 

I was talking with this girl a few days ago and we were on the topic of birthdays and she told me she doesn't really care either but she does enjoy the gifts and that's when it hit me, I didn't actually get a birthday gift for the past 5 years ish. I didn't tell her that of course because it sounds embarassing and attention seeking but somehow it makes me feel very alone. 

What makes it weird is that I don't even particularly like the custom of being wished a happy birthday, seems like a pointless empty gesture if someone you only talk to a couple times a year wishes you happy birthday and then you're supposed to be something like ""thank youu🙏🥺😗"". Yet I have this cognitive dissonance sort of thing where I actually wish people would do it. 

Also what I guess adds to how I'm feeling is that I lost my parents when I was a teenager. Who else is supposed to remember your birthday and give you gifts if not your mom and dad? I can't help but think of them. 

I wish I had someone special and I wish I had people closer to me that cared enough about me to know when I was born and be glad that I exist for one more year around them. Thanks for hearing me vent."

I've been doing all the things they said to do to make new friends-- joining clubs, going our to town where the parties are, exchanging numbers and socials I never have the guts to actually reach out to.

I've befriended my one roommate. Mainly cos she stuck to me like a lost puppy and claimed me as her ""emotional support human"" (her words).

So that's nice. Bit it's not like I can vent to someone with worse social anxiety and depression than even me..

And I've been sleeping more and more each day. Getting behind in my easy as heck classes. 

And all because I just cannot muster up the will to step outside of my crappy dorm.

There's this thing called ""imposter syndrome."" I definitely might have that. 

And midterms are here and I feel like it's too late to catch up. I'm drowning. 

And it's pathetic. And I just want to sleep.

But college is expensive and I'm poor and I have no family support or anything. 

So I'm basically screwed, and I'm just wishing I had someone to talk to."

I wanna learn how to play her favourite songs on guitar and I want to listen to her heartbeat and not be reminded of how my heart can be scary to listen to.

I've dated men in the past who just used me for sex, and I figured it was fine because I'm a sick girl who has barely any use in life. But I have this ache in my chest that I want a long-term, loving girlfriend. But even if I was pretty enough to have one, I wouldn't want to make her worry about my health.

I go out and get tea alone everyday at my local coffee shop and I just like to picture how life could be different if I had a better face, a better heart. I'm sure I'd still be going and getting tea everyday, but I don't think I'd always be getting it alone."

I’m the one texting and putting in some type of effort. It gets to a point where you question your worth. It’s so disheartening to think that “love” and relationships will continue to be this way, and that maybe guys don’t see that I deserve genuine love and care. My only friend only hangs out with me when she needs something or else she doesn’t have time for me. I’ve never had a true friend and I want to have a group of girl friends so bad. I think I’ve just gotten to the point of assuming how a friendship will turn out that I end up pushing myself away. I get so sad about being lonely. I want to learn to be okay with it but it’s hard.

i don't conventionally find myself attractive, and i'm not a very outgoing person, but close people around me always say i've really funny and have a good personality. I wish I just knew what people didn't find attractive about me. if i had to guess i'd say it's my looks or low self confidence.

If you have a friend who's always third-wheeling, what would you want them to hear? does anyone have some real world advice on how to feel less lonely?

This also might be related, but one of my friends is talking to this guy I use to have a thing for. a crush. A couple months ago I started to feel this same way (but never talked about it because I suspected my friend had a thing for him), but that fizzled in a out up until now. I know it would never work and I want the best for both of them, and most of me is over him, but I don't know if I'll ever be over him (considering I had a thing for him 2 years ago or so, and we talked a lot then, and ever since then I've gone through phases of liking him and then not liking him).

I watched as they got on the bus, it was cold and rainy outside. They walked to the back and sat a few seats away from me. I’m not sure what it was, but I couldn’t keep my eyes of them. They were beautiful. 

It felt as if something had changed as I sat in their presence. Like a sense of comfort, something I can’t describe. It felt like everything was going to be okay. I felt safe and welcomed, like I could be who I was in that instance without being judged. 

I’m still not entirely sure how someone who didn’t even speak to me or let alone look at me, could make me feel so different. I wanted to reach out and ask them for their number or something but I was afraid. I felt intimidated by the fact they had made me feel so much just by existing. Regrettably, I got off the bus without saying a word. 

I walked home in the rain, thinking about them the entire time. Tonight was the first time I’ve felt anything in months."

I go on drives to the town over alone just to get food and get out. Weekend ends, back on the weekday grind. Repeat, repeat, repeat"

lonely,23 M [Friendship] New York I’m reaching out to you right now.. for a genuine connection and friendship,"23 M [Friendship] New York I’m reaching out to you right now.. for a genuine connection and friendship - To be clear from the start, this may be dumb and most likely won’t find what I am looking for but what’s the worse that can happen? I’ll try to make this as short and straight to the point as I can. I’ve been with my “girlfriend” for about 5 years now and the past 2-3 of them I’ve been miserable. By miserable, I mean there is a stop sign in every direction I turn. She’s completely erased all of the friends I had because of her jealousy and every time I try to leave her, she draws me back in with her threats and manipulation. It’s a nightmare I feel like I’ll never awake from and almost as if I’m lost with no way out. I also blame myself at times because I let her do it.. let her walk all over me and take advantage over the years. My entire family can see right through her and they know what kind of person she is. I’m an amazing person and what I mean by that is I’d die for the people I care about. Seeking a true friendship, I would like to find someone who can help me out and pull me out of this. Not only advice but someone who is patient and will stick by my side through the good and bad. I guess you could say I’m sending an application over reddit for friends which may sound desperate but because of her, I feel like I can’t make friends around my area. There’s a whole world out there and with slightest bit of hope maybe someone will come in at the right time. Take my hand, be that person and I’ll show you what I can do. I pray that someone/something picks me up.. let’s create this new beginning for you and I. Preferably looking for people around NY."

We were talking about our academics and some gaming too, it was really fun and I wish I got his number or some kind of social media because I really felt a connection. It was the first time in a long time that I felt a great connection with a guy. Also, I wasnt the one buying the couch, so I dont think he was trying to ""secure his sale"" with me."

lonely,No Point,"No Point - I don’t expect anyone to see this, because nobody ever sees my posts, but sometimes it just feels good to get it out there. 

I don’t feel like there’s really a point to my existence. I don’t have anyone close to me except for a couple of online friends I’ve never met irl, some family members, and my partner. My partner finds it easy to reach out to and connect with other people. Most other people I’ve met do too. But I feel like when I try to connect with other people I often get ignored, or quick polite conversation-ending responses. I feel like I am always the one to initiate anything, even with old irl friends, and I’m just sick of trying. In irl conversations I’m too quiet and get spoken over and generally overlooked constantly, even when I try to speak up. I am told all the time that my presence online seems confident, sexy, and successful, yet I have nothing that proves any of that to be true. I feel like something is genuinely wrong with me. Maybe I’m on the spectrum and don’t quite realize it or maybe my social anxiety is too bad or maybe I haven’t met the right people yet, but I can’t seem to be able to form a connection deeper than polite friendliness with anyone I meet. I’ve tried bumble bff and different groups, and though I’ve met a couple of nice people and hung out a few times, I either get more surface-level type interactions or I get bored because nothing ever goes anywhere. I am terrified of dying alone, but I’m starting to have a massive aversion to people in general and am more and more inclined to stop even trying. I never thought I would be this lonely. 

I hope you’re all having a good night."

I have a boat load of dad jokes that would probably sink the ship (yes I know I'm lame)

If not I hope you are doing well and hope you have a wonderful week. I do have social anxiety so along with the weird comes social awkwardness so... well take it as you will I suppose.

But when I am at home , my household is so chaotic , my parents argue , and I agree with my brother all of the time. Both my dad and my brother are lazy and sit down and don’t do anything at all. They only like wasting money whilst my mom and I try and make the most of it. I love my mom but she can be difficult sometimes and can really hurt me with the words that she says. I only feel like they’d want me for me to clean and tidy after them but other than that I am irrelevant. I keep on scrolling on tiktok because that’s when my head is off from thinking but I feel horrible when I am not productive. I like listening to music when I do chores because then I don’t have to overthink everything I’ve ever done. But apparently there is something wrong with that. The only thing I love doing is sleeping or reading a book or watching a show because all of those take me away from my miserable reality and make me feel something other than the shitty person I am.

I just hate myself and I am scared I’ll end up turning to bad things to get my head off of the thinking.

I've been embarrased to see everyday couples everywhere that i started to avoid them and just keep my distance at  away from them

My mom told me everytime: ""just wait a little longer and the more you seek your love, the more you will find it""

Yeah mom i've been doing this for 4 years by now, im 21 years old and i feel like every touch i would get from a girl no matter if it is a friend or stranger is just, a sign of love for me...

lonely,I dont know what to do,I dont know what to do - I used to have a few close friends and now i have none i feel like everyone hates me and i feel empty
lonely,I’m not one to vent.,"I’m not one to vent. - But I think I need an outside perspective.  I’m starting to think that I may be genuinely unloveable. I don’t know what it is about me that makes every single person I grow close to stop tolerating me within two weeks. I’m 19 and I have never had any romantic involvement that hasn’t ended in me getting ghosted. I’ve had hook ups, casual flings, and almost relationships. But every time I get romantically involved, things start out so well and as soon as I start to trust that maybe things will go well, they ghost me. Every. Single. Time.  

I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong. I’m not mean, or awkward, or too forward or too distant. I’m no goddess but I’m decently attractive and I take care of myself. I try so hard to be nothing but kind and supportive and I’m taken for granted then dropped within two weeks.  

And it’s not like I don’t put in the effort. I try to hang out often, talk at least once a day, ask how they’re doing and actually listen. It works out so well for a short while. They want to meet up at least twice a week, they always text first and they’re so sweet and caring. Then after about a week, it tapers off and I’m left feeling like I’m putting in all the effort and receiving nothing in return. Suddenly they’re always too busy, too tired, just want to be alone. And I respect it! I’m never one to demand attention. Everyone has bad days where they just want to decompress. I’m constantly nice and supportive and offering help if they need it. They just brush me off. 

They make plans just to cancel them, or they follow through with plans and I’ll get my hopes up that maybe they actually do care, then they’ll just want to sex and ask me to leave right afterwards.  I have literally never been anything more than a sex toy. Which I wouldn’t mind if they also liked me in other aspects but nobody does. 

I’m just so sick of vying for a crumb of attention from people who promised they wouldn’t withhold it from me. I’m trying so hard to be a good person and a good partner but I’m starting to think that there’s just something wrong with me. I think I’m actually unloveable and I should just accept it and give up."

lonely,Trying to fight depression after moving to a new state alone.,"Trying to fight depression after moving to a new state alone. - During all this covid and trying to social distance I'm noticing how hard it's been to fight off depressing thoughts. 

Has anyone figured out how to connect and build friendships in a new place? online or offline. 

I've done little research for some discord channels. maybe hoping I can find other artists to just hang and chill on zoom or discord. or even someone to just say 'hey' every now and then. 

Or a good gaming discord? I'm not sure where to look for that. Im not a great gamer but I enjoy playing with others on switch or PC. 

I do battle depression for years but this time it just feels so isolating. Reasonably I think I should just figure it out on my own but I do like talking to people and hear ideas or views that I never would on my own. 

If anyone has suggestions please let me know :) maybe this is just talking into the void (and making this post is kind of therapeutic too).

Thank you! &lt;3"

My wife is pretty much my only friend unless you count that one old coworker who decided to befriend the 20yr old. Honestly I'm just looking for friends near the midwest that I could possibly meet up wit irl and bs and do guy stuff.

I love all types of games, TV shows, books, music, not a big sports fan but shit I'll give it a try, drinking socially, working on things, spending time doing outdoor activities"

lonely,Lonely people looking for a snuggle!,"Lonely people looking for a snuggle! - I stumbled upon this place by accident. After browsing for a long time, I didn't know where to start, but I decided to record it. 

 In my life, I didn't have a good start. A long time ago, my ex-husband embezzled my money and company money without my knowledge and used it to gamble. All lost. He owes a lot of money. When I finally divorced, my debt was 50/50. 

 I am in the darkest period. With the help of my friends, I started a new job, paid off my debts, and gradually accumulated funds. I have reached this point. 

 But my recent performance is very poor. I spend every day in nostalgia, sadness and loneliness. It has been more than five years since my marriage ended. My failed marriage is a small story, but it has brought me great pain and unimaginable process. 

 A sudden epidemic has made everyone's life difficult. It is difficult to meet a suitable person in life, but fortunately, I still hope to meet some mature and stable men, preferably from Canada and the United States. When the epidemic is over, plan to do meaningful things together! 

 Over time, we will make new friends, but I believe that few people are fortunate enough to meet some kind, positive and sincere people. So I will look for it slowly. Maybe it's not just about being friends, we all need to wait and see."
lonely,"Going out alone (M, 25)","Going out alone (M, 25) - I don't mind being alone at home, spending time with myself, I am used to that. But I'm 25. I shouldn't be living like a 80 year old Zen in my 20s. I wanna enjoy night life, wanna get to know people, I just want some LIFE before I hit the 30s and can't do a lot of stuff that I still can do know.

I moved to a new city recently, but the loneliness followed me it seems. It's been tough to meet new people here, and YES, before someone says it: I joined clubs, I came in with a fresh new mindset, tried to connect with colleagues at work, but somehow no ""real"" connection with someone has been found so far.

I also tried online dating apps, and yes, I could find some folks there, but the connections there were a bit casual/superficial, it was hard to find someone to go out with.

Anyone else going out alone and wanna share some thoughts? I feel uncomfortable doing it. I feel like many look at me and think "" is he really there just dancing by himself"". I usually don't care what others think, but in such a public space, I just feel so lost at times. But what am I supposed to do? I won't stay at home all alone. I see girls checking me out as well, but being alone there I never grow the balls to go up to them. There is no one there to push me or give me some advice, or help me. It's just me."

Solution - 
Borrow money from different people and don't pay them back. Trust they will call you text you daily for their money. You just need to spend time with them. You won't feel lonely anymore those people will surround you all the time.

Once you pay back their money they will ghost you and you will be lonely again. If you got into any kind of physical violence or cops arrest you I'm not responsible. Try this on your own risk but it will work 101% guarantee.

Conclusion - 
This trick works 101% guarantee. Thanks me later and please no clapping no autograph no photograph please. Peace ✌️😜"
lonely,I've given up on life and trying to fit in.,I've given up on life and trying to fit in. - Last year I started my first year of college but I wasn't able to meet anyone due to college being online. This year college is back on campus and I've realised I don't fit in with anybody on my course. The college isn't running societies at the moment and none of the sport clubs have responded to me. It feels like I'm doing college all wrong. I'm sick of college and sick of life at this point. Haven't felt this low in months and thought once covid would be over things would be better. That isn't the case and it's gotten worse. Don't think I was meant to be here at all and would rather just not be alive. Feel like it's too late to change my circumstances. Every person I've interacted with thinks I'm weird so I guess there's nothing else I can do.

lonely,got broken up with by my first boyfriend this tuesday,"got broken up with by my first boyfriend this tuesday - i've had a horrible week.  my relationship was going so great.  i've never been romantically close to anybody, and he made me feel so special.  i thought he was funny, he was so smart, he was hot, cute, all the good stuff.  the worst part is i even admired him.  i fell for him so hard, he was the first person i ever got so vulnerable around.  i loved being with him.  

he was the first person to hold me as i fell asleep, play with my hair, kiss me passionately, go out of his way to talk to me, spend the night at my apartment, and make me feel like i mattered to someone.  

we spent the weekend together.  over the course of the weekend i had 2 family hopsitalizations, my grandpa and dad, i lost a study abroad opportunity, and throughout everything he was so sweet and supportive.  he held me tighter than normal, he stayed with me much more, we had an amazing time together.

i ate lunch with him on the day he broke up with me, and he was sweeter than ever.  he was holding me, laying out in the grass with me, and being as amazing as ever.  i was literally thinking about how lucky i was to be with him all day.

then, he spontaneously came over to my apartment, crawled into my bed, and broke up with me.  he told me he wasn't ready to be monogamous with me, and asked me if i wanted to be friends with benefits.  he came, broke up with me, and left within 15 minutes.  

i saw he was on dating apps later that night.

i've never felt so hurt, humiliated, and lonely.  he was my best friend and only friend at my university.  he was the thing i looked forward to every day.  now, he's gone.  my baby is gone.  he just wanted to be with other guys.

my first relationship was so short, and i couldn't even do anything to prevent it from ending.  he lured me in, and right when i got comfortable and started to really get feelings for him, he destroyed me.

the way he broke up with me and the timing hurt me so much.  but i still miss him.  i even asked him if there was potential for us to get back together and he said no.  all this taught me, after looking for a relationship for so long, is that i am going to be alone forever, than i am unloveable, and that nobody is ever going to care about me.  i can't let myself care about other people because look at what they do to me.  i got chewed up and spit out by the first person i really really liked.  i want to cry because i know i'll always be alone"
lonely,I feel stupid when I try to be positive,"I feel stupid when I try to be positive - It's been years since my last relationship, and every other past it taught me how stupid I am whenever I'm positive over something.

• I'm a good worker! No, my boss points me things I do wrong everytime he gets the chance to see me, while the rest of the staff laughs.

• I'm a good friend! No, I'm not funny, or even minimaly interesting, I'm just the guy that plays videogames and tries to help others online by giving infos and tips.

• I'm a good partner! No, most of the time I'm insecure and think ""I'll be easily switched to someone else"". But I smile, and pretend everything is fine, until they actually cheat me.

• I'm a good person! No, I'm a failure to my family, my friends and myself. Everytime I think they're lying to me, they're using me, and that I'm just convenient to them.

People say I need to be confident, that I have to see how beautiful, how smart and wonderful person I am, bu I'm a monster! How can I accept a lie?

The people I love, hates me when I open myself and say all this stuff I'm exposing here. They get angry, and keeps pointing bad things that I do. I could think of a million bad things they do too, but I can't say sh\*t, because I agree with them of how bad I am and should just shut up and lower my head.

How people can be so positive? I don't think I deserve to act like this, and I don't wan't to keep lying that everything is fine, only to not be left alone."

I would also ask you be somewhere around Nashville(thereabouts) or west to the TN River(even slightly into West TN) for the chance we would both want to meet for coffee or a drink in the future. No rush for that here btw.

I am an intelligent, decently attractive, athletic, attached male searching for ONE intelligent, attractive, female friend. Maybe you're in a similar situation and need a friend to chat with too. Maybe you've been treated badly or done wrong and need someone to confide in and brighten your day. Maybe you're single or married and just feel alone in this world. Maybe you're younger or older than me and would enjoy sharing your day with someone who actually gives a dang. Age is just a number anyway and I still feel young even during lonely days. I only wish I knew in my late teens/early 20s what I know now. You are eager for endless emails or conversing through PMs. I do not use the app but am more than willing to message here or email while we get to know each other better.

There is so much I want to say and could say but I will save it for your PM. I definitely would enjoy some conversation about almost anything. If you do decide to reply, please send something worthy of a response. 3 to 5 words or a sentence or 2 is not what I call good conversation. I will know if you're serious by the content in your reply. Heck, maybe you'll even share some minor details about yourself.

Have an amazing day and maybe we find each other."

I started getting feelings for her after the first week. She’s Poly and I’m ok with that. Her partner wanted to be monogamous so she went with it and told me we would never be anything but friends. I accepted it and told her I enjoy her company and will always be there for her no matter what. Last night her and her partner broke up and she needed someone so I stayed up most of the night with her. Just calming her down and being a good friend. Halfway thru the night she said she would like to create a relationship with me again. She talked how she would fly down and visit me for a week and even looked up tickets that night. I was even planning a nice date. When the morning arrived her partner wanted her back so she went. Just made me sink. I said I’m fine and I’ll still be there but I feel broken. I won’t give up finding someone. I know I will eventually. I just wanna be number one to someone one day.

lonely,I don't know why I had to be such an insufferable little shit as a kid,"I don't know why I had to be such an insufferable little shit as a kid - Ever since I was in elementary school my parents drilled into my head that my only goal should be to study, get good grades, and respect authority. I took it to heart and for years I did nothing but read and do homework in solitude. 

I was always alone but I never felt lonely because I felt that I was doing something important and that it made me better than everyone else.

Sure, I got into a great school and will likely have a high paying job once I graduate. But for the first time in my life I feel lonely. I can't help but wish I wasn't sitting by myself in the library/cafeteria/park for hours on end but could instead spend it with someone else like the many couples I see around campus. I tried to get a girlfriend but failed miserably because I have no idea on how to talk to girls.

I still believe working hard in school is in important but surely there was a better way to do things. Instead of taking an extra night to study for an exam I could have accepted those social invitations I once received and enjoyed my youth. But those years are gone now, I'll never be a teenager with all the freedom in the world again.

I'm trying to make things right in my last years of college by meeting new people and joining various student clubs, but maybe it's too late now."

sometimes i miss him so much...he made me feel like i was the most special person in the universe...he made me feel like i would find someone, and even if i didnt, everything was gonna be ok...sometimes i think i just wanted him to finally say he liked me, cause if he would've said so, i think i would've been the happiest guy on earth

(online school has made it impossible to make friends) i just genuinely thought they liked me and i felt like apart of the group and it’s heartbreaking to know they’ve had conversations agreeing they don’t want me around.

As a fellow loner who is going through this phase again in their life (feeling estranged, lonely and anxious about the future), I was wondering if anyone would want to exchange their experiences privately?

Like a lot of people here (I presume) I yearn for making connections with others, but somehow feel unable to, as it seems I project an image that pushes others away or it seem others are simply uninterested in me...

lonely,I can only blame myself,"I can only blame myself - I’m a   senior in high school with a great group of ≈ 5 friends I regularly talk to in and out of school. While I love them and cherish each one of our conversations, whenever I’m on my own I have horrible my lonley and scary thoughts. You see, before I found my group of friends in sophomore year, I went to school where no one from my middle school went there, so everyone knew each other and I knew no one. I’ve been in my head and lonley most of my life, even in middle school I would never talk to friends outside of school despite having a phone. The first time I ever had someone’s number in my phone was in freshmen year, and it was just for a class project. 

Recently I decided to go to one our soccer games, cause why not? It’ll be fun, right? Well… I planned on going with one of my friends, but they couldn’t attend, so i went there not knowing anyone really. 

It was one of the most eye opening, horrible experiences that was pretty much where these lonley thoughts stareted to get really loud.  I went there and started to get the feeling like I was not supposed to be there. I’ve never been to a game or have been in any extracurriculars. And the worst part is that it’s probably just in my head, because I’m reality the only reason anyone lookwd at me was because I started looking first. Now whenever I’m around other people I can’t help but feel like a ghost. At home I stay in bed trapped in my mind hating myself and wanting to cry, the only time it’s inturrupted is if i am talking with one of my friends or when I’m asleep. Whenever I get a sudden motivation to try and put myself out there a bit more, I begin to hate aspects about myself, I’ll say that I’m not funny or creepy or unpleasant to look at, which sucks because if you asked me a year before I would have said that I love myself, now I guess not.

I look at this sub and feel guilt cause im a teen who might be whining about nothing, so I’m sorry If it comes across like that. I just wanted to right this so I can better understand my feelings, which I believe I have achieved. So thanks for listening I guess"
lonely,I can’t make any friends,"I can’t make any friends -  in high school, birthday is in about two months and I’m scared of not doing anything at all for my birthday. For the past few years i have just celebrated alone without any friends other than my family I guess. I’m a senior in high school and haven’t gone to any of our dances. I have never gone to any football games. I’m just sitting in my room all day wishing I would be out somewhere having fun. I’m just too socially fucking awkward and can’t make any friends, the closest anyone will get to me is being “convenient acquaintances”. I just want a friend who I can talk to on the regular for the sake of just talking. Back during my freshmen year I found out there was a girl who liked me, but I didn’t know how to react to that and I didn’t even talk to her at all because I’m fucking stupid. I was probably just a hallway crush or something, because there’s no way in hell she liked me because of my personality, because I’m so fucking boring. she probably dislikes me now as I never even tried to talk to her which I deeply regret. I wish I could just turn back time and at least try to talk to her. It seems everyone around me has their own clique of friends that they have had over the past 4 years of high school, and I don’t fit anywhere. It just fucking sucks man I hate it. I just applied to colleges for next year and I’m absolutely terrified that nothing will change in next year, and that I will continue being a lonely, socially awkward person in college. Why is socializing so hard for me? aren’t humans supposed to be social creatures? I can’t even socialize properly without being viewed as a weirdo who probably doesn’t have any friends. Even on the internet where I used to have a “friend” group on discord that I used to hang out with practically every day, it felt like hanging out with them was forced, and I was there for the sake of just playing a game, not that I was actually interesting or anything. My mom passed away right before my birthday last year which made my feelings of loneliness amplified to the next level. It just feels so shitty that no one really cares about me. I guarantee that if I just happen disappear one day, people will just forget about me in less than a week, or perhaps won’t even notice that I’m gone. Not to mention, I’m an only child so I don’t have anyone in my family that’s close in age that I can relate to. I love my family, but we don’t really show affection for each other like hugging or giving gifts to each other. This just leaves me touch-starved. I want someone to hold hands with, or just hug. Every night, I pretend I’m holding someone using pillows, and it feels really nice until I realize that I’m not hugging anyone at all. I just want to feel what it’s like to have warmth of another human on my body. I generally like being optimistic about things in life, but recently, have I just realized how lonely I really I am."

lonely,Conflicted,"Conflicted - I don't know if it's advice I'm looking for or just venting. So I met someone online earlier this year.  I was suicidal at the time and he convinced me not to end my life. I grew fond of this person over time. He was there for me pretty much every day for months. I went through a divorce a couple months ago, which was the alternative to suicide so it had nothing to do with this person I was crushing on. I didn't even mean for that to happen. It just did. And he seemed kinda interested too at times. He's wishy washy about me. 

I needed some time to get away so I thought vacationing would be nice and refreshing. I decided to meet him in person bc at one point he was okay with meeting. Then suddenly he went off on me as I was planning my trip and cut me off, saying things like what we have is not true love. Kinda a lot was said but I had no real answers. He was vague. I went ahead and still booked my vacation bc he loves in a touristy city and I was kinda looking forward to the experience. I text him and told him that I was still vacationing there, told him when in case he changed his mind and wanted to meet. I'm not desperate. I was fine either way- meeting or not. I just really wanted to meet the person who helped me at my worst.

Anyway, after not talking for over a month he messages me and asks me if I'm still coming to his city, I said yes, he said he wouldn't ""ignore me"" so we ended up spending the week together, around his work schedule. We hung out all week, he was affectionate, thoughtful, funny, we laughed a lot, he held my hand and cuddled next to me in bed. And we hooked up all week.

When I was leaving he said things didn't need to be over between us but that he couldn't be what I need right now and said what we have is FWB. Which I've never done before. I identify as demisexual so I'm either strictly friend or altogether gf. It's hard for me to vibe sexually or enjoy sex with ppl unless there's an emotional connection. He knew that. 

Since I feel affection and like/love for this person, I want to stick around as a friend but yet again he stopped talking to me shortly after returning home. When I message him he's short with me and I'm still trying to be there for this person but he barely texts anymore and when I text him he ends conversation quickly. We knew we may not have the same feelings for one another when we met and we were okay with that. You don't know until you take the chance to find out. 

I'll always be there for him if he needs me and I told him that. I feel like a fool hanging around but when I care about a person I'm emotionally invested, whether it's friendship, my s/o, or family. He did message me a couple weeks ago and said he was going through some things, I reminded him that I'll be here for him but then he disappeared again. And maybe it wasn't an excuse and he does have his own personal things going on that he doesn't want or know how to talk about. Or maybe me giving up on him is what he wants because he did tell me in a text a couple weeks ago that he wouldn't hurt me intentionally. Since he doesn't want to hurt my feelings maybe he's just avoiding me, so I'll make the decision to go away lol. I'm a fucking idiot sometimes."

But even after how much I've improved, the one thing that has stuck with me is loneliness. It used to be that I would complain about it every chance I could get, hoping someone would give me pity. I've grown out of that now, and I haven't done an attention-seeking social media post in years. These days I just sit with the pain and hope it dissipates by the next morning.

The only issue with suffering in silence is that no one thinks you need help. Those whom I consider to be my friends never check up on me, and I don't blame them because from their perspective there's no need. But still, I hold it in because I don't want to be accused of attention-seeking (despite attention being exactly what I need) so I say nothing.

lonely,I’m so lonely,"I’m so lonely - I’m 18, and live in the middle of the largest city in America but feel so alone. I never had a close relationship with my family and moved a lot so never kept any friends. I feel like such a mess. As dumb as it sounds I just want to hold someone."
lonely,Socially what happened to me in just the past 4 years...,"Socially what happened to me in just the past 4 years... - Over the course of just 4 years, I've lost most of my ""friends"" due to painful circumstantial dramas that I would've never foreseen. Within one group, I had fallen in love with one of my best friends (not my fault, it just happened. We have known each other for over 10 years) and she told me she liked me too, and i was ecstatic, but she pretty much right away freaked out at the threat of being a part of the rainbow flag (God forbid) and cut me off. She now has a girlfriend of 2 or so years and, in all honesty, I sort of despise them both. 

Within another group of friends, one of the women had gone straight to my closest friend at the time and told her that I was spreading completely false and out of this world sexual rumors to other people in our group when i wouldn't have ever dreamed of doing that to anybody, let alone someone i looked up to and loved very much. She was basically my unrelated big sister. Big sister gave me the silent treatment for 2 entire weeks....2 weeks of mental torture, reeling, having go round in circles in my head trying to figure out what was wrong, why she was acting this way to me suddenly.. i basically lost her too. And what fucked me up even to this day is that she never once came to me herself and tried to communicate anything with me and believed every word this other bitch was telling her. Never, not once. And guess what? They are devout Christians. 🙄🖕 Go figure.
This Christians actually traumatized me to the point where I had begun to experience some ugly PTSD. After that, I would basically suffocate in crowds and the idea of seeing a friend riddled me with ridiculous anxiety. It was literally the worst.

Now I'm like this:
All in all, I used to love people and deeply care about them. This is pretty standard for an ENFP, but I've learned that people are basically pretty shit, no matter who it is or how close you are to them. So now I find myself only having 2 friends, but it's lonely and I'm 32. Has anyone here ever switched from being the most outgoing loving-life person to just bring a total reclusive burnt introvert? 
I just want to care about people again and feel that love I had for others. It was so much nicer then..."

The way she asked was so sweet and cute that it triggered the lonliness out of me so bad that its kind of haunting/traumatising me. I left in a hurry my friends were confused and I couldn't explain why I left. I know I used to watch videos of people dieing inside and laugh but yesterday it happened to me.

lonely,It's my birthday tomorrow and I'm so scared,"It's my birthday tomorrow and I'm so scared - I'm scared because what if nobody talks to me and says the cliche ""happy birthday"".

I've lost a lot of possible real friendships due to my depression and anxiety and family trauma, I barely talk to my one (online best friend) and that is a bit easier because her and I share the same issues so we could go on days without talking and we'll both understand. 
But in the span of two years, I managed to lose everyone; I disappeared completely off of social media and real life, didn't answer anyone's messages and phone calls for the previously stated reasons, until people just gave up on me, and just recently i made a new Facebook account and added a few of the folks i knew, sent a message apologising for being MIA, some understood and some were very perplexed,  the thing is, i don't even have any kind of relationship that resembles to being just half real, and I'm so scared, I've never been one to care for having too many friends i never did and i still don't, but just now it hit me that I'm only getting older and if making friends was hard in my teen years, could you imagine how hard it would be in your early to mid twenties (not mentioning the baggage i have).

I know I'm the problem here, i can't keep a relationship to save my life and even though I say I'm scared of being lonely but I'm even more scared when i have any sort of commitment to any one.


It sucks, that's all.

Then there's that spark inside my mind that just goes ""if you just done slightly better in school and made a couple of different decisions that could've been you. That could've been you torn between which house party  club or whatever else you're going to with your friends"" 

I relish in certain theories about life and one theory is that this entire thing is a loop, if it is I just hope next time i do things better. I'm introverted so I'd stay in school solely for the purpose of socializing. I think it's the easiest place to make friends then I'd go to uni mostly for the social life while working on my own projects in my spare time

It is 4 am and I'm sitting on my Laptop in bed and wide awake. I feel like shit. Honestly terrible. On one hand because i twisted my ankle pretty bad just recently because I'm stupid. On the other hand is because I just installed TikTok earlier that day. And you might ask yourself whats so wrong about installing TikTok nowdays since nearly everyone uses it even though it can be a bit cringey sometimes. And you're absolutely right. There is nothing wrong with that itself. It's just... my for you page became a depression filled mess. It changed from the usual happy go lucky content you'd might expect from a platform like TikTok to a depressed and sad pile of bs. And in the middle there's me. I've been in bed and watching those sad and depressive ""motivational"" type of tik toks for the last couple of hours and feeling miserable. Part of me just wanted to die internally. The entire time I just wanted to cry. But i couldn't. No matter how hard I tried I just could not do it. Until I stumbled upon one video that hit me really hard and it felt so relatable because I was going through that exact situation they were describing in that video. And so I just started crying all of a sudden. And I really don't cry very often. It was the first time in 2 years I was able to cry like that. I kinda felt relieved afterwards.

Now its nearly 4:30 am and the weather outside is just going nuts. I am still sad. Why am I like this...

I’ll try to make this as short and straight to the point as I can. I’ve been with my “girlfriend” for about 5 years now and the past 2-3 of them I’ve been miserable. By miserable, I mean there is a stop sign in every direction I turn. She’s completely erased all of the friends I had because of her jealousy and every time I try to leave her, she draws me back in with her threats and manipulation. It’s a nightmare I feel like I’ll never awake from and almost as if I’m lost with no way out. I also blame myself at times because I let her do it.. let her walk all over me and take advantage over the years. My entire family can see right through her and they know what kind of person she is. I’m an amazing person and what I mean by that is I’d die for the people I care about. Seeking a true friendship, I would like to find someone who can help me out and pull me out of this. Not only advice but someone who is patient and will stick by my side through the good and bad. I guess you could say I’m sending an application over reddit for friends which may sound desperate but because of her, I feel like I can’t make friends around my area. There’s a whole world out there and with slightest bit of hope maybe someone will come in at the right time. Take my hand, be that person and I’ll show you what I can do. I pray that someone/something picks me up.. let’s create this new beginning for you and I. Preferably looking for people around NY."

I didn't really gel with anyone very well in college, and then covid hit which mucked things up even worse. I took a gap year and got a job, but my colleagues and I didn't really chat to each other outside of work, so I was stuck there as well. 

Now this entire time, university has been bigged up as this brilliant place where you'll meet so many new and interesting people. That it is rich and diverse - super fun and an easy place to make new friends, except its just not. 

I have been here for over a month now, and still haven't actually properly met a single new person. I'm not the greatest at social situations, so its a bit tricky, and I get really nervous in social situations, but for probably the first time in my life, I actually put a determined effort into meeting new people. I went to clubs and societies, I joined discord servers, and I spoke to student representatives... and yet it just hasn't worked. In person people just brush me off, or I get too awkward and just sit by myself in silence while everyone ignores me, and online it is basically the same. I don't understand how the hell anyone actually meets anyone new here without being extremely extroverted. 

And when it comes to my coursemates, none of them even talk to each other, let alone me. I made some attempts to chat with them, but I just got left on read and gave up. How in the hell do you meet and chat to people? It just seems impossible.

lonely,I feel incredibly lost in a sea of loneliness,"I feel incredibly lost in a sea of loneliness - I am not sure where or how it started, but I am a male in my early 20's and I feel incapable of starting lasting relationships with anyone. (A fairly big read ahead)

Since I was young my family has always been traditionally very poor. I grew up homeschooled and so I didn't make a lot of friends during my younger years, and I officially joined real public school during 7th grade. Though because I was homeschooled I had and still have practically zero social skills.

I've always been made fun of for how I look. Puberty hit me quite hard and I was always made fun of for my appearances. Id like to think now im at least reasonably ok looking (180lb, 5'11, blue eyes, brown hair, some muscle growth, fair skin, and significantly less acne than my early teenage years) but the consistency of me being labeled as a 'terrorist' due to my lineage (My family is partially Syrian and I inherited half of it) always upset me. I tried in school at first to be upbeat and friendly, but the consistency never changed and I ended up falling into depression over it, practically forcing myself to go to school every day.

One winter was particularly cold and my family gave me a leather jacket to keep at least a little warm, and that basically solidified my appearances as a terrorist to other people for my whole life up to this point.

As such I had very few friends growing up and by the time highschool hit things went from bad to worse. Never have I ever been involved with drugs or alcohol or anything of the sort, but a lot of other kids were (My area where I live is rural) and I didn't want to fall into such a dangerous trap so I never could form connections with classmates. I shifted highschools at least 3 different times due to familial issues. A couple of girls actually went out with me but it never lasted more than four months. I stood up to my bullies and told counselors my issues, but the problems never stopped and my counselors advice was decidedly poor at best. Ultimately I retreated into my studies and hobbies to avoid it all.

My senior year went from bad to worse. A really cute girl 2 years younger than me had an obvious interest in me and I accepted it cautiously. My family however did not like her and through a series of unfortunate events I was kicked out of my home since I was 18. She took me in with her parents. I sided with her because despite being the loner in the corner of the cafeteria reading or drawing, she recognized I existed and wanted to know more about me, something I didn't have before ever with anyone. Heck she was the first person I was ever physically intimate with and by far the longest relationship I ever held.

I come to find out through my year and a half tenure with her that she was incredibly abusive. She lied repeatedly about topics big and small, stole money from me and I at the time was working a low-paying job, cheated on me twice, and constantly attacked me physically and verbally, of which I now have standing scars. It is partially my fault it lasted so long as I was very forgiving, mostly cause I didn't want to lose the little bit of happiness I had with her that I failed to find anywhere else. I finally escaped back to my family after she cheated for the 3rd time, but my already frail mental state was pretty much annihilated at that point.

Thus I have spent the last 5 months recovering from that ordeal. I got my drivers license, I began working out, got a better job, changed my outfits to something more normal for a boy (Jeans, T-shirts, sneakers, etc.) and am trying to save up enough money for a vehicle and college. 

Yet despite all this, basically no one has talked to me. All of my friends from the tiny group I had have disappeared. No one, be it guy or girl, wants to form any sort of relationship with me, be it a friendship or a relationship, anything, and the nature of my work has me talking to people of all ages, but mainly people near my age due to my town being a college town. I don't believe I am completely uninteresting. I have a video game hobby, I read a lot, draw a lot, synthesize music, exercise frquently, and practice swordsmanship with a sword my family acquired as a means of physical exertion since I don't have the money for a gym pass and my family has practiced with swords before so I had people to learn from. Outwardly I do my best to be bubbly, bright, and positive, but despite all that, the closest thing I have to meaningful communication is the internet, and that itself is dubious. Basically I am regarded as the nerd due to my expressed interest in particle physics, structural engineering, and naval history.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I want to be social and make friends and girlfriends and such because I feel like it would make me happier, but every time I try either family matters stop me, the people are dangerous or do dangerous things, or simply, my chipper attitude garners no interest. Even now its late and I am laying in bed feeling mentally dead. A feeling I despise at this point as its a feeling that hasn't left me for well over 14 years now. I don't know whether its failings on my part or simply life giving me the middle finger, but I genuinely wish it would stop and get better as the last thing I want to do is resort to a bad habit like drinking or drugs as I have witnessed firsthand what it does to people.

Ultimately I am sorry for the long read. I hope maybe just putting this out there will help my mental state a little bit."

Im so tired as it takes a toll on you, and sometimes I feel like screaming i dont want to hear what u did with ur bf/gf/family. Fuck off. And then I feel fucking bad."

lonely,I'm stuck. Mentally.,"I'm stuck. Mentally. - It's hard for me to admit I need help or even open up to anyone about how I'm feeling because I feel like I have no right to ""complain"" or Express my feelings, so I thought I'd come here and speak freely and anonymously.. I'm just so lonely and sad beneath the front I put up to the world. It's like this thing gnawing at me until I can't take it anymore and just break down, lose jobs and ruin relationships by being distant and dissociated. I literally have no friends and it gets really lonely. I feel like a constant bother to my family and It's hard for me to even imagine being friends with new people because my life has just never been that way. I've had one best friend my whole life but we don't see each other as much and she has her own friends she'd rather be with. I know that I just need to ""get over"" all my bs and move on, I mean I'm only 20 a young man and I'm able bodied so I'm fortunate but I feel like I'm handicapped mentally... it's a daily struggle and I just wish I could get better and feel better.

lonely,There is no motivation to live.,"There is no motivation to live. - I fought so hard to stay alive for my friends. Everyday i wake up crying and wishing i was dead. Everynight my heart pounds with anxiety and dread until i pass out and sleep for the night.




I have no energy for anything. Food has flavor but no enjoyment. I paint, draw, game, read, but nothing is tying me to this world.





My friends, gone. There is no one i can be vulnerable with. My joy is gone. 




When i was suicidal in the past, and upset with my boyfriend, id fight and stay alive because of my friends, not for him. And when we didnt fight and it was all me, it was my friends that i fought to stay alive for.





But now... theres nothing. I have a therapist, i have hobbies. Ive traveled the world. Ive got a lot done off my bucket list.




What else is there? Why do they abandon me?




Its a lose-lose situation. They get mad if i dont reach out to them, and then they get mad if i do. Im not even heavy handed about it. I try not to guilt trip, id say something generic like hey, no response. Then they find out and then get mad and say i should have said im having a hard time. So i do that and they say well now that puts the responsibility on us and its manipulative. Like i would understand if i was like ""hey im suicidal"" but im just like, hey i need someone to talk to or hey im having a rough time are you online.






Everyone tells me that ill find new friends. Its not really about that. Its that i was comfortable around them and trusted them. They wont tell me whats wrong
 5 years of friendship and im getting ghosted. It hurts. I dont want to exp this pain ever again i tried and tried for so long. 




I have a lot of stuff to do before i give up though.





I have a lot of stuff to get rid off and give away. I need to get rid of all my stuff so theres no extra heartache of my boyfriend disposing my stuff. 





I don't think ill find peace dying, but i dont think id suffer anymore. Being alive has been shitty. Nothing can go back to how it was. Its gone and destroyed. It keeps happening. People running away from me or pushing me away. I have nothing to offer people, my friends, or society. 






I am nothing."

Love is easy to get along with difficult, only constant change and adaptation, to love for a lifetime!Some people do not see each other for a while, they feel hopeless, do not want to contact, it is not a desirable way, if this is really the case, it is not called love, can only be called passion or impulse, love needs time to operate, distance knows horsepower, time shows people.

I have a good personality, generous, easy-going, cheerful, optimistic.But it's okay if you have your own principles and you don't violate [mine.Love](https://mine.Love) love laugh, sometimes very sensitive, love tears.Stiff and awkward in front of the person you like.Don't like arrogant people, pretentious people, not kind people and boring people.

At this point I'm so frustrated that I hate myself when I feel horny because I don't have anyone. I've to remind myself to not feel horny. And it's a task let me tell you that. 
All this is affecting everything. I can't study properly. I mean I'm still managing it well but it still isn't smooth. I've lost confidence. Don't know my self worth. 
I feel like I've become very desperate. The other day I was walking with a friend[21F] and my arm accidentally brushed against her arm and that gave me goosebumps. Because that's the most touch I've had in a year. I hated that feeling. I couldn't believe it was happening.

I crave some touch. I want to be wanted. I want to be desired. Covid has made it even worse. I feel like the next time I get touched properly by someone (if I do get it) it will be so fucking overwhelming that I'll cry. My confidence is dying (almost dead). My physical needs have been thoroughly disappointed. I've forgotten how it feels to be touched.

lonely,What should a 25 yr old be doing in life?,"What should a 25 yr old be doing in life? - Hi! I’m F/25 and here’s my story. 

Right after university (marketing major), I started working at the 9-5 corporate job. I got burned out and it really consumed my mental health. After 4 1/2 yrs of staying and at the middle of pandemic, i resigned. I decided to do full time freelancing (digital marketing niche). At first, it was doing really well. I had 6 clients that time but I got overwhelmed. I had a hard time adjusting to the freelance world because I was used to having a top management that always tells me what to do. Then, after 2 months, I let go of my 4 clients. 

Afterwards, I thought that I haven’t really healed from the experiences I had at the corporate job and took online therapy. 

By this I only have 2 clients and they really gave me peace of mind. But I need to survive and pay bills, I have to increase my income. 

Few months passed, I got another gig. It was paying really well. Downside is, I don’t like the work culture and I really felt disconnected. I stayed for the money. Then after almost 5 months, i got laid off. Without notice, they cut me off just like that. Well, to be honest, I was relieved because I don’t have to deal with them. I thought that its okay and I would just find another one. But I got my problem again, my finances. 

I used this time to reflect on everything I went through. By the way, all of these (freelancing) happened just this year. And now, I am completely lost on what should I do. I only have 1 client at the moment. Finding job is so hard and draining. 

I am torn between doing jobs that pay well but will cost my mental again or following my passion but it barely feeds me? 

I thought that when I left my toxic corporate job, got my freedom and be able to do the job that I really want, everything will be fine. But now I am starting to question everything. 🥲"

lonely,Not enough,"Not enough - First off please don’t judge me. I’m a failure. I’ve made mistakes. I have been married for several years now and have kids. Married life has always been more of a “roommate” relationship and not what I think a relationship should be. It’s kind of a we are happy with the kids and we benefit from the other, but there is such a lack in connection.  I have a really high sex drive and she has literally no sex drive. A couple years ago I met this woman randomly and we connected instantly. It is literally like we are made for each other. We fell in love and fell in love fast. She is a married woman with kids as well. The difference in the two of us is that she claims she loves me and her husband the same. That we are both her soulmates. She says she wants to be with me but can’t. I have driven several hours to see her twice and she has never attempted to do the same for me. We have never hooked up. The two times I have met her was very respectful I did hug her, but that was as far as it went. I have poured my heart out to her over and over, but it feels like every time I do she starts clinging closer to him. He is a narcissist and only does for her what he gets out of it. He is selfish and completely inconsiderate of her. No matter how much I have attempted to prove to her my love it is never enough. The woman I’m married to doesn’t seem like she wants me most of the time, and it feels like the woman I am so madly in love with is only keeping me around as a backup plan in case she ever is too unhappy with her husband. I want to give someone my whole heart and receive theirs back. I’m tired of being alone. Maybe I’m just not worth it."

Now a little time has passed I met this girl, we went out a few times, went watching movies at my place with no funny business though, she was cuddling with me and stuff it was okay. But then sometimes it feels like she doesn't care about me, she takes hours to reply, she's kind of shy, but still she acts sometimes fine, sometimes like she doesn't give a fuck about me and it's driving me insane. She has this guy friend she spends te with sometimes and she tells me, but sometimes doesn't, though I know that. She has hung a photo of us in her room next to a photo with her girl friends. She's weird, one moment it looks like she likes me next hour is feels like she wants me to fuck off. Of course I am in love with her, she's weird, but I'll keep trying, i don't know. But thing is I have noone to talk to, I got into isolation, because I got covid with no symptoms and being alone in this new flat 200km from the hometown with only a few friends who I know for 2 months just gets to you. I spent now days crying, feeling anxiety about everything, about making the right choices. I just kind of became dull and sad and cold around people, don't have positive emotions anymore. It's partly break up, partly this new girl and everything is new here now. So many things are making me feel sad now, so much overthinking, different thoughts that I don't even know why I'm sad and crying in the first place. I'm just kind of in this loophole of sadness would it be one thing or another..."

lonely,disappointed with my unmet expectations and life in general,"disappointed with my unmet expectations and life in general - Hi, i just turned 18 this year. Fresh out of high school, or half a year actually. Anyways, i've pretty much been cooped up in my room since i graduated from school (boarding school, to be exact, just to show you how mundane my life was during high school as well). I could say COVID screwed me over of my what would have been, super fun out-of-school break. But all those hours in my room, stuck in my own head, made me realize alot of things. 

Firstly i have strict parents. My dad's more lenient though. Either way, i have only gotten to hang out with my friends twice in the span of the last 5 months. It's making me soooo depressed seeing my other friends (all my age) going on road trips, and vacations TOGETHER. I love my parents, but somehow i feel like i got the super short end of the stick. I'm not even allowed to have a boyfriend and despite the fact that there aren't any potential suitors knocking on my door, the idea that I CAN'T date either way is such a bummer. I'm 18. It's not like i can drive either because i haven't gotten my license yet. 

I have very few friends that i kept in touch with after high school. One which i'm super close to and trust with anything. One friend who is really fun to talk with because they get all my pop culture references but sometimes drains the life out of me with little unsuspecting comments. Another friend who i talk to maybe once every 2 weeks. And one who doesn't bother to text at all unless i do first and even then, i feel our friendship has run its course. 

Then, there's also the existential crisis that takes over my mind every now and then. Let me explain. For practically my whole life, i have been 'that girl'. Not to sound condescending but this is literally how people have described me. By 'that girl', i mean i'm usually the prettiest girl in the room. Now i know what you're thinking. ""Oh, she's a pretty girl who wants to complain about her excessive pretty privilege."" 

That's really not the case. I'm tired. I feel like i've been set up by every single person that has said or made me feel that way. I don't expect anybody to understand what i'm feeling here but i just...i feel so fucking invisible. If i'm so fucking pretty, then why do people never talk to me? If i'm so pretty, why doesn't anybody ever reach out to me? If i'm so pretty, then why hasn't a single guy ever asked me out on a date? 

I know that these things typically revolve around a person's character (and trust me, i'm good enough). I'm certainly not some shitty person that everyone avoids. But it's just depressing that everybody has basically given me this narrative that my life must be so full of blooming flowers and excitement when that's literally not the case. I feel dead. I feel so unhappy. I don't get to experience anything. What point is it that i'm so good looking when i dont get to live my life as half as thrilling as the other kids? Basically, i feel like i've been given this script to the movie of my life but the more we film, the more i realize nothing in the script is happening. 

This rant was all over the place. If you've read this far, maybe u could take a minute or two to just say something. Maybe some interactions with redditers would help :("

lonely,How to deal with loneliness?,"How to deal with loneliness? - Hi everyone, I (21F) have been facing with loneliness for 6 months since the pandemic went crazy in SaiGon, VN. As an extrovert, I used to have many friends and there were also many guys chased me back then.  
After getting rid of a desparate relationship, I realised that I lost almost all the connections and bonds (my friends moved to another the city, I finished uni earlier than my classmates, I don't have a job atm). My life turned to a new chapter: loneliness. 
To be honest I have never found myself in such this situation, I tried many ways to get rid of it such as watching therapy videos, reading about my conditions and even using a dating app. But nothing changes, it even went worse on dating app since those people made me feel more unconfident. 
I try to keep myself happy by being on my own but I also found that it would be unhealthy for my situation atm. Anyway, I am still on my way finding my new friends or community which I can fit in. Hehe. I hope whoever in the same situation as mine won't feel bad about themselves or wondering if something was wrong with them. Just know that therewill be many people out there (one day) will be your companies. 
And if you're in SG and do feel lonely maybe we can be friends and hang out *friendly invitation*"

Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real 🌟), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"

But I don't have either so I'm going with my 2 brothers, sister and mother. 


I don't know why but I feel kind of upset about it. None of them like the band or listen to their music. The relationship I have with all of them isn't the best. I have fights with my mom all the time. Rarely talk to my siblings and vice versa. 


When my sister comes home from school, she goes and says hi to everyone but me. Thats how it is. None of them ever want to hear me talk about anything. 

If I ever call any of them to show them something, they'll be like ""ohh :/ ok"" , ""oh man"" ,etc. 

it hurts even more considering there is literally no one else to share things with.


I am the black sheep of the family and have always been. 

I know I am going to cry during the concert because of how much it means to me. I dont want to cry in front of them though. Now im nervous."

lonely,Lonely in my golden time 20s ✨,"Lonely in my golden time 20s ✨ - Female here. Just feeling low and incredibly lonely. I have been using dating apps on and off without keeping hopes ofc. I matched with a really nice guy. The conversations were good and it felt nice overall. We also made plans to travel together since we both like exploring new places. Even though it's casual and temporary, I like to put in some effort and make things enjoyable for both of us. We were talking one day and he asked if we could sext, exchange nudes and video call since we live far away. I told him I wasn't comfortable exchanging nudes and video call. I wasn't expecting this so I was a little surprised. Now it seems he isn't interested to talk anymore which further proves that he didn't want anything serious. I texted him asking if he wasn't interested we could stop talking in a polite manner. He replied back saying he was busy with an interview etc. We haven't talked since then. I would really appreciate if he just tell me that he lost interest so I can invest my energy on someone else. It's not like we were going to date each other anyway. I'll delete his number after a week. Plan a solo trip. This is making me really lonely lol. I have almost given up on dating.. Now I can't even make guys to commit for causal meet ups. I'm only in my 20s and these things seem so hard lmao."
lonely,How to meet people,"How to meet people - I live in a very small area. I mean VERY remote. When I've tried to get into events and groups to meet people both before covid and now, everything is centered around older individuals (I live in an area where people commonly retire)  or there's groups and events that only happen during my working hours. It's hard to meet people my age (late 20s) who are also seeking friends and who have the same interests as me. People here in their late 20s already have their friend groups established.

I have a partner who I spend 100% of my time with, and I love them dearly but holy shit I'd love some friends in the mix. When I think about life milestones like weddings and baby showers and things like that, I realize that I would have no one to invite to those things. At the end of the day it ends up feeling like I'm the problem. I never made friends after high school and I think I never figured out how to socialize well. I feel like I have to force connections with others a lot of the time just so I'll have someone to talk to but I don't remember the last time I truly connected with anyone. I'm just sick of feeling isolated and having no one to share things with, nothing to look forward to. No one to celebrate things with. I've spent my last 5 birthdays only with my partner. I graduated grad school and it was only my partner who celebrated with me. My depression so often comes back to this feeling of being too different from others to connect and to my overwhelming loneliness. 

I'm just tired of going through life this way."

lonely,Just want to explode,"Just want to explode - Before I start, I understand I am in a very lucky position and I appreciate I have a roof over my head. 

I left an abusive relationship over a year ago, I came to live with my grandparents. I don’t feel I really had time to process what happened as I was always surrounded by them, having to pretend I was happy because we don’t speak about feelings in my family. 

I get no time to myself here, I moved about 1.5hrs from all my friends, if I do go and see them I have to be back by 9pm, so I don’t wake my grandparents, even then, as soon as I pull up on the drive they are at the door waiting for me. I then have to come in and tell them about my evening. In the morning, I have to go and spend 30 mins with them, eat breakfast, drink tea or they’ll wonder what’s up, usually I’ll just skip breakfast. I’m not good in the morning and usually running late. 

They expect me to take my hour lunch break with them and watch tv. If I tell them I’m going back to work early they’ll comment that all my life seems to be is working.  They’ll bring me about 10 cups of tea during the day. I have to be down for dinner at 6pm and then I feel rude disappearing upstairs straight away. 

As sweet as the are, I need SPACE, routine is not my thing and I don’t know how much longer I can cope with this. After a long day at work of meeting, phone calls etc I just feel like I need to socially recharge. They are also so negative about everything and it drains the life out of me. Sometimes I just want to scream. 

Moving out is not an option right now, prices are so incredibly expensive, but fingers crossed in the next 6 months I should be able to.

Days where I cannot put up with this any longer, I’ll go and work in the office, about an hours drive away. These mornings I’m up at 5am and my Nan always makes sure she is up before me, but I don’t have time to stop so then I feel guilty.  

Living with my mother is not an option, she lives 5 mins from my office but she is incredibly toxic. My dating life is suffering because how am I ever supposed to meet anyone in this situation. I am just so fed up of my life right now and I feel like it is wasting away because I have no freedom and no space of my own."

I love reading other people’s stories and being able to relate and feel normal. I lived in the same city for 13 years and made lots of friends and even best friends but all of those best friends left (no arguments, it was civil), all of the people I made friends with are there on social media but not to talk much at all or share life experiences etc. I’ve had a couple of moments this past week where I have wanted to message someone to tell them something funny I have heard… only to realise I actually have no friends, no one at all to tell these things to. It hurts so much deep down but I always put a strong front on so people don’t realise how lonely I truly am. I use to smoke a lot of weed to numb myself and everything from my childhood and present events, I have bpd and severe ocd and I definitely think all of these things contribute to me not having friends. People don’t seem to stick around for the long run, I genuinely do have a big heart and would die for anyone. Overall I think I am a really opinionated person and I should probably just shut up half of the time. I wish I never smoked weed and fell into the right friend group as a kid, I imagine I would still have childhood friends and maybe even a best friend. At the end of the day I just wish I had even one irl friend. Sorry for rambling, I just needed to get this off my chest."

lonely,I just realized tonight...,"I just realized tonight... - I am the most miserable person I know.

I know alcoholics. Meth addicts. Felons.

I'm more miserable than them. Who would have thought such a thing?

All I wanted to was to be a loving husband and father, and that looks less likely by the day. Our society, and I, am too broken. The dating ""scene"" is a disaster. I only get led on and lied to my face, like I am an idiot. That is all I am good for, being led on and lied to. Being used. I no longer interact with humans. These aren't humans. There has to be another classification. 

I am never good enough. I never was. I can never be who I am demanded to be. My overachieving isn't enough. I am not enough. I am unworthy to be loved. My whole life has taught me this, and how I wish it were not so.

Not saying I would, but that whole ""suicide"" thing, really starting to understand why someone would check out.

I am a workaholic. The money is good, but more than anything, it keeps me from facing my loneliness directly. It is a reminder of how I am not worthy to be loved. How I don't really exist. How I'm not really a human being. 

I throw myself into my work to put off facing the inevitable: the end of my work day.

I hate leaving work. Do you want to know why? Because that means I have to return home and face the same thing I face, every night: I stare at my bed before I lie down, and imagine someone who loves me, reaching out to embrace me. She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

The same cold sheets, every goddamned night. The same lack of conversation. The same lack of shared body heat. The lack of hearing her breathe, her scent, her touch, her hair draped across me. All a dream I will never experience, to be loved. She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

I wake up so many nights, reaching out to embrace someone who isn't there. I wake up and see, it was just a dream, a cruel mirage. She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

In the morning, the same occurs. I reach, hoping to embrace her at the start of a new day, but nothing is there. She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

What a goddamned terrible life this is. I don't want to wake up. The pain is so overwhelming.

She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

She's not there. She never was. She never will be. 

How can this be ""life""? I'm a dead man.

I'm unable to be loved and I am tired of reaching out at nothing, no one in the night."

lonely,21m | what's it like to be loved?,"21m | what's it like to be loved? - I feel like I've been alone for so long now that I cant even think of what it would be like to be loved by a girlfriend. it hurts feeling like I have so much love to give but have no one to give it to, I find myself thinking about how much id love to surprise them with presents, hug them, and be able to hold them and make them feel safe. its hard thinking about how I wish I could just spend time and fall in love with a girl. but it feels so out of reach. 

I dont think im a weird or unlikable guy, I do have friends, who I do love and I know they would help me if I ever needed help. but even with having them it just doesn't fill the void in my heart. 

I just wish I had a girlfriend I could tell everything to, and be able to make them happy by just being there, hell let alone someone I can just share my hobbies with and hang out with, id do anything for that. but most of all I always find myself wondering what its like to wake up to someone you love, I dont know why I've always had a fascination for this but I do, id do anything to experience that just once."
lonely,Sick of being this way.,"Sick of being this way. - I’ve been alone for so long now. It doesn’t get better, it only ever gets worse until you realise that you’ll never be happy. I thought I’d open up to my closest (and only) friend but my message has been ignored for a week now. I guess that nobody cares about me after all. I just want to throw myself off a bridge at this point, there’s no point to living like this, being a husk of a human being."

lonely,I need love,"I need love - I love this girl, haven’t told her yet because we’re splitting ways soon and not actually dating, but I fall in love pretty fast, and this girl is special and I mean SPECIAL. I am constantly surprised at things we have in common, she’s absolutely gorgeous both with and without makeup, she has a very nice taste in style, every moment spent with her is just an absolute dream and she has made me happier than anyone else ever has. The only problem is I’m moving soon so there’s no point in becoming official. Also on top of that, she’s still getting over a really toxic ex bf and both works and goes to school almost all day everyday. Her busyness plus my inevitable moving, prevents us from being serious. It pains me. It’s a different type of lonely different than what’s typically posted in this sub Reddit. 

I won’t lie I’m not as lonely as I could be thankfully, it’s just I don’t know how to comprehend this feeling between me and her. It’s like I’m not lonely because I have her, but at the same time I am lonely because I know it’s coming to an end very soon. We can’t REALLY connect because of that. We can’t REALLY establish that we have feelings for each other, we can’t REALLY date often, we can’t get too close to each other, and it’s just kind of painful to be so in love but she most likely feels like I’m just another guy who’s fun for a while. 

TLDR: I’m in love, but can’t say it. She has feelings, but seemingly not as strong. I’m not alone, but I’m lonely, disconnected, and needing some real uninterrupted love."

I fell in love and lost it all in the same year. Yet no matter what happens, what milestone I set for myself and achieve I still feel utterly empty.

I miss having friends, I miss spending time with my family. I thought that losing my virginity, feeling loved and wanted would make me happy and it didn’t. I thought moving out and being independent would make me happy, it also didn’t. I don’t enjoy my job anymore and even my hobbies are just there to burn away time.

I don’t know where to go from here. I’ve never felt so lost and alone. I feel like my entire life has just been drifting from one thing to the next in search of anything to fill the void. All I wanna do is cry."

Im so alone and it beats me tf up every moment I'm living.
It doesn't leave my head anymore. Years of nobody and its just too much. I feel like I'm the only one in the world going through this. It's horrible. I just wish I had friends. People to go down the beach with and vibe, or play a silly round of crazy golf. Anything simple like that.

lonely,No idea,"No idea - I don't even know anymore, kinda hollow and haven't slept. My mind and heart is racing so kinda want to talk gibberish and nonsense to empty space.

I remember my dreams was once filled with happiness, joy and hope. I always saw myself as a saviour, or even a superhero being a good person, doing good deeds. Sounds kinda pathetic and naive now I read out loud. 

But I don't dream like this anymore, they're filled with pain, death and destruction instead. I no longer see myself as a hero but someone who wants to hurt others, but I could never hurt someone it's against my nature. But maybe that makes me a bad person regardless or maybe I have been a bad person all along, Maybe I deserve this torment, No idea.   

I don't really see much of a future for myself, tbh the only use this hollow corpse of a creature has is to give back the energy to the weeds so new life can grow. Maybe they will do a better job than me, it's kinda comical knowing a weed has more of a purpose than me. At least they know what they're doing, not me I'm just stumbling in the dark trying to find meaning. 

Tbh I have no clue why I'm writing this, it probably doesn't even make sense. I just want to sleep lol.

I’m not really here to vent nor cry for sympathy but I’ve basically reached a point where I become broken, particularly after my mom’s suicide three years ago. 

All of these things are hitting me more than ever at the moment, as I’m bedridden and not set for discharge until late tomorrow and at this point I feel like I can’t really talk to any of my friends due to the fear of being judged or just given cookie cutter responses so if anyone’s up to talk or whatever, let me know and thank you so much"

I did not have a lot of friends, but the world seemed so full of promise. - Hi! I am new here and was just flipping through everyone's struggles. I thought I should share mine too.

I am 27 F and I just feel so disappointed by adulthood. I am in an unhealthy relationship I don't find the guts to let go because we are good as friends, my family lives abroad, my friends have all moved out.

I remember the days I was 17 and dreaming about going to big cities and having an exciting life as soon as I would go to college. And while I did all that and traveled to many places, I never really made meaningful connections. I am just feeling so worn off, alone and meeting new people causes me dread and anxiety. Life once felt so full of promise- almost so much better inside my head than when I went out there to experience it. And the growth that I got in this time was so not worth the loneliness, isolation, anxiety and the rest of mental problems I gained in the process.

In the end I never got the group of friends I wanted, or the city I dreamed of living in. I just struggle on the day to day, overwork and come home to a relationship that is not what I wanted after trying and trying to change all those things. I am just tired.

I miss being 17 and full of promise and life and possibility. Adulthood is just so desolate..."

People who get me, friendships that are easy and not forced. I live in the middle of no where, making friends here is difficult on its own.

I miss having friendships that felt easy. I had friends in high school and it was easy then, it felt natural, I didn't have to force those relationships. But when I got to college, I never made friends and I've been pretty alone since. I have gotten along well with people at work in all my jobs but nothing has ever extended past a work friendship and when I leave a job, it's over. I'm just sad and lonely. Maybe I'm too picky when it comes to friends, I don't know. I just know it's hard when I don't feel like I have anyone I can talk to about much of anything, people who want to call me or people to just BE around. I want the kind of friendships I see where two people are just so relaxed and comfortable with each other. I think about when I get married and I realize I will have no bridesmaids, no maid of honor. I think about when I have kids, I will have no one to invite to a baby shower, to a wedding shower, to anything. I am utterly alone.

But there's nobody who I've chosen to reveal everything to. I don't trust that they wouldn't just hate me for some aspect or another, or that they would feel betrayed that I even hid stuff in the first place. My mother, father, sibling, even my ""friends""; none of them truly know what I'm entirely like, who I really am. I wish there were someone who I could feel comfortable trusting with everything. Who I could really open up to. I feel like I'm wronging them by not telling things I'm certain they'll hate me for. And with each new person, I don't know what to reveal, so I have to worry about overstepping, but also about being so closed off that they don't want to talk to me anymore. I feel like there's nothing I can do, and that, even with interaction with other people, it isn't real. I feel like a fake person, living fake lives. I don't know what I can do."

About anything and everything, and sometimes nothing. I want to be silent with someone, comfortably silent, with no expectations of what comes next. I want to relax with someone. I want to be tense with someone. I just want a companion. It hurt me when my best friend, who has a boyfriend, said that I’m like “her real partner,” in a joking way, because we do so much together and are very close.

But, I’m not her real partner. She lives with her real partner. Gets to talk to him, and touch him every day. Gets to tell him she loves him, and hear it back. I don’t have that. So yes it’s sweet to hear that she loves me but it isn’t the same. And I have beat self care to death… I just want someone to take care of me. I want to take care of someone. I want mutual respect and understanding, the kind that takes time to build.

I am so, so unbelievably lonely. I think about going back to cutting my arms just to feel something again, to feel more in control; I don’t know exactly why. I just want to feel something physical, a break from the mental pain that I feel every single day. It’s so hard to get myself to do anything.

Not sure really where I’m going with this. I just wish that meeting potential men to date was easier. I’m sick of dating apps, they haven’t worked for me in like 2 years. I don’t live in a city so there just aren’t enough men to begin with I guess. And I’m getting older. So i’m just feeling more and more fed up lately.

Not having people fight for you when you cant fight for yourself because they gave up. You couldn’t get your shit together fast enough before their care worn off. Im not a fucking actress.

I’ll try to make this as short and straight to the point as I can. I’ve been with my “girlfriend” for about 5 years now and the past 2-3 of them I’ve been miserable. By miserable, I mean there is a stop sign in every direction I turn. She’s completely erased all of the friends I had because of her jealousy and every time I try to leave her, she draws me back in with her threats and manipulation. It’s a nightmare I feel like I’ll never awake from and almost as if I’m lost with no way out. I also blame myself at times because I let her do it.. let her walk all over me and take advantage over the years. My entire family can see right through her and they know what kind of person she is. I’m an amazing person and what I mean by that is I’d die for the people I care about. Seeking a true friendship, I would like to find someone who can help me out and pull me out of this. Not only advice but someone who is patient and will stick by my side through the good and bad. I guess you could say I’m sending an application over reddit for friends which may sound desperate but because of her, I feel like I can’t make friends around my area. There’s a whole world out there and with slightest bit of hope maybe someone will come in at the right time. Take my hand, be that person and I’ll show you what I can do. I pray that someone/something picks me up.. let’s create this new beginning for you and I. Preferably looking for people around NY."

lonely,I appreciate whoever reads this ❤️,"I appreciate whoever reads this ❤️ - Where do I begin. 
Firstly, to anyone that reads this, thank you. This is something I barely do. As my life progresses I’ve realised a few things - mainly I’m a mess. I can no longer pretend everything in life is going to mysteriously fall into place or simply the idea that soon everything is going to be ‘alright’. Let’s get right into it. Truth is I’ve never really known what I want from ‘life’ or what I’ve been doing with my life for the majority of it. For example. Although this cannot possibly summarise the depths of what I’m trying to explain. Some people want to be doctors. They work hard and become doctors. Essentially, there is a clear goal. My problem is during my time in school even up to university I just did things ‘because’. 

‘because’ that’s how it is. You’re expected to get good grades and make your parents proud. I wanted to do well to keep my parents happy - and to keep them off my back. So I did the bare minimum to do so. I got good grades. Got into a good university but somewhere along the lines everything began to catch up to me. Long-story short I dropped out of university. I tired to blame a issue at home for my main reason of leaving but truth is I slowly became disconnected with was I was learning and everything had just became a chore. Unlike being in school - you don’t get into trouble for not attending classes. In university if you miss deadlines or have poor attendance for classes/lectures there’s no ‘real’ sort of repercussions -  I started smoking weed heavily in university and do think it may have worsened my feelings of disconnect or disengagement but a few things became clear to me: if I had some sort group project or work -  I would always go above and beyond - not for my sake, I know how important others value their degrees/courses and I never want to be the cause for anyone’s misfortunes so I always pulled my weight. Then it occurred to me - I was still doing things just to do them. Just to ‘keep up’. Just to ‘appear normal’. Just to act as if I’m getting on. Same as exams -  I always wanted to pass exams to avoid the feeling of failure - the exclusion felt from when you don’t pass or do to well. Knowing that I’m on the same steady pace as everybody else. In other words ‘Safe’. 
I can even apply this to sex. I had literally forced myself to have sex when I turned 20. Just so friends could stop asking me whether I was a virgin or not - the experience, I wouldn’t even call  ‘sex’ nor ‘enjoyable’. I took a viagra pill and met this girl I had been speaking too. She claimed ‘it went in’ in my brain, meaning virginity lost, I left it there - I realised yet again I’m just doing this ‘because’. 

After this encounter I never even tried to have sex with this girl again - it was like I had just checked something off my check list. Thinking back on this situation - it was embarrassing. She probably told her friends how bad my d*** game was but I was so oblivious at the time I never even thought this way. 
Essentially I did something just ‘because’ again.
Not cause I want too but ‘because’ where I’m from and the friends I had being a virgin at 20 is ‘embarrassing’ or not the ‘norm’. I remember being present at places where my friends had lost their virginity way younger than I did. I never really understood it. Maybe I was overthinking it and should just ‘crush pus’ like my other friends do - I had my own fair amount opportunities to lose my virginity even before I had turned 20 but just never felt the ‘need’ to have sex. So never did. I literally never pulled through whenever it really got down to business which made me question - why did I even speak to girls? Guess what. Just ‘because’ again. ‘Because’ my friends did it. ‘Because’ if you didn’t - you’re considered weird or gay. I remember I would literally rather watch porn than have sex with a girl I have no real care for or she has no real care for me but I’m waffling off topic I hope this all just builds understanding for the ‘just because’ explanation I’m trying to give.


When I dropped out - I had returned home without knowledge to a terrible situation regarding my parents. My parents have never been together. It’s the typical story of a broken family. Abuse. Dysfunction etc. You get the point. I could get into details but would probably need to make a entirely different post. 
The main impact from this situation was that I was told a lot of things that were supposedly ‘hidden’ from me - I guess for my ‘protection’ . I was told my father used to abuse my mother. Which he denied. He never wanted me. He disowned my sister. Essentially it became a game of he said / she said. I had lived with both parents separately in the past -  on and off but such situation immensely destroyed my trust in anyone. I mean hearing my father never wanted me yet spending years living under his roof, eating his meals etc made me question whether it was ever love or something he just had to do. Unfortunately, as I grow older even if it was love or something he just had to do I understand it now. My mother is weak. I hate to admit but she’s one of those people that are too good for the world. Overly Innocent. Too Kind. Vulnerable. Weak. My dad had claimed she had her own problems but as a boy, your mother is always your loving mother you don’t question anything until you grow up. The hardest thing for me to fathom was I started seeing each of their points about each other.  The fact that my mother was a broken woman battling mental health problems for the majority of her life. Then my father who they claimed never aimed to raise a family. I have a older sister and things didn’t go well with my father and her so I guess everything started ‘making sense’.

In university, my dad didn’t visit me once - we rarely spoke but I had noticed our relationship becoming more than non-existent. I don’t exactly know why. I mean I got into the best university I could have (Top 10-20 in my country at the time)  and had never really let him ‘down’. He had got married and kind of forgotten about me and it seemed like I was just permanently stuck with my mother. 
Please don’t think I hate my mum but as mentioned she was unstable I sadly only remember her more for her worse moments as it is what I can recall the most seeing. 
But anyways. 
Here’s the real problem:

After dropping out. I had the house to myself I’d say for about a good few months (only because my mother had fallen ill again due to her mental illnesses so I had the place to myself as in that state it wouldn’t be healthy for her to be around me) This is where everything had caught up to me. I became insanely lonely to the point I had forgotten how to socialise - I would meet up with  old friends (people I’ve known for years) and barely could think of sentences or keep conversations flowing but did so just ‘because’ I wanted to appear like everything was fine. Not only this. Me being alone for so long I started to dislike being around anyone. As I said my mother was unstable -  she could be smiling one day and crying the next so I had to always suppress myself or keep a ‘guard’ up. She would always pretend things were okay even when they weren’t. I smoked weed almost everyday couldn’t give you a WEEK where I went sober. I hadn’t seen most of my  friends since I dropped out (year and a bit) and it just seemed everyone had forgotten about me. Phone was dry. Only here and there people would check up on me but then it all stopped. You would of thought having a free house to myself I would constantly have friends over or even host a party but truth is I was just drowning in depression. 
I’ve been drowning in depression my whole life - I’ve only realised my feelings of depression when I began university and properly had alone time - I realised I don’t have any real connections or relationships with anyone. Never had an Ex and my friends we always were in groups which meant we never had to get too personal we were always just kind of in the moment.

The time I spent at home was during the Corona period (which is still going on?) The effects of my isolation began to creep up on me. I always had the blind shuts. My health was poor. Would barely wash or brush my teeth - take any care of myself unless I had to - had to meet a friend or had to do something where I had to look somewhat presentable -  when I went out. I realised how overly paranoid I look always questioning ‘do I look normal’  am I ‘blending in’ yet I never used to think this way before. One day I had noticed I usually start conversations with myself - a person on the train had caught me and I always went into a panic as I didn’t even realise I was doing such thing so blatantly  - it got to the point I would pretend to be on the phone to just ‘act’ like I’m talking to someone.

As a kid or a teenager if I had told you I was doing things like this no one would believe me as I never acted this way. I must add I lost a lot of hair during a young age and underwent surgery at a fairly young age too. I can’t say the surgery went too well but during the process of the surgery and my recovery my life became even worse. it was summer, scorching hot. Obviously with the surgery my hair looked crazy. I had hair in my bald spots uneven to the rest of my natural hair. For a long time I felt I had to stay indoors and ‘hide’ away until this issue cleared - months and months passed and I soon started living the exact same day everyday. I felt I couldn’t go out as my hair was uneven - I couldn’t even bring myself to go to a barber shop in public nor take a walk or even just let my hair out I knew how bad this was for my recovery but a voice in my head wouldn’t let me free. Try to understand from my perspective at a time in life my hair was bad but i could accept it -  I could go out with my hair out, confident - then it got to a point I couldn’t - then I got surgery and had hair where I didn’t but didn’t know how to act as I never had hair there before. Do you understand? Also where I’m from it’s absolutely unheard of to do things like this - I had to essentially keep this a secret - I didn’t tell anyone - I missed a lot of holidays, birthdays etc simply due to the fact I wasn’t comfortable in my own skin and when people asked for reasonings I couldn’t share the real reason as I was scared of being judged. 
But yet again I didn’t understand myself - why did I do this if even if the results were successful or not how would I go about it? It seems my whole life I had made decision without my heart fully wanting those decisions to be made. 
I wanted my hair back so I could look like everyone else ‘because’ everyone else had hair. I was like the only guy with hair problems in my entire school. People noticed early I was balding but yet again going off topic.

How do I bounce back?
Please don’t tell me to start going gym every day.  
Start a business and make 4-5 figures in 6 months. Not that these are bad things.

But right now I feel like an alien. I need to rebuild myself essentially restart life. 
Is there any films I can watch? Any books I can read? Any podcasts I can listen too. Any music that will reach me? 

I just need help. What do I do. If anyone read all of this. What is Step 1 for me?"

I’ll try to make this as short and straight to the point as I can. I’ve been with my “girlfriend” for about 5 years now and the past 2-3 of them I’ve been miserable. By miserable, I mean there is a stop sign in every direction I turn. She’s completely erased all of the friends I had because of her jealousy and every time I try to leave her, she draws me back in with her threats and manipulation. It’s a nightmare I feel like I’ll never awake from and almost as if I’m lost with no way out. I also blame myself at times because I let her do it.. let her walk all over me and take advantage over the years. My entire family can see right through her and they know what kind of person she is. I’m an amazing person and what I mean by that is I’d die for the people I care about. Seeking a true friendship, I would like to find someone who can help me out and pull me out of this. Not only advice but someone who is patient and will stick by my side through the good and bad. I guess you could say I’m sending an application over reddit for friends which may sound desperate but because of her, I feel like I can’t make friends around my area. There’s a whole world out there and with slightest bit of hope maybe someone will come in at the right time. Take my hand, be that person and I’ll show you what I can do. I pray that someone/something picks me up.. let’s create this new beginning for you and I. Preferably looking for people around NY."

lonely,I feel like I have wasted what should have been the best years of my life.,"I feel like I have wasted what should have been the best years of my life. - I'm starting to believe I have Asperger's at this point. It runs on both sides of my family anyway. 7th-11th grade I was off and on with the same friend group (they were mean and weird like me but I had no one else to talk to so that's why I kept going back to them). 12th grade no friends. Community college I had no friends (after first semester everything went to zoom for the last year and a half). Now I am at a big commuter university and still haven't talked to anyone outside of class. I work part time so it's hard to get involved in clubs and after school things too. I just want to be one of those college girls that live on campus all 4 years and have a great social life. They post cute pictures on their insta, are in sororities, go to big state schools, and go to parties. I have never went to a high school or college party. I have the most boring life. I have nothing cool to show my children (if I even have children) of my younger self. I keep telling myself at least I wont be in debt but at this point I wish I just took out all the loans I could. I am so lonely and I wish I could go back in time and finish my last 2 years at a big state school."
lonely,I am cursed,"I am cursed - A couple months back I met some of my best friends. I was in a really bad mental state and these friends made me feel incredibly lucky. Over these couple months they became the first ever people that I really told my problems to. I was really close with one of them and they told me a lot and I did the same thing. It felt like someone for once actually appreciated who I am. A couple days ago I talked about my problems of how the friends I make eventually always seem to eventually never want to talk to me. I went to sleep feeling relieved for telling someone. I woke up to a message saying they don’t want to be friends anymore because of their mental state and they blocked me on everything. I feel so helpless. I feel like I failed them. However I also am a little angry towards them. They did exactly what I opened up about and what I thought they would never do. I don’t even know what to think. I loved this person dearly. I really value the time we spend together. I want to thank them for everything as to say sorry for failing as a friend which I think I may have done because why else would this happen. Sadly I can’t do this because they blocked me and also because I still am so confused and sad about how they could just backstab me like that out of no where. I feel cursed, my friends always seem to turn a blind eye to me. I never  expected this and not even being able to talk to them before they did it hurts me a lot. I’ve been living these last couple of days with no sense of what’s going on around me. All I can think about is how I may have hurt my now ex-friend to where they could do this but I cannot think of anything. But if I didn’t hurt them then I must have failed at helping them. I now don’t even want to talk to my only other friend because I don’t want to fail them. I really don’t know what’s wrong with me to where they would want to do this. A couple hours before they  said they really liked talking to me and had a lot of fun but then they block me on everything. I’m so confused and to be honest broken."

lonely,Hopefully the end to my loneliness. And a new beginning.,"Hopefully the end to my loneliness. And a new beginning. - 
I’ve spent the last two years trying to form a real friendship at university. 
Throughout the first year I met two other people whom I thought I could’ve been friends with, unfortunately, due to my social anxiety I couldn’t get myself to have a conversation with them that would last more than a few sentences.
Eventually, once the pandemic hit my city and we went into lockdown, I lost contact with them. 

The second year was fully online due to the pandemic, I thought I would be alone the entire time, thankfully one of our modules had us get into groups to work on a project. After we finished the project, out of the group of 6 people, only three continued to talk to me, one of them ghosted me, and I stopped talking to the other two since they were only after my solutions to assignments. 

I’m on my final year now and this is my last chance to form a meaningful relationship with other students, I’ve signed up to two clubs, an art club and a photography club, the art club held a meet and greet the other day, I actually was social this time and managed to speak to several people. 
The next meet-up will happen next week, I have to make sure I don’t waste my time so I can form at least one good friendship before the end of my course. I feel like this time will be different. 

Hopefully this 4 year long period of loneliness will finally come to an end."
lonely,Most people only want to associate with those they deem socially equal or superior on the class scale,Most people only want to associate with those they deem socially equal or superior on the class scale - Obviously there are outliers who are genuinely nice people but they are few. The vast majority of people operate on a sort of class/caste system pyramid where they see others are either superior or inferior. The whole goal of their life is to increase their standing on the pyramid by any means since the rewards are much higher the higher you go. As such the don't want to associate or be seen with low caste people since it lowers their value by proxy.

lonely,My scars have already ruined every relationship I’ll ever have,"My scars have already ruined every relationship I’ll ever have - Don’t even know why I’m thinking about this. I don’t even want a girlfriend. I already know that. I only like the *idea* of having one, not the real thing. So I don’t know why this is bothering me right now, but it is. I’m covered in self-harm scars. They’re all up my right arm, across my chest and stomach, my thigh, even up and down my back. There’s no angle you could look at me from and not see a scar. 

I’ve heard all the “they’re not ugly” and the “they’re part of who you are” and “if you meet the right person, they won’t judge you over them”, but honestly I think it’s bullshit. At least partially. Because people might try to believe that stuff on the surface, that’s what they might think consciously when they see them, but there’s a subconscious reaction that I think is impossible to avoid. 

Now I’m not the type of person who normally gives two shits what other people think of me. Live my life alone, so people mean next to nothing to me in general. But one thing I really hate I when I feel like people see me as weak. And that’s why my scars frustrate me so much, how to hell could I ever let anyone see them and not have them think of me as weak on some level after that? I don’t think they could help it, subconsciously, if they saw that I’ve self-harmed before and saw how much, it’s kinda unavoidable to see that person as vulnerable, fragile, weaker than they were before. I don’t think you can avoid seeing someone differently after seeing that. 

You hear it in people’s reactions all the time, it’s always something like “I’m sorry”, it’s sympathy. I don’t want it, don’t have any use for sympathy. Don’t want someone to feel “sorry” for me. But I can’t avoid that reaction. Even if they say nothing, I’ve seen it in their eyes before, back when I still forced myself to be around people and had casual encounters. I saw them look and there’s always this same reaction, even if they say nothing about it. It makes me wanna call the whole thing off and kick them outta my fucking house. I hate it.

I’ve never experienced it in an actual relationship before, but I don’t think I ever could anyway. Like I said at the start, I don’t even want one, so I don’t know why I’m caught thinking about this but I am. It just makes me so fucking angry that I’m stuck with these for the rest of my life, that my skin will never be smooth ever again, that even if I somehow found a way to tolerate people and maybe actually wanted a girlfriend, that I couldn’t have one now because I already know what she’ll think of me when she sees the scars."

lonely,I have a few people in my life but still find loneliness,"I have a few people in my life but still find loneliness - That whole “I’m surrounded by people &amp; still feel lonely” trope is very much real. Granted I’m not SURROUNDED, I’d lose my mind if I were, but I do have some friends at work and across the world, even. All of them are people that I cherish.

So… why is it that I still feel so incredibly alone? These friends, as great as they are, I’m not particularly close with 95% of them. I can only show more of myself to one or two, the rest get a dulled down “safe” version of me.

I’m so tired of sorting through all the meh friends… I just want one person who I feel I can be genuinely close with, someone I don’t have to hide from, but that all seems impossible for me. All these people in shows finding their perfect loves, my friend talking to me about her experiences with her SO &amp; how happy she is… I’m ecstatic for her, but I just makes me wonder how she’s able to find people she can be genuinely happy with. She’s bubbly as is, so that might be why though lol.

I’m not going to give up, but I’ll be honest, it just doesn’t seem very possible for me. At least I have people of some variety instead of absolutely nobody. ✨Positives.✨

As men we are told to not really have emotions and to hide them. Most men never get hugs from people outside their family. Whether or not a guy tells you or not we all want hugs. Sometimes we just want to break down crying the the arms of a friend but are told not to. So we bottle it up and sometimes those bottles up emotions turn violent. I guarantee you that if any of the mass shooters in schools were given hugs and asked how they were doing they wouldn’t have done it. Bottling up emotions is unhealthy but unfortunately most men do it. We all look fine on the outside but on the inside a storm is going on. Sometimes we just need the warmth of a caring person to feel better. So next time you your guy friend give him a hug. They may act like they don’t want it but just keep holding on."

So you know how your mental and emotional well-being impacts your health? I'm not talking about feeling sad for a few weeks, that will not noticeably impact your health in the long run, but humans are social creatures and we all have minimum social requirements to feel ""healthy"", even if they vary individual to individual (e.g. extroverts vs introverts). 

Now take me: I have fallen so far past my minimum threshold that I'm at the bottom of the pit. I have been starved of my minimum social requirements for over five years now. It's been that long since I've had a friend that I trusted or felt close to. I'm not clinically depressed, and I do what I can to enjoy and take pleasure in things that's in my power (i.e. hobbies, volunteering, pets), but my dominant and consistent emotion throughout these past five years is sadness. I've coped but the lack of social bonds for this long is absolutely impacting my health. It's hard to explain, I'm not spiritual or anything, but I can just sense that this persistent sadness is absolutely having repercussions on my lifespan. I'm of average health now, physically mobile and active, but in the future? Perhaps nearer future than I realize? Who knows.

I'm not talking about self-harm, I would never do that to my parents. But... I don't know. Will to live is somewhat low. It's hard to imaging myself fighting for survival against an illness or an injury when I'm in old age, unless I'm saved through the power of friendship. I literally feel like I need medicine but no one can give it to me. I know what I need, but for whatever reason I'm incapable of turning acquaintanceships into true friendships. I have friends who I can hang out with occasionally but the bond is superficial despite what I'd like, or need it to be. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but it's a problem. When I was younger I was the type to just have one good friend at a time, and usually they ""pursued"" me. I've never been able to make a strong friendship with people on my own. 

Basically I can't treat this on my own, I need someone to really like me, and I feel like I'm ""handling"" it by slowly dying LOL anyone else?"

lonely,Desperate,Desperate - Forgave my friend for doing some terrible things to me only because she’s all I have. I’m still so angry at her and want to yell at her and never see her again but I don’t wanna crushed under loneliness again. Ig time will tell if this was a bad call or not.
lonely,I’ve been trying to make an effort.. but nothing works.,"I’ve been trying to make an effort.. but nothing works. - I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I had this theory that loneliness was just something I was always going to have to deal with and with what’s been happening lately, I’m starting to trust my theory. I’m a lonely person. I’m sure that obvious since I’m here often. Anyway.. I’ve been trying (sorta) to be more social so I can be around others and maybe make friends, but nothing works. Let me explain what I’ve tried…

1. Getting a job

I planned on getting one anyway so I can make some money, but my therapist said it would be good for me so I could be around others and maybe make friends. It’s been months and I’m still not working yet. The HR team hasn’t gotten back to me yet and I’m told that they’re under staffed (which I understood) but that completely erased my dreams of possibly socializing and being around the same faces everyday.

2. Talking to people here

Every time I get a message, it’s from someone who stops replying to me after 2-3 days (btw no one is obligated to reply to me I’m just expressing how I feel) or it’s a guy who only cares about 18+ conversations which makes me uncomfortable and they can’t take the hint. I come here to express wanting someone to talk to. A friend. Getting to know each other.. but that rarely works out.. so that isn’t an option. 

3. Joining groupchats with people who have similar interests as me

The groupchats always die and I always end up being the oldest there. As a 22 year old, I can’t relate to a 16 year old and there are even moments where I become insecure about my age. People my age don’t seem interested I guess. 

4. Taking a class on campus

Did nothing for me. No one even sits beside me in class. I would’ve been alone if it weren’t for the person who sat across from me. But I don’t really see her much. Seems like my other classmates are already in their own little friend groups and then there’s me. My social anxiety messes with my mind so I couldn’t even imagine myself trying to be apart of their friend groups. A lot of them seem like first year college students and again, there’s me…

5. Posting on so social media 

I have fan pages only and no one pays attention to me. They look at my posts and move on. Sometimes I try to be interactive and ask questions and people just ignore me. There’s no point of me creating a social media page where I post my face because I don’t have any friends and I’ve always been ignored. People with the same interests as me don’t even wanna interact with me (im a kpop fan btw)

Nothing works out for me ever. I keep coming to the conclusion that I will never have friends or a significant other.

It sucks that a pet could help with my loneliness a bit but no one in my family will let me, a 22 year old woman, have one. Clearly they don’t take the pain of loneliness seriously or understand how hard it is to deal with it everyday.

I just got finished crying over this off and on. All I’ll ever have is music and my imagination."

lonely,I feel so emotionally numb and I've ruined my friendship with the best friend I had,"I feel so emotionally numb and I've ruined my friendship with the best friend I had - I guess this is a bit of a vent, but any advice to my situation is welcome.

I've felt emotionally numb for really long. I'm not sure why but I'd guess it's because of loneliness, but I don't even feel sad about being lonely anymore, just numb and empty. Being almost all alone in life makes everything feel so meaningless.

My loneliness is not one of craving a romantic partner, I've never been much interested in such and I feel I'm odd for being that way. I value close and meaningful platonic relationships (emphasizing on the word platonic, I'm not saying that romantic relationships can't be that way) and I just wish I had one real close friend. 

I have a few online friends I really care about and can talk freely with. But as much as I love them it's different from irl friends, especially as I don't feel comfortable showing myself nor voice chatting with them so there's a lot we don't know about each other.

However, I've been friends with one of these friends for around 5 years now and we've actually met irl a few times. We knew each other quite well and we were extremely close. They really were my best friend. In the passing year though we've drifted apart. It was my fault because I didn't appreciate them enough. We talked less and less while I was engrossed in chatting with someone else (completely online friend) to who our friendship ended up meaning nothing. 

Now they have other very close irl friends and I have a hard time keeping up with what's going on in their life anymore. They don't want to talk to me about any heavier things that are in their mind either. I ruined our friendship and I don't think I can ever get back the great relationship we had.

I'm not sure if anyone will, but thanks to anyone who read this far. I appreciate that so much, random stranger. Also, English isn't my first language so I hope it wasn't too bad."
lonely,So hear me out,So hear me out - Since this is a place for lonely people was wondering if anyone else felt like they are in the faze of hitting lonely levels you haven't hit before. I mean it's not a problem for me it's just super weird. Once you get use to the sadness and hopelessness you sorta accept that feeling. After a while as it gets worse you can literally feel more lonely even tho  you haven't done anything special to reacive that feeling. Does that mean that there are like lonely levels? How low can you go?

But coming home in the evenings and having thousands of things/people to talk about to absolutely nothing but a lowly lit empty one room/bath house. I'm not typically invited to do anything after work or on the weekends. I just wind up cleaning house or lazing about.

I only had a relationship when I was in high school but im so young that time. After that I never had a relationship. Now im 21 (M), I still dont have a girlfriend. Its not like im shy or what. But I just dont wanna force it. My friend suggested a dating site one time and I tried. But it doesnt feel so natural. I felt desperate using that.

But sometimes I cant help it but to feel lonely. I have friends (very few like you can count it by fingers). But they are busy in their life and some of my friends are not really my friends.I am also busy too so I understand some of them and this pandemic makes me feel really lonely. I got so tired lately because of schoolworks, internship and personal problems. 

But everytime I got tired, I feel like I have no one to really talk about my feelings, my failures, my achievements or how my day went through. I remember when I successfully finished my internship, I have no one to celebrate to.

I just realized that its painful to have no one to talk about your own problems but its more painful to have no one to share your achievements.

I cant help it but I feel like I want to be loved even though that would make me look so dependent person. I want someone who will listen to me and someone who I will listen to it whole heartedly even. I want someone who gives me a reason to wake up everyday full of hope."
lonely,I just had an apifiny,"I just had an apifiny - This is not ment to be preachy. I am in the same boat only worse because what I want to do can be viewed as socially unacceptable before all the facts are available.  None the less , here is my thought.  
I am fortunate to be born when I was. In my mind it was a blessing.  I learned later in life, we were poor but comfortable and felt loved which is very important.  
We did not have a lot that kept us home so I have always been out in public because I had to be in order to enjoy life. It forced me to come in contact with many people each day. It was just a fact of life. In that way, just by shear numbers,  you came across people and you could not help but to make friends. 
I am now lonely like the rest of you here because of my depression because of changes in my family life and covid. 
Video games, reality TV,  social media and working from home are most of the cause of your loneliness. It is not that these things are bad, but they promote not being physically around others.  They give the feeling of interaction but deprive us of physically interacting.  Jmho. 
The cure for this. Go for a walk each day at the mall each day? Go to the library or book store once a week? Join a book club  or some other club? Take a night class? Donate time to charity? Food bank ? Homeless shelter? You get the idea.  Sitting at home and  complaining about it here is not going to make it better.  A dream come true for me is two Years from now would be for the only ones on this sub is for people on this sub helping new people that would wander into it. My depression started 2 years ago and I have had 3 panic attacks.  I have never had these problems in my life. Circumstances in my 65yo life has caused them and increased them by the way I went about correcting it. 
The good news is I finally achieved my goal. I am going on a 6 week adventure to Malaysia and the Philippines to be with friends I have made on the internet.  It sounds extreme but the heart wants what it wants. 
In summation life is a beautiful gift.  We are given unlimited choices each day how we use this gift. If we continually make the wrong choices depression sets in and it is hell getting that pest off. We can all do it. 
One more note. My wife is totally bedridden with a spinal cord tumor and the results of encephalitis.  She is fed by a feeding tube and pees with a urinary catheter.  I am not looking for sympathy.  I am going to tell you that she is happier than all of us on this sub because she sees her granddaughter each day and eats and plays with her from her bed. She has only complained once about her plight and that was thirty years ago when it first started and she did not know what she was dealing with. 
If anyone thinks that their loneliness can not be fixed,  DM me and I will be glad to help you. It would be my pleasure and is part of my therapy."

lonely,So apparently this is what's been missing from my life,"So apparently this is what's been missing from my life - I recently read [this](https://www.psypost.org/2021/10/psychologists-identify-shared-reality-as-a-key-component-of-close-relationships-61969) article about a study in which psychologists found that a sense of ""shared reality"" is a defining feature of close relationships. This makes a lot of sense. When you feel like other people have similar perspectives, values and opinions as you, it makes it easier for you to bond with them.

After reading that, I felt a bit hopeless for a brief moment. I feel like I usually have a different outlook on life as other people and I know that's one of the reasons why I can't connect with most people. But I don't want to go through the rest of my life feeling like I have no one that shares my kind of reality, it's so lonely and miserable. I want to to be true to myself and not pretend to be someone I'm not for the sake of other people but at the same time I'm very socially anxious so I tend to prioritize other people's feelings above mine. So I basically created this barrier between myself and the rest of the world because I'm so afraid of judgement and rejection that it seems to be the only way I can cope. The problem is that I'll never find people who share my reality as long as I keep that wall up.

I’ve just had a chat with my close friend about our relationship and we discussed moving forward to something more… romantic I guess. She opens up to me and tells me she has huge trust issues, and that she literally doesn’t feel happiness, she can’t be with someone, but apparently I’m at the top of her “ladder”. We had our differences in past, but I’ve always tried helping her get out of sticky situations like the one she’s currently in, I’ve gotten out of rut myself, so I try helping others who don’t want to or can’t pay for therapy, but that’s besides the point. This time, she keeps telling me to leave her be, she says that she’s not worth any help and that I should just find someone else because she’s gonna drag me down with her. 
A part of me doesn’t want to give up on her, I don’t even care about a romantic relationship at this point, I just want to see her strive. 
What do I do at this point?"

lonely,i’m tired,"i’m tired - I’m 19(F) and my 20th birthday is this Friday. I’m alone in a city, no friends or family, and I’ve been waking up each morning this week reminded of that. 

I did alright the first time I was here, made friends, had an active social life and was genuinely enjoying myself. It was still hard sometimes, of course, but I never stayed in my room for weeks at a time. Sometime during May when the whole Covid thing kicked up, my parents wanted me back because they were really worried, so I moved back to my parents place. 

I always felt like an outsider in my hometown, like I would get penalized for trying to make friends because everyone knew everyone already, so it was really lonely while I was back. I think quarantine fucked me up, too, because now I’m terrified of holding actual conversations with people and I get tired so, so easy. 

When I moved back to this city, the friendships I’d made had withered to nothing since I didn’t keep up communication. I have roommates, three of them, but it’s so awkward because none of us talk with each other. It’s so quiet and I feel like I’ve just been wasting away, doing nothing at all and I go days without even leaving the dorm. I want to talk with people so desperately, make new friends, enjoy myself and my youth but I just ,, can’t. Talking with people is so hard and I’m so scared, all the time. I miss the me that I used to be :(

sorry for the long post !!"

lonely,I am not okay,"I am not okay - When you see from the surface my life might seem perfect

A high degree a supposedly prestigious research position
Married to the person who dated me since college

But just scratch the surface and you can see the wounds the darkness the depression.

My friends are no longer in vicinity they stay far with their worlds their time lines separated again by continents and cities. The truth is no one knows and will know that beneath my smiling face lies these ocean of tears.

How is it that I sense people's agonies mirth but they can't sense mine!

I met someone a few months ago and immediately the way my damaged heart is spiralled down quickly into another dark abyss.. I keep dreaming having illusions about this person.. My heart fell again..

Sometimes I am too happy to be on my own to be with my silence at other times I wish... Someone would want to have a chat with me maybe share a cup of coffee.

Then again there is no one.

There I wallow again in self hatred and self love simultaneously... Fooling the world telling them all is well..

Years ago I saw someone take their life and I know that's selfish so I won't go that route but nevertheless I keep imagining this life to be over the only thing holding me back my mother.. An innocent soul bashed so much by life yet standing strong..


Here again I put my dark thoughts under the pillow wake up put on that smile and go about my day."

I do have about two to three friends, but they never tend to check up on me at all; sometimes I wonder if they're even real friends of mine.

lonely,Not sure I know what love is,"Not sure I know what love is - I've ""been"" with a hand full of women over the years (sex or making out or both, etc), but the only time I experienced "" love"" was my first relationship and only real relationship in highschool that was a few months.

I was very insecure and lonely at the time, and I think that influenced my feelings. I think those were feelings of attachment combined with lust more than anything. I remember she wanted call things off and I believed I was going to die of a heart attack.

If she had emotions for me, I believe that is the only female before or since that felt that way.

Yes, I have been with other women casually, but I haven't developed feelings for any of them and I think the reverse is true... 

I don't even know if I want a relationship or not. I have no idea how I really feel about anything.

A lot of times, I question whether love really exists or it's all just transactional. Even I'm guilty of this.

lonely,Catfished,"Catfished - Sorry for the incoming rant. 

Trans Woman / 38 for background. 

So I was catfished over the weekend. GORGEOUS guy, or so I thought. Long story short, ended up finding out after a night of sexting. That's on me. 

What bugs me the most out of all this is the guy in question defended himself when I called him out by saying, ""sorry I just really have a thing for trans women"" so literally all he did was reaffirm my belief that I'm nothing more than a fetish fulfilment device. I don't have feelings in other's eyes. I'm little more than a walking Fleshlight. Honestly. I've come to accept that part of it over the years. It's sad, but that's reality in small-town US. 

The part that I simply can't get over is how damn stupid I was. Like. This guy is a legit high 9, and I feel like I'm a -7. Logically, why on earth would a stupid hot person want to be with an overweight trans woman in an area where everyone will judge you. I can get a troglodyte 9 beers in to give me a second look when they find out I'm trans...I fee so fucking stupid for ever thinking a person like this would ever be interested.

Maybe it's jealously, there's a certain part of it; but I just don't know, I've been quitting and returning to the group chat and to be honest I feel bad the most when I'm at the group chat rather than out of it.

lonely,"[32M] month long vacation, all alone...","[32M] month long vacation, all alone... - Work is something that gives my life at least somewhat sense of regimen and value since it is the only thing I have. We have 30 days of vacation that we can use throughout the year (using all days is mandatory though). This, in combination with my relation to work, means I work without vacation almost for a year and annual dealing with the abundance of vacation had always been a nightmare.

I had a short relationship (9 month long) and actually planned a vacation with someone else for the first time of my life. She broke up with me this May. This was before our vacation so I promptly cancelled all vacation plans.

My mental health deteriorated to the point I became more easily irritated, gloomy and outright hostile towards colleagues in some cases. It was about time my boss noticed it. We had a talk about this and she sent me on month long vacation.

Today it marks 3rd week of being stuck alone between four walls, mindless internet browsing and talking only to the Vietnamese cashier at grocery store. The only semblance of regimen are daily showers and work out days (outdoors cardio and weightlifting at home gym) but I'm slowly losing track of what day is today...

I tried reaching out to the few people I consider friends. The most positive answer I've got was about them being busy right now but reassuring me they'll get back to me when they have time. Others simply didn't bother to answer. I'm aware about the possibility they're just really so busy they simply forgot but there's also a chance of them not just wanting to go out and left this open because that's easier to do than outright rejection... It's been a week since I asked last one...

I thoroughly cleaned my apartment. Learned few new recipes. Pushed through the procrastionation and finally finished one personal project of mine, progressed at weightlifing... This vacation was supposed to get my mind clear but I feel as if this effect is rather opposite...

I feel as if the slippery slope got more steep..."

I however am not that type of person. 
when I am replying to her I constantly have to ""dress myself up"" (not literally) just to take a photo of myself, and then slump back into normal position. 
I met her on an app that is basically tinder but for minors, one where you ""meet friends"". when I texted her she said she needed friends but I'm tryna become more than that.
constantly I am trying to convince myself that she added me because she likes me. however I am so deprived of affection that I can't possibly see anyone going out of their way to make me their significant other. so i must be someone she wanted to know as a friend... right?
my head is spinning and I feel like I need to do something about this but I also don't know what the fuck I should do.
only sometimes does she quickly respond to my messages. Im growing impatient. does she like me or is it the same as always.
I am convinced that I none can be attracted to me and therefore no one who texts me can possibly be doing it to ""woo"" me. 
I hate this. I hate how my face looks. I am unhappy with myself and i am unhappy that I don't like it that I am telling all of you about this. I want to punch holes in my walls. I'm driving myself insane and I need to stop."

I’ll try to make this as short and straight to the point as I can. I’ve been with my “girlfriend” for about 5 years now and the past 2-3 of them I’ve been miserable. By miserable, I mean there is a stop sign in every direction I turn. She’s completely erased all of the friends I had because of her jealousy and every time I try to leave her, she draws me back in with her threats and manipulation. It’s a nightmare I feel like I’ll never awake from and almost as if I’m lost with no way out. I also blame myself at times because I let her do it.. let her walk all over me and take advantage over the years. My entire family can see right through her and they know what kind of person she is. I’m an amazing person and what I mean by that is I’d die for the people I care about. Seeking a true friendship, I would like to find someone who can help me out and pull me out of this. Not only advice but someone who is patient and will stick by my side through the good and bad. I guess you could say I’m sending an application over reddit for friends which may sound desperate but because of her, I feel like I can’t make friends around my area.

Maybe that's why I truly never believed in myself. He was the one saying it out loud so the world can judge me and cast me out. I still loved him. But he Betrayed me. This I will not let go. Not to long ago I wanted to rest💀. And I told him in conference. I know he told this lame. How do I know that. Because he used a word that I used when giving him my reasons. This lame asked me, why do I look scared? Maybe I should have socked him in the mouth, we would have ran like last time he had it coming.(I want to do more than hit him). But he's beneath me. In every sense of the word. Sure he may have $, but what he will never have is ❤️. So for my relative to do that, betray that bond between brothers. I won't forgive that. Never. Because in that heat of passion, I lashed out to my best friend. She took Evey single punch I throw at her. What I mean is we we're on the phone talking, she picked up every single call and replied every text because she know I need someone there listening to my pain. She absorbed all my rage . She didn't deserve any of it. Everyone in my life who has ever said they got me, ""got me"". But she is the only one who has given me real love. Never lied to me. Been there the best she could. I feel horrible about it. She's my sister. That night the only thing that gave me comfort was when I could hear her little one in the background and she's in mommy mode.

I feel so alone. Every day when I wake up, I can't wait to go back to bed and hide away in my room with the lights off, curled up under my sheets.

#1 Ask questions:- all u Have to do is ask questions, if u ask questions ur in the lead of the conversation....so if u think that the conversation is going dry ask some unexpected question now the question should be related to something u both can talk about. For example let's say anime....u both like anime so u would go ""which is ur fav"" or ""which one have u seen Latest""?? Then on the based on answer like lets say the person says a anime u know about....then u can talk about it like what they like in that or when have they seen it, fav character and all. 
And if they some anime u haven't seen then u have two choices.....u can go like ""ohh what's that anime about""?? Or the other thing u can do is say them ur fav and u can talk talk about ur fav.....if both of u have seen it. 

A conversation is the on the spot thing haha. But hope this helps the ones who struggle with the conversation.

Soon if u guys like it I would share my views on how to carry a conversation when u don't have anything in common.

Thanks for reading I hope this helps Someone.....u can comment ur thoughts.... constructive criticism is welcomed.

Also have a great day and life ☺️!!"

The days are quiet, too quiet and when you hear nothing but your own voice most of the time it begins to drive you insane.

I don't see a therapist and I don't open up to really anyone anymore, I've tried journaling but that's just another thing I fail to keep up with so creating this blog was a last resort.

lonely,"Accepting the fact that I can't or shouldn't have a relationship, at least not at this point in my life","Accepting the fact that I can't or shouldn't have a relationship, at least not at this point in my life - I (M18) feel like I would really like to have a girlfriend, but I need to accept the fact that it's not gonna happen anytime soon at best. 

I don't have even close to the confidence in myself to talk to a girl or convince myself I'd ever have a chance with them. Even if I could talk to a girl, I'd never be able to make it work. I think I'm asexual (in my case that means I still have romantic attraction), or if I'm not, I'm at the very least terrified of intimacy and definitely not ready for sex, which I realize is a problem for any prospective relationships.

So for the like, two girls in the world that are compatible with me and just so happen to be asexual as well, I still feel like I would just push her away. I'm so terrified of being ""tied down,"" to the point where even having something as simple as my gym membership stresses me out and makes me feel like I can't leave where I am. So I feel like I would just push away something as important as a girlfriend.

Not only that, but I'm so introverted, I don't think I could handle spending time with someone. When I spend a fair amount of time even with people like my immediate family (I'm lucky to be very close with my family, so at least I'm not alone there), I feel like I absolutely need to be alone for a while because I get drained so quickly. Not only that, but I'm constantly irritable and annoyed at the people I care about, sometimes for no apparent reason. I guess I like to keep people at arm's reach, so I can be with them or push them away whenever I want. It's one of those things where I feel bad about the way I act, even while I'm doing it, but I can't figure out how to be better.

I realize these are negative traits, and if I'm a person who has these negative traits, and is so emotionally unavailable, and who keeps people around only for myself, how could I ever give a girl what she deserves out of a relationship? It would be unfair to be in a relationship with me.

I'm young and haven't even begun to figure myself out fully, so maybe and hopefully these things change, but I also get worried that maybe someday I'll be 40 and still terrified of settling down, terrified of intimacy, and pushing away the people I love."

I’ve been feeling super lonely and I really miss my best friend. Today he texts me and asked if we could talk, I said sure. We talk at first about his moms health (which I care a lot about) but then it drifts into the relationship aspect before. We seem to reminisce a bit about the relationship and I just start bawling. We keep talking about things and I just couldn’t take it anymore. My heart is literally continuously breaking, I cared about him so much and he was my person. I’d do anything for him but when we talked about the relationship it seemed like he’d say “you did x,y and z wrong and you never said sorry” then when I’d go to defend and explain myself it’s “oh I’m not cut out for a relationship or love”.

I miss them a lot. I became co dependant on them and thats my fault. I don't speak to them as often because our schedules don't line up. I don't feel whole anymore all i feel is a void that seems like it'll never close but hopefully it does.

After the happiness is over im thrown back into my boring, lonely, and shitty life. I don’t have and friends really. Not long term anyway. I make temporary friends at places such as the gym or work. But I never hang out with anyone outside those settings. I’m never invited anywhere. Happiness ends in depression for me. For instance when I went to hawaii in the summer of 5th grade I was so happy there but when we came back I cried for 3 days because I was here and not there. I cried during how to train your dragon 2 😂 I just hate it. My life here is sad and repetitive and I hate it. I have adhd and the same routine every day isn’t for me. I cannot stand it at all.

I have now been in college for two months and haven't made any friends, but I don't seem to care enough to try.

I was just asked what fun things I did this weekend, and I said studying and going to review sessions, like I sounded excited about it. To be fair, that is more than I do on a typical weekend. I have always done well in school, but I feel like I invest too much of my time into it. At the same time, I keep doing it because I have nothing else to do that really brings me joy and want to at least be good at something. I have no hobbies, and every time I am doing something that is supposed to be fun, I either stress about it or feel like I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing. All I do is study, watch YouTube, and play the occasional game. I guess I feel satisfied most of the time, but I feel kind of empty, like I have no personality. I can never come up with a fun fact about myself, and I feel like I'm the most generic person out there. My roommate, who is a friend from high school, is the exact opposite of me. He made a friend group within a few days and seems to have so much fun all the time. I hate the fact that I am like this but I seem to be mad that he is having so much fun while I'm just doing nothing. I don't think I'm sad but I feel like I really enjoy something only once in a while just to wait for weeks or months before feeling the same happiness again."

lonely,Can't get over bad customer interaction,"Can't get over bad customer interaction - I work at a grocery store and a customer I was helping copped an attitude with me. I had no idea why she seemed angry with me. But this unpleasant interaction put me in an even shittier headspace than I was before. Having already just recovered from a panic attack an hour before, it made me extremely angry and I stormed into the back warehouse to have a private meltdown. I cannot get it out of my head.

My only guess is she felt I was being ""fake nice"" or sarcastic because I tend to be overly friendly and speak gently when helping customers, but it's entirely genuine. 

A dozen possibilities coursed through my mind. Did I inadvertently insult this person sometime in the past? Did she just dislike me already because of my appearance? Was she just in a bad mood at the time?

As someone who doesn't have any close friends, I look forward to making people's day better by politely helping them find shit in the store. It makes up for my inability to open up to anyone.

TL;DR: I think I made a customer angry and I can't get over it."

Ever since they moved they’ve slowly lost contact with me. They made a lot of new friends there and are always going out to parties and stuff and I’m just at home watching their stories. I don’t blame them for losing contact because people get busy but it sure does hurt. I was trying to sort of get over it until I came across a group album and all the memories kicked back in. I love seeing them make new friends and find love interests because I still want the good for them but it hurts that we went from talking everyday to not talking at all. They weren’t the best friend group to me but I still miss being their friend. Now I just always feel alone and even when I accomplish something I have no one to tell.

I'm never really sure how I feel about anything, and I'm not sure if that's because I don't care or if it's because I think human beings use certainty more to navigate themselves emotionally than to actually identify truth so I just kind of gave up on certainty, or if it's because I'm just neurotic my dudes.

Everyone is always like hang with friends like no I want a relationship i could care less about ""friends"""
lonely,37 Y/O Lonely with a thousand friends,"37 Y/O Lonely with a thousand friends - I go through life everyday wearing different masks, but feel no one knows the true me.  I’m decent looking, have lots of friends and I’ve been in a relationship for 17 years.  My relationship is with a women who I fear doesn’t even know me and with whom I don’t have a true deep connection with.  My friends are great, but again, I feel none know the real me and I don’t feel comfortable enough with any to truly be myself.  I’m very sexual and yearn for someone who shares the same level of desire for human contact and closeness.  I wish I had someone to just lay with naked, feel connected to and just fuck until we’re so tired we just fall asleep inside each other.  I know there’s people like me out there, I just never found them and settled for companionship instead of love.  Thanks for the vent."
lonely,Fuck,"Fuck - I feel very lonely, very often. I have my daughter, and she’s an incredible blessing, but it’s not her responsibility to fill every hole. I have a couple of the guys I’m still close with from school, and I appreciate those connections, but we barely speak to each other. At the same time, I feel like I’m capable of changing that, but for some reason I don’t. Not because I’m refusing, I’m cursed to forget to. I always forget to take up offers or fully extend mine. A lot of times I feel like I haven’t met anyone like me, like my personality, but that just makes me feel conceded or arrogant, which is hard to determine for me at times. I capable of so much selfishness and isolation, and I hate it. Sometimes I hate so much about me.

I love you so much Athena"

lonely,Feel Disconnected from the World,"Feel Disconnected from the World - Feel so lost and disconnected from everyone on this planet. Not sure what to do about it. Been to therapy, diagnosed as Asperger's. Fought ruthlessly for years, silenty battling all of the horrid things that I think to keep my head on straight.

It might sound selfish, perhaps even morally wrong, but sometimes I wish there was a ""do x get x"" when it comes to people. A guaranteed path to get the desired relationship I want from others. All I want is to find someone I can love and be intimate with. Someone I could share this pain with, and for someone I could do the same in return.

But that's not how the world works. I have zero control over others. Most people (seemingly) don't value the same qualities I do. People are loud and chaotic, I am quiet and peaceful. Top it off with me possibly having warped social expectations due to my unique life experiences, and it just spells disaster. Therefore (at least I think therefore) I feel disconnected. Am I the cause? To some extent, probably."
lonely,Ghosted,Ghosted - I had a tight group of friends were we lived in a homeless shelter together we stuck by each other through it all and now it’s not like we know each other anymore. They were the only friends I had and I’m so lost. I reach out to them and they don’t respond or we make plans and they fall through. It’s normal not to see each other due to jobs and us moving out but I really needed them I felt normal around them. We all are doing better but I don’t think I can get through this life without them without people to call family. I thought I had found a family I guess I was wrong and that hurts the most.
lonely,I Think Ive Been Lied To,"I Think Ive Been Lied To - Okay so when I was younger I watched a lot of rom-coms and TV (). If you cant see where this is going then let me explain it to you...So as I grew older I always believed in ""the one"" and still do to some extent and that they were just around the corner and all I had to do was wait and thus my life would truly begin but as I got older and older they never came or if they did I'd subconsciously ruin it and thus here I am panicking silently as I distance myself from others to prevent a repeat of ""last time"" and yet this desire to seek out ""the one"" haunts me nearly forcing me to seek out a partner. Big Sad

lonely,Update,"Update - So just have spoken to my doctor, she seems to think I either have borderline personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder. She’s referred me to a psychiatrist for an assessment and diagnosis. It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Maybe finally there is a reason for my actions and I’m not going insane. Hopefully I can get the help I need finally."
lonely,Everyone knows me yet I have no friends,"Everyone knows me yet I have no friends - I work in retail. I’m always chatting with customers and making jokes and having conversations. It’s as if everybody knows me yet I have no friends. No one to talk to on a personal level. No one to hang out with. People smile and wave. People recognize me outside of work. They say “oh you’re so on so that works at that place.” Nothing ever leads to conversations. It’s just greetings in passing.

They all know me yet I have no friends. I wouldn’t dare ask them to add me on social media. I also fear that if things go south, friendship wise or anything else, they associate me with my job.

So many people seem to know me but I’m still lonely. It’s frustrating."
lonely,I don’t know who I am,"I don’t know who I am - I’m 17 years old and I graduated high school a few months back with big plans to become a famous writer.

I didn't give it my all or stick to my plan to work on my craft over summer, allowing depression and fear to control me. sat back a few days ago to really evaluate my goals and realized most of them: (money, fame, a nice body) were all just things I believed would make me worthy of the love/ respect of others and myself. I wanted to use the talent I have as a way to gain approval and acceptance.

Now I realize don't know what I want, not really. I'm 18 next month and I'm scared"

I’m trying desperately to escape what consumes me, but where do I even begin to fight when I can’t see what it is that I’m fighting. 

I’m afraid of being alone, even though it’s all I’ve ever known. Maybe tomorrow things will be different. I tell myself that everyday."

She hasn’t reached out in weeks besides asking us children’s opinion on clothes in the group chat. It’s not that she doesn’t love me. She just hates talking to people I guess and never answers my calls.

My grandparents just called and we talked for a bit which was sweet. 

I’ve received texts and a birthday Venmo from my dad. 

Other than that, I’ve just been working from home all day. I’m working overtime right now because I have nothing else to do. No plans. I did have a party with sisters and a few friends on Saturday night so it’s not like I haven’t celebrated my birthday. But this is the second year in a row that I’ve sat at home alone on my birthday. It feels weird to reach out to someone and ask them to go to dinner with me. Whatever. I don’t seem to enjoy most of my birthdays anyway. Maybe I’ll watch Lost and eat Oreos lol."

lonely,Pushing away people,"Pushing away people - I feel very lonely, hardly have anyone to talk to and I hate it but when someone reaches out to me I have a hard time even replying and after few messages I become drained and I don’t answer anymore. Or when someone wants to hang out I always make some excuse not to come because I want to be alone. I hate socializing, people drain me but at the same time I hate being alone. Does anyone understand or feel the same? 
How can this possibly make sense?"
lonely,I Can’t Get Close With Anyone Anymore…,"I Can’t Get Close With Anyone Anymore… - I’ve had people come and go in my life so much in the past two years that I feel completely expendable. Various people (mainly my first serious relationship) have conditioned me to feel like any sort of true vulnerability will just push people away. The nail in the coffin was my brother’s recent suicide. I can’t explain it…but since then, it feels like there’s a wall between me and everyone else in my life. I have no energy to talk to any of my friends on a regular basis. I’m stretched too thin trying to foster deeper connections at college all while hiding the fact that I’m dealing with grief because, like I said people have made me feel like any sign of vulnerability (crying, opening up about struggles, etc.) will push people away. So, I no longer feel like my authentic self anywhere. I hang out with people at school passively, they only know me surface level. I don’t have anyone I feel like I can count on or be real with. I do know some would be there for me but at the very core I feel like I just don’t think they understand what I’m going through because I really don’t even know what it is…I feel like it’s all my fault that I feel this alone and crying only gives me temporary relief from the existential dread of everything. I’m forcing myself to go to school because I fear I’ll regret it if I don’t get a degree. But right now, every second feels worse. I already took a medical leave of absence for my mental health once and it was hard enough then to go back. I fear doing it a second time will lead me to just drop out…But I don’t even really know the point is anymore I feel tired lost and alone and it feels like no one understands. Whatever therapy I have leads me to think it’s my fault that I am this way as I struggle to do the simple tasks they ask of me so right now, everything just feels…empty."

lonely,23 M New York looking to connect with someone for a genuine friendship,"23 M New York looking to connect with someone for a genuine friendship - To be clear from the start, this may be dumb and most likely won’t find what I am looking for but what’s the worse that can happen? I’ll try to make this as short and straight to the point as I can. I’ve been with my “girlfriend” for about 5 years now and the past 2-3 of them I’ve been miserable. By miserable, I mean there is a stop sign in every direction I turn. She’s completely erased all of the friends I had because of her jealousy and every time I try to leave her, she draws me back in with her threats and manipulation. It’s a nightmare I feel like I’ll never awake from and almost as if I’m lost with no way out. I also blame myself at times because I let her do it.. let her walk all over me and take advantage over the years. My entire family can see right through her and they know what kind of person she is. I’m an amazing person and what I mean by that is I’d die for the people I care about. Seeking a true friendship, I would like to find someone who can help me out and pull me out of this. Not only advice but someone who is patient and will stick by my side through the good and bad. I guess you could say I’m sending an application over reddit for friends which may sound desperate but because of her, I feel like I can’t make friends around my area. Take my hand, be that person and I’ll show you what I can do. I pray that someone/something picks me up.. let’s create this new beginning. Preferably looking for people around New York."
lonely,don’t know how to be a person(rant),"don’t know how to be a person(rant) - Even before covid i lost all my friends because i slowly realized i was a “back burner friend” and i was the only friend that really needed to pay for gas or booze or weed a lot of the times. 
i am a people pleaser i will admit that, i feel like such a bad person when i’m an innocence or i have to say no. 
when i started standing up for myself and asking them to pay for thing once in awhile, i was accused of using my friends so i just gave up trying on each of them separately for different reasons. 
months later i gave them all second chances due to my boyfriends concern of my lack of friends, but none of them understood what i felt and how they hurt me so i didn’t get any apologies. they all stayed cold and acted the same as before so naturally i apologized for being the way i am and went on my way to never speak to them again. 
three almost four years later, i still live in my small town of less than 800 people, most of my peers hold grudges for some dumb highschool bs, or they don’t speak to me out of respect to my old friends. 
its quite lonely i will admit, and winter is coming so it’s only going to get worse. i do not know how to make friends because the friends i had were from elementary and i was always taught don’t speak unless spoken to. i feel very much like a burden even posting this long ass message, most people will scroll past but i really appreciate if you read all the way through. i have a lot of anxiety as well and abandonment issues on top of oversharing. i don’t know what else to write but i thank you for reading if you did."

lonely,I went to the cinema,"I went to the cinema - I went by myself, I made small talk with a couple in the lift. A family of 3 had booked seats right next to me, I was a little late and had to squeeze past them to get to my seat. My anxiety kicked in for a second, but I made a joke about it, and we shared a laugh. For that short while I didn't feel alone. A couple of hours just in the company of others felt good.

I know that in a few years my daughter will have her own life, she'll be off to college and I'll be completely and utterly alone again. These little moments interacting with strangers, will only become more precious to me.

I don't really know how to be friends, I just don't understand how it works I guess. I pick the wrong people, people who aren't interested in me or how I am. Who never make first contact and who leave me on read for months at a time until they need something. 

I'm not so scared now, I'm just going to go out there, smile and be friendly, and appreciate those small moments, and definitely go to the cinema more. It wasn't bad or embarrassing like I thought it would be."

lonely,You know it's bad when you bring back imaginary friends.,"You know it's bad when you bring back imaginary friends. - I've been talking to my imaginary friends and characters again for a while now. All with a purpose. Some to comfort me, some to call me out on my bullshit some to simply insult me. I'm not even sure these are imaginary friends or something different. Regardless, they're not-real-people that I talk to. 

That on it's own seems pretty bad but I took it a step further and ""made"" myself an imaginary boyfriend. I've heard of that before tho from other people, so maybe that's not that weird.
I apparently hate myself so much that I can't even let myself have that because I also made him break up with me. I got into fights with my imaginary boyfriend until we broke up. Now that's a clickbait title right there. Even though it's not real, it still made me sad. Not sure if a real breakup would make me sadder, considering I've never had a boyfriend before but I imagine it's not very nice.

Now all my other imaginary friends are comforting me and they're there for me.

I'm married, still don't know why I said yes to getting married. Feels like I'm not made up for this kind of thing. Too scared to end the marriage cause I know it'll break my mother's heart. I now know why married men choose to rather end their lives than face the ordeal, but I want to live and do things. Anyway, so I finished work, cam out for a walk and grabbed a smoke. It didn't felt good, in fact it didn't feel anything, I think why I did it because that something I wanted to do. Came back home and wife questioned if I had been smoking, I said no but this thought creeped inside my head that why should I be answerable for my actions to anyone, and this thought refuses to go away now. I have to get back the next morning and I'm always scared, always worried, always tensed. My wife's a good human being, as good as they come, so I don't for a second say it's her fault, I know the fault is mine but i don't feel like I can live like this."

lonely,Life is just drab and meaningless,"Life is just drab and meaningless - My university finally reopened after the pandemic, and everyone was so confident that university would give me a new breath of life - a place where I could work on myself together with my friends around me. 

Oh, but life had other plans. One person who would sit by me and listen to me has left me. She’s right in college - right there - having fun with her friends while I’m just here, sulking in a corner - wondering what did I ever do wrong to deserve this. 

They say loneliness comes in various types and forms - but I think one of the most complex ones is when you physically have people around you, but you are wallowing in your loneliness. 

I don’t think I deserve happiness. Too many things have shown me that. I have to come to terms with the fact that I’m unloveable. To the fact that I am ugly. To the fact that I’m not a “cool” person whom people want to spend time with. I’m just someone who can be discarded very easily - and replaced even more easily. I don’t contribute to anything in life. 

All I can ever be is a burden to my friends and my family. My arm is filled with scars and I sit on my bed with a knife on the other hand, resisting the urge to slash my wrists with that knife. Idk if there will ever be an end to this. But I have a strong feeling that between me and my mental illnesses, the mental illness would eventually win.

I overthink everything. I can’t keep track of my thoughts or feelings. I am always scared and on edge I feel like I haven’t grown out of that type of fear that kids get that only sleeping with their parents could help but I have no one to turn to. Everywhere I go I have a constant fear and stress of people, I can never relax. Nothing is enjoyable ever I can try and make myself seem like it is but it’s always just me panicking on the inside the whole time I’m doing anything. Whenever I have a moment of happiness in seconds I’m overthinking again. It never stops. I don’t know how to fix this and I can’t keep living like this. People will make fun of me for being quiet or awkward to my face and think it’s not rude. It makes the pit in my stomach and the overthinking worse and I can’t think of any response to say so I’m still quiet and awkward except now I know for sure that they think little of me . I can’t remember ever feeling different from this. 
I have no friends, I used to have 2 from hs but I’ve stopped hanging out with them because they became as scary as everyone else. I’ve never been someone that liked or used social media and now it makes me feel even more disconnected from my old friends and everyone my age. There is no escaping tik tok or Instagram. It’s in everyone’s language and jokes and personality’s and it just adds to my constant stress. I’ve never had a close friend where I’m their person to talk to and they’re mine. My “BFF” in elementary and ms was always super popular and well liked well I was called gay and weird and generally ignored. My friends never helped my with any of this took any interest when I talked. I was always quiet and I can remember hiding  when my mom would have guest over and they would want to  talk to me. I never liked how they talked to me, it’s always so degrading and nowhere close to something I would want to talk about with them. My mom and dad got divorced when I was five cause my dad gambled all our savings away then I had to move with my family cross country and move in with my cousins.(moms side) My dad is an asshole turn the frogs gay Alex Jones trumpie that never made any effort to stay in contact with me and my mom has not formed any relationship with me and I have always had to beg for basic needs. She delt with me by ignoring that nothing was even happening but I knew that my dad had done something so it just left me to think it all over alone. Lonely. I feel so alone, I’m craving comfort and peace of mind but I’m scared I will never be able to get it"
lonely,It hurts being turned away for who you are,"It hurts being turned away for who you are - Im all for preferences and and types they already have in mind.

I feel so empty all the time, I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know what the purpose of this post is, I just need to say something to someone, or just put something out there. Cry for help I guess, but I doubt anyone will see this. I don’t really have much to live for, so if it gets to the point where I don’t want to, I guess this will help explain why. I hate sympathy, it makes me feel pathetic and weak. So I’m damned to suffer in silence, not that I have anyone who would listen anyway."

Everyone else has their own friend circles and then there's just me sitting alone quietly in a corner envying their friendship. The only time anyone ever talked to me was for a) borrowing my notes or b) asking me to turn on the AC in the classroom. No one is interested in talking to me. I pretty much lock myself up in the washrooms during break so that no one can see me alone. I don't even eat my lunch because I have no one to eat it with. I either look at my watch or drink water to make it seem like I am ""busy"" and not lonely.

I’ll try to make this as short and straight to the point as I can. I’ve been with my “girlfriend” for about 5 years now and the past 2-3 of them I’ve been miserable. By miserable, I mean there is a stop sign in every direction I turn. She’s completely erased all of the friends I had because of her jealousy and every time I try to leave her, she draws me back in with her threats and manipulation. It’s a nightmare I feel like I’ll never awake from and almost as if I’m lost with no way out. I also blame myself at times because I let her do it.. let her walk all over me and take advantage over the years. My entire family can see right through her and they know what kind of person she is. I’m an amazing person and what I mean by that is I’d die for the people I care about. Seeking a true friendship, I would like to find someone who can help me out and pull me out of this. Not only advice but someone who is patient and will stick by my side through the good and bad. I guess you could say I’m sending an application over reddit for friends which may sound desperate but because of her, I feel like I can’t make friends around my area. Take my hand, be that person and I’ll show you what I can do. I pray that someone/something picks me up.. let’s create this new beginning. Preferably looking for people around New York."

lonely,on a slippery slope...,"on a slippery slope... - Just venting and I dont think my paragraph makes much sense nor is it very well structured.   
I've been feeling lonely for the past couple of years and for the most of it... preoccupying myself with work and studies has helped put it aside and made it less noticeable. It wasn't a deliberate action it just happened to be like that.. a subconscious action? My family is not a very affectionate one and since my mother passed it has been even more evident as she was the only one who showed an ounce of affection. The overwork and rigorous studies might have been my way to cope, but I only recently realised how bad it was when a friend of mine pointed out that she only saw me twice in a year (before corona) and how recent in the first year after her death I got used by my workplace often overtiming and working past midnight... With work, I think I'm burnout or I think I generally find no meaning in it... I have no strong passions or ambition so I really rather just work part-time or not get promoted. I wish I had something I am passionate about to learn and work towards.. I admire people with passions and hobbies and dreams. I mean I have interests better never to the degree to have the motivation to pursue something in relation to it...I  also have never been in a relationship and never really sought one, but recently whether biologically, mentally, physically or everything its really hit the multiply button in the past year. The possibility that I am unable to feel romantic love is quite painful and somewhat opens a void in me. Like I want to fall in love too, feel a real connection with someone who will rely on you as much as you do them? Mutual respect, trust and loyalty...When I explain to friends they say give it time one day, I understand that but this void is indescribable and so painful and without the physical and mental affection at home or from friends I think my limit is at its peak.  I am probably depressed at some level or just really chronically sad. So I tried to take my own step forward... pushing myself, when I got into uni I pushed myself to step out of my comfort zone, got my first job, joined the gym, socialised, made new friends despite my introversion. I'm tired. I just want to be in my bubble, not work and stay in my room and sleep, chill, and do what I want to do. But I won't I need t work to look after dad, he's not good with money (like real bad, gambling bad) and old.  I've been independent at a youngish age not too young as some have experienced (I'm privileged I know)  but from a circumstance where I was always babied before mum's passing.... so I think it caused some mental blockage or damage when the support just went poof. I think this has contributed to my problems with loneliness and relationships, it's hard for me to truly grow close to someone... I wish I did not crave companionship and at the same time, I don't really want to socialise... I think I'm tired of socialising at the same time. It is so contradictory .  I progressively become so cynical with life, I overthink, I see no future, it's bleak and I'm tired. I'm probably burnout socially as well, cause I have been communicating even have a group chat with these friends I've grown closer to since quarantine that we video chat daily, but somewhere in my heart I feel it's superficial, I'm still lonely. It doesn't help we have dissimilar interests and not really the same sense of humour or way we talk is different idk I'm fairly pessimistic/self-deprecating which is not ""their type of energy"" so I have to rein myself and I guess that's probably stressing me out subconsciously... and I'm on the scale of introversion so. I need rest but I've been pushing myself to reciprocate and now it caught up so I'm so tired and have been withdrawing which they have noticed and have a hard time understanding why and I feel bad. Not their fault just me... super tired and lonely.... man i'm a can of worms ain't I lolololol"

Part of the mental pain is that earlier in the year the small social circle I do have threw a big party for this other person in the group.  It was all they would talk about for **months** prior and afterward.  For some, it started on a Monday and ended on a Saturday.

In comparison, I can't get people to let me buy them dinner &amp; drinks somewhere.  We could do anything in town, my treat, and no one's interested.

I go talk to someone or with a group ==&gt; some thought that i'm ridiculous comes up or i do something weird or a joke that doesn't make no one laugh ==&gt; i feel an enormous urge to leave the place or to space out ==&gt; people notice that (sometimes it happens) and point it out making it even worse or i get back to what i did again and again even thought i spaced out of the conversation ==&gt; my conclusion is i don't want to talk with that group/person no longer ==&gt; group/person: Oh this guy is weird, he seems to be avoiding us.

I'm not mad at them or anything, in fact I appreciate their concern and that they want to try and talk to me about all this. But their disinformation about all this puts us so far apart in the conversation and that really makes me sad.

Me:No 

Therapist:What happened after that could you find a talk anybody on highschool and university

Therapist:Do you have know since your 25   
Me:I dont   


Her suggestion for me to go and join clubs or something like that.  That suggestion alone made my stomatch hurt for 7 days straight.

lonely,So tired of my heart constantly being ground up,"So tired of my heart constantly being ground up - I'm a 23 year old guy with autism. I would say that I'm not a bad-looking guy and I do have friends, but for whatever reason, a romantic relationship has always been outside my reach. In high school, I was rejected constantly and constantly got made fun of and people would go around saying I was going to shoot up the school (even though I exhibited a lot of anti-social behaviors and basically gave them the ammunition to make fun of me). 

Going into college, this situation hasn't gotten any better. Pretty much every woman I meet is either taken or not interested (and it's been quite a lot). On top of this, I've even been sent to the dean's office for harassment just for trying to talk to a woman once. As a result, I've turned to online dating exclusively. 

The few times I have managed to talk with someone online, things ended badly. Back in 2019, I met a woman on Interpals. She was Russian/American (her parents were Russian, but she grew up in Colorado). I'm a huge Russophile and love women from that part of the world. Within days, we were saying we loved each other and wanted to meet up (I fell hard for her). It turns out that she was talking to other men the whole time and ghosted me after a while. Before this, I met a woman from England who I also ended up falling for and she ended up finding a guy IRL. 

After investing so much time and money into it, I've decided that it's just not worth it anymore. I've lost all hope of finding someone. I just don't have many opportunities to go and meet women and the ones I do meet are taken or totally not interested (as mentioned previously). Even the female friends I have are only online and live in Europe. Right now, I'm so tired of the disappointment and investing so much into finding a partner and getting so little in return."

After that we didn't see each other for five weeks because we both had a lot to do - mostly working. Last Saturday we had our second date which also was great and the day after I asked her to come over to my place. Maybe we could cook something together. She agreed but told me she wasn't free on the following weekends until middle of November. It's ridiculous. She might tell the truth or just make this up I don't know.
It hit me because I really like her and might have a crush on her. But now I'm just depressed and lonely. I never had friends and I never could connect to people. I have a job that I like and a nice apartment and I am in good shape physically. But maybe she could sense that I'm just a weirdo with no social life.

lonely,My girlfriend dumped me,"My girlfriend dumped me - I met a wonderful girl. She lived in San Diego. She was the first woman to ever tell me she loves me other than my family.

We fell in love rather quickly and always talked to each other. I lived in Orange County and she lives in San Diego. Our first night together went well. She wanted to see me again. I saw her a couple of weeks later when she was done visiting Riverside and moved back to San Diego

I did not mind the drive at all. Especially since I stayed the whole weekend. Friday through Sunday. Our first weekend together was great, we had a good time and we had sex. 

I'm very sick with Celiac disease so my body is still relatively weak since I found out about a year ago and only perfected dealing with it a few months ago. I had trouble getting erect with her. It was a surprise to me since I was a virgin and did not know I have erectile disfunction. I know my health is improving as I see myself slowly gaining strength over the last few months.

She kissed me and told me it was OK. We found other ways to make love. She was a very beautiful girl. I'm kind of chubby and unfit. A couple years younger than me. Outside of the bedroom, we never fought and we spent lots of time non-stop talking and cuddling.

Lots of laughing and making memories. After the weekend, she told me she needed to get school work done and I said ok, I'll give you this weekend to finish up. I'll see her the next one. But she said no, that she wanted me to go visit her and that I could just watch her do schoolwork. Again, we had a good time again. Lots of cuddling, talking, and compliments to each other. Again. I had trouble pentatrating her but I managed to do it to o
He for a bit. I felt so bad that I couldn't perform but she kissed me and told me it was OK. I tried to give her time to do her homework. But she just spent her time being with me instead.

After that weekend. I asked her when I could see her again and reminded her of our upcoming trip to Knotts Scary Farm. She said that she needed about three weeks. I said, ok. I thought to myself that's quite a long time but I can wait. I noticed she started to change. We usually texted quite frequently and sent lots of compliments and hearts, and I love yous. 

She went two days without texting me. I asked her if her feelings changed, she was acting distant. She wrote me a lengthy message saying that she too busy to focus on a relationship. It's not anything to do with me but that she's not ready for a long term long distance relationship yet. The whole ""It's not you, it's me"". That she needs to focus on school. I want being pusby or obnoxious.

I could read between the lines though. I asked her if there was anything I could do to fix our relationship. She said no, it's final. And to stop messaging her so much.

I dont understand how she went from being so loving and the best person I ever met to just so cold. She was the first one to say I love you. She reached out to me first, she told me she would ""simp"" for me. She broke my heart. I asked her if I could at least see her one last time and say goodbye but she said no.

I'm so heartbroken. I spent so much time alone and I meet my first ever girlfriend at 24years old. She's even better than I could ever hope for.

For once in my life I experienced true happiness and love. I understand what it was to be loved

Then she just gave me the cold shoulder. She wants to be left alone.

It's so cruel to have my first experience of true love and happiness and then have it taken away so quickly. I'm so broken right now."

They give monosyllabic answers.

They do not ask follow-up questions after answering mine.

If you don't text first, they will never initiate a convo with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately I get anxiety even posting on the internet. It’s gotten to the point where I blast music through my headphones when I shop because my mind is telling me that everyone’s staring at me and judging me.

I'm a very friendly and touchy person and without the physical interactions that I get from beeing together with my peers I feel lonelier than ever. I know how adult men are usually lonely but I didn't expect this kind of isolation. 

I do have friends, long term ones and it's not often that I get affection and words of affirmation from my group of friends unlike others. It's like it's expected for us men to be able to cope with it and figure it out ourselves. 

I'm craving for any kind of physicality but at the same time it's not bothering me that much to do anything about it. I'm getting used to it actually."

lonely,Tired of reviving “advice”,"Tired of reviving “advice” - There is nothing I hate more than hearing the words “you need to love yourself,” or “it’ll happen when you least expect it.”

I’m lonely, motherfucker! I crave human contact—both physical and emotional. I want to lie down in bed at night, with the person I love snuggled up next to me. I’m tired of waking up from an amazing dream, only to find myself spooning my pillow in the morning. I’m tired of hearing shitty, unsolicited advice from people who are happily married or in the relationships that I want for myself.

They think they’re helping. And I honestly can’t blame them. I’ve heard it all before though. I know I need to love myself. I know that, and I try. I love my job, I have friends who care about me, and I’m genuinely happy with my life, for the most part. It’s just that one glaring hole that prevents me from being happy sometimes. That extra key to the front door that never gets used.

I know some of my wants are purely physical, too. As a guy who’s been actively putting himself out there for years, yet never held a relationship beyond the second date, never been kissed by anyone but his mom, and never had sex with anything besides his own left hand, I am no stranger to the baser of emotions: lust.

I realize all of this. Yet people seem to only want to regurgitate the same “advice” at me every time I mention the fact that, “hey, it sure would be nice to have someone special to help make life just a little sweeter.” One can only be told to love themselves so many times before they begin to think they’re unlovable. I’ve been “least expecting it” for years, now, so why hasn’t it happened yet?

But the worst, by far, are these self-righteous fuckers who think they’re doing me a favor by telling me that I’m not ready for love. Apparently, on their planet, desiring deeper human connection and romance is a sign that you don’t need it, and, in fact, you’d only be hurting yourself if your want for love was met. So, you’re telling me that if I decided to shave my head, move to a momentary, and take a vow of celibacy, THAT is what means I’m “ready?”

Fuck off.

Anyway. This really just a vent. I genuinely do like where I am in life, just wish I had someone to be happy alongside me. I guess it was seeing a friend I had a crush on in high school get married a week back that set me off. Seeing them so happy and being happy for them just got me thinking, “Will that ever be me?”

I am trying holy hell i am trying but I am burning out. Told a lot of people I have to interact with family disability coordinators but in the end none of them are in the business of pulling people out of pits. I am just running into a brick wall and told to force myself through it and there's only so much of this that someone can handle before they shut down. I am nearing that limit.  I am just getting overwhelmed just managing class work and one class for utterly no reason besides being unable to seek help from anyone is causing me to break down. It isn't the class itself it is just the final straw type deal. I can't let go. I can't distress. Physical touch is the only way I feel any sort of comfort or safety and none one wants to hold a 30 year old loser. So I get to cry in my room then hurt myself physically to make the anxiety filled PSTD moment end before it causes social harm. I don't know what else to do I am nearing that point where I just want to make them pain stop permanently. It seems to be my only option because without money without resources I am a sitting duck just floundering around. Ffs. it is hard knowing my surgeries is what caused a lot of this. My parents divorce all the yelling. I am constantly hypertensive always on edge. I WANT TO BREATH I WANT TO WAKE UP FEELING LIKE I CAN MANAGE THE DAY. NO no instead every now in then I get to be reminded of that cold room that operating table and my head is screaming make it stop make it stop its so cold please please help. But no one is there. No one will ever be there. Theres no point fighting this hard just to be told to climb the mountain again. I can't im too tired. I am soo tired. I am in so much pain and I cant make it stop.

Having talked to a few girls I liked, only one ever responded and it was going but she did not have the same feelings as I did. The others have either never responded or have at one point responded, but abruptly stopped.

She’s completely erased all of the friends I had because of her jealousy and every time I try to leave her, she draws me back in with her threats and manipulation. It’s a nightmare I feel like I’ll never awake from and almost as if I’m lost with no way out. I also blame myself at times because I let her do it.. let her walk all over me and take advantage over the years. My entire family can see right through her and they know what kind of person she is. I’m an amazing person and what I mean by that is I’d die for the people I care about. Seeking a true friendship, I would like to find someone who can help me out and pull me out of this. Not only advice but someone who is patient and will stick by my side through the good and bad. I guess you could say I’m sending an application over reddit for friends which may sound desperate but because of her, I feel like I can’t make friends around my area.

lonely,I think I'm beginning to realize that I don't really want friends at this point.,"I think I'm beginning to realize that I don't really want friends at this point. - Long story short, I missed out on my teenage years. Looking back, it was incredible how much I was sheltered.

To put it simply, I just think I'm better off alone, and knowing how much more difficult to make friends at 26 compared to 16, why would I want to try and make friends?

Think about it. People are much busier at my age and lack the free time like they use to. Also, we no longer have that safe school setting. Our only choices are work. The worst place if you ask me. Or hobbies, which you can do for years and come out with nothing. Or you can make good ""acquaintances"" but never really see much of them outside of your hobby.

I wish I can be 19 again and live in a dorm room where friends are just down the hall. I wish I had a hardcore group of friends like some of my teenage cousins do right now. There's a certain innocence that teenage friendships and romantic relationships have that can never be replicated in adulthood. Everything and everyone just seems overly serious.

I guess the truth is, I'm just uninterested in friendships now because they won't be the type of friends I would have made as a teenager. They won't be nearly as close that's for sure.

I have missed out on the boat that's for sure. I guess I can have friends but they'll act like adults. I can do some of the same things I missed out on as a teen, maybe even better. But the thing is I'm 26 and I'll be surrounded by other adults doing it.

I don't know why. But there's something off-putting and boring about that. I can't help but still want to be a teenager deep down.

Either way, I don't really have a choice about it. I wish I can just befriend a bunch of college-aged students but society will rage and tell me to be age-appropriate. Same thing with romantic relationships. So yes. You stupid boring fucks are all I'm getting. The only reason I'm bitterly swallowing this is that it's better than nothing. So, I'll try my best to be nice to you even though I dislike you deep down.

And to be honest, I respect that. Everybody has got their own thing going on. I'm not asking for sympathy, comfort, or help. Tbh I do okay by myself.

Last week, this lady I was seeing lied to me and I decided to move on from her. I really made it an effort to try and only include those that aren't toxic in my life. 

Yesterday, I had a ticket to a football game that was given to me. I put it out there that it was for free, anyone was welcome to tag along, not one person responded. 

A coworker text me today that he was at a football game, he asked if I was there, I replied to him I wasn't. He let me know that him and someone else went and that was it. I was thinking to myself ""I would have loved to have gone, he knows I would have gone, but he didn't ask me, why?!"". I sat at home watching the game and realized I can't remember the last time I had someone over to just hang with me. 

I can't begin to tell you how many times I have reached out to friends and ask ""let's get together for a drink, catch up"" or friends that are fearful of being around others because of COVID, so I suggest facetime....nothing from anyone. It hurts.

I see a therapist and I've told her at times I've had suicidal thoughts. 

We all have our problems, I have mine, I won't deny that. I do think that I have a lot going for myself, and in someways I am stable. I just want to feel wanted and appreciated by my friends and peers. It feels like my friends like me from arms length, like they have no problem wanting to text over the phone or snapchat, but god forbid that we can ever have that human interaction. 

As for the lady I left a week ago. My friends tell me I am such a catch, yet a lot of times I can't seem to find a woman that wants to talk to me. When I do, I just doesn't end up working several months later, they just end up ghosting me. 

I know this sounds crazy, but I'm at this point. I've never traveled abroad, it was because I been waiting to meet that right someone that can travel with me. I'm at the point where I would even PAY for a companion to travel with me just so I could have SOMEONE to spend time with, create memories with.

I run a airbnb, and wouldn't believe how much I can't wait for my guests to come through, because I finally have a person to talk to. I just appreciate the little things like that and it just seems few and far between....

They feel weird, unusual, out of place, strange, like an outcast. Just like you they are sitting alone somewhere, trying to fill that immeasurable void. Eager to be understood, liked, talked to. We all want to have someone there for us to accept us no matter what. To be there, not leave our side. I feel as you do. Many more I'm sure do not just myself. Please stay strong, and despite how you feel you are not alone. We will get through this, together. Give yourself time to grow, work on yourself, become the best you can be. The rest will follow."

lonely,No Longer Teenage Angst,"No Longer Teenage Angst - My heart o my heart

Beating with no pulse

Falling oh I’m falling 

My stomach in my throat

Life is a rollercoaster 

And it’s been going down

All this time I’ve been screaming

But there has never been a sound

It’s slowing oh it’s slowing

I’m looking at the ground

I see the tracks in front of me

O how far do they stretch out

The years only come and go 

It has been so long since

I tried and tried those failed attempts

I look back and I wince

The agony the pain 

Could never be contained

I used my body as a canvas

To express what’s in my brain

I did the same thing again again

You could say I’m insane

I am on a track of life

On this southbound train 

I look at my past and see

The puddles left by the rain

It’s hurts more now that I’m all grown up 

It’s no longer teenage angst"
lonely,"You ever realize you're the ""Back burner friend""?","You ever realize you're the ""Back burner friend""? - And by that I mean - you're the last person they want to hang out with, at the end of the week making plans for the weekend when things fall through or when they couldn't get plans with anyone else then they come to you. And even when you guys hang out you sense that you aren't really the person they want to be with. You aren't an important  valuable person to them you're just there so they aren't really alone. Your texts get ignored for days or weeks on end while you see them on social media with other people - WAY happier than they ever are with you. They only come to you when they want something fro you.

lonely,I'm not here anymore.,"I'm not here anymore. - I don't feel alive. I feel like I'm floating between conciousness and unconsciousness. When I'm awake I want to sleep. When I sleep I want to live my dreams. Every moment crushes my heart. Even now, as I'm typing this, some 90's sitcom in the background serving as my friend for the night while I try desperately to quiet the voice constantly telling me no one cares, but that voice is the only truth. It's the only thing I know to be true, no one cares about me and no one ever will.

Most times I feel like a phantom, like I'm not here. I witness people talk to eachother and enjoy each other's company. I witness a man look at a woman, holding her hand, a friend making another laugh, a stranger making conversation. I do not belong. I never have and never will. Understanding that is painful. Ignoring it is temporary relief. 

There is not one person in this entire world than will ever understand and accept me. I will not know love. It's terrifying, but it's my only truth. The only real thing I have. My heart stopped a long time ago. I'm barely here. I keep waiting for death like a dream. Knowing it's inevitable, is my only comfort."

I want a boyfriend who wants to combine souls, connect, and share our life stories.  And it seems that in the gay community that’s very hard to find I guess."
lonely,I just wanna laugh,"I just wanna laugh - I had this friend who for morality reasons i’m not friends with anymore or will go back to, but they made the days so much brighter. If i didn’t talk to them for weeks on end it didn’t affect our bond and there was no such thing as a taboo topic. we could be free with one another because we acknowledged the other person was just as bad and it was so platonic that if i talked about masturbating 5 times a day he would never take it as an invitation. and he would shave his balls otp with me and talk about his dick pimple with no shame. tmi ik sorry. but he was the person that i would always go to whenever i’m not okay because he wouldn’t pester into what’s wrong and instead i’d say “i need to laugh” and immediately make me laugh so hard i’d forget how much it hurt. i don’t think about him much and ik he changed so i wouldn’t rekindle that. But when i’m at school, on the train, on my bed and force myself to enjoy my own company because i don’t have that one person who can make me smile till it hurts anymore, i feel so empty. i don’t miss him i just miss that relationship and i just wanna genuinely laugh again."

Right now both my flat mates have both brought girls back and are having sex right now and i’m in the middle of them writing about how much of a waste of space i am lmao, i just feel like people put up with me and no one actually wants me."
lonely,Missing that deep Friendship I once had.,"Missing that deep Friendship I once had. - Sometimes I feel like I miss him, Some other times I feel like I simply miss having just someone who gets me. 

It kind of sucks because I have a friend or 2, to this one friend, i'm possibly even their best friend, but kinda just can't feel the same. Maybe it's because I just don't feel connected like I used to with my ex bestfriend, or maybe I just am a Asshole.

In a way it feels like I have people around me, but due to me just missing this one deep connection, I can't feel content and feel selfish.


Honestly I don't even know where I'm going with this, but I somehow just had to vent, if this whole thing even makes any sense."

lonely,only friend ditched my birthday plans for her boyfriend,"only friend ditched my birthday plans for her boyfriend - we’ve been best friends since sixth grade but she moved away at the end of last year :( school is so tough without her because she was one of my only friends (the other one just doesn’t get me. we’re only friends because we’ve been together for so long). she lives two towns over so my dad drives me over to see her sometimes. just yesterday i went to watch her perform in a play, but it was bittersweet. she just kinda waved me off when i congratulated her at the end of it. she’s a natural extrovert, I’m an introvert with social anxiety. she has tons of new friends and a boyfriend. it makes me apprehensive of even asking to hangout because i know she’ll be busy with one of them, but i thought I’d ask her to hang out on my birthday since, you know, it’s my birthday. two years ago we went to a theme park on halloween (my bday) and it had haunted rides + haunted houses. it was fun and my dad asked if I would want to do it again with her this year, i said yes. I asked her today thinking she’d be excited but instead she said, simply, “can’t, sorry.” it’s like she doesn’t even put effort into our friendship. she told me that her and her boyfriend would be attending a Halloween party and that she’d “pick me any other time.” It’s my BIRTHDAY! i have such a hard time making friends and it sucks. school is lonely as hell and she was my only scapegoat, but now I’m thinking that I only hold her down. ugh"

I’ve avoided so much. I can do the surface level stuff like hi, how are you. But after that I just want to dip because I feel that I’m not good enough for any of those guys (they got great jobs and my depression took so much of my life that I’m still struggling with that), hobbies, activities. I’m over here like I’m a complete loser. When I get a bit of energy, I always want to make a new recipe, or go shopping for decorations or learn about skincare. I’ve been sheltered a lot and my parents never took us anywhere so even though I want to be adventurous, I get anxious about that too. I’m not an exciting person. I feel that who would want someone with my mental state, they won’t understand. How can I feel a connection to someone from a screen? The only time I ever felt close to a guy was someone who was struggling like me but he was so emotionless many times, I couldn’t understand if he even liked me at that point, he just made me even more confused and made me hate myself even more, there must be something wrong with me.

So, what of it? *""Well, every person is different.""* I know that, but it is a cop out.

The thought of being alone used to terrify me. It still does, but I guess I just repress it for long enough amounts of time to look normal. I cried a lot when I was a kid at the thought of dying and everything just being the nothingness I dreamt of.

It used to be manageable. I'm medicating myself, trying to get to know people and keep studying. But today I just feel like I used to right now. It's just me. It's quiet and I just want to curl up on the corner of the bathroom and cry, like I used to do when I was a child. Maybe jump from the window.

I don't even know why I'm writing this, but I don't have anyone to seek help. My time is ticking and everything I didn't do when I was younger is passing through my head.

lonely,thinking I will be used..(rant/need advice),"thinking I will be used..(rant/need advice) - Hi, I finally found someone on the internet. He's nice and we have the same interests(basic geeks) he wants to meet this weekend, but there is some problems that I might face.. First of all I will unfold the problems. Age difference; he's 21 and I'm 16. I don't mind a 5-year age difference, but I heard so many horror stories that older guys are going after teenage girls, because they're easier to manipulate to etc..I don't think it's this case with him, but I talked with some people about it and they said that an big age difference(with a minor) is a redflag. We actually started to talk when I was 15 and he was 20. Basically he was pretty sexually talkactive then and that frightened me and I was also scared that my strict parents will find out. I messaged him because I felt so lonely and I matured a lot in a year. He told me he's sorry for being too sexual and he told me that if there's a problem I should always let him know. In the beginning it was nice, we talked and called a lot, but then after a period the conversations started to get cold. I had to put all the effort in starting a conversation, I get ghosted a lot, I would get a message 2 hours later even though he's constantely online. He only talks actively when the conversation becomes sexual. He explained to me before that he has a high libido and such so he becomes horny a lot, well I have the same, but I can still talk normally and not ignore someone I like and what saddens me the most is that I know him from a discord server and it might be me being paranoid, but he's also friends with the typical ''hotty, slutty'' popular E-girls from the server. It makes me feel so unworthy. Also when we talked about our meeting, he also says stuff:'' I cant wait to \[insert sexual deed\] with you. Even though I mentioned so many times I do not immedaitely want to lose my virginity with someone on the first date. I'm raised in a foreign culture which makes virginity for a girl important and honestly I want to be at least 18 year old to have sex and be in a relationship for a long time. I explained this to him numerous times, but he still thinks somehow he can convince me to have sex. So if we meet, this is what the situation can turn out to: My appearence looks different compared to my pics, so he gets disgusted and find a way to dump me, he likes me and starts to manipulate into having sex, he will manipulate me into having sex and after block me or the best ending: he respects my boundaries and we will only kiss and hug and from that point our relationship starts to get serious.  oh and aside note, i already kinda see him as my bf, but he doesnt see me as his gf, he told me he will decide after meeting, which is kinda logical, but hearing that hurted me. Please, sorry if this ranted sounded messy, but can any people give me especially men give me advice, should i stop seeking contact with him or???"

One of the things I'm trying to break away from is a friend group I've known for since i was kid. we met over the internet when we were all kids, now we're all grown up.

It was fun while it lasted, but sometimes i feel like I've grown so much from these people. It's a little hard to hang out with them without feeling extremely lonely. Of course i care about them, but i just feel so distant. I don't relate to them anymore, and feel like none of them are actually there for me. whenever we hang out it feels like we're just trying to pass the time.

But like... I've known them for SEVEN years. Its kind of hard to break away from that even though i know i should. I talk to them almost everyday, its like a routine.

its also hard because if i break away from these people then I'll truly have no friends. Its really rare that I can connect with someone so I just know it'll be a while before i have friends again. 

I'm okay with being alone, but it'll be so boring lol. What do you guys do during times where you're alone for a while?"

lonely,"Issues with loneliness &amp; retail ""therapy""","Issues with loneliness &amp; retail ""therapy"" - I have signficilabt issues with having any friends or social group irl, the closest thing to a group of friends I had was from D&amp;D &amp; Xbox Live. However my dad &amp; I sorta divorced from the D&amp;,D group, more or less cutting me off from socialization with other people irl.

Xbox Live doesn't do it for me anymore, no one wants to be in a party with me, I have a microphone to talk to other people, but they don't really say anything back.

Any other important place that I recently left, was the restuarant  I was working at. Just like school though, I didn't hang out my coworkers outside of work &amp; I don't really talk to any of them, they typically don't seem to be interested in my company. As if it's inconvenient for them to hang out with me.

I haven't had a relationship for a year, I haven't had sex ,(mainly due to my faults &amp; insecurities), the last girl I wanted to be with wasn't interested in me, and the one before that, I screwed up entirely. It left me bitter, hateful, resentful, and sad and lonely and filled with seething contempt for anyone happier than me. I hate people who are happy  I want to be them, I hate myself.

I have ADHD &amp; on the spectrum, I feel like I have to work on eggshells everywhere, yet I'm impulsive &amp; have an addictive personality. I'm extremely critical of myself, to the point of being scared to do anything that might not be within my limits at all.

I just want good friends &amp; a meaningful relationship, it is the one thing that hurts me the most, when nothing occupies my mind... my mind picks me apart , it only gives the existential dread of dying &amp; having only one, short life that I'm squandering. I'm waiting money on stuff for gaming, dnd, &amp; airsoft in the vain hope of socialization with other people. It never pans out well, I basically buy the infrastructure/stuff needed, but it never amounts to anything. I'm always the third wheel, I'm the one that feels ignored, im the one who feels shame &amp; embarrassment over the smallest of faux pas. I just hate it all &amp; want to start over but I can't."

If youre going to comment...please dont say anything mean, im not feeling strong enough currently to deal with any of that kind of stuff right now.


Im SO lonely. I have no friends. My family doesn't love me. And the thing is, I try so hard to make meaningful connections. I am a very kind hearted person, I am a pacifist, I am completely non judgemental. I dont know what it is about myself that makes ME the kind of person who ends up completely alone and isolated. I dont know what I'm doing so horribly wrong that I cant seen to make any friends (im in my 3rd year at university, with no friends despite constant trying). I'm not overbearing, i know how to recognise when someone doesnt like me (because it happens all the time) and i thus know when to stop trying with that person. Its honestly not fair. I dont care if i sound like a whiney bitch saying that-- but its not fair, it really isnt. Every person out there who is lonely experiences an unfair life. And please dont tell me 'lifes unfair, suck it up', because that wont be helpful. I do 'suck it up' on the daily, just get on with life alone but right now i just really want to vent about all of this because it makes me so upset and so angry. All i want in life is for someone to care for me and love me. Its not much. I still have hopes ill find something some day but christ its SO HARD to keep going sometimes. Sometimes it just hits me like a pile of 100 tonne bricks and I cant breathe. What makes it worse for me, that extra squeeze of lemon and salt into the wound, is that im an identical twin. And my identical twin grew up under the same conditions as me yet, no matter what, she has ALWAYS has a big friend group who are supportive and active and love her. Ive never had that and it confuses me how ive always been excluded from everyone for longer than I can even remember. Even if people couldnt tell us apart, they always knew that i was the inferior twin that they didnt like, and my sibling was the superior one who they wanted to be friends with. And im so tired of being compared to my sibling. The ""whose your favourite twin"" but its never ever been me. The ""im only inviting you because youre [siblings name] sibling"". The frankly fake sympathy when my siblings friends realise that i have no friends (yet make no moves to include me, just say (sarcastically it seems) ""aww poor [my name]"".

Im out of things to say but...my life just frustrates me so much sometimes!! And i get so overwhelmed when i try to work out just *why* my life is like this, what i did to cause it and why i cant seem to fix it or get out of this isolated life.



Because they're relatable, here is the Torches Together lyrics:

Why burn poor and lonely?
Under a bowl or under a lampshade
Or on the shelf beside the bed
Where at night you lay turning like a door on it's hinges
(First on your left side, then on your right side, then your left side again)
Why burn poor and lonely?
Tell all the stones, we're gonna make a building
We'll cut into shape and set into place
Or if you'd rather be a window,
I'll gladly be the frame
Reflecting any kind of words
We'll let in all the blame
(And ruin our reputation all the same)
So never mind our plan making
We'll start living
Anyway, aren't you unbearably sad?
Then why burn so poor and lonely?
We'll be like torches - We'll be torches together!
With whatever respect our tattered dignity demands
Torches together, hand in hand
Why pluck one string?
What good is just one note?
Oh, one string sounds fine I guess...
We we're once 'One Notes'
We were lonely wheat quietly ground into grain
(What light and momentary pain!)
So why this safe distance, this curious look?
Why tear out single pages when you can throw away the book?
Why pluck one string when you can strum the guitar?
Strum the guitar!
With no beginning, with no end
Take down a guitar and strum the guitar if you're afraid,
And I'm afraid and everyone's afraid
And everyone knows it but we don't have to be afraid anymore
You played the flute but no one was dancing
You sang a sad song and none of us cried"
lonely,Strangers,"Strangers - Why is it that strangers on the internet care more about you than those who claim to love or care about you? 
When you reach out and spill everything to them and all they respond back with 'I feel that' . How is that helpful. I have been in a dark place recently and stuff like that just makes it worse. I dont really have any one to talk to any more. I've stopped trying to talk to my friends and family about what's going on. Partners it seems to just push them away or they dont think I'm enough or im to much. I know that I have mental issues and im not looking for sympathy. I guess I just want some one to give me a hug and tell me it's okay. As some one who thrives on physical touch, living alone one of the hardest things I've had to do."
lonely,Feeling really lonely today,"Feeling really lonely today - Just struggling with that part of me aching for a special someone to love and be loved by, while at the same time feeling guilty because I am surrounded by family and maybe I should be content I am not as lonely as I could be.

lonely,What is the point of life?,"What is the point of life? - So I have posted here many times but it helps me cope. Anyway what’s the point in life? I don’t really have friend or anyone I care about but my dad. I have 6 other siblings but in all honesty if I left I wouldn’t really think of them. I have a very stable and normal home life but something always just seemed off for me. I never felt like I fit in anywhere. Home, school, swim, or out in public. I never fit in. I was abandoned by my birth parents and lived in a Chinese orphanage for the first 3 years of my life. I think I have abandonment issues because I refuse to let anyone close because I know they are just gonna leave on day. 

I also hate when I see couples in public. Knowing that I will probably never have that makes me fucking depressed. Seeing people happy makes me just feel more sad and depressed knowing that I’ll never have that level of happiness in my life. 

Currently I’m working a full time job at aldi but I’m tired of my every day life. Nothing new. The same old shit every day. I spend hours and hours on my phone just so I have something to do. I wish I just had money so I could travel. I’m thinking about leaving just so I can get out of my boring ass routine. Fuck life"
lonely,Afraid of being forever alone,"Afraid of being forever alone - 20F, putting this here to vent and see if anyone relate. I'm unable to make friends. Like I really don't know how to. 

Most of my friendships from kindergarten to highschool were toxic or distant. Basically my friends were also my bullies.

Now I'm an animation student but I can't seem to connect with my classmates. While I'm very outgoing with them in the day, when I go home in the evening no one messages me.

I'm afraid I unfortunately dug this hole I'm in myself. Indeed, when someone tries to be friends with me I push them away. I really don't like sleepovers and going out with someone gives me bad anxiety. 

It seems I'm only able to (badly) have smalltalk with people. Having deep conversations make me really uncomfortable and I always take hours to respond to texts even tho I see them in my notifications.

I also don't know how to seek friends ? Like I can't just go to a populated area and talk to someone. I don't know how to meet people outside of my classroom.

Maybe it's obvious seeing this post, but I've always had mental health issues. Anxiety at 8, depression at 13, social anxiety at 17 and I'm currently going through depression again. I sometimes wonder if I'm on the spectrum because I've always felt a bit different. In highschool I had the bad idea of starting drinking alone when I couldn't stand life anymore. 

Rn it's sunday evening where I live and I'm having a big group project tomorrow. My dumbass decided to drink again this afternoon, so I hope I won't be hungover.

Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming my life away. I imagine I'm going out with friends, I imagine I'm having deep conversations with my best friend, I imagine I'm holding someone I love. I'm used to loneliness but it gets old. 

What's scary is not having no close friends right now, it's being alone forever, dying without having accomplished anything and having formed meaningful relationships.

I guess my real problem is that I've always been very passive. Putting this out there is already a big step.

I apologize for this very long post and for the funky phrasing, English isn't my native language. If someone relates, we're in this together. Have a nice day everyone :)"
lonely,I just want to be loved...,"I just want to be loved... - I feel exhausted and tired in this very moment. Waves of lonelyness overwhelm me more and more in the last few months. I dont know how to cope with it. I'm somewhat attractive, I'm working out, I am meeting new people, I educate myself.

lonely,This uncertain feeling about my life.,"This uncertain feeling about my life. - I'm 26F and I feel lonely even though I'm not really alone. I have a boyfriend and a family who I'm close to. But I I really have any true friends. I've always struggled maintaining relationships with friends. I'm not sure whether it's my choice in people or it's me. Likely a mixture of both.

So for a couple of years now I've just felt so lost and alone. I feel that I can't relate with anyone. That I'm not really heard, appreciated or taken seriously. I've lost all confidence in myself and my abilities as well as self esteem about my quality of character and appearance. I look at where I am in my life and feel scared that I'm stuck in a place where I can't make a change. I guess I'm afraid of change, I'm afraid of the future. But I know that I don't want to feel alone and like there's no place for me. But I just don't know what to do. I feel so lazy. I kind of am. But I don't want to be. But I don't know how not to be. 

This is all a bit of a ramble but I guess it represents how I feel really. I don't know why I'm posting this. I guess it's to vent a little? I don't know."

lonely,I'm 37 and still very lonely.,"I'm 37 and still very lonely. - So I'm going to college at the moment and the majority of the girls are a lot younger than I am. I don't go out much because I'm tired of going out. When I was younger I would definitely try finding something to do or just walk around but now I just stay home or go to school. The problem is that I've never been the one to start a conversation with anyone. Now that I'm back in school it seems super creepy for someone my age to even try to talk to most of these girls at school. I notice that girls just look at what I'm wearing (I wear nice sneakers all the time) and that's it. I'm working on my bachelor's degree and ever since I went back to school I noticed that girls even in my class wouldn't even look at me. I guess since I don't go out I really won't be able to meet someone.

My main focus is to get through these obstacles of obtaining these degrees to eventually become a psychologist. I want to be a therapist and help teens that are going/went through similar situations like I did when I was younger. All I want to do is make my mark in the psychology field to help people get and feel better. But how can I help people if I'm always lonely. I've been lonely since I became homeless at the age of 16 and was homeless for 17 years of my life. Now that I'm finally getting my life together I'm more lonely than ever. It sucks to know that I'm not getting any younger and I still have no one in my life to actually support me in life and I'm not talking about financially. I want to grow with someone and I want to help someone grow and become a better version of themselves while at the same time improving my own life. Well, I'm going to cut it short because I think I'm just rambling now and jumping all over the place."

Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real 🌟), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 4500 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"

I got to hang out with my family for a couple of days and my brother hung out with me at my dorm for two nights. Me and my brother walked around and laughed talked about funny videos and good movies. We stayed up all night playing video games and had a good time. The time was up and I had to say goodbye to them and wouldn’t see them for a couple more months. I acted like I was fine saying bye and then I walked into my dorm and straight broke down crying for 10-20 minutes. I haven’t had a real conversation here at university for 3-4 months and being able to have someone to talk about and have fun with was so special to me even if it was my own brother.

lonely,Feeling lonely even with people,"Feeling lonely even with people - I've been feeling so lonely and isolated even when I'm out with people. I have trouble connecting with people because of an anxious attachment style (I'm in therapy for 3+ years now for mental health issues)  and haven't been able to feel loved or appreciated by anyone. 

They're on their phones a lot messaging other people and playing games.  I understand we live in 2021 and people use their phones. I'm an IT specialist and I understand technology is a part of our everyday life. I just wish people would put them away when we're together. I've reduced my phone use significantly(From 6.5 hr/day to 4hr/day) over the past year (through usage monitoring apps and awareness when I'm out with people) because I noticed how it made me feel less connected to the people around me. I've addressed this with 5 people now in my friend group. Some understand and have backed off using it while we're out eating or hanging out. Some have told me I'm being ridiculous and phones are a part of our daily lives. I know many are trying to back off using their phones but I feel so disconnected and unwanted that as soon as I see someone pull their phone out it triggers my anxiety so bad I wanna start crying. I've stopped taking calls and messages from family and friends when out with others to try and stress the issue. From what I've seen this behavior is defined as ""phubbing"". 

I've tried therapists. I've tried communicating. I've tried finding new hobbies. I've tried cognitive behavioral therapy. I just wanna feel connected to people again and not feel so alone, especially when I'm sitting right across from them."

lonely,My experience with loneliness [18],"My experience with loneliness [18] - Loneliness. A common feeling that apparently over 240,000 of us are experiencing. The sad thing is, there's more. And that number goes into the 7 digit region unfortunately. 

I've always found it funny that I feel this way. I'm in a friend group with about seven people and we all do rely on each other and I have a great relationship with my family, yet there's something missing. There's an empty void. And once that void is filled, it could be the solution to everything. 

I remember the first time I ever had a crush on a girl. It was in kindergarten. I would've been about 4. Although I can't remember her name and can vaguely remember her face, I remember we were best friends and we'd play every day and we relied on each other. And I remember one day, (this all happened in 2008) in the classroom there was a computer that we could play educational games on. I remember everyone was just doing their own thing in the classroom and it was just me and this girl sitting together by the computer. As we were playing the game and just laughing and smiling, I remember she kissed me on the cheek. ""Oooo, wow, big surprise"" you're probably thinking. It isn't anything special, but I can remember clearly how I felt in that one moment, almost 13 years later. I felt I was cared for and I had butterflies in my stomach. And I was smiling and I was happy. And then she kissed me again on the cheek and I remember we just held each other after that as we were still playing the game. No one else saw this. Wherever this girl is now, she's probably forgotten it long ago, she's probably forgotten who I am. I bring this up because that's the furthest I've ever gone with a girl. 

During primary school, I would end up having crushes, but hey, it's primary school. It's not like it's really going to lead to anything. When I got to secondary school, I did develop more crushes on girls I thought were genuinely beautiful but the thing was, I never had the guts to actually talk to them. I remember this one girl I had a crush on, it was for about two and a half years. I had a snapchat streak with this girl for TWO AND A HALF YEARS. Lasted for about 870+ days. During that entire time, I never had the guts to talk to her once. Eventually she got a boyfriend and I wasn't even shocked or jealous by that point because I knew I let that happen. There was no reason to take it out on them. And a few months later, I ended up repeating this mistake for another girl. It ended earlier thank God. And the thing was, I had an opportunity to go out with a girl. She liked me but I didn't share the same feelings back. I did for a short time but eventually I lost it. And looking back on it, it makes me upset because this was the only girl I'd ever known that had a genuine interest in me and she loved my quirky and weird side, we'd have conversations about movies or school and life sometimes and what did I do? I turned her down. and I guess that was why I didn't want to turn it into a romantic relationship. Because I valued the friendship we had and didn't want to lose it in the event we broke up. I'm still questioning whether she would have been good for me or not. She has a boyfriend now so that too was all for nothing. We barely talk anymore and it's down the toilet too. 

In school, I didn't really set up the greatest reputation for myself. I was always shifting personalities. If I was in a class with barely any friends, I would be quiet and for others, mysterious or awkward. When I was in a class with my closest friends, I didn't care what others thought. I would also always distance myself away from girls on purpose because of the way I saw myself. I was always paranoid that I had bad breath, that I smelt bad, even though I really didn't. I'd overdo it with deodorant and spray every single day because of this. 

I live in Melbourne, Victoria. The most locked down city in the world. The final two years of my high school didn't give me a chance to redeem myself and try to push myself to become more confident in myself because we were in remote learning for the majority. I finished high school a few weeks ago, I'm never going to see these people again and just with the current lockdown, I've never been more lonely now than ever. The days feel never ending. Time feels like it's in limbo and the days feel like Groundhog Day. They just repeat and it's more shit news on top of shit news. I'm a massive movie buff so I try to just escape as much as I can in the vast amount of spare time I have now but once it's over, these feelings come back. Sometimes it seeps through while I'm watching. Even in alot of movies I watch, I see myself as these characters. John Wayne in The Searchers. Harry Dean Stanton in Paris, Texas. Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. Maybe not their personalities but I connect with their feeling of never ending loneliness and their quest to search their heart and soul. When the lockdown lifts, I don't know how I'm going to find someone. I'd say I'm someone who does believe in fate and I'd rather just let life send this person in my direction instead of just going on a dating site and matching up with someone that I know I'll probably never see again.

That's the missing void in my life. Some people wonder if love is a need in life or a want. In my view, it's a necessity. I don't believe one can go through life without finding love. I believe that everyone is meant to and will find love. It may take a long time but one day, love will show itself to you. It's been hard getting through the pandemic this way, basically just alone with my thoughts for the majority and struggling to talk about it with anyone, but I do have faith that one day I won't be alone through this anymore. That's my story. I've never really done anything like this before but I just wanted to share this for some reason."

lonely,"Life keeps throwing shit at me, I am overwhelmed and yet I never had someone to talk to.

I feel lost and alone. - If you go through my profile you will understand what exactly is going on with my life. Right now, I don't have the patience to give all the details. I feel really, really depressed.

I will probably end up deleting this post as no one cares enough to read it.

The only person who cares about me lives in the US. She has helped me out so much and she genuinely cares about me (in a platonic way). But I live on the other end of the planet. The difference in time zones and her busy life makes it nearly impossible for us to have a proper conversation.

Where I'm from, everyone my age has a wealthy father except for me. I have been lonely my entire life because of this. The guys don't want to hang out with me as friendship for them depends on what you have and what you can offer, i.e if you have a motorcycle, a car or a super expensive PC to play online multiplayer games with. And all the girls avoid me as I'm poor and and I have nothing tangible to offer... I can't afford to go on dates or afford to buy them gifts.

Online I can't make friends because of my nationality. Yes I'm Indian but as you can see I do not speak or write broken English. I never asked any girl for anything sexual. I'm nowhere near as ugly as the guys you see in those stereotypical memes. I will never send a dick pic, even if you ask for one. I have no intention of scamming people. I do not have a heavy, laughable accent. My accent sounds more like the Californian-American accent rather than the typical Indian accent (verified by native English speakers). The ridiculous memes and the imbeciles on YouTube have ruined our reputation. I mean, how would you feel if I said: all Americans like to sex with their siblings? All British people are tea drinking racist colonizers? All Italians are lazy? All South Americans/Latin people are drug addicts and drug dealers?

Sorry, I digress.

But that's the thing... I have posted many times on places like r/r4r and never received any responses. Men already receive far fewer responses compared to women and on top of that people already assume negative things as soon as I mention my nationality.

All I ever wished for was to have a someone send me a ""good morning"" message. It would be enough reason for me to be get out of bed without feeling the weight of the world on my shoulders. Someone who would actively want to have a conversation with me. Simple things like, ""how was your day?"", ""what did you do?"" would give me enough motivation to do something productive. And in return I would also listen and try to help you when you're having problems.

Whenever I have talked to a girl or anyone online, they said the same thing: you're so kind/you're a nice person. I know I am, I always try to be kind to people because very few people have ever been kind to me. I know that kindness can be heartwarming. And yet... Why am I am always alone and suffering? Do I not deserve any happiness? Am I asking for too much?

I might sound like an incel or a ""nice guy"", but I assure you I'm not... I am not a misogynist and I do not blame or attack women for not being interested in me. I just needed to get my overwhelming thoughts out my system."

Why is it then so difficult to find another person a partner a friend who would just understand your struggle and accept you the way you are.

Whenever I meet a new person or reach out to an old acquaintance, it feels like their circle is full and there is no room to add me, even though I would genuinely love to have that person in my life.

I reach out to people, some new some long-lost-friends but pretty much everyone sooner or later ghosts me. My dating has been a joke since day 1.

When I was in highschool, people got to know each other because we spend 8h a day together for years, but outside of highschool? In the wild?

How do yall meet people out in the wild? Being lonely really sucks. All I do is take care of myself, my housing, cook good food, try to learn new things, go to sleep. I miss the most important thing, social communication.

I can fill the emptiness with social media, but that's REALLY terrible. It gives me no incentive to go out and meet people, as I get my ""social fix"" from social media. It's like how a drug addict don't get their dopamine or whatever from healthy stuff, but they get it from the drug."
lonely,20 years old and never even kissed a girl,"20 years old and never even kissed a girl - Well, I did once when I was about 7. I think we can all agree that doesn't count.

\~massive vent incoming\~

I once hugged a girl at a house party when I was 17. We were both extremely drunk and she started to get wobbly, so I helped her to an adjacent room and she started hugging me on a sofa. She started to look sick so I helped her to the toilet so she wouldn't start vomiting all over our friend's house. I tied back and stroked her hair while she vomited.

Sometime after, I started texting her and we got talking almost every night. One day she told me she didn't remember any of it.

The pair of us (myself mostly) were too socially awkward to talk to each other in person while sober. I was too anxious to organise a date and I kept putting it off so it never happened.

At the next party a few months later, I was so excited to finally be able to speak to her in person while both drunk. She completely ignored me and my anxiety went into overdrive, convincing me that she was lying the whole time or that I'd somehow completely misread the entire situation. This caused some kind of panic attack/existential crisis that I've not had before or since and I lay on a sofa despondently, ignoring those around me who thought I'd passed out from the alcohol.

I messaged her after the party asking what was going on and she told me she was just shy.

I was extremely relieved and the come down from that crisis was a bit rough. I can't remember exactly what I messaged her, but suffice it to say that the alcohol mixed with the emotional rawness/mental illness caused me to textwall her some, I guess, obsessive and repetitive stuff. 

She got weirded out and the combination of that and the lack of interaction caused her to break it off. I can't really blame her, it was *very* weird, though I did make her acknowledge her part in the lack of interaction while not trying to downplay my own.

That was the only ""relationship"" I've ever had and one of maybe three instances of any girl being remotely interested in me. How screwed am I?"

Probably just toying with me, sending mixed signals. Or, just using me for attention and validation.

Thank you so much for that.

Its been a couple months now, adjusting to the culture was fine but I couldnt help but feeling sad and so alone because it was difficult for me to find new friends in my new school, not to mention my school is still in lockdown. 

I did find some acquaintance by talking to some students online but thats pretty much it.

Anyway, I was scrolling through instagram recently and saw Mike's story. It was his birthday and he showed him with a huge friendgroup having fun together. He even put over 10 stories of people from his class wishing him a happy birthday.

I’ve accepted that as the main reason I could never make friends. I naturally act awkwardly to the people I meet and they easily lose interest in me because i have a hard time being all comfortable and friendly with them. It takes me years to fully be comfortable with somebody so when I started the new school year in a different school, I wasn’t sure how to make friends. Many people around me were able to click so easily, but after 3 months of hopelessly hoping to make a friend, I’ve gotten nowhere. Not a single friend to talk to or somebody to go to during breaks. I feel so pathetic even when I know this is all because of my own issues in communicating with others. In the beginning, I didn’t mind it because many people around me were still adjusting, but after seeing that they were coming out of their comfort zone, my insecurity and jealousy grew larger. I would stare at friend groups and wish I was included and I’d end up avoiding crowds out of embarrassment of being seen alone. I’ve gotten to a point where ive been more stressed at being an outcast than getting a bad grade. Recently, I watched a show and when the main cast was able to make friends so easily, I actually felt uneasy. I can’t believe I’ve gotten so lonely to the point where fictional character relationships get to my head and I can’t just enjoy a show I want to watch. Is there anybody who has actually felt that way?"
lonely,i have a girlfriend but i feel lonely,"i have a girlfriend but i feel lonely - I’m an  in college. I made the mistake of spending my first year in a one bedroom apartment. I’m able to talk to people in my classes but I can never seem to make a connection with people outside of my class.

My girlfriend and I have been dating a little over a year and she’s definitely doing much better than me. She’s been able to go to parties and meet new people but I just can’t seem to find something to do other than sit in my apartment for a majority of the day. I see her probably 2 times a week even though we live like 5 minutes away. We don’t even text much anymore, I find myself anxiously checking my phone every 20 minutes hoping to see a notification but rarely see one. Seeing her story with her and her friends at parties is especially difficult because I can’t help comparing myself to her."

lonely,"Lost, afraid of being vulnerable.","Lost, afraid of being vulnerable. - 5 years ago met a girl in a drug rehabilitation program (romantic I know).... Had some of the most amazing times of my life. But, also some of the craziest. Relapse, after relapse (shooting heroin) homelessness, saved her life probably 20 plus times from overdoses ( narcan, hospitals,cpr) she probably saved mine 10 plus times as well. We use to have people pay us to have sex in front of them while they masturbate. Homeless on east and west coast. We both were accomplished musicians busking in the city for money while dopesick. In between these times were some sustained periods of sobriety and something that resembled normalcy. We had a son, he was conceived in California. We came back east for the pregnancy, got at an apartment and six weeks after he was born our apartment building burned down (we were in the building when it caught on fire.. Thankfully, we escaped with our son but we lost all our possessions. We moved into her parents house and relapsed hard and after some time went to treatment. During the process we broke up for 6 months and then tried to work it out. But it seemed like too much damage had been done. She broke up with me and started dating another guy 2 weeks later. She got an apartment 3 doors down (that I can see from my bedroom). It torments me I still love her. After 2 months she got pregnant with new guy. Came over my house told me she still loves me and thinks about being with me (while pregnant) asks me if she should get an abortion? I told her that's on her. She gets abortion goes back with other guy and acts like she never said the things she said. I'm so devastated. I'm handling it pretty well (all things considered). I logically know we can't be together. But, after experiencing life on such an intense level (death, homelessness, degradation, miracle of a child etc) I don't know if I'll ever be the same. We both have about a year sober now. I've started a business and started doing pretty well financially and working a rigorous AA program. But, I'm very afraid of intimacy with another woman. I crave affection and connection. But my self esteem has been so eroded I don't know if I'll be ready for anything anytime soon. My heart hurts. But, I also am not sure if I know what love is or is supposed to be..."

I just want a girlfriend that cares about me and that I care about

I just want to move out of my parents who see me as the lost child

I just want money so I can save and buy things I want without worrying about paying my student loans (I know the government has them on forbearance, not the point)

I just want to learn new things because I like being smart without people looking at me like I’m weird for knowing that every century they skip a leap year and every millennium they don’t

I just want to feel useful, like I’m here for a reason not just dead weight

I just want a reason to be happy, I can pretend or find meaningless reasons all day but it’s not the same as the really thing

He caught me up on his life so far and told me about his new friend. I’m happy he is happy. But why do I feel like I’m in agony? I’m not jealous but I feel like he’s moved on. I feel desperate. I don’t understand why. Am I jealous? Like he
is at least talking to me but why? Why do I feel like I shouldn’t have done this? I missed him. Our late night talks about anything and everything, I missed it.

lonely,I'm all alone,"I'm all alone - I have no friends and I'm not close to any of my family. No one will be there for me, no one will help me and no one cares about me. I was around 12/13 when I became aware of this.

It's been subtly ingrained in the way I think and act for a long time. I don't notice it, but a lot of my actions have been driven by the feeling and the assumption of futility in making an actual friend. I don't bother to try to get through my social anxiety or fear to meet new people because what's the point, no one will be there anyway.

At this point I'm too old to change or to make meaningful connections with anyone.

I thought I could make peace with it and just be content hermit, but it still affects me. I can't not feel down about not being able to make any connections and having no one who cares. It's a human urge I can't stop, and it brings me misery.


I'll consciously recognize that I can't do it alone and I need someone to be there for me and to care about me. I can't go on being lonely or alone all the time."
lonely,I just want to cease to exist,I just want to cease to exist - So I’m 20 and I absolutely hate life. I rarely find joy in it and the joy I do find is crushed by the voice in the back of my head saying “this is as good as it’s gonna get” and remember that after the moment of happiness is over it’s back to my boring ass life. So many people are doing such great things with their lives. Most people my age are working towards a degree in college. Meanwhile I dropped out and have no idea why I’m here. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I’m also not looking forward to the real world. I don’t have many friends and the ones I do have I don’t talk to a lot. I doubt I’ll ever go out on a date let alone get married so what’s the point of my life if I have no one to share it with? Sometimes I wish I had a terminal disease that could relieve the pain and worries of living.

&amp;#x200B;

Dating is so hard, in my opinion, 90% of people only want temporary things, for those who want something serious, it's bad, as a romantic, I find dating impossible, it's frustrating.

I don’t know why I have to be forced to stay on this hell hole and pretend things will “get better” just so I can have all the tears and save it from other people. Everyone else gets to be selfish so why can I? Why can’t I do this one thing for myself that would bring me some peace?

lonely,Fuck it. I’m going to a bar.,Fuck it. I’m going to a bar. - I’m so lonely. Internet people are great but everyone I meet is not in the 49th state like myself. I’m going out. I don’t care if no one speaks to me and I have to drive 30 mins to go to a dive bar full of a bunch red neck men. It’s only 8pm but I can’t even remember the last time I met someone new. I’m starved for conversation. I’m miss flirting.
lonely,Is something wrong with me?,"Is something wrong with me? - I am incredibly lonely and here is why 

I am a 17 year old male and I have been really struggling to relate to people as of late. From a psychological perspective, I understand why people around me are the way the are but despite that understanding I really am hopeless when it comes to connecting with them. I feel as if people very infrequently understand my thought processes even though I believe, and have been told, that I am very excellent with language and, in turn, am great at putting things into words. Another aspect of this lack of understanding is how misguided everyone my age seems to be. It doesn’t seem like people my age have virtually any meaningful purpose behind their actions whatsoever. This creates a very apparent lack of alignment in lifestyle choices between me and my peers. My actions are almost solely focused on improving myself and I don’t see a lot of people doing that.

I feel like a lot of people like me but no one understands me and, despite numerous attempts, I really struggle to enjoy the company of my peers. There is a very, very small group of people I deem my friends and I can’t see that group increasing in quantity regardless of if I want it to or not. I spend most of my time alone but ironically feel most lonely when I am amongst most others my age. I typically occupy myself with reading, exercising, or practicing music (singing, guitar, and piano.) I have been single for all of high school and have lost many friends it seems because I have outgrown them.
Now my main sources of recreation/leisure are going to diners by myself, watching tv, or looking into colleges in order to plan ahead. 

In short, almost all of my actions are geared toward practicality but I wish I had some people to have stimulating conversation with. I try and try but being around people just makes me feel more lonely than when I am literally laying awake at night after not talking with anyone but my immediate family all day.

I don’t really know what this is indicative of but I thought I’d throw it out into the internet just to see if someone could lend some of their insight. There is more I would be willing to dive into so feel free to ask questions if you are inclined to do so"

Just me and material objects for 8 hours a day.

Every day is the same. Go to work and come home to my empty house. Some days I want to stay at work just so I can have some sort of human interactions. Cry myself to sleep almost every night. I have no one to reach out to and honestly I'm tired. Tired of everything. Tired of existing."

I feel alone I don't have much friends to talk to even more vent my problems to them, also I don't want to worry her more, she has it's own issues.

lonely,I'm so lonely it hurts,"I'm so lonely it hurts - I have no friends. I've always struggled making friends and I've lost every friendship I've ever had one way or another.

I've tried joining discord servers to find people that share my interests but it's never worked out, I'm about to start a job and they're nice people but no one that would interact with me outside of work as they're all adults with lives.

I'm so lonely I'm in pain. I'm miserable. I have no one, I just sit at home all day waiting for my family to come home from work. Why am I so unlovable? Why does everyone always turn on me? I've been hurt so many times over the years that I feel like I'm breaking because it just happens over and over again. I just feel so alone, and I don't think it's ever going to change."

She’s completely erased all of the friends I had because of her jealousy and every time I try to leave her, she draws me back in with her threats and manipulation. It’s a nightmare I feel like I’ll never awake from and almost as if I’m lost with no way out. I also blame myself at times because I let her do it.. let her walk all over me and take advantage over the years. My entire family can see right through her and they know what kind of person she is. Seeking a true friendship, I would like to find someone who can help me out and pull me out of this. Not only advice but someone who is patient and will stick by my side through the good and bad.

But in this scenario, reaching out directly via message is the only way we’d ever communicate since we don’t really talk or hangout anymore. I’m especially hesitant in this case because:
 
1. Me and this person were never too close of friends and have not seen each other since 2014 

2. Although we have messaged a few times on social media over the years, the convos were very short and usually in response to something she posted on social media (specifically IG)

3. She has a BF and may seem suspicious of me suddenly messaging her out of the blue

There are a few other reasons im hesitant to message that I can’t think of now. But I’ll take whatever advice I can get regarding this. I should clarify that I’m not trying to win her over or anything but just want to catch up"

I can't really ""Talk"" to them and sometimes they don't even feel real, My stepdad is that type of person to do what he wants and he avoids almost all negative emotions, and my half sister hates the living guts out of me because she is ""Simply going through that phase"" and I rarely get to talk to my grandfather, I have tried opening up my feelings to all of them at some point, SEVERAL TIMES, and every time it feels like they just don't know how to react and play it off like a joke, I say it in many ways and still they just forget and never think of it  


It might have to do with my situation, I can't leave the house because I need money to get one and I am in a legal situation with my mom that I will not go into detail about, another thing that might be causing confusion is my high functioning autism that messes me up in a million and one ways.  


I do have a councilor but she says the same things that the last 8-ish councilors I have been to ""Give it another chance"" ""Try something else"" etc. the thing is I HAVE TRIED PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING ALREADY AND NOT A SINGLE THING HAS CHANGED, I feel like I am going insane!  


Why I say this here is because of how this effects my non-existent social life, I feel alone, I feel like nobody is there to talk to me, not my family, not my councilors, not even the few online friends I have, and the friends I know IRL left me because of my bad decisions I made while going through another depression while I was with my mom, I feel like what I did was unforgivable and the people that it affected seem to feel the same way (at least it feels that way because they ignore me as much as possible).  


All I have ever wanted to have was someone there for me who genuinely cared, someone who never had a ""Oh I got to go because bluh bluh"" moment any time I try talking to them, and don't even get me started on my love life! I think I have given up on ever having a romantic relationship because nowadays being a straight white man is illegal for some reason! So I think I might be alone on that. I have tried to have normal friendships and those never ""Spark"" and then the person finds me as an inconvenience.  


So what do I think of all of this? What \*I\* think is the world hates me, why would there be any other reason?! People find me annoying, and bothersome, several people even told me that directly, and I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER MYSELF IN THOSE SITUATIONS, I try to be ""Less annoying"" and ""Less bluh bluh"" but I have no control at all! I am one of the biggest disturbances to everyone around me, so why should I be here? Why should I even try to talk to people? If I don't interact with people, \*maybe\* just maybe people will like me more because I am out of there way, It doesn't matter if I am touch starved or not getting my daily ""Hello"", I want to make people happy and I will do anything to do it, even if I stay lonely forever.  


But even then, will that be enough? Maybe it's my own existence that makes people mad and I should just ""Disappear"" and people will like me more.

  
I am probably overreacting at this point but a lot of things here are true, a lot of people hate me, or ""Don't like me"" and I have seen enough to confirm it, maybe some people would say something if they knew this about me, but at this point I don't even care anymore, everyone I know closely broke my heart one way or another, a lot or a little, I am sorry, I wish I could cry for you&gt;"
lonely,An unrequited crush for 5 years which I can't move on,"An unrequited crush for 5 years which I can't move on - Hello

This seems stupid that I write here but I need some tips regarding my crush which makes me feel like shit inside. The reason is I can't move on because I don't feel anything for other beautiful girls around me. My heart doesn't flutter or skip a beat for other girls and its been like that for 5 years even tho we didn't meet for 2.5 years already. We didn't do any dates we were people who knew each other from high school, parties, university, domirtory but my akwardness and shyness and stupid things I did when I was drunk fucked it all up which I regret so badly and would do differently just to start my relationship from the beginning. We didn't talk a lot in person, in social media. The last time I talked to her was this summer. What I should do? I still didn't confess to her but it would be akward after such time to write something like that. Problem is I can't get over it and it put brakes to get in relationship with other girls."

lonely,Self love…,"Self love… - I think I’ve talked about the topic of “self love” on here before, but I still always cringe when I hear the “love yourself before others will love you.” And, it always comes from people who have large groups of friends and always have a significant other.

It seems (to me) as though it’s easier for someone to love themselves when they have people around them that love and care about them.

I have family, which is nice. But, I honestly don’t really talk to anyone in my family much more than a couple times a months. So, the love/support from them is relatively minimal. And, I do have one friend I talk to from time to time. But, we don’t really have serious, in-depth conversations about life or whatever. So, the support I feel from this relationship is fairly minimal.

So, I always wonder if people who say “love yourself” would actually still feel the same way if they had minimal (or no) social/emotional support from family, friends, or a significant other.

I believe “self love” can be greatly affected by love and support (or lack there of) from external support."

Been alone for a long time and haven't had much luck making new friends. Tried different hobbies and groups but found nothing really addictive to fit with me or did stick with it but ended up losing the friends there due to them moving away much like all my past high school group (all of them either died or moved away to) I really hate distance based friendships and relationships but had one for 5 years with a girl in Malaysia I really loved and visited multiple times but after her parents refused us getting married due to our different religious beliefs I had to call it off fearing she would be sad being in love with a guy she could never marry. I still look at the last picture we took together and think of all the things we opened about. Never had sex cause don't believe it until marriage and felt true love if that's possible with her and every girl I have met now that has sparked a little something in me just disgust me once I find out they aren't virgins or Christian now. I guess fearing of going through that again. All I do now in life is work in a booth by myself at night security guard in a dangerous neighborhood to care for my mom and grandma feeling my life is only to care for them. I don't hate them or anything for this in fact It's all I feel I'm worth for but do wish my weekends could lead me to finding companionship but every where I go is nothing but old people and children around my town. Any one my age I see is a stoner and keep away from that crowd. I just had a lot to vent and thought this would be a good place for help to on what would be a good course of action I would quit my job but I make the most in my family to pay for everything just about so it would be a issue and would cut into my savings by a large margin and socializing online hasn't really done anything I still lack human relations that I crave but have no hand to hold in this pain of my heart.

Then she cheated on me and kicked me out taking me from my 3 children.

She took my self away and I just can't move forward or talk to people.

She called an hour before to tell me that she wasn't ready for a relationship since she had recently gotten out of a serious one. It feels unreal. She was everything I wanted in a partner. She is a very caring, understanding, funny, smart, and hard working person. Never judging me for anything and making me want to be a better person.

lonely,Only want my ex and it's killing me,"Only want my ex and it's killing me - I first got my with ex in 2016. I was looking to learn Portuguese and she English, so we met on a language exchange (2015). I wasn't looking for love but ending up finding it. Since I already wanted to come to Brazil it all worked out. We became crazy for one another, speaking every day and I finally fulfilled my dream of coming back to Brazil (first time was in 2007) in 2016. I stayed with her family for a bit then got my own place. I was crazy in love, but then I had to leave as my visa expired.

To cut a long story short, we were together on and off since 2016 until the end of 2020. One of the main reasons we split is because I have OCD and I really gave her a hard time with my constant questioning. I can't blame her. The guy she was crazy about was bombarding her every day with stupid OCD questions.

Last year we got back together and she was much less passionate. After about 5 months together I suggested we split as the love seemed to be totally one sided (why did I do this 😭?) 

I think if I could get over this OCD it would work out. We work well. However, even after getting this chance last year I messed it up AGAIN.

I feel so useless. I'm a 35 year old male. I'm a good looking guy and get a lot of female attention. Yet the only girl I want is my ex. She actually cared about me. She knew me inside out. We were deeply in love. But I know I hurt her and she seems dead towards me now. We don't talk much. I've tried to be with other girls but it's not the same. I can't stand these self-obsessed girls of Instagram.

Why am I posting this here? Because I feel incredibly lonely. It doesn't help that I'm still in Brazil. I need to make more friends here. I think this pandemic also hasn't helped. I wish this pain would go away and that I could move on to another person. But, as for now, no other girl can compare and this sucks!"

I'm 21. I played too many games in my life, listened to way too much music, watched too many shows and movies. It's all the same every time. I like reading, but I can't just read all the time, because it will end up being as boring as all the things above. A few years ago, when I had 0 friends, I thought that partying a lot is a dream life. Well I now have some friends, but they are just party friends, not long talks friends. Partying and drinking got soooo boring really fast. Today I went out with them, and just went back home before 9 (I'm from Europe), because it was all the same topics as always, all the same places, wasted money. 

So what else is there to do? I'm too old to start take up on some hobbies, because a lot of sports teams recruit only kids. What can I do for myself? I always did everything that would sound cool in front of others, but now that I do not care about others... I have no idea how to better myself. 

Well that's a long story, to ask for some things that would fill up my boring day. Basically I need some things to try out as a young adult, but I have zero idea about what that could be.

lonely,another try,"another try - I met someone a long time ago, when I met them I realized I'd never liked or connected with anyone until then. I also haven't been able to like or connect with anyone since then.

In the end I only knew them for a little bit, and they were mysterious enough that I was able to project my idea of a perfect person onto them. In all likelihood, if they came back I would probably end up disliking them and leaving them like I do everyone else.

I haven't been able to forget that feeling, and now every person I meet just rings hollow to me, so much so that I begin to dislike every single person. Given the chance, I disappear out of everyone's lives. 

I thought it would just be a matter of time, that if I was able to form a connection once I would be able to do it again if I met the right people. I don't need or want love, I just want to connect. I couldn't find anyone here so I blamed my school, then my university, then my country. Even online I've hated and left everyone I've met. I don't know if people out there exist that could fill my stupid and pointless standards, but I don't want to settle for less. 

Normally I'd just apathetically keep on living, but I'm emotional at the moment, so I'm writing a vent post shamelessly hoping that some magical figure that understands me is going through the same problem, that somehow this stupid post on reddit is going to be the key and I won't just end up dismissing everyone again. This isn't the first time I've attempted this, it probably won't be the last, but who cares in the end.

Even if a person like that was reading this, I wouldn't want them to bother. I've stopped trying, in every aspect of my life. I don't even see myself when I look in the mirror. If a perfect person for me really did exist, I wouldn't want to burden them with who I am now. I'm sorry in advance to everyone that feels inclined to console or reach out to me, the chances are that I will end up disliking you."

How do you deal with it? I dont keep in touch with anyone from school. They all went their separate ways and I grew to resent them. Made a few college friends but havent seen them for over a year (cuz pandemic). Im so depressed sometimes and I ponder so much over my previous relationship eventhough it ended a year ago. The events that transpired before the breakup tore me apart. Im so depressed sometimes. I cant find any joy in life. I have nothing to work towards.

After all these years it still hurts so much. I just want my dog back. I've always been alone since I can remember, never been able to form any kind of relationship with people. When I was with her I didn't care though, I was happy knowing she loved me, nothing else mattered.

I tried getting back in contact with them, but they pretty much just might as well have said they don’t have interest in me anymore. It’s so hard being this lonely.

So I joined Meetup a year ago and finally found an event that's along my interests and works with my schedule. I'm rather introverted so it took a lot to gather the courage to go to this.

I arrive 30 minutes early and as the starting time came and went, nobody showed up.

I wanted to make new connections, but by 15 minutes of not seeing anyone, I was feeling dispirited.
Why is it so difficult? I'm always ghosted or told ""I'm busy"". It's depressing after a handful of times..."
lonely,"28M. I'm alone because I'm a smol bean that is afraid to be mean so instead of letting people take advantage of me, I push them away.","28M. I'm alone because I'm a smol bean that is afraid to be mean so instead of letting people take advantage of me, I push them away. - One of the very few things I was taught as a child, was to be polite. But over the years I have learned that people take politeness as a sign of weakness. I never understood why after a few interactions with people, they would start being slightly colder and would talk down to me like I was a child, as well as have me do petty a favors for them. They knew I was afraid to say no. 

That's when I started becoming reclusive. I started to learn to say no to people, and when I did, they would try to appeal to my emotions to make me feel guilty for not letting them take advantage of me. That's when I learned to just not deal with them. Because I knew, once I did their favor, I mattered to them no more. 

Because of that, I forgot how to build relationships... and now I'm suffering all alone. afraid that the person that gets close to me is only in it for themselves. 

I have such a deep distrust for people, but I so deeply crave to be wanted and truly cared for.... I'm a goddamn walking contradiction."

lonely,Why do people suck so much?,"Why do people suck so much? - Always say sweet stuff that they don't actually mean to. But hey! It's just them trying to be 'nice'. Because society is all about trying to look nice no matter how fake your words actually are. And It's your fault for believing them, what a clueless fool! You should have known!

No one actually seems to genuinely care anymore or reach out unless they need something from you, and once they're done, they will discard you. No one seems want to spend time with you either, you need to convince everyone why you're worth someone's time to get a glimpse of attention. No one thinks about anyone else but themselves.

And then there you are! Becoming a loner of the society. Once a loner, people see you as a huge 'red flag', there must be a rational reason why someone is rejected by the society. No one really wants to do anything with you anymore, so you just gotta deal with crippling loneliness each day by yourself. Just give your biggest smile like nothing fucking happens! No one gives a shit that you're dying inside everyday because displaying depression is prohibited too in our society! Don't end your life either like a selfish bitch, because it will create another problems to others, so just snap it out! Welcome to the world, I guess? I don't care how bitter I do sound, for once I want to let it out tonight!"

lonely,Today is my birthday,Today is my birthday - Today is my birthday (26).
lonely,I am desperate to vent,"I am desperate to vent - I am currently studying abroad for high school in Korea, and it is my second year already. I am a week away from the mid-term test, and I suddenly just feel empty and burned out.
The school has been under quarantine for covid since 2020, thus, I have been stuck in the dorm and school ground for almost two years. I can only go out on a selected date, usually once a semester, once during vacation week, or not more than 5 times in summer vacation. In school, due to the education system, most of my time is dedicated to studying, which is from 8:50 am till 9:00 pm. However, in order to keep up my grade, the studying time needs to be until 11:30 pm or even 2:am on average. This is not counting the extra research projects, presentations, and hours I need to fill to graduate.
I have gotten used to the systems, and I have managed to get much higher than average results. However, today I suddenly just feel incredibly tired, and I cannot find nor see any point in, well, doing anything. The homework flow is so constant that when I finish one, another pops up. Studying can be really fun and rewarding, especially the interesting subjects, but I can never have enough time to digest the subject and dig deep into it before I am forced to follow the syllabus, which is quite demanding. My hobbies have been reduced to occasional gaming, small-talk with a small group of friends, and, well, masturbation. I also watch movies and read manga, novels, and do research in my free time, but all of them are starting to get really really repetitive. I feel like I am stuck in a loop, a grind to nowhere and nothing. I can't really share nor talk with my friends that much, as they are also very occupied, and frankly neither of us can afford time for an extended conversation like this without feeling guilty about not studying later. Sleeping also begins to feel like a waste of time. I truly find it hard to find joy anymore.
I have read about solutions online and consult with some people, but I can't really do anything in my situation. I quite literally am incapable of taking a break to get fresh air, as I am confined within the campus with just 7-8 buildings, small enough that I can circle it in 15-20 minutes on the estimate. I can't extend friends group, as I am an international student, making it hard for me to communicate with the native students. The population of internationals is small, no more than 30, and I am already friends with all of them. I am not sure what new hobby to developed, and I am hesitant to put in the time due to numerous demanding tasks. Thus, I am stuck in my routine, and I can at most sneak in some exercising routines, which I admit is very refreshing. My most exciting past time in the past has been cooking, but I cannot now as I have no place nor equipment to cook and clean up. I can't afford to slack off my study, because of my GPA, all of my acquaintances and friend now expect me to perform well.
I can't really complain to my friend, because they all reply like I am having an easy time here. They all see me as a very smart person because of my grade, but I do not feel like one. All I did was study and did all I can do, and it was also hard for me. But to them, it might feel like I did not put any effort at all and still get the highest score. So now I am known as the smart one, but I don't think I am at all, and it is tiring to live up to that expectation. On the contrary, I think they all are smarter and more hard-working than I am. They all came from less affluent families, but they all are so smart and work so incredibly hard. Thus, every time they compliment me, it feels like a mocking insult to me. I admire them so much, their tenacity, their grits, their passion that it feels horrible for me when they put me up just because of my grade.
I was in a relationship here, but it was not an affectionate one. It was the first time I felt so strongly for somebody, and I was truly feeling over the moon when she accepted my confession. However, she has never expressed her feeling for me, regardless if it is just affection or something more, on a physical, verbal, nor emotional level. I truly pour all my effort, attention, and time into that relationship, but I even have to ask if I want to hold her hand. She rarely if not ever show affection on her own, only when we broke up after a 3-weeks break does she start showing affection after I limit my interaction with her. When we were dating, I feel like I was the only one putting in the effort, the emotions, and taking a risk. Thus, I was truly heartbroken when she broke up with me, with the reason being that she cannot stand me. She rant for the entire conversation about how horrible of a person I am, and I truly felt that way for a while. I was only out of that dump when I explained everything to my friend, and they told me I was gaslighted and lied to. However, even now I still wonder if I deserve to be liked, as I have rarely received any form of physical affection, like a hug, a pat on the shoulder, or just, ... something to tell me that... Well, I don't know. I just try hard to be a good person, to mind my word, to show my appreciation to people. I was taught to do this not expecting any rewards, and that when I am being good to people, they will know it in their hearts. I tried really hard to follow that teaching, to be generous without asking for things back, to apologize and try to fix my mistake, to ... be the best person I can be and make my friend's life be less hard.
I am suddenly just tired. Not tired of being nice to people, I want to do that too. It feels nice when they smile and I see that small happiness in their body language. But today, when I went back to the dorm at 11:30 pm, I randomly see a couple. They weren't doing anything special, just walking together in the same direction I do. But I notice some small details, like how they adjust their pace to walk in synchronize, how she grabs his arm affectionately, and just how they are in their own world. I suddenly just froze, and all this exhaustion and feeling of ... lacking something hits me. I don't know what I am feeling, but it is a horrible state to be in.
I am now crying on my bed for no reason and typing out a long paragraph for Reddit, which made me feel better but cost me time that I should have spent studying. I am just stumped. I don't really know what I want to ask, nor what I want to hear. I just feel like sharing it with people who I do not know in real life, so I won't have to worry them. Sorry for ranting this long, and please excuse my English. I am not a native speaker."

When I was a kid, I didn't really struggle with relationships. I was very shy, but I was always able to make friends. People would always invite me to do things, I felt liked and could connect with those around me — despite my shyness.

When I was a young teen my family decided to uproot everything and move to a different continent. I feel like this was the start of my major problems with my anxiety. I felt so much like an alien that it was really hard for me to start and maintain meaningful connections with people, I was too scared.

Throughout high school and college I had various friend groups, but being so anxious, I failed to cement these into anything more permanent. I wouldn't open up about myself, turned down one too many invites to hang out, was too scared to message first. Full self-sabotage before I even realized it. But I didn't feel this loneliness too heavily until after I graduated. My friends all had their closer groups, and I felt desperately alone. I felt like I ruined my own chances.

It was at this point that I worked up the courage to reach out to the singular person I felt a real connection with - someone whom I hadn't spoken with for years. I reached out and we talked every day, finding out that he had missed me just as much as I had. He told me he had feelings for me, and I couldn't ignore mine either, and we got together. I didn't feel as alone, and his support helped me get out of my shell in a way I hadn't before.

A year and a half ago he passed away. It has been the worst for so many reasons. But one of the hardest is the crippling loneliness I now feel along with all this grief. I hardly had anyone I could open up to, or who checked in on me. Covid makes it worse, as I can barely see or meet anyone even if I wanted to in this country, but it all just has been awful.

I have a best friend I made online in the past year and they mean a lot to me. But they also live on the other side of the world, and when they're not around, I feel kinda empty again. And I don't want to be too dependent on them. On some nights I hang out online with the group of friends i adopted from my boyfriend, but I still feel like I'm not fully in it. And every time I try to connect more I feel like there is this barrier making me feel robotic and not allowing me to really be myself.

Just struggling and don't really know what to do. kinda feel hopeless recently."

I feel like crying just thinking about it. - I’m turning 21 soon and I have no friends to celebrate with. I have no idea what I’m going to be doing or if I’m even going to be doing anything at all. I have my family and boyfriend and I still don’t really have anything planned. As much as I love them and am grateful for them being here I just wish I had friends at the end of the day. I feel like I hyped up my 21st birthday and am now expecting something that won’t come true. For the first time ever I feel like I have no circle, no friends and now I don’t even see in the point in celebrating at this point. I feel alone and sad just thinking about it."

I've never felt loneliness this painful before my chest is so tight and I'm so emotional right now, I want a break and I can't deal with this anymore. It hurts so fucking bad I don't have anything else to live for, I don't see myself making it another month."

lonely,Loneliness heightened by health scare,"Loneliness heightened by health scare - Honestly, sometimes I go back and forth with myself. Am I lonely or do I like being by myself- and I’m sure it’s both. But right now it easy to feel really lonely. I came to my hometown because there’s a medical scare I’m going through. With the US healthcare system, this pretty severe scare can’t be seen for two months, but I live near the border and can have the problem assessed in MX over the course of the next two weeks. I normally live with my boyfriend, he’s a senior college student. But since I got (maybe) sick, he brought me to my hometown, back w my family to get treated. It’s hard, my friends here are from high school and have erratic schedules, and honestly by now they are more acquaintances than anything. I stay home day after day, just waiting for doctors appointments to happen. My mom goes to work and has dates, my sister has school and sports and tonight my bf he got to go out with his friends while I stayed home watching greys anatomy. I’m just jealous of everyone, I feel so isolated. And I contain it because I don’t want to ruin anyone else’s happy times with my loneliness. It’s bad enough that I have all of those people worried for me and my health. But rn I just don’t know who to tell or confide in. Normally I guess it’d be my boyfriend, but he had so much fun tonight and that shouldnt be ruined by guilt or worry for me. Anyways, thanks to any one who reads it, sometimes just being heard and acknowledged by another person can help so much."

lonely,A lost soul standing on the edge.,"A lost soul standing on the edge. - First off. No real idea where I'm going with this post. Kind of just writing it as I go along. But I've had a lot on my mind and I figured I should actually write it. As a heads up. This is not a suicide thing or anything like that. Just my thoughts that stem from my loneliness and for the first time I feel like I should just put them out there. Express myself for once I guess.   


 First off I'm writing this while listening to chill music. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAhvvQQurw4&amp;t=72s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAhvvQQurw4&amp;t=72s) Really good for just thinking if you like chill old-school 80's techno. Goes by Synth/Chillwave now. It's not mine I just have it playing if you wanna get into the same kinda mindset as me while you read this.  


 Anyways. I said this stems from my loneliness. This is true but it goes far beyond that. My life has been a rough one. I don't like comparing because everyone's life is hard in its own ways and you can never truly know the pain someone else is in. Even shared pain is not the same among us. But I've never really had the chance to finish school or go to college. But I'm blessed with natural abilities that let me excel in anything I set my mind to. I turn 30 next month and it has had me thinking a lot about my life. Where I've been and where do I wanna go from here.  
  My biggest thoughts are why am I alone? I've only had 2 GF's in my life. One is actually an ex-wife of 7 years. Getting into that is a story in and of its self. But long story short she cheated on me. In fact, both of them did. No idea why. I was raised by a single mother and she taught me right on how to be a good man in a relationship. But they just didn't seem to think so. My divorce was in 2019 and since then I've been up and down in emotions since then. 

  
 For years I stopped using social media. But recently I had to relog into my Facebook account cuz my roommate needed something. Well, I got notifications about my ex's cuz that is what Facebook does.  I did what everyone does. What you really shouldn't do. I clicked on them and found out they both moved on and had families. This upset me of course. But after I let that original sting subside I started really looking at it. They both settled for less. The ex-wife is now with well.....Trailer Trash. Not saying it to be mean or anything. But like actual red neck drinks all day asshole. The first GF is with an actual gangbanger working on her 2nd kid from 2 different guys.

 Personally, I never put myself on any kind of pedestal. But did they really sink that low? I thought I was bad sitting here feeling sorry for myself. Like I'm just some bad person who ruins everything. But no. In that same time period, I've met great friends. Move to a whole different state and started a new life. But as much as I want to think I'm better. In some ways I actually am. These women left deep scars on me. I honestly don't think I can trust someone anymore. At least not on that emotional level. This pains me because I'm the type of guy that if you told me you always wanted to do something. I would make it our next date. Not to be some kind of pleaser or anything. But because it would make them happy. Makes it something truly special. It could be skydiving(I'm deathly afraid of heights btw) or just sitting at Mcdonald's at 3 am watching cat videos and laughing when we both got work in 3 hours.

It honestly never mattered to me exactly what me or the person I'm with was doing. As long as we were happy then I'm happy. But lately, it just does not seem that the world really works that way anymore. I've tried dating app's and it's either bots or people looking for something insanely specific. It pains me that all these people. All these singles. Male or female. Are so willing to pass up so many chances at happiness just because of XYZ. Course I'm not saying you can't have standards. But it happens so often that it's one of two extremes. Either they bullseye on the 1 thing they don't like while ignoring all the good or they focus on the 1 thing that's good while ignoring the blatant minefield of toxic behavior.

 Turning 30 does not make me old. In fact, I'm still pretty young. But I'm definitely an old soul. Too many people want to play games with relationships and emotions and I really just don't want to play the game anymore. I really don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. More than likely as I continue to build my new life and push forwards as I always have. I will meet someone at some point. But I don't feel like gaining any more battle scars on my soul for it. If I end up alone then I'm fine with it. If I meet someone then I hope I can learn to let someone in again and not be afraid anymore. The edge I'm standing on where I can either fall in love or fall into obscurity. I've accepted either outcome and will continue to try living happily within it. If you made it to the end I want to personally say thank you for taking the time and hope that you as well can learn to be happy in your own way in this life. 🌹✌"
lonely,So I want to know where I went wrong.,"So I want to know where I went wrong. - So I’ve been hanging out with this girl for a while because we had the same class breaks and met through a mutual friend. After a while of just hanging out she started flirting and we were doing it for a bit and she’d have me over and start cuddling with me. I was gonna make things official but then she started going through tough times with her friends and her parents and I just wanted to be there for her. She had a chance to go home and she her sister which I encouraged her to go on and she said she felt really happy when she visited. When she got back though I just got treated like mincemeat. All the flirting ended, messages were kept brief, and read receipts got turned off. When she got back I was excited to see her but I maybe I didn’t give her enough space? I tried to seal the deal since she did seem happier and she said yes to a date but said that it’d be a while and now I can barely even talk to her. Did I mess up and be too clingy?"

December of last year I lost the couple of friends that I had and it's kind of bitter sweet. On one hand I've been able to really search myself out and learn about myself and I used to be suicidal but I've controlled that aand turned my major anxiety into an advantage instead of a disadvantage and despite my loneliness I'm honestly in the best mental health shape I've ever been in. But on the other hand it really sucks not having anyone to talk to, not having anyone who cares. I'm a happy optimistic person, and I dont see any reason to be depressed by loneliness, but it still is a bummer. I found this sub kind of as a joke but I figured I'd make a post. If anyone who reads this needs a friend or just someone to talk of vent to, hmu. I keep a busy schedule to make my time go by fast every day, but I'm always down for a good convo.

lonely,Sometimes I “forget” I’m alone,"Sometimes I “forget” I’m alone - I live alone. I work alone. I haven’t been able to make more than a casual acquaintance with anyone (who usually ghosts) in two years.

Sometimes I forget I’m alone in the moment. My weekends are usually the same: chores, shopping, tv, videogames, walk around outside. And only when I look back after do I realize oh I didn’t speak a word all weekend. Or I saw 0 people in a week. Sometimes media; podcasts, movies, tv etc makes me feel like I socialized in some horribly sad way.

Friday night and I’m going into yet another lonely weekend with no plans."
lonely,I am a passenger in my own life.,"I am a passenger in my own life. - External Forces. They are at the core of my life. I love routine. I crave predictably. I struggle to be the director of my life.. 

External forces change everything. Every night I wish for a great external force that changes my life. Sometimes I even admit that I'd be cool with a horrible external force, if only to change everything. Because I'm just enduring this life I've created. 

But I have no control over the timing of external forces. I know they're coming. I just don't know when. Meet the perfect girl tomorrow? Maybe. Get in a horrible car accident tomorrow? Maybe. 

I've had some horrible external forces in my years. Compared to my ""peers"" I believe I've been through more suffering. But my life is also super plush. I'm so lucky to live such a soft life. But I still am so lonely. I'm still so trapped in the routine. I feel powerless to change it, even though I have all the power. So I wait for the external force to reveal the next stage. And I pray that it's positive."
lonely,Difficult to be loved,"Difficult to be loved - Some time ago, I was scrolling through Pinterest and I find this pic that says “Im sorry someone has make you feel like you’re difficult to be loved”.

The people that I called “friends” barely talked to me if I didn’t started the conversation or approach them, and when I do their faces changed to one annoyed and it became hella difficult not to cry there trying to finish what I was saying or simply shutting myself mid sentence cause I feel it didn’t matter that much anyway.
Then I realize, f*** this have been happening my whole life with everybody, my family, friends, everybody.
I just don’t want to feel like it doesn’t matter or that I’m difficult to be loved.
Have so many things to say but I don’t want to start crying again."

lonely,"Should I escalate things with my friends by calling out their bullshit in the group chat, or just let it go again.","Should I escalate things with my friends by calling out their bullshit in the group chat, or just let it go again. - Another weekend where all I have is time. And I know none of them are working and have nothing going on as well. They are the only friends I have in this city and I’m afraid that if I just stopped trying to do things with them I would be absolutely, truly alone. I don’t want that, so I cling to the notion that these people are still my friends…

I sent a message the other day about wanting to grab food or just go downtown since there’s events in my city that are free and the weather is nice. One said he was down. Great. The other said he needed to check his schedule. Alright, that’s fair. Well now it’s the weekend. I text them and try to get something going. I’ve learned my lesson by all the times of being ignored that instead of arbitrarily listing times, specifically put times and locations. Anything to solidify plans.

Silence. Why am I not surprised. And I can even see that the mother fuckers saw and read my post, and continued to ignore me. I’m so tired of being ignored. I have no friends. I want to just sever ties with them right here and now and call them out for all of this BULLSHIT! But then I won’t have anyone to talk to. God what do I do. I’m going out tomorrow afternoon and getting a beer by myself like I usually do. 

Any help?"

lonely,I feel like I’ve missed out on so much,"I feel like I’ve missed out on so much - So hey. I’m a senior in high school, and to put it bluntly, I feel as the entirety of my school years have been a wash, particularly the last few ones. I changed schools before the 8th grade, and while I never was a social butterfly at my old district, I kinda sorta knew people and did things and maybe high school was going to be okay. But then I changed schools, something I welcomed at first as a fresh start but…nothing happened. I made no friends these past four or so years, and it certainly isn’t going to change now. I’ve never hung out with someone after school on the weekend, never been invited any where, never added anyone to my contacts, never had a need to download Snapchat or any other social media, never anything—you get my point. I *tried* somewhat, joined a club or two in ninth grade, continued them even for a few years, but never made an actual connection and I left whatever I joined. And the worse part is that *I* did this to myself, no one else to blame. But I don’t even know what I’m doing wrong. 

‘What’s wrong with me?’—this question hits me from time to time. But I have no answer. I mean, I take care of myself so I’m not physically repellent. I try my best to be polite and conscientious and appropriately jocular—granted I’m awkward and shy, but many people like this do just fine. I have hobbies and interests, and I can talk about them to no end. I can keep going. I’m just at a loss. There’s just some ‘spark’ that I’m missing that everyone else has. I’ve tried to find it, honest, but nothing has turned up. I’m doing something wrong, but I can’t quite identify it.

But it’s too late now, at least for high school. By senior year, everyone has got their friend groups, and everyone is off busy with classes and college applications. God knows, so am I. I think I transferred my frustrations into academics. Somehow I clawed my way into the top 20 out of a class of 500 or so, so I can’t complain there. But I can’t help but feel it’s all been so worthless. I don’t have a single good or memorable experience here. Nothing truly meaningful, nothing that I haven’t ruined, nothing that I won’t forget (for good reasons). I know college is around the corner, but I can’t help but just mope about on how much I missed out on. I’ll never have old high school friends to reminisce out, no conversations to remember fondly, no memories of stupid stuff done for fun—nothing.

And I’m worried about college too. If I ruined high school for myself, whose to say I won’t ruin college for myself as well? I know myself too well, and I know I’m nowhere near finding the “secret” of human connection. It’s all so tiresome.

lonely,I feel so empty and unimportant in this world,"I feel so empty and unimportant in this world - Sorry, this is probably going to be really whiney, I'm really sad right now.  
I'm not doing good lately. Actually I was feeling this way for years. I feel like I haven't spent the last five years living at all. Just... existing somehow. Everyone left me who meant something to me in the past and I feel like I don't have anything left to give. They all took a piece of me with them and now I'm just empty, I don't know who I am, I don't know what I'm supposed to do and I'm incapable of forming new friendships. It overwhelms me and I always worry about ruining everything, which is like a self fulfilling prophecy somehow. Even though there are billions of people in this world, I feel alone, like no one actually wants to get to know me and I can't blame anyone but myself. I'm just an insecure mess who lives in the past and to be honest, I just want to be found, I just want someone to find me and say that I'm not as worthless as I think I am.  
I want friends so badly. I want to laugh with them about stupid insider jokes, I want to travel with them, go to concerts together and to be able to honestly say that there are people who I care about and who also care about me, without any doubt. I want friends I can rely on. People I could invite to my wedding if I'd ever get married, who would actually come, and who would be happy for me, too.  
The people I used to care about in the past left me when I needed them the most. Or tossed our friendship away when they couldn't get a use out of it anymore. It always felt one-sided, like I wasn't really important anyway, no matter how hard I tried to be a good friend. I was just a back-up to many of them, when their ""real friends"" somehow weren't available. It makes me so sad that this is all I seem to deserve."

Even though I was good at making friends, I just....kept losing them. I lost my bestest friend to cancer. Lost 3-4 friends to suicide...shit's just never been good. But then i found this one BIG group and I was one of the most respected and like one of the most loved people in the group because I fit perfectly in and you know it just...felt right. Basically, I joined this group along with my best friend at that time in the month of March of 2020 and it took us literally no time to fit in and get friendly with everyone. Im a very introverted and awkward person but  if someone strikes a conversation with me I dont really have a problem continuing the conversation. Anyways, so last year in the month of December I started dating this one girl from the friend group and we hit it off really REALLY well. Before we started dating we even had an agreement that if we broke up it should not affect the friend group in anyway. We dated for 9 months  then last month around the 23rd we broke up and shit started to become apparent right after it. I started to get ignored more often, people stopped texting me, people just....stopped caring completely. Even the BEST FRIEND I joined with made a new best friend so he also stopped giving a singular shit about me. And now ive stopped talking in the groupchat's completely. Its been around 3-4 days and ive not received a single text from anyone there. Im gonna be leaving the groupchat soon and ill be cutting them off permanently. Im sorry if my grammar is kinda weak im just not in a  good mental state right now. The worst part is, these were people I thought would never leave me. Never. NEVER. I had never met such a perfect group of idiots. It was like a second family to me. Tbh I loved this family more than my own because my own family has some issues I dont want to get into that. I always knew that shit would go wrong after the break up but honestly I didnt know it would be this bad, that id be completely thrown out of the spotlight. Funny part is, ive been in the group longer than my ex and i used to be way closer to everyone there. I just....feel so neglected and its like I am not even cared about. Im not suicidal dont worry LOL im used to this happening. But its just....it still hurts alot. I mean i do end up blaming myself for everything which bothers me even  more because  its not really my fault. We broke up mutually because it was bloody obvious shit wasnt going to work out and  the smart thing to do was ending it before it could get any worse. To add salt to the wound, I had this online best friend, lets call him M, even he abandoned me around a month ago. So basically I used to be an avid gamer and I met him through a streamer's chat so our friendship really started through csgo. but I have now grown out of video games. i physically cannot enjoy playing a video game anymore. No offense to people who do. But just because I dont play games anymore he has stopped giving my attention at all. He used to be the one who used to say shit like \*we are more than friends who game together you can tell me anything\* but now whenever I used to text him, he used to   reply in 1 or 2 words or used to leave me on read. So I stopped texting him as well and now its been 2 weeks since we have spoken. He doesnt even care anymore. No one does. Absolutely no one cares about me. Oh wait but theres more. Ive always struggled with depression and ADHD. So I had this one friend from the friend group who used  to live like......30 houses away from mine so we used to walk daily together and these 2 hours walks used to be extremely therapeutic for me. Because I just genuinely enjoyed his company ALOT. ALOT. He was one of my closest friends ever. But he also had to shift to another state in the beginning of this month. Shit is just....not good. Im being abandoned by everyone. I have absolutely no friends at all and I honestly.....dont know what I should do. I mean, I severely struggle making friends online because I find the whole \*send a text randomly\* thing weird. Am I such a horrible person ? Is it my fault ? I dont really know....but ive always struggled with  friends. Even my sister and my cousin neglects me and my father is never around or always busy with his tv shows and my mother is an abusive alcoholic. Life is horrible right now. All the people I considered the closest to my heart have all abandoned me and left me to rot. And now im just...an empty confused shell wondering what should be my next move.    


Just some extra information I want to add, Me and the girl had the most healthy breakup possible.   
The best  friend I joined the group with I had known since 2nd grade. (Im in 11th)   


But I am still......gonna hang on because I atleast have one person to live for. That is my best friend since birth. Me. Because theres also a good side to this. Now I have the  chance to find better people and the motivation to find better people as well. People who will actually care for me. And not leave me. But ive been repeating this process ever since I was born and no one has stuck...... :(   
Ill not give up though."
lonely,ugh,"ugh - people are so hard to understand, christ. I hate not knowing how to respond to other people when they say the randomness shit. I feel like a robot going through the motions and not get annoyed when other's around me take long or don't stay on topic. is this the result of being isolated all my life? does it ever get better, do people become more tolerable and easy to be around. everyone doesn't feel real to me. anything someone says irl I just respond with: ""nervous chuckle"" ""PLEASE-"" ""yea.."" or ""oh yea.""

I really don't like people, like as a thing. Tolerable sure, sometimes fun to be around but I really cant stand anyone for a long period. maybe im just not around the right ones ???, but it feels like everyone is simple and I can't find a way to fit myself in with them."
lonely,an outsider,"an outsider - I feel so frustrated. I've never had a first kiss/sex. I don't think I even had a real crush on someone since 5th grade.  I hate feeling outside of the loop of everything. All the kids in my school are so put together and have their identities so fucking put together. I have no sense of self and my closet is a wreck... The friends I do have can be are extremely annoying, sometimes I can't stand to be around them but I have no other option unless I want to become a social outcast again. My family, friends, parents, all feel so very distant. My teenage years are slipping away and I fucking hate it."
lonely,my partner has an excuse for everything,"my partner has an excuse for everything - I've been dating this person for six months. in that six months, I've never heard this person speak. We never do anything online. Anytime I bring up about meeting up or even talking online I'm met with every excuse in the book. She is never there for me when I need her. this is supposed to be a serious relationship and it feels more like small talk. I really want this person out of my life"
lonely,I feel increasingly separated from those close to me and I feel like I'll be lonely for life.,"I feel increasingly separated from those close to me and I feel like I'll be lonely for life. - I'm a 24M currently living with my single mom and brother. I just graduated from college and really want to move on with my life and live on my own, but I've had health issues that have kept me from working or doing anything social over the past year, although I've tried to keep as busy as I can.

Over the past couple of days, I've felt so lonely that my chest is tight and my head feels like it will implode.

I have a small, but very tight group of friends, but lately I've felt distant from them and my family. Everyone I know is Christian. I grew up in a Christian house, attended Christian life groups, went to a Christian highschool, and was very involved in all of those. Over the past couple of years, I've come across some things that have made me question the faith and as of now, I wouldn't consider myself any religion. My friends and family still love me, but I feel so disconnected because they are all Christians. I feel outcast and separated from them and I have incredible guilt because I feel like I've let them down by renouncing my faith. I have also reached the age where my friends are moving or starting families anyway.

I've never even been on a date. I've asked two girls out, but got rejected by both. My friends are starting to get married and yet here I am never getting noticed by anyone. I've gained weight due to my illness and I feel so unattractive. Doesn't help that I'm 5""6'. I haven't talked to a girl in ages and I can't really get out or date rn because of my circumstances. Every time I watch anything with a girl showing a guy any attention, especially anime, I feel so depressed and lonely it's overwhelming. The closest I've felt to a girl is watching Projekt Melody livestreams, which I know is ultimately empty. I feel like due to my uncertainty in faith and my current situation I will never meet anyone. I just feel so pathetic never having been on a date as a 24 year old.

The loneliness and desire is so overwhelming that nothing I try to relieve it works. It just comes back. To be clear, I am not suicidal at all, but sometimes I imagine putting a gun to my head and pulling the trigger because it's the only way I can think of to make the thoughts stop.

I've felt trapped at home for years and every time there is a glimmer of hope, it's ripped away. I question every day if I will ever escape the pit I feel I'm in."
lonely,My first group outing!,"My first group outing! - It was a group for filming a project. I had no problems talking to them face to face, and we even shared a few laughs. 

There's this invisible force field around me, forcing me to stay a certain distance from them. Not too far that they can't hear me, but not too close for them to pat me on the back. I've never been like this around my friends. Around my classmates. It was as if I was a leper. 

We didn't really get to talk about ourselves a lot. Two of them seemed to know each other very well, talking about each other's preferences and every minute detail from when they woke up. They talked about how beautiful the trees were, and how adorable the little dog on the sidewalk is. They shared memories, laughs and hugs.

As I am writing this I am sitting on a bench, feeling my insides churn, dazed and gasping for air."

lonely,"30/M Just looking for woman to talk to. Not even in a sexual sense, just have no female friends I can talk to on the regular","30/M Just looking for woman to talk to. Not even in a sexual sense, just have no female friends I can talk to on the regular - Title says it all. I get tired of bullshitting around with ""the guys"" and I wish I had more friends of the opposite sex to talk to. Especially when I have depressive cycles and I feel isolated, because having deeper mental conversations with other guys always feels off and weird. I'm not looking for a hookup, just someone who is willing to talk regularly so that we're not all so alone.

Before lock down, I tried to get out and go hiking or see random movies, however I'm also into the typical nerdy stuff. Gaming, MCU and random streaming things, I occasionally dabble in anime. I also enjoy discussing theories about the universe or psychology, the way the brain works is fascinating."

Like its always every single person i just want someone to understand me and just be my friend or something. People suck i cant find one good person that makes me feel good. Im almost everyday in a state of shit. School is shit home is shit and ""friends"" are shit. My life sucks i always put in a lot of energy to talk to someone and no one ever gives me the energy back... I dont think anyone actually likes me. Im ugly asf. Honestly just felt like this after i thought all was going good with this guy and thought we would actually be friends :) i complimented him and he was nice about it. He suddenly blocked me out of no where mid convo and got this burst of memories. Should i rlly blame him? he dosent even know me. But so many people in my life has gone. Maybe its me? Most of my friends ignore me when i text them. Wtf Idk. Thats not even all of it... I feel like shit."

lonely,some days are tough reminders ._.,some days are tough reminders ._. - I often struggle with feeling isolated and reserved from the world around me. At a loss of trust with the people in my life that I surround myself with I try to turn to strangers I meet online. Hoping that maybe my resolve is with someone I just haven’t met yet gives me at least one reason to stick around. I know truthfully that the only real solution will be found with myself and perhaps that’s why I like to stay distracted. I don’t think I want to get to know myself anymore than I have. I’ve felt so alone with myself for so long that I’m sick of my company. I want to know what it feels like to be appreciated and loved without an exception; someone to be proud of me. It’s pretty lame of me I must say so I think i’ll stop talking now but you get the point. It would be selfish of me to think only I can feel so alone •~•
lonely,just spent my whole birthday alone,"just spent my whole birthday alone - Well tbh at first I was feeling a bit sad and lonely especially when the only birthday wish that I had was a quick phone call from my parents, but I got up went to class took a shower and went out for dinner by myself grabbed some booze to celebrate and tbh even though I felt lonely I got to do some writing ( a thing that that I didn't do for 3months) and guess I had and I'm having a good time being here with only my thoughts. So guess I'm writing this to say to people that it's okay to feel lonely from time to time  (I've been feeling like this for the past 3 years) but just stay strong it will pass, for the time being try to do things that you love doing and that you might not have a chance to do them later in life"

lonely,Hopelessly obsessed with a female celebrity for the second time in my life,"Hopelessly obsessed with a female celebrity for the second time in my life - I never thought this would happen to me a second time. This is a long and very personal story that I've never told, not even anonymously online. Only my therapist and close relatives know. 

About ten years ago, when I was 20, I put an episode behind me during which I was obsessed with an actress for about 6 years straight. Not exaggerating. Everyday I would go to the fansites, check the papparazzi pics and so on. Watched literally every movie and interview she was ever in. I still got a pile of 20 DVD's lying around that I'm too embarrassed to sell.

Several times a day, I would wonder what she was doing, what she would think of me. I checked the timezones and estimated when she would sleep, and when she would be awake, depending whether she was in New York, LA or Sydney. Guessing by the time of day, I would fantasise about what she was doing. When it was her birthday, I kept congratulating her in my head. I hated every man she ever dated from the bottom of my soul. When one of her ex partners died, I laughed and cheered when I saw it on the news. I'm just telling you that to give an idea of how deep this obsession goes with me.

So I couldn't just sit idly by forever. I had to meet her. Through a fan site, I ran into someone who knew her address in New York (I'm from Europe). I figured yeah right, there's no way. But when I checked the address on google street view, I quickly found out, through my large archive of papparazzi photo's, that a specific graffiti marking on google street view matched a marking in one of the papparazzi photo's shot outside her house. Then I was certain.

So I went out there. With my mom, grandmother, and baby nephew for christ sake. They all thought I just wanted a fun trip to New York. But it was only about her. Only my mom knew that beforehand, or at least had an idea. So we went there, to the address. We went there, she wasn't waiting outside her building of course, why would she be? Even then, as a 17 year old boy, I was smart enough to realise I couldn't just ring her doorbell. That I was a stalker basically. So we came back later the same day, and waited. All four of us.

By some freak twist of fate that still has me reeling when I think about it, she actually showed up. Not leaving her appartment, but going toward it, with a stroller, her two sons, and her husband by her side. He saw me, us, sitting there. I had my camera ready, and took pictures. I still have them. My hands were so shaky, you can't tell who's in the pictures unless you know before looking. We were sitting pretty far away. Luckily, he didn't approach us.

So that was the end of it. I was extatic just to have seen her with my own eyes for a moment. But that quickly changed when I realised we still hadn't technically met each other. I realised I had failed.

When I arrived back home from New York, sitting in my room all by myself, I cannot describe to you the botomless emptiness I felt inside. My life was over. I no longer felt the need to pursue her, but I did feel like a failure. After that my obsession lingered for some time. Then it gradually became weaker. At age 19, I got my first girlfriend. After my relationship with her ended, the spell that actress had put on me was definitively broken. 

Nowadays I can comfortably say I couldn't care less about that woman. I still see why I was attracted to her, but the magic spell she had cast on me has become completely impotent. A few years ago, I heard she divorced her husband from the photo's I took. When I shrugged at the news, and felt nothing, I knew she would never bother me again.

Enter 2021. I saw a movie I absolutely adored about four months ago. The actress in it was cute. I had only ever seen her in one other movie, and somehow missed all the others, as if fate was trying to protect me from her charm and power over me. Didn't think much of it. I was actually so confident in my being over these types of obsessions, that I saw no harm in watching a few more of her movies. Big mistake. I already recognise all the symptoms I felt ten years ago. It's all coming back, like a chronic disease. It's like I've been thrown into a time portal back to where I was then. I thought I had grown, became a better man, someone too confident to show this type of pathetic behaviour. But i was wrong.

Now I'm shaken to my core to see I'm still that insecure boy. I'm no man at all. I haven't grown. The last ten years of life, have been pure stagnation. Having had a real relationship, didn't change me like I thought it did. It's hard to describe this feeling. It's pure hopelessness, powerlessness, madness. The only cure, my heart tells me, is to go find her. To stalk her, and all of those stupid things that lead to ruin. In my mind I've actually concocted a plan to, get this, \[I\]become a Hollywood Composer and meet her by composing a soundtrack for one of her movies\[/I\]. That way I can meet her without being a creep. If that isn't pure madness, I don't know what is. I barely know how to work Garageband at this stage, and I'm 30 years old. By the time I'm that good, she'll probably be happily married. Right now, she's 24. I'm not sure whether meeting her is even enough, or whether this time I want a relationship. 

Needless to say, I don't want any of this. I want it to go away, to feel normal again. I don't want to set a goal for myself that's this difficult to achieve. Before this second obsession, my goal was simply to make a living creating music. If I could achieve even that, my life would feel like pure bliss, I thought. But now...everything feels ruined. Dead ends all around me. Nothing matters to me but her. 

I realise this is all way too heavy for this forum. But the forum for the actress in question on reddit only allows photo posts, no text. I won't mention her name because I'm extremely delicate right now. Someone could blurt out some fact about her in response to my topic that I wasn't aware of, and send my emotions reeling. The fansites also lack forums. So where else can I go? Back into therapy? I can't believe this...

Is there anyone, anyone at all, who understand how I feel? Please tell me, did you heal yourself? Can you live your life normally and forget? I am on my knees begging for a solution to this. I don't want to go through this again. This time it will break me. I won't survive it."

I talked to people but just the standard conversation, what course you studying e.t.c and nothing more. 

While waiting for my Uber this random guy spoke to me and he talked about he was a PHD student, we had a lovely little conversation. When said “it sucks to be lonely, I feel you.” that’s when it hit me. I’ve talked to lots of people and have little conversations here and there, but ultimately I’m lonely.

So, I eventually get tired of it and unfollow them on social media or whatever and delete their numbers if I have them. Then, a couple weeks later, I get the “I miss you” text/message. Always kinda makes me chuckle because they never seem to miss me when I needed someone to talk to.

No matter what I talk about.. even just mushroom foraging.. everyone is fixated on one thing and when they find out they can't have it they either disappear or randomly throw sexual comments at me just often enough to ruin my day knowing nobody is truly listening to what I have to say. I tried only being friends with women.. but a.. no matter how long we're friends.. and no matter how much I avoid eye contact or talking to their significant other... the moment their SO meets me.. the woman friend slowly stops talking to me.. no matter how much I ignore their SO.. It really hurts. I've never found a solution. I stopped wearing make up entirely, doing my hair, only wear T shirts and jeans. I should clarify I used to try to be genuinely nice to their SO like anyone would but.. I was seen as a problem for having done so.. so I slowly I switched to ignoring all SOs and only talking when necessary. Does anyone have any advise on wtf to do?

Im in long distance a relationship since over a year now and i do love her (ig). But sometimes i feel like i cant be the person she needs and i also kinda sometimes feel like she isnt the really right one for me. Things that keep me in the relationship are the fact that i still love her ig, that i cant do it to her because she is mentally absolutely not stable and needs me. Also it would probably be a lot of stress and yes ik, if its just because that i should think about why i actually stay but it just be like that, pls respect that. An other reason is that i kinda feel like I need an emotional relationship with 1 or more persons. Its not like i dont have friends, but i dont have a relationship that would be ""enough"" or whatsoever to call it. The problem with my current gf is that she is something a bit too demanding for me and i cant be there for her enough. Yeah just wanted to share this,  it also took me some energy to write it down.

Good afternoon, everyone!Introduce myself so you can get to know me.

I am a lovely girl who likes romanticism.If you want, you'd better come from the United States, because I'm from Singapore. I like reading books, because it can enrich my knowledge.I like running because it can sharpen my will. I am lively, cheerful, enthusiastic, persistent and strong-willed. However, it is not easy for me to know some American friends because my English is not very good.

I often travel to different parts of the United States, but the pandemic has stopped me.I hope there will be more opportunities in the future.If someone can stay together, we can build deeper friendship, help each other and make everything better and better in the future.

Send me a message so we can get to know each other, be friends or travel together."
lonely,Not quite the university life I imagined,"Not quite the university life I imagined - I'm currently studying within my 3rd year of university and I have to say, it hasn't been all it's cracked up to be. I'm fortunate that I really enjoy the topic I'm studying, however, socially things have been quite difficult. Along with not being very academically gifted in secondary school, I was quite a self-isolated kid. I had friends, but never made the effort to go out and see people. It's safe to say tbat I'm quite an introverted person who struggles to push myself out of my comfort zone. I was content staying home and playing video games, which was okay at the time, but has become less satisfying as I've gotten older.

I left secondary school with not the best grades and if I wanted to go to university one day, I would have to attend college (which is a step before Uni for us here in the UK). I studied really hard in college to make sure I could go to Uni and didn't really give myself many opportunities to make friends. I stuck to the belief that Uni would be a fresh start for me, where I could meet more people and find my group. 

My first year of Uni was quite tough. I was meeting new people and making friends on my course, however I still struggled academically which meant I had to repeat one of my modules. This meant being held back a year, while the rest of my cohort moved on and I unfortunately lost contact with a lot of them. Since it was only one module I had to resist, I was only attending Uni for one lecture the entire year, which didn't really give me the opportunity to get to know the new first years that I was now a part of."" That's okay though"" I thought, ""I still have 3 years after this so there's plenty of time"". I also decided I would use the extra time that year to get a job and earn some extra money while I wasn't in University that much. Again I believed 2nd year would be a new start.

Unfortunately for me, Covid-19 had other ideas for both myself and every other student in the world. Gone were my in Uni lectures and seminars, gone went my city's night life, gone went the chance to join clubs and gone went my chances to meet new people. It wasn't all bad. I was able to meet some of my cohort through online studying but it just wasn't the same. That year was so tough to work through, but I pulled through and now I've reached my 3rd year.

I'm currently on placement this year, which I'm really enjoying as it's a great change of pace from being stuck indoors due to Coivd. However, this takes up nearly all my time and the rest cohort is in the same boat. I decided this year I wouldn't let life just pass me by, so I pushed myself to do things like join the volleyball club to meet new people, become student rep of my year to engage more with my cohort and spend my time doing things outside my flat like going to cafes to read. I really want to push myself outside my comfort zone so that I don't feel so trapped and it's being going really well. However, things are still early days and I'm often still feeling that strong sense of loneliness at times. I know that I'm doing the right thing to put myself out there, but I can't help but feel the weight of having a long road ahead of me.

If you made it this far and read part of my life's story then thank you. I'm not really looking for advice, this was just a means for me to put my thoughts out there and see if anyone can relate in some way. I feel like I'm making a positive change in my life, but I know that growing comes with it fair share of pains also."
lonely,Just utterly alone!,"Just utterly alone! - It hit me very hard these last few days. I have learned to cope with loneliness from growing up a lonely child.

I am estranged from ALL of my family, they are not all bad but the good ones also aren't good people. If it is not outright vitriol and violence then it is an endless supply of problems they want you to be burdened by to help them survive because we share the same blood. 

If that wasn't enough the place we lived in, the city I come from, it is on the list of most violent places on the Planet. It just so happens to not be in the middle east, but also not in an industrialized country. The things you experience, the people, what human beings do to each other, it is horrible. No matter who you are you do not leave that without carrying it inside you the rest of your life.

The only way to get ahead in life was to leave and sever ALL ties. 

My life got better the day I left home, left the country, and got the cheapest smallest apartment I could afford when I was 18. That place was 300sqft no furniture and it was incredible. It felt like I chopped off a gangrenous limb. Sure I lacked a limb but the pain was gone and the wound healed, though the limb never ever grows back.

Needless to say that type of upbringing makes you a very bad person on the inside. I spent years learning all the ways that life made me angry, made me prone to violence, made to quick and willing to bend the rules. It takes constant round the clock will power to keep yourself in check. Years and years of carving out neuropathways that prevent you from getting angry at the slightest of things. You have such jelousy over everyone that had a better life, hearing someone talk about golfing or taking tennis lessons growing up. It makes it impossible to relate with ANYONE at ALL. 

To have any kind of human contact requires maintaining a constant fascade, if they tell me about their lives I have to pretend that my life was just as nice and I pretend I can relate or else I've lost them. You can't respond with the truth, ""Oh you did this and this with your parents, well my father was in prison growing up, my mother was too drunk to know I was alive""...lol yeah that will have them inviting me to parties real soon. So all people relationships I have are superficial, no one knows about the blackhole inside my soul because to show that would further alientate me. Would I even have a job? 

I end up knowing people but they never truly know me, nor do they want to. Because being around people like me is toxic, the same toxicity that suffocated me growing up. Alone I can breathe and let people breathe

I have my dog, and that keeps me going. People think I'm crazy for loving my dog so much, but to me he is my son, my best friend, my brother, my family."
lonely,"36F Almost 40, they say 40 year old women are scary, especially single and divorced, although I don't have kids, I guess you are like me? How did you start your new relationship?","36F Almost 40, they say 40 year old women are scary, especially single and divorced, although I don't have kids, I guess you are like me? How did you start your new relationship? - Time in a hurry, I feel terrible, not old, but old, still didn't get your own happiness, and family, I am a economic independent woman, partner request is very low, self-motivated, good to me, don't expect the other side of the economy is better than me, but at least they can handle their basic life, I don't think anyone would like to know one, in a network is it?"
lonely,Forever DC'd,"Forever DC'd - I am starting to think there's no fix. No cure. A childhood of being consistently devalued, unwanted, thrown away, taken back, thrown away again has deprived me the ability to feel any human connection beyond physical. 

I have no trust, no faith or belief that anyone actually cares. And I don't think there is anything that would actually ever change that. I have a partner of 8 years. And I often feel just as disconnected to her, as I do a stranger. Oh, I love them. I truly care. I even let down most of my barriers somehow. 

But if the connections a 2 lane bridge, the lane coming to me has long crumbled and fallen into the river. 

I had hope. A friend, who I didn't feel the need to protect myself from. Someone who called me family. Someone I could do the same.  And then, suddenly there was a fight between them and my partner, over a conflicting communication style and trauma responses. They weren't friends anymore in a matter of hours, and who could say where I was with them. They assured me we would still be friends. And then, they were essentially gone. We went from messaging all the time and planning trips and things to do, to 2-3 messages that it feels like I dragged out of them. The irony being, this person gave me the confidence to remove the people I called friends who were toxic to me. The ones who made jokes about my trauma, excluded me, were rude to my partner. I thought, oh, I have X, and they would never do this. I don't need this. And now, I have nothing. 

I tried harder than I thought possible. And I still have no connection. If anything, the crushing feeling of hope being ripped away was just that much worse because of how close I felt. Knowing that the closeness I thought we had, is gone, and that the crumbs that are left will be gone too. How can any of it have actually meant anything to them, or been real, if they would so casually discard it I ask. And the answer hurts. Because the only one that seems to fit: it didn't. Once more, i found myself filling the role of friend and confident just because they needed one. They didn't actually want to be mine. 

I don't know what the point is anymore. Growing up, I wanted to be independent. Control my own life, and have the ability to be secure. Here I am. I have enough money. I have a home.  A stable job. A partner of 7 years. And yet, I feel a crippling loneliness. A need, for just 1 person to be my friend, through the hard and easy. 

What am I supposed to do at this point? Ive met the Phsyiological needs, the safety needs. But the next step ""Love and Belongingness"". That seems as much as a fantasy as dragons."

lonely,Just looking for friends,"Just looking for friends - Hello, I’ve made some attempts to find friends on here before and it never seems to work out, maybe because I guess I have an odd sort of set of interests. I don’t have much interest  in social media or chatting. I’m mostly a writer and a reader, a lover of good quality films (not a lot of the big blockbuster type).  I also like a lot of music but I’m not terribly knowledgeable about all types.  Anyway, I’m kind of stuck at home a lot, there just are not many people to hang out with that I’ve found. Oh, and I know almost nothing about games or gaming, which seem to be really popular in here.
I just find myself, on a rainy but not entirely unpleasant day, kind of wishing I had a friend to meet for coffee and conversation. So anyway, this is probably not the greatest place for making friends but if anyone needs someone to talk to (in writing) I’m a pretty good listener.  And hoping everyone has a peaceful day!"

lonely,I met a guy I really like.,"I met a guy I really like. - But I met him in a weird place, admittedly. I had myself admitted into a mental ward, because my mental health was getting worse and worse, from a bunch of (not-so) little issues piling up, and making me have more and more suicidal thoughts and tendencies.

And I met this guy there - he immediately caught my eyes because, well, I'm a transgender man, and I could just tell that he was too. Sometimes you can just tell, even if they have a perfect passing, it's just about the similar things we went through shaping us in a certain way, you know ?

I got to know him, and immediately felt comfortable around him. He had issues too, obviously. A burn out. Undiagnosed mental issues, that aren't being treated properly. He just needed help and to rest. Kinda like I did, actually. We had a lot in common, too - similar tastes in fashion, music, movies, video games... We had conversations about obscure topics like the occult and our beliefs on resurrection. All of it matched. I very quickly realised I had a crush. But we were in a mental ward, and is there honestly anything weirder than trying to ask someone out when you're both institutionalized?

We both got out around the same time and kept in touch through whatsapp, chatting about everything and nothing. I convinced him to try an online game I'm a big fan of, and he talked me into getting into kpop, which is a big interest of his. To this day I can't tell if I'm into it because I enjoy it, or because I like him, and that makes me want to like the thing he does.

Finally after a month, we spent some time together yesterday. We chatted a lot, had snacks, showed each other stuff on YouTube... it was fun! I was so anxious on my way to his place and I had butterflies in my stomach up until I knocked at his door, but he just immediately made me feel comfortable. I didn't even notice the day flying by and I didn't really want to leave, but I did around midnight. 

When I got back to my place I was so giddy and so excited, grabbed my phone to tell him I got home safe and... asked him out on a date. No reply before I went to bed, but I wasn't surprised, he doesn't exactly reply to texts quickly- he's definitely not spending all his free time on his phone. 

This morning, I got up and went to work, already expecting to quit for personal reasons (I have very bad physical health issues, and I just can't handle the pain, the amount of meds I have to take and the fatigue of a job, all adding up together...). Still no reply, but it's fine. He's recently unemployed, I don't expect him to be up at 8.30am.

I get to my office, being the first person there... and then my phone buzzes. I went to check it so quickly but it was nothing I'd expected. He replied, and told me something along the lines of ""under any normal circumstances, I would've said yes, but I'm doing really poorly and I don't think I can welcome someone in my life right now"".

I had expected complete rejection. Actually I didn't have my hopes up. I'm not attractive. I don't feel like I'm a particularly person interesting either. I have no self worth, and I expect the worst out of relationships because I've been through some really, truly bad ones. But there I was hit with the knowledge that I could actually be desirable to someone I liked... and that wasn't enough.

And it just really hurt. I feel like fate keeps actively going against me. I'm a deeply romantic person, I haven't been in a relationship in 3 years, and I'm reaching a point where sometimes I feel a physical ache in my chest if I think too hard about it.

It could've been yes. It was so close to being a yes. But life isn't allowing me to get that bit of happiness I'm yearning for so badly.

I told him I'd be here to support him even if I was just crying my eyes out in my office because all my self loathing just came back and slapped me right across the face. My boss walked in and I was so embarrassed that I lied and said that a close friend had passed away. I was just ugly sobbing, and what kind of 25 year old dude just breaks down like a child after being rejected?

I quit my job and immediately got started on trying to help him - I knew he'd be interested in the job I just left available, so I told him to get an application ready, warned my boss about his app and that he would be a great fit. I want to help him get better for entirely selfish reasons. I hope that if he does, maybe he'll be able to open up to me. I can't say it tho, obviously. Now I'm lying in bed and I just feel so profoundly sad. I want to see him again, but I can't just be too pushy about it. I know I need to give him space. It's just so... I don't know how to say it. I do have attachment issues (BPD specifically) that make me overreact like I'm doing. And I'm aware that I'm blowing it all out of proportion. I just can't help it, and now I'm miserable."

Rarely would she ever ask about me, or even when I would make things about me for too long, she would just stop replying... I figured it would just be better to let her come and go rather than having no friends. But it finally became too much. I want someone to care about me as well... I want to matter to someone...

Am I a terrible person or does she bring out the worst in me? Is this really who I am? 

The person closest to me doesn't see me in a positive light, what does this say about me?

She has so many friends and she's my only friend, I feel so pathetic. Especially when I get jealous or sad when she spends time with other friends and I'm left alone"

And i thought about it for a long time, and found a possible asnwer: I'm just scared of not being well received.

Cost, expense, and side effects.  I can’t really succeed at my job due to my extreme anxiety and lack of confidence.  Any criticism or negative comments gets my super defensive.

I don’t even know where to start. I don’t go anywhere except for my job. Im in school but classes are online. I even thought about online dating but Im not so sure anymore.

lonely,Feeling left out and lonely,"Feeling left out and lonely - During lockdown my depression had become really bad, I feel like due to this my behavior towards people changed. Because of my state I was often frustrated and sad and always overthinking , I felt isolated myself even more . When I understood what is happening with me and could start explaining myself better, my friends understandably had already become more distant. I feel that people treat me like a patient now. My friends have stopped sharing things now. It is getting worse slowly. I feel left out. I feel selfish for sharing my problems because it feels like they don't want to share theirs and I feel like I am just taking and not giving anything back. Conversations feels forced with everyone.

Even though I feel like I managed to do a lot of damage controlling by explaining and apologizing, I think their view of me has changed irreversably. Now my depression is pretty much always there, I'm also feeling constant fear or anxiety of all my contacts drifting away from me. Now I've noticed having trouble communicating with my roommate as well, and feels like loneliness is always there.

I do try my best to be socially active, but I can't shake the feeling that despite my best efforts I'm being left out. I fear that if I try to explain this to my friends themselves, their image of me will go bad even more and they'd see me as desperate and needy. I just don't know how to handle this. Plus I already have very few friends , past few months have been really bad for me ."

there's this person within my group which I talked way more than the others. Honestly they were the reason I stayed. Had lots of fun together but because of this being online i think they grew bored of me. 

Doesn't help that somehow now i don't say what I think like I used to do, I think it's anxiety. 
I can't do anything with them like I used to do, starting something feels like a hassle (even though later I end up enjoying it thanks to their presence) I feel like now everything bores them even though I know this feeling it's irrational but their attitude and emotion then (when we first met) vs now wants to prove me wrong. 
My interests are fading away, I don't enjoy the few things I liked anymore and im pretty sure it was because that void inside me was filled with the presence of this group. **I stopped whatever i was doing just to talk to them.**

Now we don't even talk.

I don't think i'm interesting enough, making conversations became hard for me. I wish i was like the me when we first met, more spontaneous and carefree but it seems like since i like them way more than i ever thought, now i dread the thought of them leaving me, the realization that without them i'm alone again just crashed onto my brain and it's the worst fucking feeling in the world.
I knew this was going to end soon but never thought it would be THIS soon.

**I am way too self-ware, though, so much that it hurts.**
the moment i realize i feel so strongly for some internet randos is when i feel like I want to die, it's just so irrational and i fucking KNOW IT BUT I STILL FEEL THIS WAY and I fucking hate it.
I should just go outside, join other groups, get some exercise. TALK TO NEW PEOPLE in REAL LIFE, GET HOBBIES but NO here I am *again* ranting about something nobody cares about in hopes of NOTHING.
In 2 years or maybe a little more i haven't talked to people outside of ocasionally an irl friend who is also bored of me (i'm also done with her tbh). 

Don't know how's the state of the social life of the person reading this but im sure you're doing way better than me, (i'm not trying to invalidate your feelings) I hope you never hit this point and if you do, hi fellow caveman i've been here for years hope you can get out because i'll probably die."

lonely,I’m so tired of feeling betrayed,"I’m so tired of feeling betrayed - Hi, I’m sorry if this is long, but I feel like I need to provide the correct amount of context. I’m 26 (M) and have no friends. I live with my parents in a small country town and I am by no means country as I wasn’t raised here.

I’ve had a lot of friends in my life, but none that have stuck with me through the tough times. I get along better with women, than men. I’m not trying to sound vain, but I am a decently attractive person and my problem with guys is that they’re always insecure and think that I’m going to fuck their girlfriends so I’m usually kept at an arms length. I’ve never been that type of guy, but I guess I give off those vibes? Idk, maybe I need to work on my demeanor. Anyway, so I’ve always had a harder time making friends with guys. 

I don’t want to ramble too much so I’ll get to the point. I’ve had several close friends and every single one of them has fucked me over in some way or another. Also keep in mind I’m really not trying to victimize myself. I like to think I’m a fairly objective and understanding person. I won’t fool you though, I’ve done plenty of shitty things that I’m not proud of, but when it comes to my friends, I’ve always put an emphasis on loyalty and always tried to do right by them. 

I’ll go chronologically here.

My first best friend was actually my childhood bully. We reconnected in high school and put the past behind us. One night he and I had snuck out to go to a party. I had a bit too much to drink and he insisted on driving. That was the right call so I have no qualms about that. It’s what he did after that was the problem. We’re driving along the snowy highway sometime in December and because it was like 2am, no one else was on the road. He starts purposely swerving saying “IM THE KING OF THE ROAD! IM THE KING OF THE ROAD!” Naturally he loses control and we slam into a wall totaling my car. Luckily we were okay, especially considering my airbag didn’t deploy, but naturally as 16 year olds we start freaking out. We weren’t far from his place so he actually said he was going home and that this is my problem. He starts to run and I tackled him to the ground. No way I was going to let him get off Scott free. He then turns to me and says that he will stay, but that I had to take the blame otherwise he would tell my parents all of my secrets. He straight up blackmailed me and I decided I would rather take the blame for the car then have them know all those things about me (I wasn’t a good teenager). So that’s what I did.

Moving on. My next best friend was someone I met at my first job. That’s also where I met my high school sweetheart. A couple years after meeting both of them he gets diagnosed with cancer. He lived with his dad and since his dad was always on the road for work, I moved in and took care of him during his treatment. I’d drive him to and from sessions, make food, comforted him when he’d cry because he was scared of dying. Good news is that he made it through. By that time I had been broken up with my high school sweetheart for a few months. He asked me if it was okay if he started dating her. I said I wouldn’t be comfortable with that and told him I wouldn’t approve. He promised me he wouldn’t make a move then, stating that our friendship was more important to him. Fast forward 6 months and he comes over to my apartment high on acid. Starts breaking down admitting that they had been fucking the whole time. That was the point of no return for me and I just couldn’t be his friend after that. Our other friend, who I had introduced him to, told me I was overreacting and that he couldn’t be around such an emotional person so he moved in with the ex fucker. I lost my two best friends during that time.

Jumping ahead another 4 years or so, I moved in with a friend I had known since we were in diapers. 20+ years of friendship right there. Things were good until her bf moved in with us. One night were out at a bar and he’s all coked up and angry. He ends up slapping a bunch of stuff out of my gf’s hand like her phone and vape. I pushed him and we end up getting in a bar fight. I know, classy. My friend was scared of him that night because he was so out of control so her, my gf, and I go back to our apartment and she locks it so he can’t get in. Eventually she lets him in and my girlfriend and I decide to go to her place for the night. I never heard from my friend again after that. Not like she was dead or anything like that, she just decided that the three of us couldn’t coexist and cut all of her friends out of her life to be with this guy. I’ve never seen such a rapid change in a person. It was so bizarre. So I end up moving out and in with my girlfriend, still haven’t heard from her to this day. Just woke up one day and got the everlasting silent treatment.

So I’m living with my girlfriend and she just wasn’t a very nice person. I won’t get any further in depth on that though because it’s not relative to the story. I move out and back in with my parents. My other best friend and I decide we will move in together. Well covid happened so we figured we would ride the wave a bit longer before moving out. About July of 2020 we were getting ready to move out, but he decided he wanted to take a 6 month class and wanted to wait until after he was done with that to move out. Okay sure, that’s fine with me. He finished the class and then decides to quit his job because he was scared of contracting covid from someone there. Okay, I can kind of understand. He finally gets a job about 2 months ago and we’re gearing up once again to move out, but then he says he wants to save up money for a few more months, maybe until January, before moving. Again, a reasonable mindset. Well this last weekend he hits me with a bomb - he says that his other friend asked him to go on vacation to Korea with him over a year from now and that he wants to stay living with his parents to save up for that.

Look I’m not mad that we aren’t moving out, I’m just mad that he’s strung me along for 2 years now before making it clear that we won’t be living together. I put my life on hold for him, promising that I wouldn’t move without him. You think I wanted to live with my parents for this long? Hell no. But I did it because we promised each other that we would find a place together.

Yet another disappointment from another one of my friends. We talked every day for years and now we haven’t talked in a week. It really feels like the end of an era and that he’s trying to distance himself. I feel alone, and frankly I don’t really want his friendship at the moment. I don’t want to feel alone, but I want a quality relationship with someone. It always feels like they put their self interests over the friendship when I have always given them everything I had. Maybe im the problem and there’s something about myself im not seeing or addressing. Idk…all I know is I’m tired of being left for dead by people. I’ve done a lot of bad things, but nothing to any of them that would justify how I’ve been treated, that I’m sure of. He was the last friend though. I’ve burned through the rest of them for all the reasons listed above and at 26 it’s hard to meet people and make friends, especially when you have none to meet new people through. I’m not sure what types of responses I’m looking for. I just kind of needed to vent. Kudos to you if you made it this far seeing as how I wrote a novel.

But no matter what I do any girl I've ever talked to has ended with me in my own bed alone overthinking about what I did wrong or what others did better. 
I started working out again in September, I hadn't since highschool and I'm seeing the results of the work I've been putting in at the gym, people always say I'm funny or polite and that I'm decent looking. Yet whenever I'm talking to a girl im interested in it never leads into anything. Everything I've thought about what I'm doing wrong I try and fix or work on it but I feel like it's all a waste because nothing has worked
I don't have a hard time finding girls I vibe with well, but its keeping them around and wanting to hang out with me I always screw up and I don't know what I do wrong, but it has to be something wrong with me with how many times its happened.

I feel as if I’m in limbo and cant move forward with my life. I’ve started using drugs and drinking more than I should. I wrote a suicide note (shorter than I thought it would be lol) but ended up making it through that night because of my cats.

lonely,I just can't cut this out anymore.,"I just can't cut this out anymore. - I'm sure my predicament isn't quite as bad as some of you out there, but I certainly think this kind of loneliness still hits home just as hard as the typical circumstances you find yourself being lonely in..

The type of lonely where you might have very few people or friends around you, but they're so embezzled in their own lives that you have very infrequent dealings with them.. You feel forgotten about. This is understandable to an extent. 

Imagine this though. Whilst the above may be an unpleasant predicament to be in, what I find makes my loneliness crippling, is the knowledge that there's people out there who don't/won't/can't have a connection with me due to whatever reason it may be.

These are people who throughout life I've had a really strong and meaningful connection with. Most notably a recent person who I met at the end of last year. But its always been short lived and distantly intermittent at best.

I mean, its just crippling knowing that someone explicitly said they wanted to have a friendship with me and actually include me in their life, yet they actively chose to end it. Someone who wanted to be around me and do stuff with me. I've maybe only ever been told this once or twice in my life.

I refer to the last person I had significant dealings with, because frankly I haven't had any other sort of real connection in such a long time.

I've just been missing them so much and it's made me feel stupidly lonely after being able to actually see what life is like on the other side, with a friend who acted more like a real friend than anyone else I've met in the last 10 years.

They even reached out to me about 4 months ago, (and about the same amount of time after we stopped talking) to apologise for how things ended (because it was sudden and abrupt), and to see how I was doing.

I was honest. I told them how lonely I've been since, not in a pitiful way either, just being deadly honest. That I'd tried to connect with others to no avail. But even after trying to make amends, telling them how much I appreciated them being around, etc... 

 I still got hit with the ""sorry I just can't"".


It's more a kick in the teeth than anything else. All things considered, would you push somebody away without proper explanation, knowing full well of the situation they're in?  Even if they admit that you both get along really well? 


Just to clarify, there was no romantic affiliation with this person.

But yeah, my point is, it's a different kind of lonely knowing there are people or someone out there, not that far from reach, that could somewhat easily help to at least alleviate life, but choose not to.

This is not la be all and end all solution, however, I might add.  It's just an objective opinion based on the environment surrounding me."

lonely,Unoriginal title: Lonely so lonely,"Unoriginal title: Lonely so lonely - 33 year old currently looking to get back into work at our family business. 

My two guy friends, one of them seems to be an anti-social sociopath, and the other is diagnosed with bipolar and I got sick of them both to be honest. 

I realized my lack of friends, or being with bad friends, may have come about from my highly dysfunctional, isolated, narcissistic home. The only guy who I can support is my younger brother and who we derive some beneficial enjoyment together from. 

The way I cope is by listening to podcasts, Netflix, and most importantly reading books (philosophy, fiction) which I adore. They are my babies. Currently gonna start reading **Dune** and some other non-fiction book, maybe **The Denial of Death** 

On the bright side I do have an LDR girl friend (whom I visited a while ago). She is the sweetest thing on earth to me. I will look into getting her here permanently I hope. 

I had a promising future but it sizzled out at my dad's companies, now giving it the last chance. A wrench was thrown in my plans and I stumbled a little.  But they still didn't defeat me. Good luck guys."
lonely,I haven't felt human most of my life.,"I haven't felt human most of my life. - All my life, even growing up, I never felt natural. Like I've always copied what other people do. Going through life seems to come easy for everyone else. I had to be shown how to act, or how to dress, or how to talk to people, or how to think. I never felt like I've actually thought or done anything for myself. I don't even know if myself is my own. Do I like things because of my own pleasure, or because what I like is deemed desirable by others?

I feel so fake, like I'm some other observer, not a person. Like I'm a Frankenstein's Monster of all the different people I've met. I've taken aspects of their personalities and assimilated them into this homogeneous mass that everyone sees as me. Is everyone like this? I feel so alien and unwelcome. I can put on a good show for people, make them believe I'm a person. But once I start expressing what I believe to be myself, it's over. It always ends in me being ghosted, without fail.

I feel like there's some spark I'm missing that others can sense isn't there. I must be wrong in some fundamental way. I can't even begin to imagine what I could do to fix it."

I dated my best friend for two years but once we went from friends to dating I lost the joy she brought me, I thought it was because we didn’t see each other as much because she went to college in a different city. But even with girls I saw every day I just lost the joy I felt. I don’t know if it’s just me subconsciously feeling like I still have my whole life ahead of me, that I have plenty of time to find love and all that jazz. Or if there is something wrong with me.

 I’m not someone who is ever sad or upset. I feel like I’m supposed to be the beacon of happiness for the people around me. But when I broke up with my last girlfriend we talked about our emotions and I’ve just felt depressed since. I don’t know what I’m trying to get from posting this other than venting because I can’t vent to anyone else. Hell it’s a joke to talk about depression in the military. I got my dream promotion today after working my ass off for the last year, but I can’t help but feel like I’m not supposed to have that job.

Knowing that there are many things I could have done differently, This could just be karma.","I have been lonely for my entire life, and it feels like its eating away at me from the inside out. Knowing that there are many things I could have done differently, This could just be karma. - I feel like most people have no idea how lonely it is. Most people go through periods of their life, maybe its a few months or even years of loneliness but they eventually find some people to be around and spend time with and make genuinely real friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

But when I say I'm lonely, I really am and I really mean it when I say I have felt this way for 8 years straight.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have never had many friends; or I did up until a certain point and everything just changed. I got bullied and was the outcast and suddenly a flip just switched. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that I became a jerk without even realizing it. Years later and suddenly some of the memories come back and it shocks me because I can't believe I didn't even know about the fact that I was so toxic or the fact that people would even bother sticking around for so long. 

&amp;#x200B;

From their point of view of course they would want revenge. I cant blame them for that. I turned down all their offers because I didn't want to feel like a liability, and I know i'm wrong there but I'm just too scared to apologize and I don't even know exactly what I did wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cant blame anyone else at this point... I can list bunch of reasons or logical explanations of stuff that happened in my life but what's even the point. I just feel like I totally ruined all my relationships. I feel like past a certain point no apology will do anything for anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my brain chemistry is permanently messed up. I don't know how social interactions work, I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to self reflect on anything without totally spiralling, I don't know what the right thing to do is... I always feel confused and stupid and anxious and regretful and ashamed

I thought another guy liked me when I was 18, we were hanging out and getting close, I found he was also trying to message my friend. Met another guy on an app, he told me I'm cool but he still wants to date other people. As if I'm going to sit there and be a placeholder until he finds someone better. No matter what I do I am never good enough to earn that girlfriend position, just good enough to be a placeholder. I usually just settle for it or else I have nothing. I just want to be shown off and the girlfriend for once. But I'm not good enough for that so it is what it is I guess."
lonely,"Being suicidal and having no friends is absolute hell, especially at school.","Being suicidal and having no friends is absolute hell, especially at school. - Hello, I'm a 16 year old girl and I started self-harming when I was 13 but life started being so bad years prior to that. I've never actually had any friends who were willing to listen to me vent, be there for me when I cry, or simply listen to me when I talk about something serious.

I so badly want to graduate high school, it seems like a big step to get out of this hell hole. But alas, I'm in 11th grade so I've basically still got half of high school to go through.

Seeing other kids around me with their friends, having fun and whatnot, makes me want to throw a pity party for myself. What is it that I'm doing wrong to not have any friends? Why is it so hard for me to be open about a lot of things? A big part of me believes that I don't have friends because I'm ugly, although yes, that is a very dumb reason.

I just want a therapist."

But thats because one of my friends in the sercer advocated for us. Then I found out in june about this new server. I asked about it to my friend who is in it,  he said that hes been trying to get us in it too. Hes been advocating for us, and he recently stopped because its not gonna work. This other server started becoming more active recently. Now it is just as active as our main server. They voice chat there when they dont want me and Nate in there. Ive been advocating for months about it. I don't want leave this group because I have several real friends amd I go to a very small school so there are little options for school. So Ik when they are in VC together because on Steam they will all conviently log on the same game at the same time. What a coincidence.

And even though I want to put in the work to get better, I’m so insanely poor that I can’t get infront of anything in order to do so.

I have no one that I can go to. No family. Nothing.

So, as my last attempt, I’m coming here to ask for any fucking amount of money that anyone can spare. I’m sitting in a cafe using wifi on my phone that I don’t even have a provider for anymore.

It definitely going to sound weird, but i watched the anime of the manga Nagatoro and that relationship(typical anime relationship really nothing out of the ordinary) hits me like a truck; happens with any movie or game really. It makes me feel trapped, and most of the times i feel an intense pressure on my chest as if I'm choking.                     

There's a game called Emily is Away that tells the story of you and your friend relationship trough a chat. Later in the game you found out she's loosing interest in you and she flat outs ignores you, and it's pretty fucking pathetic but it actually made me cry irl; i felt this breakup almost like real life (even though I've never been in a relationship as you can tell lol).    
I know all of this sounds very pathetic gotta be honest, and i definitely can't really fully explain this feeling but i just have to try. 

I'm not necessarily looking for any advice or anything like that, i just wanted to share this somewhere. I've been feeling like this for a while now and felt like letting it out would kind of help.

lonely,Depressed and down.,"Depressed and down. - I’ve been feeling terrible now for almost a year.  This all started from a hookup.   I was friends with this woman who I met at work and would party with her a lot.  I knew her for a couple years already and then last New Years we were ganging out and ended up hooking up.  She had just broken up with her girlfriend and we ended up hooking up al month long.  There were conditions like that I knew she wasn’t gonna be my girlfriend and no being super drunk etc.   Well, I’ve been single my entire life.  This was only the second person I’ve ever had sex with and I had never been thru anything like what I went thru with her.  It ended at the end of January.  

I already started feeling terrible back then because of how amazing it was and then abruptly stopped.  I had never felt that good in my life and for the first time I felt like a normal person and had a huge confidence boost and then it all went away.  I started drinking really heavy and eating bad.  I gained lots of weight and was feeling miserable.  In the meantime I’m still just friends with her.  

She starts sharing with me how she’s getting tinder and bumble dates, which was really hard to hear.  I thought I could learn to be ok with it.  I even didn’t care that much when she got a new girlfriend although I felt sad and unwanted.  Then I had to start seeing pictures of them together and that kinda fucked me up.  She wanted me to meet her and I kept putting it off.  A couple of weekends ago I went to the bar with them after kinda being forced to meet her,(my car isn’t working and she was giving me rides to and from work and I ended up at her place after work one day and the girlfriend came over).   

Last weekend I ended up going to a small gathering at another coworkers house where her the girlfriend and some others were there.    Well I was drunk when I got there,(got a ride of course), and proceeded to make a giant fool of myself.  I had to see her and the girlfriend making out a ton and then come to find that the other guy maybe both were all planning on having some kind of orgy with them and I showed up and ruined it.   

I had been doing pretty good the last few months.  I’ve been dieting and have lost like 30 plus pounds and had been feeling like maybe I could get over this.  Now all week I’ve been the lowest I’ve ever been in my life.  I honestly feel completely out of it and like I want to cry all the time.

I have a friend group of \~10 people, and I fit in just fine at my school. But almost constantly, whether I am around my friends or not I feel a sense of loneliness. What I've decided it is, is that I want to have a relationship with a girl. Because I really like the idea of being able to snuggle up under a blanket with a girl and cuddle while we watch a movie or talk about our lives. But I don't really have any traits that would be interesting to a girl, and also I go to an all boys private school which makes it kind of hard to meet girls. But I feel like I wouldn't have such a strong sense of loneliness if all that I feel I am ""missing"" is a relationship with a girl.

lonely,Why do people with friends say they have “no friends”,"Why do people with friends say they have “no friends” - Sometimes in the same breath too, like you can’t say you have no friends then talk about your friends in the literal same sentence

Because you don’t know what it’s really like to *actually* have no friends. Not just friends who don’t care about you, but not even people who pretend to give a shit about you or hang around you. Having no one to text. Having no one to hang out with, year after year. Having no hope that things would change because you’ve never had friends so you can’t even reach out to “old friends”. Having people go out of their way to avoid you because having zero friends is a death flag even though you haven’t done anything wrong to anyone and your only crime is being uncharismatic.

THAT’S having no friends. I really wish people could see the difference between feeling like your friends don’t care about you versus not even having the illusion of there being people in your life."

My sexual frustration, the fact that i never got to feel wanted; They are sapping away at everything i do and feel. They are always in hindsight. Always growing.

I've grown obsessed with someone whom i had hopes with meeting 3 years ago. Im still clinging to those hopes and dreams. Sometimes as comforting love while other times they just burst out as hateful, narcissistic desires.

I dont know. The worst part is that i am a successful person. I socialize, I try to stay active, I try to be... normal. It scares me that no amount of success or any other effort fills the void. Im fixated on the fact that i have unfulfilled needs for years now. Sometimes getting specific while other times simply wishing i was loved.

It scares me that i have indeed wasted an entire decade where i was supposed to be human. But failed to be so. And now at 23 im supposed to not even bother with these things. Focus on ny job and career and such.

Sometimes i look at creepy, thirsty old men and fear if this is how the process starts. Im still the 15 year old boy that wanted to be loved, feel special and spend days with his special one.

lonely,Lonely in your 30’s and beyond,"Lonely in your 30’s and beyond - I miss the specific social environment fostered by college campuses. Where else can you find gatherings of people with your interests, with flexible schedules, within walking distance, in a setting with plenty of indoor public spaces where you can hang out without having to buy something? At 35, work snd household chores take up most of my spoons. So scheduling in time to socialize while coordinating with someone else’s schedule on my days off feels like a chore. I’d much rather use that day off to recharge in bed or clean the house or go grocery shopping. I fit the stereotype of obnoxious smug asshole who feels relieved when social plans are canceled, and I recognize the hypocrisy in that I feel lonely. I hate how phony it all feels. When I’m ready to be the one who initiates social plans, it’s hard to know whether the other person secretly feels put out and inconvenienced by having to pencil me into their schedule. We collectively want to be left alone and then go shocked Pikachu face when we get what we want and it feels lonely."

I just want to be loved and it shouldnt be that hard.

lonely,Had a dream about people in my past,"Had a dream about people in my past - So today I woke up from this dream where I was at the mall in my hometown with a bunch of people from my old high school. Except it was all people who I lost contact with. I was with my two old best friends and we were joking around and it didn’t feel like we lost contact at all. I tried to keep myself oblivious the entire dream cause I knew If I started to gain awareness it’ll all be over. I also saw the guy who I had a thing with like 4 times in the dream and it was weird instances where he’d just walk by, stand and stare at me for a few seconds. I woke up from that dream so confused to what was real and what wasnt but I wasn’t mad it happened just more sad cause I miss these people a lot."

lonely,Cold responses and people fading away.,"Cold responses and people fading away. - I noticed this today, somebody I was trying to form a connection with sent a very short response, a subtle indicator to me that they want the conversation to end.

It always happens, the rare occasions that I manage to connect with someone always fizzle out. I don't know why I'm never good enough."

Recently I watched a podcast basically saying that women send nudes all the time. This came as news to me because I was sure that this was something nobody really ever did but apparently almost every girl has done that…

 I just come here to get this off my chest and say I have never received nude photos from anyone I’ve talked to and I have talked to many girls before. Come to think of it all I haven’t ever sexted with anyone either… I had no clue this was something people GENUINELY did.

I'm not sure what I'll do tonight if I do anything but I just want help...just need a hug and a kiss and a cup of water. I'm feeling highly suicidal today all because of this. All because I'm lonely and questioning myself and have nobody to vent my worries and thoughts to. I want it all to be over...I want life to be over at this point..."

lonely,I have such a deep heavy loneliness that makes my chest feel empty,"I have such a deep heavy loneliness that makes my chest feel empty - Whenever I start thinking about my old social life, or my current social life (which usually leads to me think abt my past) I get a heavy feeling in my chest, almost like someone's standing on it.

I've lost 90% of the people I know and the ones that have stayed are starting to drift away, it feels like I'm watching my life implode on itself I try so fucking hard, and it's never enough.

It's come to the point I've just given up now to make matters worse my family has a line of mental illness and seeing my mom I know if I took my own life My mom would come shortly after, and it would devastate my little brother as well.

It feels so unfair and I don't want to do this anymore, my life is leading to nowhere my self care doesn't exist anymore  I feel like I'm such a burden. I don't want to get out of my house. I'm always tired, no energy. Nothing motivates me. I've got antisocial thoughts. I feel like I deserve it for all my mistakes. I feel so much shame and guilt. I'm living death. Can't see myself in the mirror. I can't tidy up my room because everything reminds my lost of interesting in the activities I used to enjoy and the career I drop out. I cry everyday, I feel suicidal all the time, when I'm with my mom and my brother I feel I'm invisible and start to think how they will be better off without me. I've lost my sense of humor, I steal my dads alcohol, I got sent to my grandparents to ""fix me"" and lied, manipulated, and convinced them that my mom is just overly anxious and I just have slight anxiety and I'm a little lazy. I'm told everything will work out in time but I'm at my absolute limit, nobody fucking cares and I deserve this."
lonely,Alone,"Alone - Sometimes I see a glimmer of hope. I desperately try to grab on. Claw my out of this deep dark hole. Just as i seem to reach the top, it vanishes, and i plummet to the depth again. Desperate, afraid. Just trying to find the happiness that doesn't exist. Maybe i shouldnt as well.

Trying to cry myself to sleep. I hope i never wake up. The silence seems to call to me. Its just there, but just out of reach. 

Turning 21 soon. But do I want to? Do I deserve to?

I wish i could go to sleep and never wake up again"

lonely,Feeling misunderstood,"Feeling misunderstood - Hi you all. 
I wanna share my issue that I’m currently struggling with.

 yo and recently I’ve visited a psychologist ( the reason was completly different from the one I’m talking about ) where we both realised that I’m a bit more mature than my peers. 

I am aware that it sounds so immodest but I wanna explain.

The thing is that 98% of guys my age don’t care about other’s and their own emotions. They just wanna lie in beds watching tiktoks or game entire weekends, while I need to talk about phylosophical topics or emotional issues.

I really don’t feel that I’m above them or something. I’m just different, not better or worse.

Some people listen to me and I appriciate it a lot but nobody can’t give me the feeling of understanding.

I also struggle with overthinking. One small action can destroy relation that we’ve been building for years. For example I one hate my friends for that he is being lazy. This affected our relation but other guys would just let it be.

I have pretty few friends but I don’t feel anyone. I also feel strong attraction to primitive activities like parties or smoking because of that.

My mindset seems so complicated even for  me. Anyone feels misunderstood this way?"
lonely,I have one to talk to,"I have one to talk to - I have no one to talk to, I spend most of my time with my dog.

lonely,One.,"One. - *You* will always be the only one, 
that could do it, 
*without even touching me.*

Just from your words,
and hearing your voice 

The strongest desire I’ve ever known

You felt so right.

My body aches for you, and your touch, and the feeling of you inside me 

I had never wanted anything so passionately, needed anything so fiercely 

I didn’t know I could,
until you 

Now the pain of loss suffocates me-
but I almost enjoy it

I feel alive.

I refuse to forget,
and choose to live *with* it, 
instead 

Amazed by how intense love for another can be

It is the most beautiful memory. 
The most beautiful experience.

*Even if I never feel it again*"
lonely,Being a quiet person SUCKS,"Being a quiet person SUCKS - I just can't be alone with anyone without getting extremely nervous because I just don't know how to start, follow, or let alone carry a conversation. I never know what to talk about. I don't know what people around me talk about, and this has always prevented me from getting to know people.

I've known my sister in law for 6 years. I KNOW she likes me, and I like her back, but I still feel her distant, and we've lived together ffs. I feel like this happens to many people I know.

For instance, I have a friend who I've known since college, and I swore I was pretty close to him but he's said that he doesn't consider me close.

Something similar happens with my best friend, who I know since we were 3 y/o. We say we are each other's best friend but I feel so outside of her life. 

The only person I actually feel close to me is my husband (thank God). And that should be enough but I'd like to have someone to talk to when there's a difficulty in my relationship that's not him, you know?

And the one factor I've found in all my relationships and general interactions is that I have no idea of how to get to know people and how to let them to get to know me. I have no clue. Most of the time I just stay quiet, answer their questions and follow up with a 'how about you'.

Thanks for reading."
lonely,How do I stop asking for friend's time?,"How do I stop asking for friend's time? - I'm so lonely at this point in my life that I'm practically begging for attention now. I have zero friends. And I felt so lonely that I reached out to an old friend (more like schoolmates) but she blocked me the moment I told her I was feeling lonely. I guess its my fault.


But I can't even stop bugging my best friend. She's busy with university and I have told her at least 10 times within the past few weeks that she should talk to me more. I have begged her in fact. Argued with her, cursed her and many other things.


I've managed to enjoy being alone but the moment I talk to someone, I feel so lonely once again. Any sort of professional help is off the tables for now. What else could I do? I have to stop bugging her; else she'll definitely leave me forever. I have become a pain in the ass. I need help but I can't find it anywhere."
lonely,What's the cure for loneliness?,"What's the cure for loneliness? - 26 F. 

I grew up in an abusive household. My childhood had been extremely traumatic. Even though I am certain my parents love me, I just never felt loved enough in life. 

Because, for obvious reasons I had been deprived of love, I grew up developing unhealthy attachment to people. Even if someone's niceness equivalent to an ounch, I end up giving them my world, and get hurt in return.

I not only trust people easily, I am a people pleasure, and I am sensitive. When I love someone I love them with passion, when I hate someone I hate them with all my heart. 

Currently I am extremely bothered by an incident that happened when I was 22 years old, when I was on a trip abroad. I met a boy who I really liked, who led me on. To be honest, I guess I liked him first. But he ended up breaking up my heart, and after all these years, I am still salty about it. 

People call me naive, they tell me how I have a big heart, and ready to love people too easily, how I am so kind, and a ray of sunshine in their life. But honestly, I am just tired being the way I am. Staying around people is what fuels me for the better, I absolutely cannot stand being alone. 

I guess I don't love myself enough yet, and still having trouble in learning how to solely enjoy my own company. I guess what am I asking is this: what's the cure for loneliness?"

lonely,I post in r4rs just to look for people to talk to,"I post in r4rs just to look for people to talk to - R4r is mostly people looking for nsfw meets, so most responses I get are inappropriate; I post there because despite being surrounded by people, no one wants to talk to me.

My family tells me to shut up if I try to join in conversations or ignores me. My colleagues say I talk too much and my friends never have the same days off as me so we never see each other. Even when we do they aren’t so much interested in what I have to to say so much as what I can do for them.

Back in august I threw a party, invited 20 people, most saying they were gonna come. I made food and prepped the hot tub, an hour before I get my first cancel because she too ill. In the end only one showed up, Theo hos late and left an hour later after playing on her phone, eating my food, using  my wifi and not talking to me.

lonely,Sometimes we're so busy chasing what's in front of us; we don't see what's behind us.,"Sometimes we're so busy chasing what's in front of us; we don't see what's behind us. - I'm an innate observer of human nature, and one of the things that I see over and over again with people seeking a partner in life is that they tend to look only in 'front' of them.  They look for what they **think** they should be looking for.  Put another way, people often look for what they *want*, instead of what they *need*.

Where am I going with this?

I have a friend who has been 'looking for love' for some time.  She keeps throwing herself at people, and coming up empty.  Yet while trying to get the attention of others, she hasn't noticed the person trying to get **her** attention.  So while she keeps looking ahead, she doesn't see what is right behind her. (The same applies for men too of course)

The irony of course is that people 'pass over' someone pursuing them, yet they get upset when someone does it to them.  They want someone to give ***them*** the chance that they don't give to other people.  

To those who may say there is no one behind them--look closer.  You may have put them in the 'friendzone'.  Or maybe they don't seem like they're interested, but they're shy.  Ask yourself... does this person make an effort to be around you?  Do you find yourself seeing them around more often than other people?  Maybe they send you random messages asking how you're doing, but you kinda just dismiss their interest. After a while they give up.

I see this happen all the time.  

So look around and see who is there.  Maybe you're at school, and someone seems to pass by your locker and say 'hi' to you more often than other people.  Don't dismiss it as coincidence.  Maybe they don't have the nerve to talk to you, but they are trying to be **noticed** by you. That should tell you something. People don't do that for no reason.

I'm not going to sit here and lie saying that 'popular' people don't get more attention and affection than other people.  They do.  More people 'chase' them.  But the more people who chase them, the less will actually 'catch' them.  Hey, unless you want to be part of a harem of girlfriends, (or boyfriends) chasing after someone who already has a 'line waiting' is a waste of time. 

This is not a magic solution though, and it won't work for everyone.  However, it will work for some.  All you need to do is take a look 'behind you'.  Stop chasing, and instead **WATCH** people.  Make notes of who smiles at you.  Make notes of who says hi to you.  Make notes of who tends to sit alone at lunch near your table all the time.  

These are the people that may already be interested in you, so give them a shot before giving up."

lonely,Feeling like my like is boring and dull,"Feeling like my like is boring and dull - After I graduated college last year, I felt like this sense of excitement left my life. Up until this may, I had a consistent feeling that I was “missing” something in my life because I was no longer chasing a degree and now out of the student mindset. I think the hard parts were no longer seeing friends daily, having to work the same job daily and just being fully independent in terms of my planning my future. The pandemic also didn’t help since it isolated me from my friends.

Right now, I work remotely and live at home still. I got in a relationship back in may, which I think is what helped to bring back some excitement to my life and have something to look forward to daily. But now that the relationship is over, I feel like I’m back where I started and feel like my life is boring again. I want to get to the root of this problem so I can fix in head first and not have to deal with it in the future or compress it with another relationship.

Some options I was thinking to help me was either moving out or getting dog. How do you guys deal with this feeling as an adult?"

lonely,Little story.,"Little story. - Yes, i’m lonely. Because I don’t care anymore about, strips, clubs, drinking, smoking, random sex. Those adventures lead you to anxiety, depression, panic attacks arguably. If you decide to exit that path, you also will leave those “friends” in that path, those kind of friendships was based on pleasures, it’s totally fake. 

Right now i’m on another path, not blinded path. And i’m not depressed, im just sad, because I’m being alone very long, I daily exercise, read and pray, sport and God my only pillar at this point, and I hope that God will send me something, and will not longer need to sleep alone, and write here for support, because 
even my mom don’t care about my feelings, also around as well very angry, not satisfied, gossipers. I don’t want to crew, I want peace and share love. 

Right now i’m overthinking, I’m alone, and very humble. 
Being alone made you like that, in past I was selfish, I thought also, that I’m very smart, but now realised, that I’m not, I think, that everyone has a gift at something, someone is smart, someone is brave, someone is open-minded, and I don’t know what to equate to myself. Maybe, I have one gift - memory, I’m able to remember what I did past two weeks, i have knowlegde, but usually that knowlegde is based on the memory, I used to be creative, but I ruined that with bad habits, also my memory, bit frustrated, but it’s recovering now, that’s why i’m happy, I’m hope that they will recover a bit, to make myself good again. I did not disclose yet at something, but I also don’t have a big plans for myself in the future, I decided that I end up living simply, and I will not chase money, it’s a fasion imposed by others. I transfer everything to God. Thanks for those who read, and I hope everyone here will achieve something, find something, friend, love, or reveal at somewhere. PEACE"

I dont have any crushes, no love for my family members, and i have no fear for death, and nothing is there for me to look forward for the future. When i come to this country, after living in my home country for my entire life(where i also felt the same), i didnt feel homesick at all. My parents didnt let me play video games, even though we had all the resources, and they knew all the other kids play and only talk about it. Now, im embarresed, to sit alone for for my lunch in school, so i just skip it. It has been affecting my heath, and productivity, and now im dreading school. Even if i was a complete stranger, things would be bearable, but since, my classmates just know that i exist, i dont want them to look at me as a loner, even tho they probabably do. It has always been like this, and always just wait for the day to end, eveyday."

lonely,Im a terrible sister,"Im a terrible sister - I feel so guilty about unloading all my religious trauma on my sister. I pretty much told her how I left the religion because it got so hard lying to everyone in my life for so long. She said she still loves me and won’t tell anyone in our family but I feel like I’ve really burdened her. Theres still a slight chance she might tell my mum and that would be a complete disaster, i would pretty much be shunned by all my family members. Plus shes only 16 and shes fully indoctrinated by the religion so how is she even supposed to process anything? I should’ve just took this to the grave."

lonely,What I want out of life,"What I want out of life - Every day. Every fucking day I think about these kind of scenarios in my head:

•Driving over to a friend’s house on a cold, Winter night to hang out.

•Staying up late at night to watch movies with friends.

•Going to the mall with friends.

•Driving around the city with my friends.

•Having friends who I deeply love and relate to. Lifelong friends.

Every day for the past two years I have daydreamed about scenarios like these.

I crave recognition. I crave to create SOMETHING to get people’s attention and recognize me. Any kind of attention. Despite this, I just can’t gather the energy to be creative anymore. I’m just an ideas guy now. It sucks.

Maybe I should admit to myself that I’ll most likely be a nobody. I need to stop equating creative pursuits with fame and praise. It’s kind of vain. After all, recognition doesn’t really matter when you’re alone.

I just want friends. Above all else I want a family, y’know?

I’ll watch these TV shows with characters who are lifelong friends with each other, and it just makes me feel like absolute shit. Just total trash.

I mean, I do have some good childhood memories. I visited a few friends’ houses, I played outside, I went to the mall a couple of times… but those friendships always ended in us drifting apart.

And honestly, I never really related to anyone irl on a deep and personal level. I’ve took every friend for granted.

I think it’s because I’m so unhappy with myself, and have such a weak identity, that I don’t know how TO relate to others. I don’t even know who I fucking am. All I’ve ever done is talk to others about video games or some media shit. It feels so shallow. I don’t wanna keep up with gaming or entertainment just for the sake of a conversation topic.

I have online friends but honestly, they’re kind of abrasive and give off negative vibes. They’re not terrible people but I’ve been in their chats long enough to recognize that they can be judgemental. I’m probably just hyper-sensitive but these people can be draining.

I never attempted to reconnect with my high school friends after the Quarantine began. That’s probably my fault. I should probably try to reconnect, but part of me… maybe doesn’t like them? That sounds horrible. They’re good people. I just don’t feel up to it. I feel awful for that, because I never really emotionally opened up to them.

I had a neighborhood friend who I used to hang out with. Gave him my phone number after coming across him about a year ago, but he didn’t give me his, so it seems like he’s pretty much moved on from me. Maybe it’s because I’m a weirdo shut-in kid, or that he probably has friends of his own, but it’s pretty sad on my part.

Life sucks. Back in my Junior year of high school, when I was really getting lonely, I thought these scenarios in my daydreams would’ve been realized by now. It has been nearly two years since then, and I am even more alone.

So what? In another two years, will I still be alone in my room all the time?

I don’t wanna become a loser/incel… I want some friends to chill with. Fuck man I can stay a virgin for all I care, just gimmie some homies.

(btw I’m mainly referring to irl friends. I don’t really wanna meet people on Reddit. Sorry)"
lonely,Lonely during office hours,Lonely during office hours - So lonely that I'm browsing through NSFW subreddits during office
lonely,Hopeless Romantic,"Hopeless Romantic - I've never dated anyone I have had feelings for. I think maybe because I don't get romantic feelings very often with people. I've only really had two actual crushes, and I have been rejected by both. It hurts and I'm so fucking lonely because of this."
lonely,"Yep, I'm kissing my pillow","Yep, I'm kissing my pillow - I was listening to some girl reading Reddit stories on YouTube while lying down on my bed. I'm already cuddling my pillow for warmth but then I just close my eyes and give my pillow a little kiss. Felt nice so I give it some more kisses. All I can think about is ""damn, wish this was a real person."" Sucks when you're affectionate but there's no one to give affection to. My hair's getting longer, wish someone would play with it. Lately, I've been dreaming of relationship goals and cute date ideas. I guess I will make do with giving this pillow kisses."
lonely,Lonely after loosing a really close friend due to depression and mental illness,"Lonely after loosing a really close friend due to depression and mental illness - Lost my girlfriend and best friend recently. I already saw my relationship coming to a close, and was living with my best friend to. As the situation unfolded I fell into a very deep depression that ended up with me almost shooting myself. The only thing that stopped it was my best friend hearing me crying and coming into the room and grabbing the gun. She ended up taking me to psych and from there it's been me at war with my own mentality as I try to become stable. It's been a rough two months to say the least and now I'm venting into what feels like the void at 5 am after being up for 3 days from insomnia."
lonely,My now live-in ex girlfriend left me and is back with her emotionally abusive ex…,My now live-in ex girlfriend left me and is back with her emotionally abusive ex… - Hey guys. Long story sort I saved my now x gf from a very abusive and manipulative boyfriend. We had an amazing 9 months together and everyone said she smiled brighter with me than she ever did with him. And that no one had seen me smile like the way I did with her. She left me to “be alone and take some time to learn to be independent” but In reality she left cuz she still had feelings for him.(she was with him for 8 years)..honestly? I feel alone. She lived with me the entire relationship and I can still physically feel her sleeping next to me. I miss my best friend…

lonely,I miss him but know I can't go back.,"I miss him but know I can't go back. - I miss his mind the most. We really connected so deep, but its over.

I feel so lucky to have experienced such great love in my life and then have it fade away softly. But its left me lonely over time. I've dated other men and have had great sex but havent had a truly deep/good conversations with someone since. 

We met when we were 17 and stay together till we were 26. We were best friends. I'm 31 now and still think about him often, even though I truly don't want to. I want to 100% move on completely from him. I have no plans on reaching out,  I can't. Too many weird, strange, and off putting things happened at the end. I wish I could social media stock him but were both were so private we never made any of those.

I wish him the best. I do hope he is happy, safe, and comfortable.  

I hope to one day not think of him anymore, it makes me feel lonely in a crowd."
lonely,Just stressed out and missing people,"Just stressed out and missing people - Today I had a busy day.  Been up early and have been finishing assignment after assignment.  University is so hard and isolating, even in person.  I started uni right after my father passed, and I’ve always felt that I started on the wrong foot without my best friend, my dad.  The pandemic didn’t help in processing my grief or in making friends,  just gave me more stress and made me feel lonelier.  I’ve told my closest and oldest friends about feeling so beaten down, they said they would call me up or visit me, yet they have group calls and watch parties without inviting me… all I get is watching their videos of them hanging out online on their stories.  Just sucks feeling so lost and alone without my rock, and even more so that the few friends I do have seem to move on without me."
lonely,Why does life suck. My mum is the only thing that means I'm still alive.,"Why does life suck. My mum is the only thing that means I'm still alive. - I literally have no friends. No social life. Just constant pain all day until I'm asleep.

Life is so overrated man. I have nothung I've achieved in life and just sit in my room wanting to dissappear almost every night. I thought life was meant to be for me. I guess not....

I shouldn't exist or be here anymore."
lonely,So lonely that it physically hurts ?,"So lonely that it physically hurts ? - How is that even possible ?

All my life I've been pretty lonely and to be honest quite fine that way. Absolutely no problem having lunch by myself during college years and its not like I was ostracized, just I feel like having lunch by myself. 

Now in my 30s I'm currently living alone, my parents are around and its been this way for a few years. At night time I usually flirt around with the bar girls but nothing was ever serious. I don't necessarily enjoy getting laid but I really enjoy cuddling.

Something changed these few weeks, the feeling of being lonely has been more heavy than usual and the heart seems little more tense like it is hurting. Feels like I'm coming down with a fever that never comes, constantly feeling dazed and tired. Anyone have similar experience or am I just crazy ?"
lonely,"The more I get lonely, the more I daydream","The more I get lonely, the more I daydream - These days, I just lay in bed early just to daydream. I have nothing to hold on in this life. I am miserable. I have no one."
lonely,Enjoying my bad habits,"Enjoying my bad habits - Staring at my dermatitis and pimple ridden face on the mirror, posting not so positive stuff on the internet, banging my head... This stuff used to give me the shits quite a few years ago.

Nowadays when I do that I'm cracking my ass off. What am I becoming?"
lonely,never really felt lonely before,"never really felt lonely before - I guess I've been lucky as I've never felt lonely before. Experiencing it now its subtle but its there,  and I don't want it to grow.  I work out and run regularly any other suggestions on shaking this? Looking into therapy but haven't found anyone yet."
lonely,The worst loneliness,The worst loneliness - I think the worst loneliness would have to be the ones you put yourself in. You know you don't have to be but you dont have the motivation to get off of it. Always on the outskirts of things.
lonely,Girlfriend just broke up with me,Girlfriend just broke up with me - My girlfriend just broke up with me and I said some mean things she has now blocked me and I regret it I wish I could say something to her but now I can’t I feel like I wanna die
lonely,What’s next,"What’s next - Doing much better now I feel like compared to before I’m pretty much ok. 
Not to make anyone feel bad or to give anyone hope. I’ve found there’s never any prediction with emotion.
It’s just waves hitting a wall and your trying to predict where a single drop will go next. 

But even so, I finally figured out how to have the right people around me. I have friends that matter. My family is better. And I know who I am.

But even so I think there’s something missing. 

I was with this girl, she’s cool chill but I don’t feel that way when i look in her eyes. I thought after we spent more time together it would change. 
But through texts, conversations, cuddles and before during and after sex it was the same. 
This thin layer of distance. 
And it’s my fault. 

I want to love but I never have and the closest I got was a train wreck. 
Yet I can’t even feel that way to someone who i should be able to. 
I feel sick in a sense. 
I see myself in my head with the woman of my dreams or at least a reflection and kids.
I’m devoted loving I’m happy.. 
yet I snap back and no one seems that way. 
Im scared I’ll never love anyone 

or maybe I’ll stay a piece of shit forever keeping everyone at bay for someone who can only exist in my head."
lonely,"Lost, lonely, touched starved married man","Lost, lonely, touched starved married man - Yes, I am married. I am a decent man. Far from perfect, talk to much, sometimes I drink too much. But damn I am faithful, hard working, loving and caring. 

My wife is an overworker, when she’s not working is on her phone, playing games. Like talking to a wall. She’s never been much of a cuddle Buddy but has gotten worse. Rarely wants to talk unless it involves her, rarely wants to hold hands, sit next to each other…

A few years ago as I was going through an difficult time, bad health issues and unable to work my second job… I had a breakdown or few and shared some on my most painful moments in life, cried, wept… 

Was told by my wife and daughters, it was too much, they didn’t want to hear anymore. So I shut up. Just stopped talking, expressing myself.

Maybe I’m in the wrong sub, the moderators, please let me know. 

I am so very lonely, I am so starved for conversation, intimacy, hugs, cuddles, just want to talk to someone who wants to hear, who maybe cares.

I am not ugly, not pretty, I’m older, I am faithful, but need some one to talk to, about real life, pain, healing, dreams, joy and laughter…

Am I in the right place? Is there a place for that?"
lonely,It’s not fair,"It’s not fair - It’s not fucking fair. I always see Instagram posts about how people are out and hanging out with their friends, going to parks and having a good time. Every fucking time I look on someone’s Snapchat story or go through Instagram I see people having a good time, while all my “friends” from school brush me off. It’s not fucking fair, I was an extrovert my entire life now I’m rotting away in my bedroom while everyone around me is out and enjoying life. It’s not fair, it’s not fucking fair at all."
lonely,Feeling extremely lonely :(,Feeling extremely lonely :( - 21 M can anyone please be my friend
lonely,I have no one amd don't belive I ever will,"I have no one amd don't belive I ever will - I haven't had friends since I graduated high school. I tried to keep contact with them but they completely stopped inviting me to things and never text me unless I did first. I didn't want to be annoying so I stopped texting them. Now the only time I see them is on Snapchat stories where I see them all hanging out together.  It makes me wonder if they all secretly didn't want me in the group when we were younger.

Now I go to places like discord and anyone who keeps a 5 minute convo with me, I think of as a friend but then that just ruins me at the end of the day when I realize we will never speak again. Same with apps like amino but every person on there now is a scammer. 

My dating life isn't so hot either. In fact, I never had a girlfriend. I've tried 3 different dating apps and I'm rarely liked and those rare times I am matched, they are catfish, will ghost me or (the less attractive ones) are in it for s*x only. 

All I ask is for 1 person to be in my life. One person who will actually care about me, talk to me, just be there for me. If that someone were to come here right now, my life would change A LOT and for the better. I wouldn't be stuck in my constant sad, pathetic loneliness. I'd have someone to keep happy while they make me happy. What did I do to deserve absolutely no one while watching everyone else with others?"
lonely,"Everywhere you go, there you are.","Everywhere you go, there you are. - I just want someone to see me as I really am not someone to be changed or fixed or healed. Every fucking night I get this all consuming lonliness and its so tiring. I wish there was someone who wanted to keep texting or taking to me on the phone until we both fell asleep. 

I have so much love to give but somedays it feels no one is there to recieve it and those who had never reciprocated after I laid my heart on the table and my soul bare. 

Just ranting, thanks for reading this far if you have. Know you are not alone in being alone...even if just some anonymous dude on the internet said so."
lonely,Is this it?,"Is this it? - Is this it?  Is this life?  Honestly sometimes it feels like it isn’t ever going to get better.  Most of the time actually.  I don’t even know if I’m capable of true happiness at this point.  The only time I’m not alone is at work. I don’t feel like it CAN get better, no matter what I do.  I don’t want to live this life that feels like it’s not mine anymore, I just want to be happy, just once."
lonely,few years in social isolation and everything seems so bizarre,"few years in social isolation and everything seems so bizarre - I’ve(22f)being living by myself in my apartment for a few years with very little human contact (besides going to a grocery shop or saying hi to my neighbors).I work from home.
It all started with me getting overwhelmed with my depression.I’ve started isolating myself.I feel like I’ve wasted so much time,will be turning 23 by the end of this months and these 3 years in isolation flew by so fast.
I could’ve done so much more within these 3 years but I let depression take over me.The thing that makes me feel so lonely is probably not having friends or life in general.I don’t care about dating etc so that doesn’t bother me.Sometimes when I go out and see groups of friends,it makes me feel so miserable.I haven’t made any significant memories in last 3 years…I used to be a normal person but now I feel extremely alienated.I used to have friends,had a desire to look forward to something.It’s my fault and I gotta start changing things before I waste more time.But rn I feel too depressed to function.Don’t feel human.I’ve been depressed for 7 years and tried getting help,but my experiences with therapists in my country were not pleasant.Gotta try giving therapy a shot again.
Hugs to all depressed and lonely people🫂"
lonely,I’m not gonna find anyone,"I’m not gonna find anyone - I miss having someone to snuggle. I just wanna have someone to love with all my heart and for them to reciprocate. Someone to hold me and kiss the top of my head. Someone who won’t be weirded out by my problems, my depression, my autism, my weird fetishes (they don’t need to explore them with me just don’t treat me poorly for it). I know I’m being dramatic but I’m so hopeless and lonely."
lonely,I dont know how to get help. Im lost and don't know what to do,"I dont know how to get help. Im lost and don't know what to do - Every since I started going to middle my life shifted, I was the boy who was always happy and loud and then for some reason I lost that happiness. I started hanging by myself, then I moved schools which made it worse. I got bullied all the way to 9th grade. I am alone, no friends, I don't know how to talk people the right way. When COvid hit I was happy got to stay home and not have anxiety nor get picked on. I was good at math and was a decent student gpa 3.5. But when covid hit it just made reailxe how alone I was, if i died no one would care besides my parents. I started talking to myself, falling into delusions and I did this for until now. I suddenly popped from my mind or something I feel like im going crazy, not having friends. Ive  attempted changing but I keep falling back to the loop. I have no idea what to do in my life, where to go, how to do simple things, I'm empty and been empty for a while, I have to fake to be happy, sad. I know this will sound mess up but one of my family memebers passed away last year I didn't feel anything which made me afraid I would force myself to cry and act angry, my paranoids mind search it up and just made things worse for me, ""am I evil, am I a psychopath, am I this and that, am I gonna hurt someone"" shit like that that just made me feel crazy. I write this now knowing I am not those things but I cry and feel those emotions I have hold in for a long time. As a kid ive seen my step father attempt suicide, being homeless, my other step father abuse me and my mom. I just want help or to start over, I regret not doing things that would've helped me. I want to end it all but I i have feeling that the ""afterlife"" is not a good place for those who end their journey early idk what to do now"
lonely,I am no one's first priority,"I am no one's first priority - It's a celebratory atmosphere right now where I live and everyone's going out with their friends and I have no friends. I had one, she told me she's sick and hence we cancelled all plans we had and I stayed at home, mostly studying and applying for internships trying to be productive, while she...haha...she was out partying! Her friend accidentally posted a story on social media of them partying.

A few days ago my dad told me that I'm so toxically competitive and full of issues that I'll be left alone by everyone. That's what's happening. I've always been a very anxious person with very little tolerance for bullshit so I'd always call out people's bullshit and hence obviously I have one friend. HAD. I guess she too found herself more compatiible with the cool crowd.

I'm actually okay with being lonely, but sometimes it just dooms on me that no matter whoever tells me they care about me I am never their first priority. My parents are shitty toxic people whom I can never rely on and at the end of the day all I have is a Reddit full of strangers who'll maybe only give a shit for two minutes."
lonely,She,"She - She is online at social medias almost all the time... i don't even know her at all to send messages or something like that. We already talked with each other but I don't know what do to, don't have friends to talk to. I feel like I don't have enough courage to text her... i don't wanna bother her at all, i would like to ask her out but I can't... looks like I have some block or something like this

Don't know if I love her but I feel something special for her, at the same time she is happy with a guy (not her bf) but I feel like I don't wanna screw the things up between them. I'm just waiting my time.

Thanks to hear me."
lonely,Feeling like giving up,"Feeling like giving up - Hey Everyone,

I hope you guys are doing somewhat okay.

Here is my story:

3 years ago my girlfriend broke up with me - I totally deserved it, and was a piece of shit back then -, but since it happened everything is going in a downwards spiral, and I just can’t stop it.

Before this all happened, I was a really energetic guy, who always was down to any random ideas any of my friends brought up. I enjoyed talking to people, sharing experiences, having debates and also had no issues talking in front of a crowd.

After the break-up, I started to develop some mental issues, and I isolated myself from anyone. I also started drinking and doing coke heavily which - surprise-surprise - didn’t help at all…

Right now I‘m experiencing crippling social anxiety whenever I’m surrounded by people - kinda interesting but I’m still good on a 1 to 1 basis, I’m starting feeling anxious if there are more people, who listen to what I say - my self-esteem is at an all time low, and just to put the cherry on the top of all this mess, I buried myself in work just to forget about all this, so naturally my friends drifted away for good.

Here is the thing: I have zero friends, no family and basically no-one to talk to except for the random girls I met at bars, and we somehow end up at my apartment.   
But even the one night stands cannot make me happy anymore, not socially nor sexually. I feel like a walking dildo, and I’m super ashamed of myself, but on the other hand I’m craving social interactions, and it seems like this remained the only way I can have talks, and share my thoughts with others. 

I hate this feeling, I hate being alone, and also hate feeling isolated.

Sometimes I just think about other peoples life’s and how I’m just a background character in everyone else’s life.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post."
lonely,I just feel so alone and miserable these days,"I just feel so alone and miserable these days - I have a few friends but they're not exactly the type of people I can vent to. They're so childish I feel like i'm friends with a bunch of 10 year olds despite being in our early 20s. I've been single for years, and I'm beyond miserable. I dont think that being in a relationship would cure my depression but man i would at least feel somewhat less lonely and less romance starved. 

I dont think i'm a bad looking guy, or even a shy person, i'm just an introvert who has trouble making \*serious\* connections with people. Romantic, platonic, whatever.

lonely,On Intimacy | A piece I wrote earlier this year to express my desires.,"On Intimacy | A piece I wrote earlier this year to express my desires. - His nose tickles my cheek and my neck as he pulls me closer.

There is music playing.

Something he’s played surely a million times, but with his fingers grabbing my belt loops swaying my hips to the rhythm of his breath in my ear I don’t mind.

This is intimacy.

Presence without performance. Unwrapping each other emotionally. Seeing each other for who we truly are, and staying.

Leaning in closer to taste even more of this imperfection.

This isn’t a honeymoon, it’s better.

It’s his hands scrubbing my back in the shower. It’s my borrowing his deodorant.

This isn’t a performance anymore.

We piss each other off regularly, yet we always return.

We have no fear of rejection.

There is no reason not to show up exactly as we are; broken, sad, anxious, excitable.

*This is intimacy.*

His breath in my ear as we barely even sway… just rest in each others arms.

This isn’t just now, this isn’t just today. This is tomorrow and all of the days.

This is intimacy.

His breath tickles and excites me.

I cannot wait to be pissed off again.

~

Tonight I am again left to ponder my loneliness and how it contrasts with my desires.

I remind myself that I have chosen to be alone. I am choosing what I want most (genuine connection and intimacy.) over what I want now. (Someone to fill the emptiness.)

*I am choosing what I want most over what I want now.*

It’s hard to remember that sometimes.

To anyone else feeling the emptiness tonight—by choice or otherwise—you are loved. Your value is seen, and it is appreciated."

It would be nice to have someone to help motivate me and say positive things to keep me going when I start to doubt myself. For now, I’ve been practicing self-compassion and affirmations; but, it would be nice to know someone else is on my side and believes in me. Or to talk about other things to distract and take a break from the hunt from time to time."

I’ll try to make this as short and straight to the point as I can. I’ve been with my “girlfriend” for about 5 years now and the past 2-3 of them I’ve been miserable. By miserable, I mean there is a stop sign in every direction I turn. She’s completely erased all of the friends I had because of her jealousy and every time I try to leave her, she draws me back in with her threats and manipulation. It’s a nightmare I feel like I’ll never awake from and almost as if I’m lost with no way out. I also blame myself at times because I let her do it.. let her walk all over me and take advantage over the years. My entire family can see right through her and they know what kind of person she is. Seeking a true friendship, I would like to find someone who can help me out and pull me out of this. Not only advice but someone who is patient and will stick by my side through the good and bad. I guess you could say I’m sending an application over reddit for friends which may sound desperate but because of her, I feel like I can’t make friends around my area. Take my hand, be that person and I’ll show you what I can do. I’ve been searching and I won’t give up on.. let’s create this new beginning. Preferably looking for people around New York."

I don’t want to be part of the lgbt community if that means I have to pick friends from like 5 lgbt people wtf, I don’t want to have to question whether someone I’m talking to supports gay people, I don’t want to have to deal with that uncertainty, idk I don’t think it’s like that, why is life so hard, people will never understand the struggles of being lgbt unless they are, like take all your problems socially and make them worse, life is so fucking hard.

I also don’t like people, people are just so complicated to be friends with and I feel so depressed being alone, I feel like nobody likes me and I can never be fully honest, but I don’t want to walk around with a label on my back, I’m just a person not something to be defined like that, that’s not my entirety as a person, and I feel like a failure not being able to go off to college, having to go to community college, and I’m worried about my grades, and nobody from before quarantine wants to talk to me anymore. And I just feel stupid and ugly and unaccomplished, and lonely and depressed and confused. The idea that being gay determines your lifestyle and identity is so disgusting, it should be a choice, but instead it’s like the only possible thing, I don’t know, I just feel like I’m going nowhere with my life and nobody likes me and I must be ugly or boring or weird, I just wish it was easy. I’m tired of trying to make new friends because everyone has always left me, I met a nice girl who would always say hi to me and was super sweet, accept, she moved away a few weeks ago, it’s like I was born, just to suffer and that the universe wants me to be alone and unhappy, so many people have just left me with no explanation and I want to know what’s wrong with me, what fucking thing I’m doing, I don’t even know what to search for in people, no type of person seems to like me and I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I think I’m just your standard empathetic gay closeted boy with empathy and repressed feelings… idfk"

lonely,I'm absolutely terrible at making friends and keeping them.,"I'm absolutely terrible at making friends and keeping them. - I suck at making friends and always have. Growing up, I've always made acquaintances with others very easily, and would even be invited to join others in activities. For some reason though, I would almost always turn them down. Sometimes it would simply be that I wanted to go home and just relax all alone and play video games. Other times I think I was just afraid to. I'm not sure why. My mother would encourage me to go out with them whenever she could, but I was always stubborn about it. Looking back now, I deeply regret it, having missed out on so many opportunities for other friends and experiences. Friends that I would make back then would eventually become frustrated with my turning them down and we'd quit talking. I don't blame them for that either.

&amp;#x200B;

I've somehow made friends with two people back when I was in middle school, which then continued after graduation from high school. Due to unfortunate circumstances, my one current friend, Steve and I, cut ties with the second friend, Trevor, so now it's just us. Steve is a great friend, and I'm glad to be stuck with him, but sometimes I wish I had more likeminded friends to just talk to. I believe that the only reason that Steve and I are still in regular contact with each other is due to our love for video games. It's what we became friends over way back when, but as time goes on, it's become harder to ignore the fact that we have very few little things in common now. Steve also has a family of his own now that takes up a lot of his time. When we do find the time for games, we mostly only talk about the game we are playing, gaming news, what's going on in the world, our daily lives, our work life, etc. His other interests and hobbies, I have no interest in just as he doesn't have any interest in mine.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a good amount of game genres that I like and I don't have anyone to play with or talk to about it, like JRPGs or Platformers. They're not Steve's cup of tea, which is understandable. I never went to college, and started working right after graduating from high school and have worked ever since. It was hard for me to make friends back in school, and now I find it damn near impossible. I live in the middle of nowhere (USA), so I don't have much to pick from when it comes to meeting new people (even more rare to find others with similar interests to mine.)

&amp;#x200B;

I adore Japanese culture. Anime, Manga, Vtubers, History, Music, you name it. I've recently began self-teaching myself Japanese, and have been enjoying it so far (Kanji is hell lol). Steve loathes anything anime related, so I also have nobody to talk about it with either. Anime in my area is seen as extremely weird by the vast majority, so I don't go around announcing it to others, especially at my workplace. I goof around and talk to others at work over random things, but I feel like that just makes me feel even more lonely, having to stand there and just listen to the others gush about their interests and hobbies to each other. I do rarely find some people that like playing games. But they're very casual gamers, and it's only the same games that Steve and I play, which is always disappointing to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried using Discord to talk with others about games, anime, and vtubers, but it never goes anywhere. I sometimes have fun with one server I've found, but it's rare to have an actual conversation about something that lasts. (For some odd reason it seems that most people I've found on Discord are turned off to long-winded conversations)

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I hope you enjoyed my TED Talk. I'm not necessarily looking for advice, but I'll appreciate any. Just needed a place to vent my frustrations."

Talked to a few guys online &amp; it helped me gain some weight &amp; confidence I needed to. I met a guy on a dating app after that &amp; he seemed so into me. He mentioned marriage &amp; children,  all things I want.  Men have done this to me before though, even when truly they're getting nothing, no reward for saying they love me or whatever. So why go so hard with the sweet talk? I don't need a man to promise me these things to go out with him, I'm so confused too because now his pet died &amp; now not talking to me. I just lost my pet a few weeks ago so I totally understand why he needs time.

I don’t place blame on anyone for my shortcomings in dating but I’ve never been able to get the girls I was into. I’ve had a lot of meaningless hook up sex but these moments have left me more empty as time goes by. I don’t have hate, hard feelings or any of that and if anything I’m harder on myself because of how things turned out. I have a job and hobbies I’m passionate about, These things keep me occupied.

Im a 20F I have quite a small friendship circle and I no longer live in my hometown due to circumstances and I made friends in a different area whilst leaving all my old friends in my hometown. But they’ve been so preoccupied recently and don’t bother to check in with me anymore or they only check in when it’s beneficial to them and or when it’s convenient to them and it hurts. I spend so much time trying to involve them in my life by messaging and calling them but I feel a little unappreciated because they don’t spend as much time as me when it comes to keeping in touch. I don’t have any parents due to past abuse and trauma and I live far away from my family. I guess I’m a little envious of the fact they have such a strong support circle when they are low, whereas I have them and only them, but I always seem to get let down. They know about my history and know I can be a little clingy and need reassurance in friendships as I struggle with trust issues. And I feel like when they don’t reply like I’ve done something wrong and they think I’m being annoying and I get this rage when they don’t reply or it seems like they don’t care. This has left me feeling lonely than ever as I have no one to speak to about my problems and my emotions. I always argue with them because I crave the attention I didn’t get as a child and my mind tricks me into believing that if they don’t reach out and speak to me that they don’t care, even though I know this isn’t the case and I know they do care. I just don’t know where to stand when it comes to maintaining friendships so I don’t end up alone. Any suggestions or comments would be appreciated. I’m willing to take some advice on this matter."

Then, her heat switched to a cold, the 1 day response switched to a 4 days, then a +1 week... justified by ""I work 6 days a week, sometimes 7. I don't always look at my messages."" (When she like and post things on Facebook).

My most probable theory would be that she saw my pictures and said ""Ew, no!""...

I didn't have high expectations while trying to approach this girl (because experience?) but... Jesus Fu\*\*ing Christ! How am I suppose to find the courage to talk to girls when it always jinx like that!? Is it the ""Friendzone""?

I was at a campsite with a bunch of people I didn't know but in the dream it felt like they were friends. I was nighttime, but it suddenly, miraculously changed from night to day in a matter of seconds, and I was immediately compelled to enter into this tent. A beautiful, studious-looking young woman was inside. I was talking with her for awhile, but over time she grew less and less patient with me. I asked her what was wrong, she did not respond. I asked if she wanted me to leave, if she needed her space. She gave me a stern look and told me that I ask too many questions, and I ask too many questions in order to avoid asking the right questions. The dream ended."

Our god moments are really good and he’s not abusive physically. Emotionally he makes jabs which could be written off as true observations about me, like that I’m clumsy or have trouble making eye contact. I recently cut my finger bad enough to need 18 sutures. Which made the comments about me clumsy come back more :/ but I love his presence and friendship despite this hurting my feelings. He stopped by at my birthday party as my boyfriend and only friends who stopped by and hung out for 5+ hours. He genuinely seems to like me. I wish I didn’t feel the sick need to make him love me, after all I’m only human and would not want to manipulate anyone in to loving me. I’ve been manipulated into saying i I love the person abusing me before. I’m just a lonely gal willing to drive half an hour for my bf who won’t say I love you back.

I had friends in high school and college, but they were more like classmates or acquaintances. After graduating, I have drifted away from them as well.

I have noticed them being a bit more distant the last few months though and now they have completely ghosted me.

I know they are going through a lot right now so I have tried to be as understanding as possible but it definitely feels like they are completely pushing me away at this point.

lonely,nobody really cares,"nobody really cares - everyone in this day and age is so goddamn selfish, nobody cares about anyone but themselves. You see all these posts and campaigns where people spew nonsense like ""check up on your friends or that quiet stranger"" or ""be kind to each other"" or what have you but 99% of the time nobody actually does that unless it benefits themselves, the only thing that matters is themselves and their social clout or status or whatever and

nobody cares about anything besides how much money or power or status you have anymore, your value as a person is defined by these stupid things like looks or the the dollars in your bank account or how popular or cool you are even though none of that is real and everything is subjective

compound all this tenfold if youre poor and ugly, pretty privilege and the halo effect are so real, everyones always ready to ""fix"" others if theyre good looking or handsome or cute or whatever, but if you arent youre treated like a piece of scum

everyones so ready to throw away their morals for a quick buck or instant fame, loyalty is damn near nonexistent, people shame you if you're a virgin for being a social reject, and if you have had partners theyll shame you for being promiscuous

the people that make the top level decisions and laws are often unfit to lead and quite stupid, we worship and idolize politicians but in reality most of them are sociopathic narcissists and as a result the majority of society finds these inhumane selfish characteristics to be valuable and those that are machiavellian and cunning like them can easily rise to the top without any reguard for their humanity or morality

why is it that when i am sad and reach out to people for support they tell me to just get over it and that its all in my head, when my friends that are traditionally attractive get all the support and help they need from anyone they ask, am I less human than them?

i am bitter, broken, and defeated, i loathe myself for being given this lot in life, and i loathe society for making me and many others feel like this

i did not realize the frequency of which i had thoughts of self harm or suicide, I assumed that it was normal for most people to have them but i suppose it is abnormal to have them everyday, but what can one do when they lack being treated with dignity and value in this messed up world

lonely,I can't relate to other men.,"I can't relate to other men. - Everything revolves around hooking up with girls it seems. Recently I told some people I grew up with about some traveling I did. The first thing they asked was if I banged some hot foreign woman? Not if I saw some beautiful places or met interesting people.
I don't find sex appealing so it seems really weird. 
I find it stressful being around groups of guys. There's always this pressure to not come across as weak or feminine.
I used to work construction and I worked just as hard as the other guys. I could never pick up the mannerisms though, I was picked on alot and was always worried about saying the wrong thing. Working blue collar jobs, it was a constant struggle to not appear vulnerable, otherwise someone might see me as a target.
Sometimes I'll call the crisis line and a man will pick up the call. I'll call again later to try and get a girl because I can't open up with men. I've had so many times where my ideas are shot down, or men attack me for being vulnerable. I have this deep seated fear of opening up with guys.
I can relax around woman alot more, but they don't seem interested in talking to me. Alot of the time they seem afraid. I wish I was born a woman."

Idk anyone here and I’m just too shy to talk to anyone. I sit alone in lectures and I commute by myself - which I guess can be considered progress, considering I have really bad social anxiety and that there was a time where I spent a many months without leaving ever my house once.

And I guess it’ll be nice to look back on this post in a year and see how things have changed (for the better, hopefully). I hope I’m not as lonely and that I’ve found someone, or some people, to be friends with here."
lonely,Almost feel like quitting.. life,"Almost feel like quitting.. life - Feels like I’m only doing worse everyday. 

There is no love life - I’m too pessimistic about every guy - either he is an asshole or he is too nice.

I’m not getting exciting work nowadays. The work I’m doing - feels like someone else is taking the credit for it.

I have decided to not talk to friends anymore because I think they do not care.

I used to workout and that would make me feel good but nowadays that does not help too.

Other than my parents, I feel there is no purpose for me living anymore."
lonely,i'm used to having no one but why does it still hurt so bad,"i'm used to having no one but why does it still hurt so bad - most of the time i can ignore the loneliness but sometimes i just break down. i'd give anything to have someone to spend time with and to love me as a person, even just a friend. i feel so pathetic lying here crying in bed"
lonely,I fell so alone.,I fell so alone. - I have friends but I love being alone. But not lonely. Does anyone understand?
lonely,First rant I’ve ever done - Background character?,"First rant I’ve ever done - Background character? - So, I just turned 19 as of last month. I’m military so I was out in the field and didn’t have a celebration. Nor did anyone even ask me if i was celebrating when I got back. This led me to have a sort of realization with my life. I’ve always felt like a “background” character so to speak. I’ve always felt that way ever since middle school. I feel that no one really pays attention to me at all despite me trying to stand out or speak to people. I think it’s partially why I joined the military. So that maybe, people would see me, see the things I’ve done, and recognize me. But it barely made a difference. The only difference I’ve seen is when I’m in uniform back home in my small town. Even then it doesn’t last very long because being in uniform while on leave seems kinda taboo to me so I’m never in it long. I’ve tried to make connections with people everywhere, I’ve gone out to new places, tried to hang out with co-workers. And almost nothing. This also only feeds into the fact that I can’t seem to make a connection with a partner either. No matter how many people I message, or try to interact with. I always seem to be the last option. I’ve tried all the apps to meet new people as well, to no avail of course. I guess I’m just trying to figure out why? Why can’t I make connections? Why does no one seem to notice me? Even after all the struggle I’ve done to try and stand out? I don’t know truly. And maybe I never will know. I just needed somewhere to rant so I apologize if this was a bore to read. It was a spur of the moment thing to attempt to lift my spirits."
lonely,I guess I'm just supposed to not have a romantic partner.,"I guess I'm just supposed to not have a romantic partner. - I'm 21 M. Never had a girlfriend, no kiss, even not a single date. I have a few friends from high school but only male. We aren't seeing each other much anymore cause everyone moved in different directions. I'm in college and also work part-time. I can't really make any new friends. I have some 'class buddies' in college but we don't hang out.   
But the thing I really crave is romantic partner, a girlfriend I could take care of, cuddle with, talk about anything with. And that's something I started feeling like I will never have. I'm enourmosly bad at talking to strangers, especially to female strangers. So I have no idea how could I get a girlfriend. Also I don't like dating apps, don't think that is the way to go. I've been trying to talk to this one girl recently, but it ended badly.   


I am going to bed everyday with no motivation to get up the next morning. There will be people saying I should focus on myself, focus on my career etc. but I will tell you one think. Having someone you do it for is what it makes worth it. I could be in some dead end job and live alone until I die. Education, school and everything, you always doing it for someone in your life. And I feel like my life purpose is really just provide to my partner and make her happy. That's just how I feel it."
lonely,I need help,I need help - The cracks are starting to show again.  I fucking hate this world so much I’d be happy to watch it burn.  I’m so fucking angry at how I’ve been treated in life.  Nothing ever works out.  Every giving thing I have is just something to take.  I’m never included.  Always kept at arms length.  I want to move back in my parents at 35 because they’re the only people that give a shit if I live or die.  Nothing I do helps.  Nothing ever works.  Everyone gets something while I just suffocate in their presence.  I fucking want to die every fucking day.  I’m a sad grown man so starving for any type of positive reinforcement I feel like a barren desert inside.  Every day I die inside a little more.

I don’t know why but it’s been worse lately. It seems/feels like everyone but me is lonely and I want to scream at anyone who talks about their relationships (I don’t actually. I just stay silent, but boy, do I want to)"
lonely,i’m exhausted,"i’m exhausted - how do people fight the loneliness? i (28M) live alone, i have friends but they don’t seem to care or at least they only act like they do when they need something. i have family that care but i’ve been a burden to them enough already. 
i’d love a relationship, i’ve had girlfriends before but they never last long and now i either get ghosted or i’m the asshole that ghosts because they just don’t understand that i can’t keep up with constant talking, but then that adds to the loneliness.
the past couple of weeks i’ve felt worse, i work from home so i don’t see people at all during the day and i’m always left out of things when it comes to friends, so i turned to alcohol to try and block out the feeling of being so alone. but as i’m sure many people have experienced too, that only makes it worse. 

how do you cope with it?"
lonely,Realized I Don't Have A Best Friend,"Realized I Don't Have A Best Friend - I have a lot of casual friends. One of them called me the other day and really needed comforting. I went to his apartment and hugged him, sat with him etc. He's a paranoid schizophrenic and after I left I called his emergency contact, who is his girlfriend, who he'd just had a fight with... but probably the best person to talk with to make sure he was alright.

When we were talking she said ""well, why did he contact you and not one of his close friends that live nearby?"", and I thought that was kind of a fucked up thing to think about when I was talking about being concerned for his safety. Then I realized that I don't actually have anyone like that in my life. That none of the people I hang out with and interact with are close friends. Someone you talk with every day and don't hesitate to contact when you're in a bad spot.

I'm glad my friend felt comfortable enough with me to reach out for help (I'm sure it was after he tried his other friends), but we're not close. I only know him because he's my friends boyfriend.

I'm just tired of seeing all my friends who have that someone in their lives whether it's a best friend, partner, spouse, and feeling empty. I've haven't had that for a long time, and I'm always trying to find it."

I had so many chances and I am still sharing too much talking too much. - A warning think before you speak. I control myself now despite some failures but don't drive your friends away. Think before you speak be measured. It's hard cause you're supposed to be out going at the same time but you have to master this. I wish I had in my 20s. I'd have more friends. Women still would have rejected me though. Being a little guy down there is a curse but eh I learned to not need a girlfriend but man would it be nice to still have friends. I am a neck bread in the worst ways or at least I was.

She tells me he misses me but is worried about a few things, she says she will talk to him and that she isn't trying to interfere, that she is there to support us both. She says it had to come from him (which I agree)

She says she will get back to me, this was yesterday and I never heard anything else about it.

lonely,At Least It Can Be Put To Use,"At Least It Can Be Put To Use - \[24, M\] Frozen Purgatory of Canada

I'm throwing a message in a bottle into a sea of messages in bottles here, but I'm so unbearably lonely. All of my recent attempts to post here or elsewhere have gone unnoticed-- or have been downvoted.

I don't know where to start, but I'm not sure if I need to worry about that.

Over the years, I've grow to be comfortable with-- and enjoy-- solitude. Part of it is genuine, but part of it feels like some sort of ""melodramatic emotional masochism"". I have always enjoyed the romanticised portrayal of melancholy, and I am a creative, so I put my own such feelings to use in my creations.

I'm fine with all that, but when something real and important IRL comes along, it isn't so enjoyable. But it still is to a degree, as I've already suggested.. It fuels my creativity.

Without such things, I have no creative drive. I've already tried. I cannot be creative when I am anything other than depressed or lonely.

It ought to be noted, however, that any attempts to dissuade me from such thinking or methods would be nearly \*offensive\* to me.

Anyway. I have 2, \*maybe\* 4, friends, but I never see any of them because they're always busy. I'm an only child and I live at home (which I'm not happy with-- both being an only child and still living at home at my age...) I have a mild physical disability, am poor with socializing, and have agoraphobia, severe anxiety, and dysthymia.

It's hard for me to make friends for various reasons-- and also I don't really want more at this point.

What I want is, as I put it, ""a companion with whom I may be affectionate, and for &amp; about whom I may care"".

I really just want a companion. I'm working on myself, and building myself up to a point where I'd be more of a ""catch"", so to speak, but what am I meant to do in the meantime?

I've had to change myself in so many ways over the past 9 years. Mostly because I'm young and I'm not sure who I am or what I think yet-- indeed many are the same way until at least middle age-- but also because I want to be more appealing to the opposite sex. 

None of the opinions or lifestyles-- political, religious, or other-- that I've held over the past number of years have stuck. Primarily for the former reason, but a little for the latter. I have experimented with almost every viewpoint and combination of viewpoints and lifestyles under the sun. Nothing has worked, clearly, for me. So I don't really care to much for these topics in general anymore.

Point being, I have wished to have a wife and children one day, but due to various factors, I have been steadily downgrading my expectations in this regard to the point where I would be happy enough with a mere companion as I have already mentioned. The way the world and society are, as well, it may be better to not have children either. Despite my feeling that to be a ""family man"" is my life's purpose.

I am very asocial and reclusive to begin with, but I understand the necessity of going out every now-and-then, and I bemoan my human nature for wanting someone to love and care about. The world, and many in in it, frustrate me very much. Hence my desire to seclude myself as much as is realisitic. I especially dislike governments...

I also feel, given my charateristics, aspects of my living situation, tentative opinions, and my lack of luck with any kind of romantic pursuit, that the world does not want me. It is good, then, that I have learned over the past 10+ years to be content with my own company. That does crack every now and then, however, hence my writing this.

When I was a kid, I wanted to be a Classicist or Historian, and I wanted to be married by the time I was 21 or so... It's interesting how life tends to ""fork"" as you go along, but I'm pretty settled on my current endevours, so this is really just an observation.

There, perhaps, is more I could write. At this point however, while I know I can build myself up and be more successful, I wonder whether-- even with ""Paradise \[Re\]Gained""-- I am meant to live out my life as some stereotypical brooding, reclusive creative of recent centuries...

(Thank Heavens for the likes of Patreon and Amazon etc.! Hahaha!)

Bearing all of this in mind: at least it can be put to use, as I've mentioned."

lonely,Advice for coping in hard times,"Advice for coping in hard times - Hey,
I’ve been lonely for a while, coming up on 2 years. Deleted all social media and cut myself off from everyone, as they were seriously bringing me down and holding me back. I live in a deprived area, and I was getting pressured to get involved in drugs, rape, all kinds of stuff that I just don’t agree with, and found the people around me to be self-absorbed narcissists who solve boredom with fights and extremely self destructive behaviour. 

At times, I like the loneliness, being disconnected from it all. Never worrying about the latest trends or whatever, not caring what anyone thinks, but mostly I’m just sad. I’ve recently started having panic attacks, and the loneliness is just really getting to me. I’ve had a bad couple of months, and having nobody to turn to or talk to, no way to let out all this sadness and bad emotion. I’m struggling to move forward in life and have no motivation at all.

Does anyone out there have advice, ways to cope with hard times on my own, ways to stop wanting to be a part of society. I see people together, enjoying each other’s company, and it makes me jealous. But I don’t want to be. I chose this path, and I guess I’m better for it, but it’s hard man. I just can’t find meaning, a reason to fight through it, cause at the end of the day I know I’ll just be dust in the soil, and I have else nobody to carry on for."

It's very rare for me to click with someone, and when I do, it never lasts anyway. The last long term friendship I had was through high school into my first year at college, but that crashed and burned. Made no other friends in school. I've always resorted to making friends through my relationships, but when those end, I lose the friends I've made too. Everything feels so situational and meaningless. I'm so tired of this. I want to be able to experience connections that aren't a boyfriend. It doesn't help that I'm very introverted and have social anxiety (mostly in groups or crowds, I'm pretty good one on one). I think I'm also about to get an ADHD diagnosis, so I'm wondering if that has always affected my ability to keep connections my whole life. Anyway.

lonely,I’m getting worse mentally,"I’m getting worse mentally - I find myself never talking to anyone. I only talk to my girlfriend who is very supportive and loving. I don’t have any friends at all. Not even one. 

My family members never talk to me at all. When my grandparents do talk to me, it’s only ever been condescending, judgemental words. Saying that I can never accomplish anything. It’s obvious they look down on me and don’t believe in me. Why? Because apparently i’m just too stupid according to them. But they treat all my siblings like pure gold. Especially my sister. My sister never talks to me unless she wants something. The only family member that talks to me like a decent human fucking being is my mother. 

I don’t talk to my family members at all besides my mother because of how they treat me. Frankly with the way they talk and act towards me, I don’t want them in my life what so ever.

To make matters worse I also have a very hard time creating friendships. 

I use to have a small bunch of blokes I hung out with heaps. Until I was nothing to them. It happened very under the blue. Completely unexpected. They stopped putting in any effort to hang out and talk to me. They stopped inviting me to events,  parties, road trips and hangouts. They would post it on their Facebook and Snapchat story. So I would always see it. Eventually they kicked me out of their friend group. After 5-6 years of friendship. It didn’t help that they did this at a very low point in my life. Now when they see me uptown they all give me the “oh it’s you look” like it’s such an inconvenience and they turn and walk the other way. Sometimes they even grunt disappointedly when they see me. One of the blokes in the group has a girlfriend and even she glares me down with such hatred. Like I murdered someone. She was like that the moment she first saw me, and met me. Naturally my first impression of her wasn’t great. All of this absolutely breaks me mentally.

All the other people I was friends with at the time also used me. For my car, money, etc. Especially this guy I use to class as my best friend for 11 years. Even though he never once acted like a best friend. 

I want to get out of town I live in. No one wants to be friends with me in my local area and I have too many bad memories in this town. I want to escape it. All of this has got me really depressed."
lonely,I want a girlfriend,"I want a girlfriend - I am a straight 38 year old male. Unfortunately that basically means any hope of any relationship is dashed. 

I served in the US Army. I also served in combat and am disabled. I have a pretty decent job. I live alone, and have 2 people in my life who at least care. I don't have any friends. So when I say I'm lonely, that's what I mean.

I hope some woman will come into my life, but I also know that that's basically impossible.

It's sad to say, but if any woman came on here saying ""I want a boyfriend"" or ""I want a girlfriend"" they'll be flooded with messages of desperation and plenty of outward support.

Being a male, will basically get crickets and a bunch of electronic dust."
lonely,I sexted older men on omegle and now I feel terrible about it,I sexted older men on omegle and now I feel terrible about it - Recently I've been feeling really lonely and sad and I just wish the someone really liked me or cared about  me so I went on omegle and started texting this older guy who was very sweet. I talked to him for about and hour and then he asked if he could see me on video I said yes but I was extremely nervous and I mostly just did it because I felt bad for him and because didn't want to let him down. When I saw him on camera I felt sick to my stomach. I lost all the feelings I had before and now I just felt lost and terrified. He asked to see me naked but then I just left because I couldn't do it. Now I just feel bad for guilty for leaving him and I just feel like I'm a stupid disgusting whore who deserves nothing. I'm really young and I know I shouldn't be doing this for my age but I just wish someone showed me some sort of affection. I just wish someone would hold me and tell me everything's going to be okay.

But what happens when you arent forced to be in school anymore, when you are somewhat ""free"", why do you stop talking to your school friends? My classmates that i had a lot of fun at school suddenly became very busy after school, they have no time for me anymore, adult life is about career, work, you are very short in time and all the other bullshit they told me. So im asking, why am i always up to meeting anyone, even if im busy i will definitely find time to meet, and they cant?"

lonely,lonely 1.0,"lonely 1.0 - I'm a 22 [M], 

So at the end of August was when I started feeling lonely again, at first I chose to attempt to fix it instead of dealing with like I've done in the past. I've gotten all sorts of advice in the past, but done of them seem likely to work. 

The advice I got at first  was to talk just talk to people, that seemed like easy advice at first until I actually tried it. For the last few weeks I've been getting to my community College early to eat lunch before my only In person class, but when I get their my social anxiety (self diagnosed) acts up and I often just eat alone. 

I've looked into joining a social club to help with that issue, but I can't really find anything online and I'm getting tired of seeing things like the widows group for instance in the meetup app. Most of those meetups aren't interesting and have members who are a lot older then me. I then decided to look into the clubs at my community College, but they are either accidemic  or religious based. 

Honestly at this point I'm kinda just lost on what to do."

lonely,Anyone else randomly remember the smallest but distinct details about your past encounters with people and have breakdowns?,"Anyone else randomly remember the smallest but distinct details about your past encounters with people and have breakdowns? - My college best friend and I had been together since high school. He never called me anything other than ""brother"", and I trusted him with a lot of things. 7 years ago, even when he spread bad rumors about me to my then-crush and got me blocked by her, he still said ""It's alright, brother. I will look into it"".

5 years ago, the person I liked back then told me ""Even if you were the last person on earth, I am not obligated to like you, am I?""

3 years ago, my course-mate and I accidentally swapped pencils during a lab. Two months later, she sent me a pic of the pencil (the one I originally owned) and said ""See, you're always with me"". Didn't hear from her again or got reply to any of my texts the next semester, because my usefulness as a course-mate was over.

A year ago, I was madly in love with someone I would call ""A"" (yeah, I know I didn't learn anything from my previous encounters). That person's best friend ""B"" had also been my friend for a long time. ""B"" knew that I liked ""A"" romantically but was against the idea of us dating. ""A"" was suffering from tooth pain for a while and could not go to the dentist due to some reasons. I wanted to take her to one but I also had my own issues at the time which prevented it. I asked ""B"" if she could take ""A"" to the dentist instead and that I will get ""B"" something in return. ""B"" went into a mad rage about how I had just tried to bribe her to do something for her best friend ""A"", and that I better know my god-damned place because ""A"" tells me about things way after she has told ""B"" about them."

She even recently started a book club with all her friends without me even though I had been saying for months I wanted to start a book club with her. 
I recently attempted to put more effort into making friends and hung out with someone I knew from my first year of university only to have her text me the day before we were supposed to meet up for a second time saying she didnt want to be friends because we were on 'different paths'. My already low confidence was really crushed by this. 
I'm surrounded by people at university who seem to have large groups of friends and are always spending time together and I feel like there must be something wrong with me. I dont know what to do."

lonely,"Some words about ""finding yourself""","Some words about ""finding yourself"" - I've been thinking a lot about the meaning of ""finding yourself"". There's the assumption that if you're trying to find yourself, that means you are lost. But it's not like a thing or an object that is lost in space and you have to phisically search for it to find it. When someone feels lost, that's multidimensional. It's not exactly about the place you live in. Not exactly about the time in history that you're alive. I'm sure people of all cultures in all moments in time have felt something similar to the feeling of being lost. But humans are good at creating meaning out of nothing, that's why it was possible to build a society around a green piece of paper we value more than most things. In my experience, being lost means missing the feeling of belonging somewhere or with some group. So it's a wonder why I moved 9.000km away from my friends and family to try to ""find myself"". I've never felt more lost."

lonely,I quite enjoy being alone/lonely!,"I quite enjoy being alone/lonely! - I turned 30 earlier this year, still living with the folks and a disabled younger brother so my definition of alone may differ.

I've lived a horrendously sheltered life which means I doubt I'll ever have much of ""normal"" life, even when I do move out and buy a place of my own.      

Despite that, I'm quite grateful. Despite avoiding people there are a few people that text me every now and then. I'm lucky enough to be involved in plans. Even managed to find love in my early 20's which didnt last long but left quite an impression on me. Not entirely sure what she saw in me, but its nice to look back on.

Not too sure what I'm getting at with this post, but it msy be aimed at the younger lads in here who might feel isolated in partly enjoying their regrettable isolation. Its the only time you might have to soul search and explore your interests.

The ex mentioned above contacted me recently which filled me with pangs of lonliness and self-defeating feelings, which concluded with the subject line - I quite like being left alone. If you guys like being alone to, dont worry about it, if you were wired differently you would have acted differently by now. All I ask is that you accept the odd invitation that comes your way. It may reaffirm your acceptance of solitude but it can at least give you small adventures to reflect on.

Sorry if this is a jumble of words, just felt like writing.

The worst part is that I will never be the guy for her, I know I should just drop my feelings and accept that she’ll never like me but it’s hard to do that.

I’ll never be able to make her happy and I hate myself for that. I need to move on from her but I work with her almost every day I work, it’s so hard to get rid of the feelings I have. I lied to other co-workers about me not having these feelings in fear that they would tell her. It hurts to lie to the people that I trust but I just can’t take the risk of her knowing. I just want to be happy with her but I know I never can be and never will be and I hate myself for feeling this way…"

How to cope with that?,"It's been almost three years since I don't kiss anyone due to Covid. Have any of you guys faced the same problem? How to cope with that? - I didn't use to kiss people because I was in love with them or something, I just went to parties and ended up kissing some cool/cute person I met there. It used to happen on some Fridays. Then Covid came and I didn't leave home except for doing groceries and do any other routine stuff. 

It turns out I really miss going parties and kissing people. I don't even consider going outside rn, not because of me but because of my parents who are not young like me and need to be protected from any kind of contagious disease. They don't leave home either and are healthy, and I want to keep them that way. 

I work from home and study too, but I don't have any friends, so it goes without saying that I don't flirt with anyone too. I don't want to flirt over the internet, though. I feel the need to make real connections, look into a person's eyes and feel their smell, you know.

lonely,How to break the curse,"How to break the curse - I'm in my 20s. For as long as I remember I've never really fit in.

I've realized that if I don't fix this sooner or later it would get worse. I now at a point where I try to be more social. I want to make new friends, but it's so hard to do, so so hard. I've just accepted that you can't force someone to be your friend, either they will or they won't. In order to try and move past this rut and actually grow with it, I think it would be beneficial to find that group, any place where I can grow as a person and have friends. It's hard and I'm stilling looking.

I personally thought the date went really well. We didn’t have sex or anything but we just made out and cuddled. Then yesterday we spoke all day. He said he missed me already and all this shit. He seemed so sure about me and I fr had no doubt that things were going great. Then today I saw that he unmatched me on bumble lol he also never responded to my last text yesterday asking about his cat lol I’m too scared to text him again. I don’t wanna come off desperate or something. I have a feeling he probably blocked my number or something but I think it would hurt too much to find that out so I don’t even wanna text him and find out lol why do guys do this shit? Does anyone have any advice? I’m so sick of getting ghosted and feeling so lonely fml.
lonely,Silence is deafening,"Silence is deafening - [I posted last week about how my girlfriend needed a week to thinkand I wasn't doing okay](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/q41q0q/not_doing_well/)

My girlfriend of 3.5 years told me that she can't keep the relationship going anymore. We were long distance because of the pandemic, and while we made as many trips as we could to see each other, the distance was making it too hard. I was dealing with it a bit better than she was, but I was still struggling too. When we talked today I had ways I could move to her, but she had other reasons that made the relationship too hard, and I agreed that it's best for us to be apart. 


Our love for each other hasn't faltered at all, and we still consider each other best friends. I hope there's a way we can keep that friendship for as long as possible, I know it'll be uncomfortable, and difficult, but we both said that if the pandemic didn't happen we'd probably be happily married by now. 


I can come to terms with the end of an amazing chapter of my life, but now I don't have anyone to talk to. I never realized just how loud silence was until recently, and it's really painful sit in it. I used to have a tight knit group of friends, but I had moved away and only returned home in March 2020, now I still have those friends, but not like I used to. 


It's really lonely... and I just wish I had someone to talk to. To say good morning to, and goodnight to. This is so painful, and it's worse knowing that my now ex-girlfriend is going through just as much pain. I miss her so much."

I have always felt that but at the same time my rationality always kept me sane and I told myself that I would be fine and I am not a failure. 

I went to bed and had a dream where It was some event in a place and there were a group of people aged around early 20s. There was an instance that I was talking to a girl who really resembles a crush I had years ago who has a very cheerful and playful personality at the same time a soft voice and a heartwarming smile. When she look me in the eye, and talk to me, it feels like she knows everything about me. In the dream I didn’t say the wrong thing I just looked so awkward and not confident which is not who I am. I know that no matter how not self insecure I am sometimes, I still have a little bit of “something” in which I would still be awkward but at least i sound confident and capable of humors and putting some smiles. But not with her. So in the dream we had a lot fun with the group, and at the end of the day I had a little chat with her and that was it. 

So in reality I was a friend of the person and we share some classes. We would do homework together, etc. when I asked her out one time, she was like “I am sorry I am not interested”. It was already near end of the semester and then I never really talk to her again. 

I know the past is past I should always look forward to the future and truth is I haven’t really thought of her for long time as I know there are things that matters more. 

I hope this story is not too boring, this probably sounds like every typical failed love story and then ended up feeling lonely and a failure. 😂"

Yesterday was Canadian thanksgiving, and I  had dinner with my boyfriend and his friends. They all talked with each other and I just sat there alone. They all used to work with each other so they are all pretty close, except for me.. sure my bf and everyone else checked on me to see if I’m ok, but all had nothing to say to me except some really short small talks.. 

I am graduating college soon and I’m reaching out to people on LinkedIn and Instagram to grow my network, but so far only one replied back to me.. the rest ignored me.. 

I’m also doing interviews for my thesis, but again, nobody is replying to me.. 

I have only one person that I consider a friend in college, but she stopped replying to my messages in November.. i messaged her in November 2020, and again in March, and finally today, but no reply.. I have no idea why.. 

I also have a group project for my professional practice course where we have to do a proposal as if we’re starting a business. Nobody teamed up with me so I’m doing the project alone.. 

I joined a Facebook group in my area where females can introduce themselves and hangout in person. I introduced myself to a couple but they also did not reply.. 

I work from home and do classes online so I don’t really socialize anymore.. my bf lives with me and I am very grateful, but other than him, I really have no one.

lonely,A painting made me burst into tears,"A painting made me burst into tears - Springtime by Pierre Auguste Cot. It's a lovely little painting of a man and a woman, presumably a couple given how the girl is looking at him. I've had it hanging up in my house for my entire life, and I just had to take it down today. I've been improving myself nonstop - better hygiene, getting out more often, expressing myself more - and all I have to show for it is what I had before; rejection and solitude. After I came home and I saw that painting hanging in my front room. Just how lovingly they looked at each other, I broke down because I know that no matter what I do, I'll never have that. There's someone I've been hoping to ask out but I'm tempted to just give up on them. I already know that I'll never be good enough for them, even if we did start something they'd likely drop me once someone better came along. I can't shake that feeling, and no matter how often people tell me that what I think isn't true, that doesn't change the fact that there is zero proof to support that. When you run 100 experiments and get the same result 100 times, it doesn't matter if someone more experienced tells you that result isn't guaranteed, you simply cannot argue with facts. I don't know what to do with the painting, or myself for that matter."
lonely,Why is life so damn hard?,"Why is life so damn hard? - So I’m 20 and decided not to go to college because it’s just not for me. All my high school friend are no longer in contact cause, well, I don’t keep in touch tbh. I have never made a real connection with anyone friend wise. I have never had a group of friends to hang with. I have never been invited to hang out with anyone. I am always the one who has to initiate a hang out. During high school this didn’t big me much. The being lonely wasn’t as hard because I had “school friends” (friends you just talk to at school) and I was on the swim team both high school and professional so I had friends there too. I also worked out every day so my day was packed and I didn’t really notice my loneliness. But now that I’m out of school and I’m the real world I want to die. I’m so damn lonely and sad. I have never had a girl friend or even a friend who is a girl. I’m shy because I was born different and it has made me very insecure. Needless to say I have never gone on a date but I have asked 3 people but they all said no. That didn’t really help with my self confidence. Now I’m just living day by day waiting for something different and exciting to happen. Unfortunately for people like me that doesn’t happen. Sometimes I wish I would have sole terminal disease like a brain tumor. That way I wouldn’t have to plan for the future. Wouldn’t have to care about finding a partner or having a family. I do want those things but I find it very unlikely. In today’s world we hear all this bs about “it’s not about looks and it’s about what’s on the inside that matters” women say this but don’t really mean it. If you are not attractive they won’t cent give you the time of day let alone a chance at a date. So that’s my life right now. Lonely and sad. I’m not suicidal. I could never put my parents through that. I just wish I wasn’t here sometimes. Or that I was just born normal like everyone else.

This is crippling me and I am tired. Take a nap- engage in one of your hobbies- watch a movie... None of it seems to stop the thoughts of this lonely feeling and it is really getting to me. I have a few wonderful people in my DMs at the moment. But the responses are getting scarce and some are ghosting. People are too busy to take the time to hear about someone else's day. I get it. But can we stop, breath, and vent? I will listen to you talk all night long. Just so I do not have to think about myself right now. I know that sounds bad. But it is true.

Today I actually thought...

*what if I just fucking jumped ship? Drove into a tree as fast as i could? Downed this bottle medication? Maybe two? What if I just wasn't here*

I *actually* thought those words? I know, it may seem silly...maybe not...but I never really *truly* felt like I just wanted to *die*. It was a scary as fuck thought.

I try really hard everyday bro. I want to wake up feeling good for once, I want to get my grades up I try really hard to focus and study but I just end up getting a bad grade. I’m not sure what to do, French is weighing me down I hate French I wish I could drop it but it’s too late. I have that mindset if I don’t take 2 languages during high school I won’t be able to get into a good college or a scholar ship or whatever. Maybe I could try asking the school counselor if I could still possibly drop the class cause it’s been messing with my mental health but Im worried they’ll say no and I don’t know I’m just worried about my future cause of the state I’m in. 

I need to find motivation and discipline and a better mind set and also advice to help with my brain function like memory and learning but I don’t know where to start. I really just feel like breaking down at school sometimes but I keep it inside. I think I would make things better if I got my grades up I can do everything but French I just can’t seem to do better I have a 46 in that class but I feel better to know there are some kids in that class that have a bad grade as me."

lonely,I really miss this one friend.,"I really miss this one friend. - Back when I talked to them, I didn't have many friends. I didn't feel lonely (not because of them, but I never felt this emotion of loneliness even if I was lonely). I wasn't going through anxiety nor was I going through waves of deep sadness like I do now. On the other hand, they seemed to have their fair share of struggles and a lot of the time, they'd come to me for help. I really didn't understand how to deal with them at the time, but I tried. I really did and I'm still glad to this day I was able to help them. 

There was more to our close friendship than this too. We really seemed to bond with ease. We shared a common interest in hockey (in fact, they found my personal account through one of my sport pages I had), we were in the same grade and were around the same age, and they actually admitted to having a crush on me. I never got with them though because I was never really interested in them at the time and even if I was, I'm not a fan of long-distance relationships (they were from Canada). I really liked them as a friend though. Like I don't think I've ever felt closer to someone else. 

We began talking less and less though slowly. This wasn't out of hate or anything either, I'm pretty sure it had to do with them trying to change. Plus, I was already slowing losing interest in them anyways as their problems were becoming too much for me to handle (I was only 15 and wasn't used to dealing with such problems). Eventually, they let me know they were going to unfriend me on Snapchat and I let them know I was fine with it. I was glad that we didn't just stop talking to each other like everyone else did.

Looking back though, I really miss that friendship. Honestly, if I experienced what I did back then, I feel like our bond would've been even closer and even stronger. It may have ended up as more as well. It's a shame that friendship had to end and it's a shame that we were never on the same page in one aspect. When they were down, I wasn't. When they were beginning to change, I was truly beginning to feel pain. Nowadays that pain runs deep and I can understand what they were going through in a way. 

Ever since that friendship ended, I haven't gotten close to another one. The closest friendship I had was one that lasted up until last year with someone from high school. We both dealt with anxiety and were really good friends, but not super close. That one slowly evaporated after high school though. Sometimes I wonder who'll be that next close friendship because I know I won't be lonely forever. I'm just reserved and wait for the right people to come to me."

Yet I can’t find anyone... not one person that wants me as a friend, let alone a boyfriend.... I crave a relationship; to have someone to hold tightly, to wake up and know that everything is alright, I dream so often about waking up in the arms of the people I see so often, but I know it isn’t them that I want. It’s the relationships that I’m seeing them go through with other people...

As for dating and sex life while that is a joke. I have not been in a relationship since middle school and I am not about to graduate from college. As for my sex life while I am a virgin still. 

This loneliness I feel hurt alot. Someday I feel like it would be better for me if I were dead. If I am dead atleast I would not have to suffer for the hurt and pain that is my life.

We were supposed to have our date this afternoon, found she unmatched me on Tinder this morning. No other means of contact, guess it's my fault for not asking for her number.

I even went to the spot anyway to see if she would turn up. She didn't

I just feel like this is the thing that broke me, I felt so humiliated. Everything is going to shit, everything that seems good in my life will literally always go bad. All my friends don't seem to actually give a shit about me, I'm always the one to have to reach out to people, and I haven't had someone close to me for about 3 years now. 

I feel so alone. I don't even know why I'm posting this, guess I just need somewhere to vent.

lonely,Realistically I will live a lonely life no matter what I do,"Realistically I will live a lonely life no matter what I do - I’m not a people person. I’m already asocial and I generally do not play well with others. I’m not a bad person, nor am I sociopathic. But I have heavy chronic depression and insomnia and I find myself eventually withdrawing from others. I have a difficult time feeling pleasure or happiness regardless of who I surround myself with, and that’s coming from someone who is involved in a lot of different circles, even as someone very introverted. I’m one of the first to leave parties and other social gatherings because I get overwhelmed and need a breather from people. I can’t always mask the fact that i’m not vibing. I can’t crash at people’s places. If i’m in bed with a girl I lie awake staring st the ceiling for a long time and I feel the need to dip out in the middle of the night. I partake in hedonistic behavior and spontaneity in desperation for pleasure because it fades quickly for me. For thousands of nights I lie awake, restless. It has occurred to me that realistically I will hurt for years to come and that no amount of company will ever fill that void. Days and faces pass me by like lights on the Highway. I am not suicidal and I will still take care of business, but I know it will be heavier than it needs to be, forever."

Thats the issue is that its so unrealistic for me to ever live on my own, my job doesn't even pay bad its just not enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Included with the contestant fear of never being enough financially I know I'm never gonna be enough affectingly. me and my ex girlfriend broke up almost 8 months ago and not a day has went by I don't think of her, I loved her and she was my first love and now I cant be happy alone anymore. i try so so hard I started growing shrooms, working overnights since wasn't able to sleep at night anways, and even talking to random girls or girls on tinder but its not the same and never will be nobody since has made me as blissfully happy, I feel like a robot ever since we broke up it doesn't even feel like 8 months ago it feels like a few days because everything just blurs together, I have no recollection of my conscious and I can feel my self awareness  fading day by day. 

&amp;#x200B;

i don't know I just like writing so other people can see cuz maybe they'll care. and the pages of pages of pleas for help on Microsoft word go un-noticed, I don't want anyone to tell me its gonna be okay and it'll just take time I just want people to see this so I know Im not already dead."
lonely,Lonely for 5 years,"Lonely for 5 years - Since leaving school I have had no relationship with girls and only have a handful of friends who I see maybe once every 2/3 weeks. I am chronically lonely

I am by myself 95% of the time regardless of the situation. 
I used to just think and believe I loved being alone and being independent, that it was a cool trait of mine. Recent pain and sadness has made me rethink my view on my behaviour

I generally don’t feel like anyone understands me whatsoever. I have no assurance my ‘friends’ even like me as I feel some tension or awkwardness whenever I speak in GCs or in person so I just don’t bother half the time.

lonely,Got rejected by my best friend,"Got rejected by my best friend - I already did this post on a another subreddit but I want to know opinions about this from other subreddits.
 
Starting this story, I have 16 and she have 16 too, we are on school, we are best friends but everything got wrong yesterday.

So we talk for a long time, 3 years, and we talked a lot (not on school because she said she didnt liked) so we had a nice friendship, we only had 2 discussions but everything was good.

1 month ago i had a discussion with her were i was wrong all the time and she blocked me but i apologized to her face to face (1 week after the block), she apologized me and we got back talking, the first week she was very angry to me, but after sometime we was back again being nice to each other, i tried to be the better me for her, but here comes a new characters.

On the first week after we stopped talking she got a new friend, i thought it was a like a guy from her class but it wasnt, I didnt care too much because i wasnt too much of jealous.

But after we started talking again, she was talking a lot about him (when i say it was a lot, it was), but she was always talking like this. ""I did somethings with him that i didnt did with anybody else, dont ask me details im not going to say"". I was like ""ok"" 

Skipping to this week. I wanted to talk with her why we didnt talk on school (face to face) but she was with the other guy 2 days in a row and i couldnt even had 1 minute with her. She said she was busy and only could talk with me on wednesday (she never talked with me on the wednesday even when i was waiting for her).

I was a bit tired and i said that to her and at the same i said the fellings i had (im in love with her, a lot). (She cried).

Day after i talked with her again, we did a call and was talking for some time, i did a playlist on spotify to her. And the topic about liking someone kicked in and she was talking and she said she liked a guy that didnt care about her, she said that she hugged the ex. I was like ""Wtf?"".

I talked with her about that and said if i had any chance with her ( i know that i did bullshit a month ago, but i was already a changed person for her, i was always wanting her to feel good with me, it was working) but she brings up a topic that made me angry, so, that guy that she said ""I did somethings with him that i didnt did with anybody else, dont ask me details im not going to say"", she said me what it was and she said she was giving hugs (a guy that she only knew on 1 week) and was talking a lot with him. She said to me ""Do you know that guy that i walk with him? So the detail is that im giving him hugs, and having a good time with him but i said to him ""we are not going to have anything"" so i think you know what im saying""

When she said that i hanged up the call, she could only say yes or no to this answer but she got the worst example that i didnt wanted to know. After hanging up the call she said ""Please come back, you know that you are important to me, please comeback""

When she said that i said ""that i wanted some space"", because i was sad, i liked that girl a lot and did everything i could for everything to go well. But she saying that she hug this guy, that another guy, more and more.

We didnt talked today, but she saw me on school and smilled to me and said hello, but im so mixed on my emotions. I asked help to my closest friends, many said to forget her, to move on, that i was better than her. (i cant move on)

I dont know what to do on this situation. I feel lonely, I want to talk withe her but at the same time I want space because she broke my heart. 

Thanks for you guys that are reading (i know its long)."

When you feel narcissistic for wanting someone to love you.

When you have never been considered a romantic option so you stop seeing yourself as one.
When you have never held anyone’s hand.
When the closest you’ve come to cuddling someone is hugging your pillow at 3am.
When you’ve stopped craving love because you realise no one will give it to you.
When you’re so numb to loneliness and rejection that it feels like comfort.

lonely,lonely,"lonely - I'm a 22 [M], 

Honestly I sympathize with this sub a lot. When I was younger I was very lonely. Over time you learn how deal with it. I never made any friends until high school and that's only because they aproched me instead of me aproching them. I suffer from Social anxiety (self diagnosed), so it's really hard for me to aproch/talk to  people I don't really know very well. 

Over the course of the summer I realized that I was planning all of the hangouts we been doing for a long while. At the end of August I asked them to start take turns planing hangouts, so far we have had one hangout since then. Honestly even though they text alot in our discord sever everyday  I'm still lonely. 

Currently I just go from work back to home most days and I to my only In person class once a week. I do occasionally to go to the gym. Honestly that's not really fulfilling anymore. I've tryed ways to fix my situation, but none  of them seem likely to work. I understand I can just deal with being lonely, I've done it before, even then the feeling is still going to be there."

I had the sad realization that even if community was offered to me, this community I dream of so much, I don’t know if I would even be able to accept it. Or trust the people enough to let them that close to me. I would probably push them away even if I don’t want to. I don’t know why."

I was the only one putting the effort in the conversation and she was just replying, albeit with more enthusiasm than any girl had ever replied to me. Then I decided to see what'll happen if I don't text her first one day. It's been 5 days and we haven't talked since. Even a simple ""hi"" from her would've worked. But nothing.

I'm not mad at her, neither am I attached to her or anything of that sort, but I'm just sad that if I constantly don't text people first...I'll basically never talk to anyone. Mind you, she was one of the few people who didn't block me instantly after seeing a picture of me. I thought I found someone who genuinely liked me a bit for once...
Maybe I should be lowering my expectations and that I expect too much for someone who doesn't even get replies in the first place...
Maybe I should text her first again 
Maybe I'll be less lonely that way."

A clever algorithm that covers age, gender, common interests (probably the best feature), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"

lonely,Why did I let the weeks turn into years?,"Why did I let the weeks turn into years? - Staying up too late, waking up even later. I know I have shit I should be doing but I just don't care anymore. My life is going nowhere. For a few months I actually believed I could be something. I was so close to success and just like that it was gone. I should have remembered I was doing it and everything I love is something I'm not good at.

Everyone from my past is graduating college now and here I am still chasing stupid ass dreams that are getting me nowhere. 

I'm 21 and I started this when I was 19. All the pain and sleepless nights just led to more pain and sleepless nights.

Do I just keep fighting and go for a third year? Am I strong enough? The last two years were hard enough battling my depression and now I'm battling depression and loneliness. 

I didn't care about the loneliness at first. ""Oh I haven't talked to a friend in a couple months? Oh well, I'll hit them up next week to go hang out."" Then we all know how that ends. Now there's such a big gap from then and now. It's like they didn't even care I disappeared off the face of the earth. 

I just want someone who cares, nobody cares though. 

I just want to get my grandparents a house on the beach and put my bros through college or fund them in whatever they choose."
lonely,"Stuck between not talking to people or talking, and not get much in return","Stuck between not talking to people or talking, and not get much in return - I’ve stopped using most social media and have stopped reaching out to most people because I rarely receive anything back. 

I wouldn’t really care if it was just a few isolated instances but it seems to happen often, with a lot of people. Usually I will message people because I genuinely care. It happens in all different contexts (sending a bday message, checking in on someone, and just trying to make plans). The common defense I’ve heard to a lack of reply is “I’m busy” but then I never hear anything else from them or it takes a very long time to hear anything. This makes me feel indirectly lonely because this is how most people in my life, especially on social media, act. 

It got to a point where it was just draining to even try since I knew it wasn’t going to amount to much. As a result, I kinda just stopped using social media and reaching out to people. Since then, only two people have reached out (not very surprising but saddening nonetheless).

I thought this new approach would help but I still feel lonely. Living without much communication is definitely doable but it’s not very enjoyable. I really enjoy meeting new people and talking to people so it’s tough for me to be “happy” with this defense mechanism."

I evolved and became an adult, learned how to be social and still be an introvert. Overall an amazing time. 

Now I am an important part of a group. I have all my friends are living with me. They are supportive and nice and all the good things. I really really like them all. They are my family. 

But still, I am lonely as never before. Like I am sitting between all my best friends in my room and I still feel lonely. I don't know why. Everyone I love of some kind is there,  except my family, and something is missing. 

The only reasonable thing I am thinking of is the one thing I don't want it to be. My first thought was love. I mean I need someone who loves me, not as a friend even more as the person I am. 

But I don't want it to be that reason since that means that my only problem is the lack of physical touch. So ... primitive, so irrelevant compared to real problems. I f\*cking hate this feeling.

I just need to share my feelings."

Not my coworkers, my roommates, or my family. Something that made me feel so good now reminds me that no one really cares."

lonely,"Only ever had one real friend, they’re replacing me now.","Only ever had one real friend, they’re replacing me now. - The only friend I’ve ever had is an online friend who lives an ocean away from me (pathetic I know). They’ve since started talking and spending time with me less and less each day and has grown attached to someone else. They even have matching statuses on Discord about how much they love each other which just adds salt to the wound tbh.

She’s the only light I’ve ever had in my 18 years of life, someone who did so much to keep me happy and loved.
To be perfectly honest I don’t really have anything/one else that really makes me happy so her drifting away has really taken a toll on my happiness and sense of self worth. Not much else I can say other than I’m preparing to be alone for another few years until I can hopefully find someone new."

No one new to hang out with or chat with or eat with. I've talked to a few people of course and I wouldn't consider myself antisocial but some people just don't want to hold a conversation with you no matter what. I try and break free from boring conversations to not stay on the topic of school but everyone just seems to kinda run back to some general shit and boring stuff. It's so lonely and I visit my home city every weekend but even then I don't always get to meetup with my old friends. It's really really annoying because everything just got thrown at me and the weather in this city is absolutely terrible, like the entire time it's either raining or super windy. I'm considering moving schools next year because of this. I know it's really early to judge but I feel like if I go abroad to study, I'll actually have a higher chance to make friends. Everybody really just hangs in groups so I'm instantly neglected out of the bunch. Just stuff to get off my mind cos I feel like it's so unfair right now."

I'm glad I cherished those times, had some really good memories with them.

Now I'm 19 and lonely. I need a few close friends I can spend time with like I did with my cousins. I need a few close friends I can laugh with, I can watch movies with,  I can chill with, etc., but that feels difficult. I got no friends and still barely know anyone in college two years in.

Sorry guys, this is going to be a long rant but I've no other place to rant

There was a time when she was the sweetest to me and we used to talk a lot to each other about every small detail, now it feels like everything was just a illusion I created in mind. We used to talk a lot and then suddenly she stopped talking to me, she'd even leave my text on read sometimes. She texts me once in a while now just when she feels like it. She was the one who herself told me that ""I would always be there for you whenever you'd feel low or whenever you'd need someone to give you a shoulder"" and I felt like I was the luckiest person to be loved have someone like her by my side.

Now suddenly she says that ""All the love and care that you showed felt like I was just pretending in a selfish way"". Like wtf, seriously??? That's all? That's all you are saying? That's all i went through? I was always here, always here for you when you were feeling low and needed someone by your side and you are saying that i am selfish? I valued your mental health more than mine while mine was becoming much worse because of shit i face irl and the way i suffer silently without anyone knowing and you are saying that i am selfish and I was never genuine? I don't even know how did that come in her mind. I just wanted her to be happy, nothing else. Whenever she felt low then I used to call her immediately. When I got hurt in an accident 2 months ago then she didn't even care about asking how I am. Now out of blue she just invalidates the care which I gave to her?

She used me when she had no one else and was feeling low and now when she is fine then she suddenly started avoiding me. I can't even take it anymore, I guess I am not accustomed to people changing wrt me. Now I don't even kniw what to do anymore."
lonely,Life seems tasteless and isolated,"Life seems tasteless and isolated - So,  and I just realized that how isolated I have been recently, my friends (all of them) have like moved away., like they are now in different places preparing for exams or in the process of taking admission in colleges, so like there is no one to talk physically or meet them, forget physical meeting there is no one to talk to even in online. And I'm not good at making new friends online (actually not even tried it ).  So, it feels very much isolating and sad thinking of personal goals trying to do achieve something but then spiraling into nothingness and sadness. Just venting my thoughts. Writing it down really feels good."

I can relax and walk for a short time before someone is coming in my direction. I get a tight, anxious feeling for a bit. I'm uncertain where to look, and look away from the passerby. Finally they walk past and I can relax. It's the worst when it's a couple holding hands. Or when you're stuck behind a group of people.
I don't remember walking being such a stressful activity. Maybe I'm just getting old? Even on hiking trails it's the same thing. There's so many people everywhere. I just can't relax."

lonely,iEvolve - “Live Your Challenges”,"iEvolve - “Live Your Challenges” - Hey, i'm devolping a VR game and would love some feedback. 

iEvolve is a brand new VR gaming experience, focusing on solving daily life challenges and overcoming bad behaviours in modern society, schools and even in work spaces. Throughout the storyline of the game, your self designed character gets approached by various types of bad behavior. It is up to you how you will interact and deal with these given situations. But choose your actions wisely, as your character evolves based on your actions. It's a very physical game, requiring lots of arm movement to control your character, yet you will also have to think carefully before making choices.

iEvolve will contain a multiplayer feature, making it possible for you to connect with other  players, communicate and even complete daily challenges together. It is also a way for you to build relations with people from all over the world.

Our wish for iEvolve is for the players to gain knowledge on how to interact with these everyday challenges which makes it easier to interact and overcome these situations in real life."

I am not interested in being superficial buddies with anyone. I don't dislike talking to people,l though.
I heard from girls that I am sweet, amazing, cute and such but somehow I'm still alone af. I try to ignore it most if the time, push those feelings down how I always tend to. But every now and then a batch of sadness still gets through and roughs me up...

It was literally the opposite of a nightmare, there was nothing bad about it. I don't even want to remind myself of the details, it's just too painful. It feels like the legendary Reddit story where the guy had a family and everything in his dream, only to wake up and lose everything.

I want to be close to you, share our stories, trust our ambitions to each other. I want to be there for you. If you're in the Puget Sound I want to hug you and go on a hiking trip.

Do you want a best friend? A lover? A mentor? A devotee? A confidant? I'll be what you need me to be but I want camaraderie, comfort, and confidence. I want the people in my life that will ride out until then end.

My day job demands a lot of attention but after about 630pm PST I'm free.

I'm sick of the isolation and melodrama, I just want to be close to you, whoever you are. I have no trouble talking to people, I just feel that rejection anxiety very acutely, but on the internet it's easier.

I get easily bored so talk to me about the metaphysic or the emotional or anything intangiable, I'm more interested in you rather than your inventory

If no one told you today, I love you."

He was a guy I could relate to most, we used to share our feelings with each other and everything was cool. In 2020, when the school's shut down, we became much closer friends. We used to do frequent voice calls and used to play on our play stations, it was just great!

I used to consider him as my best friend, but from the start of this year, he has been acting kinda strange. He leaves me on read, we rarely chat and in general, we only talk if he needs some favours. 

I waited for a long time and we only distanced further, today I manned up and decided to ask him what was wrong. 

This is what he said:

 I want to talk and chat with you but not as much like we can be friends but not friends that talk a lot.

its just I don't want to talk to you as much

And then when I asked him if he had any reason to that he said:

 not really man, I just feel like we can't really be that close

So like this was the guy I used to consider my ""bestie"" for over a year

Just wanted to get this out of my system"

i just upgraded my favourite character in genshin impact and i felt so happy and excited. until i realized it's 3 am and i have no one to tell what i did and no one cares besides me. i open livestreams and hear people playing with their group of friends laughing and having fun and instead of watching i just become even more depressed. i can't even play my favourite games like valorant or overwatch because seeing everyone else in party together while i'm alone with no one to talk to makes me extremely depressed.."

lonely,20 Lonely Years,"20 Lonely Years - Most days I can ignore it. The gaping hole in my life. But occasionally something will remind me of just how chronically alone I am. A group of friends laughing. An empty inbox. My birthday. God birthdays make me wanna run into traffic. I'm literally the poor bastard in school whose mom throws him a party and no one shows up. Except I'm not 10 anymore. I'm 20. So I'm sure you're wondering what's wrong w/ me. Surely there must be something if I have no friends. Well up until these past couple of years my parents sheltered the fuck out of me. I hardly got out of the house and when I did I was a socially awkward freakshow. I was an outcast in every social setting.
I never had a friend group. I never had a bestie. Not even a boyfriend. 

Now that I'm older, I still just haven't been able to connect w/ anyone despite all my efforts to be more outgoing, funnier, kinder etc. The places I go (work, church etc.) It's always just formalities and small talk that lead to nowhere. It's just so hard to develop meaningful relationships with people. I want to get out more but I wouldn't even know where to start. All I want in life is to have one. JUST ONE deep connection w/ somebody. I'd probably cry if someone listened to me. Like genuinely listened and cared."

We are with eachother almost everyday and I don’t want to interact because I am so afraid. Sometimes when I do interact with them I feel like there not really listening or they don’t really care which make me feel like they don’t want to get to know me.

If you wanna vent or someone to hear you, I'm here. - When I say completely alone I mean it in the most literal way possible: no couple, no family and no friends to talk to. I only have a few acquaintances who I appreciate and nothing else apart from those superficial relationships, and I think I'm finally starting to find peace living this way.

It's hard sometimes, and it makes sense since humans are social beings after all and our brains have evolved to go against this kind of complete isolation making us feel like suffering garbage as we sink more and more in loneliness. But even though I still have some of those days from time to time, I really think I'm starting to find peace with just me.

So if you need someone who listens to you, whatever you're going through, no matter who you are, feel free to hit me up. I'd rather not to talk about myself, as you can imagine after all of the above, but I don't have any problem with listening to what you have to say. I may not be able to help with anything at all nor to take the pain away, I'm not the most conversational person out there so please don't come expecting a lively chat, but if you're not okay or feel like you don't have anyone who will listen to you, I can do that."

just pure affection. show me you care. no “buts” and no strings attached. 

i don’t know. maybe my standards are too high. maybe if i left my dorm room i wouldn’t be in this situation. 

but sometimes depression just feels right. safe. it’s like when people dye of extreme cold while climbing mount Everest. those who survive say it’s like peacefully falling asleep. except you’re dying. 

i just wanna be eased out of it. slowly, gently. make me a cup of tea. draw circles on my arm lazily until i wake. sit with me and listen to the birds chirp. don’t come at me with the aggression and the force of an alarm clock.  i’ll just keep hitting snooze and i’ll oversleep and miss the bus called life. 

anyway. thanks for reading this far if you have. feel free to message me. it would mean so much."
lonely,Feeling extremely isolated,"Feeling extremely isolated - I'm always pushed away or isolated from my friends. I'll make friends and then, a few months down the line, they grow distant from me and stop including me in conversations or events. I think it's because I'm bad at listening to people or at having things to say, but it still hurts to notice the people I care about responding to me less and less. Becoming a person who brightens other people's days is my dream, but socializing always manages to make me feel more isolated than I do when I'm completely alone.

That's all for my vent, I wish you all the best."

lonely,Just realized how alone I feel,"Just realized how alone I feel - Hi friends. 

I’ve known that I felt lonely for a while now.. but it just hit me tonight that there’s not a single person that knows the full me. 

There are plenty of people that know different parts of me. I’m a teacher, so a lot of people know the “good” side, but I’m also 26 and love to have fun, so plenty of people know the “bad” side. Most of my friends fall onto one side or the other. My family and best friend know a more neutral side (I moved across the county 2.5yrs ago). 

There is not a single person that knows the full me. Nobody who knows all of my interests, my full sense of humor, the intricacies that make people.. people. 

And it makes me really sad. 

I know I’m not alone. I’m lucky enough to say I’ve never truly been alone. But, fuck. I’m so good damn lonely."

I’m not anti social and don’t have trouble speaking but idk why I struggle with this.

lonely,Feel So Alone and Misunderstood,"Feel So Alone and Misunderstood - Honestly, I wish I had someone I could just love and hold right now.

22M, chronically lonely, depressed, and anxiety worse than I've ever felt before. If I just had someone I could just vent all of this shit - someone who understands - someone who's here in person for me, someone who accepts my deficits, and someone who I could do the same for - fuck, that'd be everything. But I'm an idealist, an introvert, and probably a weirdo who can't stop fantasizing about what is most-likely warped romantic intimacy because of how lonely he is.

At least I'm learning guitar, have gotten back to work, and have my close friends and family. It's just going through all of this anxiety sucks. Doesn't help I'm either autistic (professionally diagnosed but doubt due to reasons) or just introverted as hell. The cravings for close human connection are there, but for some reason I just feel like I'm stuck behind a thousand-foot wall that's preventing me from feeling it. I wish I could make the imaginary relationships in my head real - especially when I fantasize/visualize them before I sleep at night. That's what happens when your brain is on full-throttle non stop.

I realize these lines of thinking probably aren't that helpful, but they are the only thing that comforts me when I feel this way."

I tried to go to a favorite coffee shop today but they had closed unexpectedly. The coffee shop thing helps a LOT with my loneliness. I bring a book and people watch. Even just sitting there hearing people talk is huge.

Podcasts help a bit too. I listened to a board gaming / RPG gaming podcast and enjoyed the discussions.

But overall still feel that ""heaviness"" of the loneliness. Between covid causing a lot of places to be closed or have limited hours/seating/etc., and the gray and rainy fall weather arriving, and being off from work for a bit (had a contract job end a couple weeks ago), and living alone == lots and lots of time to think and ruminate and be by myself. Even my neighbors situation has been lonely: there's been two nearly-vacant houses surrounding mine lately.

I'm introvert and do enjoy lots of time to rest and recharge. But covid has been so many months and months of isolation, work from home, meetup groups being cancelled... bleh.

lonely,A break from R4R posts to lay out my general feeling for the night.,"A break from R4R posts to lay out my general feeling for the night. - I don't have anyone to talk to. My wife is upstairs with her boyfriend, we are open and it doesn't bother me. I have one online friend who i'm not close enough to to dump this on and no real life friends who are any closer. 

I'm lonely. My wife tries to make me feel like I matter to her but that does not solve my problem. I went with them and another couple friend to an amusement park yesterday and was a 5th wheel the whole time. I don't fit in to social situations and I am having a particularly bad day realizing that I need people in my life I can talk to and spend time with. The only one I have would be hurt to know she does not fill the void. I know I am my own problem but I do not know how to fix it or even where to go to meet new people.

I don't dare put any of this in an R4R post because showing any level of unhappiness or neediness comes across as weak and puts off anyone who might respond. I keep looking for romance or even FWB because there don't seem to be any options to find close friendships and a FWB could serve that purpose. But then I have to play the getting to know you game tip toeing around what we both want but are too afraid to ask for. I've tried being unafraid and it scared away all the potential contacts I made except those asking for pay... I promised myself I would not pay to pretend but sometimes my resolve erodes. It has been a tough week.

My natural response was to ignore him and continue shopping. So I lost all my focus on him and didn’t think anything of it until he actually approached me saying he thought my outfit was nice. So in my head I figured he was just trying to make friends and not flirt. Or maybe I’m just very bad at reading people but i really tried best to wrap up the convo because I’m very reserved and to myself but there were some parts of the convo that I liked.

lonely,Lonely &amp; Disconnected,"Lonely &amp; Disconnected - Hey I’m M(19) and feel so disconnected from the world. I was born with a rare form of deafness which has resulted in me being having severe hearing loss for most of my life. These days I don’t hear much of anything. I faintly remember the voices of some family, mostly my dad, before my hearing got extremely bad.

Anyways, I’ve always felt alone even growing up, I went to a normal school and I was the only deaf person for my whole schooling career. I had some friends in middle school and high school as I was in speech therapy, and had a few friends from that. 

Yet last year when quarantine started it was really hard for me to attend online classes as at first, as I didn’t have access to a relay, and the translator I have just didn’t work out with lag and other internet issues, so I ended up just getting all my homework sent to me and not having to attend live zoom classes.

To make a long story short, I lost my friends that I did have and now I’m into my second year at college and I’m completely alone. I go through my days hardly interacting with anyone. I have no friends, no family to talk to. No one. I go and sit in the dining hall and no one even bats an eye. I’m in massive classes with hundreds of students yet none of them seem interested in interacting with me.

I try to make friends, yet I still manage to mess something up. I try to go to groups that share similar intrests yet I’m still somewhat pushed aside as it seems like no one wants, or knows how to to interact with deaf people.

I’m not sure what the point of this post is, whether I’m trying to vent or ask for help or something else I don’t know.

I’m just lonely, and tired of sitting by myself.

Found one dude off reddit and he pushed me away so i gave him space, he stopped inviting me to play then got mad i didnt invite him. I double checked my message history and i was the one always asking. I guess since i didnt ask it made him upset and with my depression i sleep a lot so he thought i was ignoring him and threw that in my face saying i was using that as an excuse, still didnt invite me to any games or to chat, then removed me off everything.






Its kinda hard to meet new people and much harder after what that guy did, but tbh he didnt seem genuine, he said he found me off my gamerpals post but then revealed he saw my relationship post and asked about it. There were other things that i could tell he was lying about but i enjoyed his company but i guess since he was being fake it doesnt matter, he showed me what he thought i wanted to see and not who he really is. It happens, its the internet.





#back to the main topic



So, after weeks of just chilling alone i go back to them and they reveal a bunch of stuff they were unhappy about, some of it being twisted or rumours/assumptions and after what my bf told them, it was too much, they couldnt handle it. 





They slowly let me back ""in"" but its not the same and honestly never will be. They said they hate it when i read to them or talk to them about the stories i read. Not every thing i read is horror. 




So, i stopped. I stopped talking about my feelings. I stopped sharing memes (my memes are wholesome is just cute animals typically), i stopped talking about my day, and didnt ask them how they were doing as much as i used to. 





And now they get a little aggressive and passive aggressive. They ask me why the fuck arnt i talking. (And i am, we played an urf and i wasnt ""talking"" but would call out ""mia"" or say, ""do you want to swap lanes"")



Its just gaming stuff now, and they are fun to play with, but i feel like everything is empty. Things are already ruined. 




I dont know what to do. I know i gotta make more friends, but how do i balance who i am? Do i just put on a mask and just never show who i am to others? I dont even remember how i got comfortable talking to them about stuff. I guess it happened over time? Do I really have to start over again...? I tried being open with that one dude off reddit and i dont know if thats where things went wrong or what.





My bf suggested I make a youtube channel where i just talk and read to an audience. That just seems kinda lonely, i like reading aloud to share what i like with a friend. I guess sharing with a channel isn't that different but its less personal?





I guess it could be better than what im doing now, which is mostly isolating.





I like to draw too so maybe sharing those to a channel as well.




Heck, maybe even a discord for people who want to hear me read. I can even screen share and i also have audible to listen to stuff together."

I just lack identifying features that I think most people base their groups off of...  I'm not the type of person who wants to dive into trends. I don't want surface- level conversations. I don't identify heavily with what I wear, I don't spend too much time on my looks. I'm often shy, and probably a bit neurodivergent.

lonely,I think we could do it if we tried?,"I think we could do it if we tried? - Making friends nowadays isn't a crime, right? At least I like to think so. As of late, due to depression, anxiety and some other personal situations I've been struggling in being social, in general. 

I've been slowly isolating myself from people, somewhere in my late-ish teens I tried expressing these feelings through Art (I suppose you could call it that). They started as photos that I'd take and put as a profile picture (like the one in my profile right now), I also posted a few days ago all the drawings I've made depicting some of these feelings on my profile, if you're interested in knowing what I mean.

Most of the time I feel like a choker, as I've grown and learned how to (better) deal with this I've been trying not to be too hard on myself regarding my mental health state. Started an Alprazolam treatment (Xanax) with a very low dose, recommend by my psychiatrist to treat my anxiety, they also suspect that my depression, etc, could be caused by an underlying physical condition, this one being Cerebral Dysrhythmia (sounds way worse than what it is, to Sum it up, everyone's brainwaves follow a pattern, so cerebral dysrhythmia is when your brain waves lose such pattern)

I suppose I wrote all of that previous stuff so people have a rough idea of who they're going to be chatting with (if interested, ofc).

Regarding my interests, they're quite general. I've been told that I'm a very mature person for my age (19), and that I'm very smart and all of that. In my case, I believe it's true, but everyone's entitled to have a different opinion if so they decide.

I love learning how stuff works, and with stuff, I mean everything: Science (I'm a lot into physics and astrophysics, but also into medicine &amp; chemistry), Psychology (which technically isn't a science), Technology (both retro &amp; up to date tech), and some other things that interest me too, but not as much as these. I like gaming, I'm mostly a PC gamer, but for personal situations I sold my gaming rig about 2 years ago, so I've been playing on my cellphone and some lighter games on my laptop (good news tho, a decent gaming laptop is on its way!)

(Start the conversation by saying any color so I know you read everything!)

I usually like talking to people older than me, since I feel that we connect better, but everyone's fine, I don't think age is a defining factor when it comes to a person's mental maturity (except when they're very young, hormonal changes do affect maturity)

So, who am I looking for? Anyone that's interested in texting me, really. I don't have a prototype of a ""perfect person"", neither as friends or romantic interests.

If you've read all of this, I'd recommend you to check my profile too.

Thanks for taking part of your time in this post, have a good day/evening and (hopefully) a good life too."
lonely,Is loneliness inevitable?,"Is loneliness inevitable? - Think about the most wonderful plutonic friend that you have. It’s nice when you’re young to imagine having friends forever, but not everybody can text everyday always. Emergencies, death, and fatigue set in.

More years pass, and college happens. Jobs happen. Your free hours go from more than 12 hours a day down to 4-5 assuming you wash and cook for yourself.

Jobs get worse, stuff gets more difficult. Things get more congested. People get married, start families or chase passions—your free time with them cuts down to maybe an hour if that.

Then just the weekends.

But then they have to choose to be close to you.

Then…. Maybe there’s nothing left. You have to spend your time scratching and begging for scraps of time.

lonely,Life feels like a cycle,Life feels like a cycle - I know I hear all the time about how “bad times will pass”. But to me it feels like all the good moments in my life are the ones that pass. The good moments are nothing but temporary and then I’m back being upset and going through a rough time. I wish I just had someone to listen to me and to share my interests but I haven’t been lucky. It seems like I just get into relationships and get attached to them and then they leave and I’m back being alone because I can’t make friends.
lonely,Will I always be alone,Will I always be alone - Honestly it seems like no one ever wants do talk to me for more than a week. Tbh I don’t have any sort of friends as i always just end up getting ghosted
lonely,I honestly don't know how to find meaningful friendships,"I honestly don't know how to find meaningful friendships - Hey, at this point, just asking for help on how to make friends.  You probably seen me posting on here a lot as well as other reddits, and that is because I am desperate for making friends since I cut off two people who I used to talk to all the time because they were terrible people.

But now, I am in this state of loneliness.

I have been posting in Friendship reddits for several months, but honestly haven't had much success.  I do get offers all the time, but it usually ends up like this... 

* They start ghosting me
* I ghost them because its impossible to hold a conversation with them.
* They are up at completely different times, instead of the time I am up, so I get to barely talk to them if at all.
* They only talk to me to try to date me and then block me when I inevitably say no.

So honestly, I don't even know what to do.  I do have friends... just no one that is up at similar times that I am that I could bond with.  

I have trouble going to group chats, but I do much better in 1v1 conversations as I have an extremely hard time talking in groups.  

So help please? ;-;"
lonely,A Workaholics’ Lament,"A Workaholics’ Lament - I guess I didn’t think that every time someone asked me to do something when my reply was ‘I’m working’ that somehow nothing would change. Then I got a 9-5 for “a better work/life balance”. 

Now, no one asks me to do anything. 1000’s of ‘friends’ on social media doesn’t mean much when you spend your nights eating by yourself and reading articles on cryptocurrency.

lonely,loneliness visits my body once again,"loneliness visits my body once again - I understand one fundamental fact, that we as humans may view as a curse, that this universe is equal. there is equal amounts of good as there is bad.

but why is it that loneliness, which I understand as an emotion that needs to hurt, hurt so bad? I mean fucking hell if you would have told me when I was younger ""yeah when you see a couple exist or a person smile with their significant other, you're gonna wanna wish you were gone"" I'd have fucking laughed cause my god (I'm not suicidal but sometimes the only way for me to express the amount of mental strain other people's success and happiness does on me when I barely get any success and happiness, is to relate it to either suicide or going through something like spooning my eyes out)

loneliness is such fuckery"

lonely,The first time I hug a girl I will probably cry,"The first time I hug a girl I will probably cry - Infact I'm crying right now as I write this out! 

I realise how out of proportion and so how cringe this sounds to a lot of people but when you're 18, never been intimate with someone, have few friends and you're a fully blown empath who's dreamt up countless  idealistic scenarios since you understood the concept of love, life comes as a big smack in the face sometimes. 

We all need love, but I'm honestly so starved of anything close to it that once I finally do have a real attractive connection with someone my heart will literally explode. I can see it now, It will be the end of the date and just before saying goodbye we hug and I literally start sobbing as my head is over her shoulder. She'll think I'm crazy lmao and I'll just have to pour my heart out on the street there and then. What a story that'll be hey! 

It's not like I'm ugly or anything, decent looking infact, but I class myself as an INFP for personality and I have  bad social anxiety which has meant I've missed out on a lot of the important experiences teenagers have. If I'm honest its left me with a big hole that only love could fix. I'd love to know if people can relate, if not I hope its given you a bit of insight into some peoples lifes or you may have found it humorous which I completely understand lol. 

TLDR: Im an 18 year old male who is so deprived of love that I will probably cry the first time I get it. It's quite sad but it's also quite funny too!"

lonely,How do you try again when you can't anymore?,"How do you try again when you can't anymore? - In early 20s.

I was one of the only who didn't make close friends in college and still trying to find out why. 

I tried/or did therapy for around 2 years and I still don't know what I'm working on. My last therapist left me without a word. I'm getting back into it again but they can't care for me, can they?

Meals and eating enough are hard in a way I can't describe and no one seems to understand it, not even myself but it feels like I have to go back and solve that when all I could do was cope.

It just feels so unfair all the work I had to do to have a friend or a girlfriend, to be normal. All the times I went out of my comfort zone, all the activities I joined, all the things I did, it just feels unrecognized. It did make a difference, but it takes too much work; I don't know how I can live with how everyone is normal and I have to be different and fight it on my own too. Even my own family I had to make changes in which I don't contact them much for my well-being. I don't understand why I had to go through so much to be left with nothing. 

I found some new people to hang with (because I went out of my comfort zone, again) but I don't want to. I want to talk about my problems. I want to be there for them but I can't. How do you try again. People don't care about my problems, because of their own I don't need them to. But I do need to feel like I matter, somewhere. 

I feel like I need a year to grieve all that I lost and was taken from me and understand the reality of the situation.  But most importantly, how do you try again? How do you go back and fix problems you had since middle school that you didn't know should be fixed? How do you care again? How do you do it without judging yourself for not making progress? Without being afraid that if you let yourself down the hole you won't come out of it. How do you get over anger at the people who didn't understand you? At the people who assumed things you were fighting to control were things you did on purpose? How do you live feeling good when you move forward but other days paralyzed by all the feelings realizing how different I was."

lonely,It seems like I just flat-out lack some friend-making skill other people are born with,"It seems like I just flat-out lack some friend-making skill other people are born with - 23M, this is a vent post. I'm at a breaking point now, realizing that my mind literally lacks the ability to make connections in the way normal humans can. The ability for people to be funny and come up with witty stuff on the spot, just doesn't exist for me. The ability to connect with people based on common interests also is something I just completely lack. And I don't even think that my interests are all that uncommon. I watch sports (popular ones), I run and go to the gym, I pay attention to news and politics, I play guitar and I ski. But for some reason I just completely lack the ability to use my interest in these topics to actually get people to connect with me or like me, and it's been this way for years. I simply have no charisma and have a shit personality. Literally my only ""friends"" right now are girls I've hooked up with or met on dating apps. So in other words if I wasn't mildly attractive, I would literally have nothing and nobody. I have no guy friends.

The root cause of all of this might be what happened to me when I was a high school freshman. I had one really close friend at the time who transfered to another high school, and eventually we completely lost touch. As it turns out, he's gay and only really hung out with me because he liked me and now all his platonic friends are female. Anyway, in high school after he transfered out, I tried reaching out to a new friend group that I thought was cool with me but quickly enough they started pushing me out and talking shit about me to my face. From then on, I completely hated going to school and lost all confidence in myself. I quit playing sports that I'd loved for years and lost all interest in social media, further isolating myself. Later in high school I found some more casual acquaintances who I would eat lunch with and talk to in class, but we would never do anything together outside of school, and they made no effort to keep in touch with me after we graduated. College was kinda the same for me, I had acquaintances in clubs I was part of, guys I would go out for drinks with, but I had no relationship with them beyond that and club stuff.

Through all my previous lonely years, I at least thought that if I stuck with the plan, building a successful career, working on my body and overall appearance, people would naturally gravitate towards me and I'd become popular. But over the last few weeks I've come to the realization that it doesn't matter, since I still can't carry a conversation and have the personality of a dried paper bag. I don't even expect women to want to seriously date me because why the fuck would they be proud of having a bf/husband who is a loser with no guy friends? And it also sucks because there's so much stuff I want to do, so many big ski/hiking/sports trips I've always dreamed of doing, but I can't for the foreseeable future because my female ""friends"" aren't into that, I have no guy friends and I'd look like a complete loser doing them all alone. I'm just so fucking tired of being myself and not being able to connect with others in the way an average human being can. I was never diagnosed with ASD but I strongly believe that I am in fact on the spectrum. I'm just so tired man."

As soon as classes are over or I give them answers and help they vanish and I'm alone again.

What scares me most is when I still feel alone when I'm with people.  I feel like they aren't there, or maybe I'm not there.  It hurts so bad I don't know what to do.  The first relationship I had like this was with my younger sibling.  I try to help them but nothing I do can help and in fact it just seems to make it worse.  I feel so lost.

I work with psych patients, and many of them are homeless. Some know what to say just to get 3 hots and a cot, while others really have nowhere else to go. No family, no friends.

Today I was with a patient with a terminal illness who lost everything she had to pay for treatment. Never married, but has 2 adult children she hadn't spoken to in over 20 years. She is an only child and her parents were long gone. She cried openly about some of the mistakes she made with her kids and was inconsolable about her impending death. She was only in her early 50s and had a successful career, only her sickness took it all away from her. She had been in the hospital for almost a year without a single visitor. 

I can't describe how bad I felt. For her and for me. I've never had a friend in my life and I too am an only child with no family. I think about how no one would visit me if I were in the hospital and it makes me feel helpless. I've never been anyone's priority and never dated. Pretty much all of my coworkers are in a relationship/married/with kids and don't seem to be interested/don't have time for making friends. It just sucks not having anyone to rely on."

So a girl from work and I have been flirting with each other for a few months. She had honestly always been much more open about it than I was (I’m kinda shy). But a few weeks ago, she asked me for my Snapchat, so I gave it to her. An hour later, she messages me. So you know, we start chatting.

We actually started messaging each other almost constantly, from the time we woke up to bedtime (we were also talking at work when we got a chance). Snapchat even showed that we were “Best Friends” (which just means we’ve sent the most messages to each other out of both our contact lists).

So that’s how things were, up until a few days ago when she started responding back to me a little slower. I didn’t think much of it then; I mean, we all have lives outside of our phones, you know. But the next day, just mid-conversation, she stopped talking with me altogether, leaving me on delivered.

I don’t know what I could’ve said, but I don’t think I ever said anything remotely wrong or inappropriate. I just can’t help but feel like she’s lost interest in me as she’s gotten to know me better, and this feeling is eating away at me.

Work was so busy these past couple days that I didn’t even get an opportunity to talk with her face-to-face, and we aren’t scheduled to work together again until this Friday. I snapped her again a few hours ago, just saying “hey,” but that message still appears as delivered too.

Idk, guess just wondering if anybody else can relate. I’m feeling really down right now."
lonely,"Review my decision, please","Review my decision, please - I am a software engineer. My native language is Russian. 

Recently I moved to Poland to avoid the obligatory military service (which would steal 2 years of my life). Here I do not know the Polish language, so it is hard for me to meet new people.

I could try to learn the Polish language, but I decided to develop other areas of my life. I regularly: do some sport, practice meditation and learn something useful for my software engineer career. Also I have a remote job which takes 8 hours of my day.

I decided to do that, because my life dream is to relocate to Australia and get a citizenship there. So I plan to work and live for two more years in Poland and try to relocate to Australia afterwards.

I hope that in Australia it will be easier to connect with people, because I read a lot in English and I watch all the movies and tv shows exclusively in English. Also, because I would feel myself more fulfilled in Australia.

Whenever I have some free time my thoughts are free to roam around. And I definitely see benefits in living alone, since I am all free to spend time and other resources however I want."

lonely,Just tell me why,Just tell me why - I try to keep it short. I’m M(19) In my whole life i kissed like 4 or 5 different girls and it never happened more than kisses. I met them all at partys or Festivals because i literally don’t see another chance to meet girls. And everytime we changed numbers and when i wrote „hi“ the next day they instantly blocked me. Girls always complain about the same guys who do exactly that. And I only want something serious. Love and affection for eachother. But either i have such a bad luck and only get the „fuckgirls“ who do this intentionally or i do something wrong all the time and so they don’t want me anymore at some point. Anyway i heard this can happen but i have a 100% rate of getting this kind of girls. The last case happened a few days ago at a party. We cuddled and kissed and i even told her that exactly that happened already and she said this time it’s something other because she wouldn’t do something like that and really want something serious. Guess what…she did exactly the same thing like all the other girls. Blocked me after i said Hey. And I just want to know why i deserve this. Always getting played and screwed by girls while everything i want is love and affection.
lonely,Idk what I want to do anymore.,"Idk what I want to do anymore. - **TW: suicide and school shooting**
Ever since I found out that depression and social anxiety has ran through my family, my life has been only going down hill, I’ve never had any real dating experience, barely anyone really cares about me in any kind of meaningful relationships.

My parents didn’t even care about my problems at school, I can be on the front end of insults of flat out bullying and they won’t even talk to me about school unless if I had an assignment that I needed to go over with a teacher or needed to send to them. They keep telling me on how I should get a job yet when I do and try to make any sort of effort to work and get money I get yelled at how I should be working at their family business, yet when I help it takes a year or so before I get paid anything for the 11 + hours I work on the weekends cause I’m only a high school student,  yet I only get a weeks worth of work paycheck, at least at places I want to work at I don’t  mind having to work night shifts and I get paid every other week for the amount of work I do before payday.

I can barely have friendships at school with how much bullying that happens to me, I always just keep to myself and I get bullied about how I look like the quiet kid ready to shoot up the school, when it’s not that it’s about how I don’t have a lot of friends and how I’m a lonely piece of shit, my friends wonder why they still keep doing it no matter how many times I have told multiple guidance and other school staff members about my situation, it’s been like this ever since I was a kid going to school for the first time ever,it doesn’t help that they learned about how my father had gotten cancer again recently. I can’t even stand up for myself because if I fight back in anyway I just get in huge and unnecessary trouble, I’m just forced to sit there as the teachers don’t care and won’t do anything about it.

 I've always been completely lonely. That changed when i met this girl and she became my friend. We passed some great times together (and i even developed some feelings for her ngl). This changed recently...  It has been quite some time that she started to treat me real badly, i don't even know why. Today we got into a big fight and now she doesn't even talk to me anymore. I'm back to square one, i guess? I'm so scared... i don't want to be alone anymore...."

hoping that one day someone will save me, as much as it hurts to say—I can’t save myself."

Anyways, I was out practicing driving with my dad as my driving test is coming up and as I was driving in my little town…. I drove by my ex boyfriend and I’m pretty sure he had another girl in his car. Which is fine, we have been broken up for a year and a few months… it doesn’t matter. However of course I still have my own feelings and it hurts seeing him with someone else… when I’m here completely alone struggling to get him out of my head. This situation just made me realize how truly lonely I am… I didn’t even have anyone to talk to about this situation that brought up a lot of emotions… I had to post it online:( I wish I had someone. My best friend has a serious boyfriend so i have been kinda tossed aside. Man it’s just hard wanting to express to someone how upset you are and you have no one… and then on top of it thinking about my ex who I miss with another girl just makes me feel even more sick.

My long distance boyfriend also moved in with me recently and he’s been absolutely incredible. I love my job, love my boyfriend and I have been pretty happy. I’m proud of myself but I feel so isolated from everyone. It’s just me and my boyfriend all of the time. I haven’t made any new friends and I basically go to work and come home. I miss my family and friends and I feel like everyone hates me, is mad at me, is having fun without me, etc. I text my friends pretty often and I try to keep up with them but I’m always working and so are they. This is my first time moving out of my parents house. Is this a normal feeling? I didn’t have the typical “go off to college” experience so now I’m 25 and I’m really struggling with feeling homesick and isolated. I’m really just looking for words of encouragement. I’m worried that I’ll feel like this forever. Or that because I feel like this, I’ve made a bad decision? I don’t know what to think anymore. I just feel lost"

My inboxes are empty, and my notifs too. Whenever I tried to interact with them, I didnt receive the same energy, which makes me feel Ive wasted my energy because interacting could really drain me.

On the plus side we are still best friends and even continue to live together to raise our 3 kids. We are a good team. We just aren’t in love anymore. Plus her fiancé is kinda awesome. 

But there are times late at night when everyone is asleep in there rooms. That I get so lonely I miss being wanted, the feeling you get from being part of a whole. Heck, I miss being held and holding someone. Each of us knowing no matter what happens as long we have each other there nothing we can’t over come. 

And I worry, that I will never know that completeness again. I fear that if someone does come along that likes me I won’t notice. Because I am captain oblivious when I comes to people flirting with me. I just wish people would say what they mean."
lonely,19M and this loneliness has already caught up to me.,"19M and this loneliness has already caught up to me. - Before college began, I'm not sure if I was ever ""lonely"". Sure, I only had one friend in high school, but I had plenty of acquaintances I talked to in school or occasionally on social media. Even when this was happening less and less as high school went on, I still felt comfortable in school knowing most people. I also had my cousins who were willing to hangout with me often during the summer and always would let me stay over at their place in the summer if they were allowed to (it was like a 10 minute walk). I definitely was happier then, that's for sure.

Now I'm a college sophomore and I most definitely am lonely. When high school was finished, I was told that it would be easy to make friends in college, but that couldn't have been any farther from the truth. Two years in and I have no friends, barely know anyone, and my only interactions come from professors. Last year, during my freshman year, I actually opted to take one in-person class and four online classes and I surprisingly loved it. Too bad I couldn't do that this semester.

Anyways, like I said, since everything I thought would happen clearly hasn't (and likely never will) happened, my loneliness has began to take a toll on me. I've felt bored with almost everything I do except for playing or practicing at the basketball courts at my park and at college. I've felt a disconnect between me and nearly everyone else except family. This disconnect has gotten so bad that I've quit almost every social media. I only got this Reddit account a very small Instagram account after removing plenty of followers over the year. At least once everyday, I feel this emptiness that can only rid itself naturally. It doesn't matter where or when it happens: at home, at college, on the city bus, during the day, or during the night. I just feel like I only got myself and my family. I've also began to lose motivation for college at times since I can't rid this feeling of loneliness, but I'm still passing and I plan to graduate in a few years. 

Loneliness hurts a lot when being single too. I'm only 19, but I don't want to be single anymore. That may not have been the case if I made a move on someone who may have wanted me, but that was two years. I still run into them too so that hurts even more, especially when I still don't know anyone at college and can't simply find an interest in anyone there. I could hit them up now, but considering we never really talked and all I got was hints two years ago, I think that'd be awkward. I was thinking about using a dating app, but I'd rather not.

I know things will get better eventually. I already got something to look forward to soon. I just hate this feeling of loneliness and the negativity which thrives off of it. I feel like I need more than just basketball to distract myself off of the loneliness, but I don't know what I can do. I don't got any money and live with family, so it's not like I can do anything interesting or fun at the moment either. Patience is key as well, because who knows what opportunity may arise to break this loneliness off?"

I have major depression issues I'll spare you the details on, and I'm a recovering alcoholic currently relapsing because I don't know why I bother. My ex wife always used to say if we ever split up nobody would want me, and it seems she was right. I've asked people for advice, looked up ways to improve. I feel like any chance I had of being even temporarily happy is long gone. If I could I'd just start wandering again, but those days are over. I can't get out of this feeling that I'm an ugly, messed up, unwanted and unloved pain that everyone just kinda deals with. I'm in a really dark place and I'm trying to change it up, but what's the point? So since I don't have anymore ideas, here I am."

But I feel like that way never happen for me and I'll have to accept it, sooner or later. Perhaps my perception of love is unrealistic. That's how people make it seem anyway. I'm told to just enjoy life, as if my feelings and emotions don't count. They think it stems from the emptiness within me. I guess it kinda does. Like even when I'm in a room full of people I still feel really lonely because I don't have that deep, emotional sort of connection with anyone. 

I just hope i become desensitised to all these emotions. I don't wanna feel anymore.

Everyone who sees me automatically judges me as ”weird, nerdy, etc.” so yeah, pretty hard to hit it off with somebody when they already don’t really want to be friends. And then there’s this one person who used to be my bestie from second to fifth grade and started acting creepy at the start of fifth grade, when she found out I became Head Girl (basically Class President for the whole school, or in my case, all of Primary). After that, I tried to level it down to “just friends”, but she’s seriously emotional and very attached to me, so that made it hard. And she won’t get the hints I give. She’s now toxically obsessed with me. Layer some sexual and emotional abuse on from my nanny, and that’s how my life is going. Hooray."

And how do you get over such a person? - I'm sorry if this is the wrong place. I really don't know how or what to do. My girlfriend blocked me over 2 years ago, right after I recovered and returned from the hospital due to an illness. Call me mad, but I was head over heels for her. I'd try to help and support her in every possible way I could and she would do the same. We did have fights occasionally, but we would sort them out all the time. She was my carbon copy in every way, which was why I was so mad about her.

But her sudden ghosting left me devastated. Eventually, depression set in, and then one fine night, I took some extreme steps, which left me hospitalised for another 2 months. But despite all of that, I didn't get over her. I have few to no friends as it is, which I know is cuz of my emotional nature, and I'm trying my very best to outgrow them through therapies, but her loss left me stumped completely.

 It's been two years, and she still is mad at me. For what reason? I cannot comprehend for the life of me. I'm trying my very very very best to move on. But I keep getting triggered and start harming myself. Why in the world is she angry with me even after 2 years? Is it possible, I, being a guy, missed something which I should've fixed earlier? How do I get over her? I just am unable to for lord's sake, and it is driving me crazy. ANY help is most appreciated."

#1 - I can move out and find a place with random roommates that’s closer to my job in the city. Right now, my commute is almost an hour and the areas I’m looking at would lower it to about 20-30mins. 

#2 - Continue to live at home to save money that would be going to rent and get a dog, which would be my main responsibility.

Some points:
- I can afford a room for $1k, but I definitely would have to budget myself and won’t have as much freedom with my purchases like I do now

- Owning a dog has been a dream of mine and I know I would be responsible in terms of caring for it, but i don’t know where I’ll be exactly in the future 5-10 years from now

- I feel like I need more excitement and independence in my life. Living at home makes it hard to see my friends that are in the city"

lonely,"Life is not a journey anymore, it's just a vicious and never ending cycle..","Life is not a journey anymore, it's just a vicious and never ending cycle.. - Hello fellow lonely people! For this venting session I would like you to know that  i'm secretly a loser who pretends that she has everything under control and constantly fakes being  happy and not having any mental health problems, just because it makes me sick to my stomach when i think about being vulnerable and admitting that i'm simply lost, and truly miserable and the worst part is that i think i deserve it. It's my second year in law school. I pun on a fancy blazer every morning, put some color on my cheecks,  and on my lips, concealer under the heavy eyebags to cover up that fact that i've cried myself to sleep last night and that i haven't slept in days and i either binge eat or starve myself till i feel like colapsing. But it's fine, at least i look presentable for the teachers and for my colleagues, right? I study all this awful subject till i'm exhausted, i joined a stupid law students association just to get to know more people hoping to feel the void. (spoiler: it didn't help). Many think that i'm smart and capable, but i'm pretty much a fraud. I simply cram my twisted brain with all this information just so the other respect me. I smile all the time to the point where my cheeks hurt, i don't want to let them see, i truly don't want to let them see the cracks. I pushed so many people i loved away from me. I feel like i'm ruining everything. Why do i find it so hard for me to show myself some basic human decency? Where does all this self hate and lack of kindness come from? When did I stopped enjoying the sunrise and the sunset? When did I start caring more about appereances and little white lies? When did I lost my sparkle? This is not a journey anymore, it has simply become a vicious and never ending cycle of: no worries, i will manage! no worries, things will get better! no worries, i got all the time in the world! No worries... the fake positivity won't get you far either. :)"
lonely,It is difficult to understand people,"It is difficult to understand people - Tl:dr - I need friends and advice on breaking up ties

I've been contemplating posting on this sub for a while and today presented an opportunity to do so. I turned 21 last week it was a very off-putting birthday celebration. I first went out to the movies in the morning with a couple of friends. They didn't remember my birthday but I didn't care because I like spending time with them and we forget birthdays all the time. Fast forward a few hours and another group of friends literally coerced me into meeting them at the same time that I promised to get dinner with my family. I explicitly told them that I already had plans but they somehow convinced themselves that it is okay to wait outside the restaurant I was having my meal at, instead of probably going out another day. Dinner inevitably became late and it began raining, so we drove to one of the friends's house where they had a 'suprise' waiting for me. The surprise was bottles of alcohol. I've told them time and time again that I do not like drinking but it clearly didn't get through. They purchased so much alcohol and I had a dreaded feeling that they did so at my expense and will expect money back. It didn't take long, 15 hours to be precise, until I got a message asking me to foot the entire alcohol bill. I'd been expecting it so it wasn't a shocker but it still hurt. 
Today happens to be the birthday of one of the friends from the group. I wished him in the morning and he mentioned that he'd let me know if there is anything planned for later in the day. This friend in particular is rather close to me and when we spoke later in the evening, he made sure to remind me about paying for the alcohol and also didn't invite me to the party he was having at that very moment. 
I feel disgusted with myself more than anything at this point and have serious questions about my relationships. This post is not about birthdays but I didn't expect to be treated like absolute shite, given that my previous birthdays were rather positive. It feels like this treatment was long due and I could have avoided this by simply being straight with them.
There's also a backstory to this but that's a little too long. I will mention that I do not enjoy the company of these friends anymore and I'm somehow stuck with them because they're the only group I know in college. It's an excuse I've been telling myself for months now and I sometimes get nervous when I think  of the lack of friends whose company I enjoy. 

I have two rhetorical questions that I really need help with:

1) How do I make friends again?
2) What advice do you have for lonely people that have very few friends, whose absence would make everyday life extremely difficult?"

lonely,Emptiness,Emptiness - Yo. This is my first post here on reddit although i've been here for a year now just reading stuff and what's going on through peoples lives. I always compare it to my life like if someones life was worst than man i feel okay because i am lucky that i am not in the same situation of that someone. But then again i always have these days where I feel appreciated yet i am really empty inside. Its like everything thats positive only meant words for me. Sure i got a lot of friends but theres really no one looking out for me. I am okay just being by myself but it hurts being empty and not knowing what to feel whether i should be happy or sad its just always a plain expression or feelings in me. What i am hoping right now is something genuine but i cant see the day when will that happen.
lonely,"??: Reconnect with old contacts, Go out and socialize more","??: Reconnect with old contacts, Go out and socialize more - Whenever I type up ""what to do when lonely"" on google looking for some advices to escape or somehow alleviate my loneliness, they always give me stuff like ""reconnect with old relationships"", ""make new friends"", or ""join a group"". 

These are quite useless advices, I have to say. A person is lonely precisely because one is not able (or is finding it difficult) to do those abovementioned actions.

Yes, I am fully aware that if I am not the one who is taking actions and making changes for myself, nothing is ever going to change. I know that. However, just telling a lonely person to go out and be with other people simply does not help, and it's not like I haven't tried it before. I have been out there before, and was involved in groups before, and tried contacting old friends. It's just that I didn't find those relationships interesting or particularly fun. Those were for the most part, draining and time consuming, and in the end I am plunged back into emptiness. There was no fulfillment and enrichment. After all that hassle, everything was for naught.

So in the end, I found out being on my own is more cost efficient. Back to loneliness it was. It's everywhere and I just can't seem to shake it off."

lonely,Insomnia keeping me up at night makes the loneliness harder,"Insomnia keeping me up at night makes the loneliness harder - I was diagnosed with insomnia a few years back when I was 19 and lately I'm finding that with my loneliness it's a super bad mix. It keeps me up every night and sometimes I can't even sleep for days. My sleep schedule is all over the place so I'm stuck trying to balance it and school. However lately I'm finding that being unable to sleep every night, when it's quiet and all I can hear is my own thoughts and cars passing by on the highway is not making things any easier on me. Every night I can't help but wish I had someone to make these Insomnia filled quiet nights easier and more relaxing instead of being afraid of being alone. I'm not really the best conversationalist either so when I do get even the smallest chance I typically blow it cause I'm awkward, don't know what to say, and eventually don't say anything at all. All I can do now is play something to numb the nights which is typically ffxiv lately. Maybe she's out there, id like to think she is, but that's probably just hopeless thinking. All this time alone at night just makes it really hard to not think of scenarios that won't ever happen and only makes the loneliness more and more crushing."

It's obviously hard to have nobody to talk to and being the lonely kid in class. But sometimes all I fucking feel is like having someone talk to, give me a hug, talk to me. Had a lot of friends back in the time before this pandemic thing, but isolation made me realise that friendship like that really had no meaning, just stayed with them, everybody had their own friends and I was the only one left. I thought I had many friends but turned out they were all acquaintance. Had 2 friends recently, but now with time, I am the one left out, they stay with themselves, and they try to seclude me from their conversation, and like before I can't really can't go upto people forcing them to talk to me. Liked this girl a lot, first time actually liked a girl and wanted to have some realtionship, but couldn't even talk to her and well now she has moved into a town, so can't even do anything now.

I feel fucking miserable upon myself, not doing anything's, having thousand of things in my mind, listening to music all day, and sleep being my best friend.  It's easy to tell for others to go out and talk but it's not. What I have understood is? We all are lonely deep inside but most won't express it to others and stay with themselves acting all strong, only if we lonely people could help each other out but no we all are busy and won't move out of our circle, only of some of us actually want to talk and be with others except knowing most of us are lonely.

I just want someone to talk to and take care of me, I can live alone and that's 100%age true, but I don't enjoy it. This thing has been moving into me since a year, should have done something back then, but all I feel like is a void inside. I understand people have trauma inside, and feel that sometime. But nothing remarkable has happened to me, that makes me sad and lonely, but still I am fighting the demons in my head."

I feel sorry for myself. I know a few years ago I would have never let this happen to me. I always had a plan I always had a dream. But now everything feels so stagnant and I feel so lost. 

Sometimes I just want to go home but I don’t know where home is."

I literally don’t go clubbing or to party’s or anything, lately I’ve been thinking how different could my life be if I did would I still enjoy the hobbies I do now or would I be a different person. 

at the same time there are perks to the life I’m living because I don’t go out or anything I don’t really have any friendship dramas and my life so that makes it pretty peaceful but it feels like my life’s on repeat I do the same things everyday. 

If you are someone that went wild in your teens or 20s please let me know if you regret or wish you continued living that lifestyle would love to know how much I’m possibly missing out on."
lonely,I think all I needed was a community.,"I think all I needed was a community. - I don't exactly remember the accurate date, but on August 29th I was at my new lowest point. And it was also the day I decided to embrace the hell I was in and transform from it all. 

My group of friends were dead quiet, my family actually started to ask for help to release my mom from purgatory, I still get depressed at night because there's no one to talk to. 

So I joined a community. I joined a discord group and recently I've been in another one. However more relationships that were once personal now crumbled to the ground. In the end, the community of people became my friend instead of one on one. 

I have to remember the incident to not fall back. But it made me hateful towards men as well. Especially when something similar happened again but they got so scared they deleted their discord account and blocked me on reddit. 

I haven't been on reddit in a month, and honestly, it makes me feel so depressed with inceltear and reading depressing amberlynn theories or the occasional posts of people asking if their trauma is what happened. 

I remember when the last time I came on here, I basically was a lonely girl looking for a fuck/love buddy I can go to. 

I don't need that anymore. This drug for romantic attention destroyed me like how any other drug would destroy a person. Never again. It took me quite a bit to find myself again. I don't want to become lost and lustful."

lonely,Longing for someone who doesn’t exist; fell in love with a person who only existed within a dream.,"Longing for someone who doesn’t exist; fell in love with a person who only existed within a dream. - I’ve always been lonely, and I’ve always wanted someone I can truly talk to. So many people don’t get it, or have fundamentally different views than me. I’ve longed for a connection to someone where we innately understand each other; where we provide full attention and compassion towards one another without hesitation. Is it an unrealistic romanticization of love? Absolutely. Does it change the fact that I think about it all the time? No. 

About two years ago I had this dream. I was lost in an urban hellscape - no knowledge of how I got there or how to get home. I walked through the metropolitan nightmare, passing through corner liquor stores and empty stretches of road. Every direction was filled with concrete. Even looking up meant following monolithic urbanization until my eyes finally reached the clouds. 

I wandered for so long. Nobody wanted to help me. It didn’t matter how kindly I asked. It didn’t matter what I asked. They always refused. Until a woman approached me. She offered me a ride back to my home; despite it apparently being days away.

At first, she seemed to genuinely dislike me. It seemed she offered me a ride out of abject pity. Nothing more, nothing less. She had this rusted green truck. The type that creaks when you turn the wheel the slightest amount. It didn’t matter to me. She was the only human capable of helping a lost soul. 

We drove for so long. She started warming up to me - started actually talking about everything and nothing. Throughout that ride I learned an incredible amount about her life; though I’ve unfortunately forgotten most of it. After some time, we fell in love. 

I can’t remember most of the dream. I know what she looks like, what she acted like. I know she isn’t real and never will be. I know I can’t hold onto this dream characterization of a woman, but it hurts. It hurts to be in reality and know most people don’t give a fuck. Most just want to use you, or they realize you’re a fucking weirdo and leave you alone. 

I would give anything to have someone to talk to like I talked to this dream manifestation. But, I guess that’s not how the world works."

I have a good job, I go to the gym every other day, I have hobbies, I'm kind, and sociable. 

I just asked out of my friends of 2-3 months today and she wasn't into me. I've gone on every dating app and get no matches. I try so hard to make a good profile but the conversations never go anywhere. 

All my friends moved out of town and I'm only friends with 3-4 people that I see only a bi-weekly basis. My work is completely remote and every one is older than me. I've tried going to bars alone before but it sucks. My county still has the mask mandate in place so that has made it harder to meet people

I'm so alone with my thoughts that it's low-key driving me insane. Like I can go hiking by myself and think about the same things over and over again. 

I'm trying really hard to be content by myself, but I've been alone for so long that it's starting to get to me. 

Does anybody else feel this way?"

Numb to the touch I am now cold, but still when the message bubble pops up within my phone my cheeks grow warm. My heart palpitates with feeling. ""Don't get attached"". The voice in my head warns. But still I can't help but feel everything, in want of company. No matter how hard I try to deny or hide it. Its only human want to be in company with someone, or a select few."
lonely,I miss my mom,"I miss my mom - Recently I lost my mom to cancer. 
She was everything to me. 
I have this huge hole in my heart, and have never felt so lost in life. 
I was her primary caretaker through most of the process. It is really hard to see someone be gone before they are really gone. I tried to reach out to people just to have a distraction. Lots of people I considered my friend really let me down. Ignored me and treated me quite badly to be honest. I moved past it for the most part because my mom was my top priority. Now that she has passed. I feel more alone than ever, I am an only child, I am 22. I just want my mom back."

I have been using dating apps and going on many first dates (never a second one) and found a girl to hook up with but she thinks we're in a serious relationship. I don't have any feelings for her and I'm only playing along because I can't imagine living any more years completely alone. Every time I see her I close my eyes and think of the girl I love but I know it will never happen. No sane woman would willingly choose me, and I know if by some miracle that girl entered a relationship with me she wouldn't be happy."

For some reason I feel like I’m the only person going through this because it seems like from social media everyone seems to be making friends/having fun but me.

I can’t seem to find anyone to talk to since I started college. I’m 4 hours away from home, i have a decent friends group but everything is always so surface and I miss having a meaningful connection with someone that is there for me and I am for them. It takes over my days and leads me to attached to any guy that gives me the slightest attention. I can’t seem to control it no matter how many activities I sign up for or how distracted I try to be. At the end of the day I’m all alone with no one that loves me, will cuddle me, and give me the support I used to have.

I called her when it was time to get on and she told me to give her a sec. I decided to wait and I assumed she would hit me up and let me know when she was ready. Hours go by and nothing. I then check out a discord server that we’re both in and she’s on with them. Crazy thing is that I asked her what happened like a day later and she said she was “too tired and busy all weekend”.

lonely,Is it easier to make friends in college than in high school?,"Is it easier to make friends in college than in high school? - I can’t make any friends in any of my classes. Everyone just sticks with the people they already know. No one really wants to make new friends or talk to others. Is it also like this in college or do people find new people and become friends with them?

——————————————————

I’m a junior in high school and I don’t have any friends. I used to talk to my only “friends” in freshman and sophomore year. I rarely talk to them anymore. We kind of drifted apart. 

I did make a friend during freshman year, but we only talk to each other during class or in school when we see each other. We don’t talk much over text but if we do the convos are short.

I also have this “friend” who I’ve known since elementary school but we don’t talk much. Same situation as above, we don’t talk over text and only talk to each other in school. I’m not sure if she even considers me as a friend though.

——————————————————

I want to be able to make at least one friend. A friend who I can talk to anything about. But it’s hard because I’m an introvert and it’s even harder when no one seems to want any new friends."

lonely,20M Alone and broken,"20M Alone and broken - This is my first time posting here, and it just feels weird ig. For most of my high school life, I had a lot of 'friends'. I never felt alone. But, slowly, but surely, I started to realize that they were just there cause I could help them in some way or other. Mostly with academics, since I used to be pretty smart. Sure enough, once i got out of school, they all left. I tried staying in touch, but there was no point. They weren't interested and that was pretty clear to me. Never experienced love neither.

Then, I found the one person who I felt was it. I felt she actually cared about me, and I became so close to her. I used to talk to her everyday. We used to play games together, watch movies, sent each other meme, shared our joys and pains with each other everyday. It just made life all that easier to hold on to. I was suffering a lot on other aspects at the time, but I never felt overwhelmed, cause I knew at the end of the day I could talk to her and forget about everything that happened. I only had one fear, and that was she would leave someday. 

And that happened many months ago. It was partly my fault, and partly situational. A misunderstanding that ruined everything. It was a pain I cannot express. I tried messaging her yesterday to see if we could make things slightly better, but she just blocked me. It hurt me..so much. But I still wont blame her. She was an awesome person and I wish the very best to her in life.

But, now, once again, I feel so alone. I have no one to talk to. No one to share my thoughts with. No one to talk to everyday. I wish I could relive that. I wish I could have someone like that again."

lonely,vent,"vent - I’m here falling behind in everything I’ve wanted to do or have done in the last 5-6 years because I’ve never vented or decided to open up to anyone. Once tried talking to someone and they kind of shrugged it off thinking it was a one day thing or something and since then haven’t talked about how I’m feeling.

I’ve distanced myself from anyone I’ve grown up with or had talked to just because I felt myself changing and never wanted to talk to anyone about it. I do what I have to do at the best of my ability then just do nothing for the rest of the day. Anytime I learn something or something that excites me, no one cares. Just learned to keep everything to myself and just fake it everyday. Always have been social, played football for my whole life and then that just stopped. Always used to go out that just suddenly still stopped. It is my fault though. I isolated myself from anyone that I talked to because the problems I have had internally. Never vented or talked to anyone about it. Feels good to just spam this shitty iPhone keyboard. Maybe I just spent too much time on social media or hated school so much that it’s had a spiralling affect. No clue, all I know is I am lonely and sad and don’t think that’ll change for a while. No motivation for anything."

But almost constantly, whether I am around my friends or not I feel a sense of loneliness. What I've decided it is, is that I want to have a relationship with a girl. Because I really like the idea of being able to snuggle up under a blanket with a girl and cuddle while we watch a movie or talk about our lives. But I don't really have any traits that would be interesting to a girl, and also I go to an all boys private school which makes it kind of hard to meet girls. But I feel like I wouldn't have such a strong sense of loneliness if all that I feel I am ""missing"" is a relationship with a girl. So I've been really struggling on trying to figure out what exactly is making me feel so lonely."

I was the one who decided to cut every contact in hopes that it will be a final push for them to help themselves after they’ve become lost, I tried everything I can to help but they didn’t want to help themself, I thought that losing me would turn the metaphorical loss to a physical one and they can finally wake up and find themself. I was either wrong or they’ve decided to give up on themself and just go with the toxic river flow.

The really bad thing is... I really need them. I can’t see myself with anyone else not even in my imagination, they were the only real feelings I’ve ever felt, and I’m afraid I’ll never feel again."

She was my only actual friend, and ever since I just feel so alone, I don’t have anyone to rely on, to vent to, to just vibe with yk. 

It’s just so so so lonely, to know that there’s literally no one you can go to if you feel low, someone to always have your back, no matter what. To have a rock, your rock.

lonely,How I'm feeling right now,"How I'm feeling right now - I'm lonely. I really want to feel a connection with other people but I don't know how. I think it's probably because I have a hard time opening up to people, so how am I ever supposed to connect with someone if I can't be vulnerable with someone? 

But I have a hard time opening up to people because the few times that I've opened up to people before it hasn't gone very well. Sometimes when I tell people about my true feelings, like my loneliness or how a lot of the time I feel sadness in regards to my life and the world around me they don't seem to know how to respond. Maybe they think it's a strange way to view the world or maybe they just don't wanna hang out with someone who feels like that because they think it might rub off on them. I don't really know to be honest because they don't usually tell me, they just quietly distance themselves and stop talking to me as much.

I am a very loving person and it hurts me to not have someone to give my love to and have them return the feeling. I just wish I was as important in people's lives as they are in mine.

Anyway, I don't really know why I wrote this. I guess to let anyone who feels the same know that they're not alone. Hopefully we'll get through this xox"

lonely,i cant tell if i actually enjoy being alone or if its an excuse to make myself feel better,"i cant tell if i actually enjoy being alone or if its an excuse to make myself feel better - Everytime I see people from my school post on their insta about the events that they're all going to, I can't help but feel a bit jealous. They're out having fun, enjoying the high school experience while I'm at home. I've never been invited to a party or anything like that unless it was the party of one of my family member's friends and they had to invite me to be polite. So I feel jealous that I've never been able to go to something fun like that or been cared about enough by someone to be invited somewhere.

They're out having fun, enjoying the high school experience while I'm at home. I've never been invited to a party or anything like that unless it was the party of one of my family member's friends and they had to invite me to be polite. So I feel jealous that I've never been able to go to something fun like that.

lonely,Spending birthday alone,"Spending birthday alone - I won’t make this too long, I just wanted to rant about how my life is super pathetic and that I don’t know if I can’t keep going on like this. So I’m a college studying, majoring in health sciences, work at home, etc. I don’t have any friends, not in my state at least. I have about 2 friends and they’re in a different state. I legit have no one. During the pandemic, I fell out of touch with those I called friend, and then it just became me. I work during the day, go to the gym at night, eat, sleep and repeat and it’s honestly very depressing.

I went out to eat earlier today and was by myself. I sat at the bar of the restaurant and watched everyone else in big groups enjoy themselves and laugh. And even if I was alone, I wanted to be in company. Even if THEY felt alone, at least they were in the company of others. I just want it to end, I want it all to end. My life recently has just been this one big ball of loneliness and I just can’t. 

I don’t know how people manage to make friends with others. I haven’t tried going to club meetings and other things, because they’re at the time of when I work. Does anyone have any advice? Anything?"

That’s where I’m at. Im in my late 30s and in a stable career. I’m also in a longterm relationship, but I feel like I’m never able to be myself because my gf doesn’t have a lot of the same interests I do. My friends are focused on their children and lives and I feel like we’re all becoming different people.

I thought I was over this, but at night, some disturbing facts keeps me awake. 

How do you cope with people ignoring you and not taking you seriously? Do you ignore them back if they ever get back to you? Or do you pretend they didn't disrespect you by ignoring your calls, invites and texts?"

I’m ugly, stupid, worthless, lazy and unloveable. I think I’m autistic, since I can’t make any friends. Everyone gets sick of me.

lonely,Being Lonely,"Being Lonely - I, (M20), am in the Air Force. I just moved to a new base in California, and I haven't made any friends. When I'm not at work, I just sit in my dorm and watch movies or browse on my phone. Yes, I have a good amount of friends back home and they love and support me, but I'm not gonna see them for a long time. I made a couple friends at work, but we're not close enough to hang out outside of work. I'm tired of just sitting in my room being bored. And it's nearly impossible to be friends with people here outside of your job. On weekends, I only leave my room to get food. And I don't even look forward to that. I stay up late on weekends and wake up late. I am a pretty good looking person, but I haven't met any girls here. Having someone to hang out with would be great, but it hasn't happened. Any advice?"
lonely,I'm a lost cause,"I'm a lost cause - I can't socialise. I can't make conversations with people I meet. I just don't have anything to talk about . Nothing pops into my mind.

And since I lost every friend and everyone I at least considered as a friend, I'm left all alone. 

You would think, after a decade of being lonely for most of the part, one would get used to the feeling. But I just don't. I still long for human connection.

You know, people keep telling me that I will meet someone eventually but I'm still waiting. And the longer I waited, the harder it got to talk to people.

I am now at a point where I don't see it ever getting better. I mean how could it when I'm unable to keep the conversation going for longer than maybe 5 minutes. 

I'm gonna die alone. And it doesn't matter if it's tomorrow or in 60 years. What's the point of it all?"

It seems that besides my parents no one really cares about me, I have been going through a tough time mentally and I have no friends to talk to about it.

Recently, I was really looking forward to a short trip with a couple of my what I thought were close friends. Now one of them has canceled and is practically ghosting me over flimsy reasons. I am scheduled to travel in a couple of and am really dreading the experience.

What does one have to do for things to just be normal? I see so many of my college batchmates going on trips, getting into relationships, hanging out with their friends and doing things which people in their 20s usually do.

I work a decently paying job, have a good sense of humor, am not the worst looking person, still nothing seems to go right in my social life.

I don't post too often, but I need to let some things out. 

Sometimes I feel so lonely and unhappy, eventhough I don't have problems with my family or friends. I actually have a lot of good friends. However I still feel so depressed. I don't feel like this all the time, and I try to suppress these feelings as much as I can, but sometimes it is too much and I start crying. I feel like an asshole because a lot of people have it way harder, that I shouldn't be overdramatic. 

I don't even know what im typing right now. Just what comes to mind, hope you guys don't mind. But I just can't stop feeling so lonely and depressed. I usually try to ignore these feelings, but ever since I started a new education  I am only getting more stressed about my future and what i want to do in life, about how friends think of me, and it makes me so frustrated.

I also get pretty jealous when I see couples, especially when they are close friends. It feels like everybody around me is so wanted and I'm just not good enough. But than again I feel like im just being overdramatic, and that I shouln't complain because others have it more difficult.

I don't know if i'm actually depressed, or if I'm being overdramatic, or maybe just having 2 bad years in a row. 

to the people who read this, thankyou for listening, and I'm sorry it is a bit of a incoherent mess, just needed to let these things out."

The only time I dont is when I am around family.  Sadly I moved away from them for work a few years ago.  Since my girlfriend and I broke up a while back I have felt even more a lone because I dont really have friends where I live and I just dont jive with people here.  I have decided that it be best to move back even though itll make my commute to work longer but it wont be to bad...about a 45 minute drive one way.  I am hoping that it will solve my mental health issues I am suffering from right now.  After the housing market stabalizes then get a house around there.  Anyhow I just felt like venting in here about that on a whim.

I'm getting worse and don't have enough courage to tell it to someone like friends or parents. just for context: I'v been an hikikomori since the beginning of middle school, i isoleted myself from the others for a looooong time, i try to be the most kind with everyone I meet and want them to know how much I think how good they did certain things, like taking a good grade in class, or excelling in a sport but none of them ever seems to care, in return i always get insulted or joked about at school, maybe for my still childish way of being, not in a negative way, in a good way like being over excited for things or having innocent reactions, it's been like this for almost 5 years and through all this time i got and stille get sucidal thoughts, not just for this great loneliness i feel of course. Now i'm lonely except for very good and serious friends online, differently from the people i find irl they are very kind, respectful and say how beautiful and strong i am, and sometimes i can see that beauty (i'm pretty fit, muscular and with a cool jaw and nice voice too! really) it felt like kinda of a dream hehe. but now i'm wondering why after all these years, no one ever said those things or ever complimented me for the minimal achievement, i suck at school i get it, but at least i hoped for even a bith of simpathy from them...

and now here i am, i feel incredibly phisically and psichologically lonely, i want to be desired by people but at the same time, i feel disgusted to even the thought of being with a girl because i'm not enough.

feels like i'm begging for attention, but at least i hope i made myself clear, i'm not used to vent to others. i'm sure i'il regret making this post. please be kind"

At a very very rough patch in my life rn. Social life, Personal Life, as well as financial and career aspects, everything is a mess for me rn. 
And I've seen that some times, internet does trigger me too. 
I don't use any social media besides twitter and reddit. Never used insta or fb because I have had major body dysmorphia and self esteem issues and stuff, so could never get on a platform where people mainly posted their own pics. 
I'm thinking about stopping usage of twitter and reddit for the rest of this month too, because it's triggering a lot of my issues a bit too lately.

But I'm very scared about this decision. I have no social life currently. Im staying at my parents house and haven't spoken to anyone else except my parents and the retail workers etc since 2 months now. Reddit and twitter are my only sources of any sort of interaction in which I can be genuine, especially reddit. 
I'm scared I'll lose track of what's going on in the world and lag behind in terms of news etc., And also lose out on this small sliver of interaction I get. Reddit is my only hope of making true frnds anywhere. And I'm super scared that stopping it. 

But I kinda wanna too. I'm also scared that if I determine myself to pull this off but relapse, I'll feel even more like crap.

Idk, I'm in a massive dilemma rn. I just don't know. God I wanna die."

lonely,God.. what happened…,"God.. what happened… - After typing all this I’m realizing it’s just a really long pity story so I’m sorry for wasting anyone’s time 

This may come off as a bit childish, but I used to be somewhat popular, I used to be known, I had a big friend group, then because of some mental health issues I got put in a class for kids my age who had bad grades or bad mental health 

(my school system refuses to actually care about mental health, my friend was in a really bad place to the point where he almost took his life and they just sent him to a different school system so they didn’t have to deal with it.)

So instead of helping me and other kids, they send us to “the bad kids class” where the kids they don’t wanna deal with go and play games instead of being educated, don’t get me wrong it was fun, but they didn’t educate us and when they did it was work we did years before. Then COVID hit towards the end of the year and I didn’t even get to do finals, then they decide everyone passes automatically because of COVID. 

So I go into the next grade without knowing anything from the previous grade &amp; not having my friend group as we couldn’t hang out when all of my classes were in one room. I gain weight cause of depression from COVID, and I start the school year with online school for personal reasons, then halfway through the school year I switch back to normal school without knowing any of the online school work cause of my horrible self control (never did any online school work.

So I’m dropped in with no knowledge from the year prior or the first half of that year, I have no friends, since my town is VERY athletic to the point where it’s discriminatory, I get shamed for being overweight, no one even wants to look at me, I fail, I redo school again trying online, and now I’m almost halfway through a school year, having done practically NO work at all.

I have one friend that stuck with me this whole time who introduced me to his two best friends and now we all hang out together. Thing is my best friend who was all I had. Through this, just found a girlfriend online and is going to a different state across the country until he graduates to be with her.

So to recap, I lost my little popularity I had, (idc how childish it sounds it made me feel happy that people knew who I was) I lost two of my big friend groups, I’m failing school with no option but to drop out and be disowned by my parents, I’m losing my best friend soon, things aren’t too healthy with my other two friends so i don’t think they’re gonna be around for much longer. 

And I have NO way to meet new people my age. No school, I do homeschooling. No job, grades are too bad to get one. I barely leave the house. And even if I DID have a way to meet people besides online (I can’t do long distance relationships, I need to be able to hang out with whoever I date a lot, I’m just clingy idk..) my crippling social anxiety is way to hard for me to overcome I get sick as if I’m in a life or death situation while just talking to people.

TLDR: I used to have everything, happiness, friends, popularity, and I now i have absolutely nothing, I’m failing school, no hopes of success with my schoolwork AT ALL, I’m losing all my friends and i have no way of meeting new people so it all finally leads to I’m lonely…"

At this point it almost seems like I’m driving under water. I can’t even see out of the windshield. All I can feel is the cold air around me and my sweaty hands clutching the steering wheel. My breaths are shallow so I pull over to try to catch my breath. Im worried someone will hit me. I try to see past the waves of water slamming against my windows but there is nobody. Not a single pair of headlights. I sit here and I try to get a hold of my thoughts. “Where do I go?…” “What do I do?…” “Am I even headed the right direction?…” All I want to do is sleep. Wait it out. So I do. 
I wake up with my head spinning, and body aching. I see my car in the distance with a trail of glass leading to me. Somebody hit me. I call out for help, I reach out. There is nobody. All I want is someone to hold. Someone to allow me to feel love but there is no one. I lie here unable to feel, and everything I can feel, hurts. I am here. Alone."

I only started referring to it as a disease recently. I was stupid enough to think “how can negative thoughts, and emotions be a disease”.

It’s not rocket science. I have a chemical imbalance in the brain that requires me to see a psychologist and take medications. It by no means is “cured”. My psychologist tends to compare it to diabetes (I’ve gotten flak for the comparison), in which it never really goes away, I’ve just gotta learn to manage it.

I have a shitty attitude, and miserable demeanor. Not afraid to admit it. I’ve done some terrible things in my life that I carry extreme guilt for. I would apologize to those I’ve affected but they would prefer to never see me again, which I can’t blame them.

The bridges burned, the insults spewed, the disinterest in others, it can be rooted to one thing, depression. It’s caused me to drive away every friend I have.

I’ve become a better person though, I’ve completely dropped drugs and alcohol, and go to the gym everyday. Although I’ve tainted my reputation as a person. It’s hard for people to give me a second chance, in which I understand.

Long story short, I hope someone can relate to this post. I only speak to two people a week, my psychologist, and trainer. Maybe I’m desperate for friends idk.

lonely,Pain,"Pain - The sorrow in my heart is overwhelming
A man of my word, I am not
Hatred from God is what I feel
My sinful nature takes over
Refusal crosses my mind
Like a gentle breeze
Brushing past a firm mountain
My body traps inside my heart
Closed off from the rest of the world
I attempt to lift it up
To give it away
But the sorrow weighs it down
I imagine trying so hard
I proclaim that I am a Soldier
My mind is weak 
And my body is on the front lines
Every thought I have is ineffective
For the desire of my flesh 
Brings to light they are just fake
I find that I do not do what I want
Rather, I do what I hate.
And as my body feels good
I find that the hate subsides
When I cry up to my God
My tears fall slowly inside
My heart fills up with these tears 
It’s overfilled with pain
You’ll never know the level of pain
Because my tears never come out my eyes"

I wish I had a solidly established clique, people that I know I can count on sitting with at mealtimes everyday or someone to talk about my day with.

I used to have a group of friends freshman year, but I sorta distanced myself from them because I'm not into the party and drugs scene, which feels so difficult to avoid in college. I want sober, nonparty friends.

I tried talking to these 2 or 3 other girls more, but I feel like it's always me who initiates. Why doesn't anyone ask me to dinners or invite me to their hangouts? I know I'm not close enough to them, but it's just so hard. I hate that it felt like everyone made friends the first month of school and just stuck through. It's so hard to break in, and I feel like I'll never have a real best or close friend because everyone else got years of friendship on me.

There's even a guy I'm trying to talk to who I'm interested in hanging out with more and maybe something more, but I think I just look like a shy, innocent girl, so it's hard to ask for anything more.

I fully admit I'm not the best at starting bonds. I am extremely awkward and shy, I prefer work style communication, as it is easier to work with.

Everyone I know seems to have these great bonds, where I can say I have 3 people I think of as real friends, and not 1 lives even remotely near anymore.

lonely,I (F20) have no friends and only have my boyfriend,"I (F20) have no friends and only have my boyfriend - I’ve been dating my boyfriend for over a year now and am very happy in my relationship. However, just last year I was in university living with 4 of my friends. I decided it was best to move back home and commute to school to save money. I thought I would still keep in touch with these friends but haven’t spoken a word to them since. It’s hard to get into but it seems they are mad at me and completely have cut me off. We all said how we would have to hang out even when I moved back home and I’d be invited to our old house, but this hasn’t happened. It hurts to see on social media their posts hanging out or having small parties and not being included. It may relate to the fact that I became very close with my boyfriend and hung out with him more than them. 

This has left me with 0 close friends. My boyfriend obviously has a life of his own and even though I see him a few times a week he is busy with his sports and also has friends/roommates of his own to be with. I feel so lonely when he is busy with them. It is not his fault at all, but it makes me jealous of what friends he has. I regret moving out of my uni house as at least I had people to see every day. I feel at this point I won’t make any new friends either. I don’t like relying on my boyfriend to have someone to be with. I miss feeling included and having friends to have fun with. I’ve just been feeling so alone and dwelling on the past :("

lonely,…vent,"…vent - Since the new school year has started i tried to be more outgoing and nice to everyone, it was going well for a while but as the year goes on i just started to feel the sense of loneliness coming back. I am surrounded by loving people but in every conversation i feel like i’m somehow a problem and that no body truly likes me. I put up an act because no body likes someone who brings the mood down but sometimes i just want to let go and not care what anybody thinks.
 
I developed a crush this year which was nice.. ya know the stares and freaking out over normal convos we have.. well i thought that was going to be something good that would happen  but i’ve been seeing him more and more with a different girl… at this point i was like “yea ok i knew it” i try to tell myself i don’t care about some dude because i really shouldn’t but deep inside my mind i do because this always happens.

i feel like i’m not good enough for anyone, and i know all i need is myself but right now it doesn’t feel like that, i just want someone i can talk to and cry on while also sharing my happiest moments with.. what sucks is that i don’t know how to express my feelings to someone else irl so i just dont and i don’t know how to fix that either. I can’t even talk to my mom either. Even when i do try to express how i feel towards people, they get angry or tell me to basically suck it up, that’s why i’m here because the internet rarely lets me down.."

My family doesn’t listen to me the way I want to be listened to nor do I feel comfortable talking to them about certain things.

lonely,Does anyone else relate?,"Does anyone else relate? - Does anyone feel like everyone around you just hates you, I feel like I'm completely irrelevant and a mistake to be born to begin with, my mom passed away because of me my father had abused her to the point it cut off her life by over 40 years most likely and she passed away in 2018 the only reason she stayed with him was because of me. My father was a drug dealer who sold marijuana and was in prison for it for many years of my childhood and had done meth and he's currently in the hospital with everything my mom had, I have no friends either I'm completely alone the only happiness I get in life is from my gf and we only talk online she's almost always busy too with other things so us talking is basically rare to some extent..... I hate the world I live in and I'm tired of people telling me the same thing ""go to a therapist"" ""just deal with it until you can move out"" (also just for context I just turned 18 in July and live with only one person my aunt and she treats me like shit).

lonely,i can't take it anymore,"i can't take it anymore - i'm eternally fucked. i don't feel like anyone actually cares for me. even though my parents do a lot for me, i still don't feel like i'm cared about. like the feeling just isn't there. i don't have any close friends anymore, and the people i do talk to are like acquaintances. haven't hung out with someone in years, and i don't take hugs. this girl i like unexpectedly stopped talking to me, even after we had really great conversations. every day is the same now. wake up at 6, and then school from like 7:30am-3pm. i get home at 4, get too exhausted to do my homework, fall asleep at 5, wake up at 8, and then stay up until 2am, switching between procrastinating and doing absurd amounts of work. 

my parents tell me to join a club at my school. ""you'll find friends there"", they say. the issue is that it doesn't help. at all. i just wanna give up on trying to make connections. at this point i feel so drained of emotion i'm not fully able to take in just how shitty my situation is. people say ""it'll get better"". yeah right. i've tried everything and it doesn't work. medication. therapists. trips with other people. they don't fix the issue, only put a band-aid on it. all the ""fun"" stuff i do serves as nothing but a distraction. why can't i just sleep forever?

lonely,What's wrong with me?,"What's wrong with me? - I have this constant dread that I will lose what I have. Every conversation feels like a battle. A battle to not reveal how weird and miserable I am. I remember overhearing co workers talking ""What's wrong with that guy? I Don't know he's bipolar or schizophrenic I think"". I was the only other person they were working with.

Sometimes people just start uncomfortably laughing in conversations. I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. I can't hold a job for very long. It's usually not the work itself, but the feeling of being disconnected from my coworkers. There's this impending dread and I'm just wondering how much longer I can take this before I get fired for being too weird or just leave.

I live in a major city at the moment. I hate the noise and it makes me constantly anxious, I do like how anonymous I am though. I can just disappear pretty much. I form no real connections with people just keep jumping from one place to the next...surviving. It's no way to live but what's the alternative.

I've tried to get into therapy, but I can't figure out how to get affordable therapy. I believe it's available, but it's such a beurocratic process I can't figure it out, or wait it out. Everything takes too long and I'm so indecisive. 

Suicide is feeling like the only option. It doesn't make sense, I'm super active, not into drugs or anything. But it all seems pointless when you can't connect with others. I'm constantly angry and alone, why stick around.

Just some brain vomit, I don't know. Just wanted to write some of this out."
lonely,Why does nobody like me,"Why does nobody like me - I don't get it, why does nobody like me. I thought it was because I was ugly but I wear a mask all the time. I thought it was because I wasn't funny so I tried harder and I can get people to laugh a reasonable amount. I thought I was boring so I got a lot of hobbies. I thought I talked too much about myself so I listen. I thought I was too needy so I don't bother people. I am there for people when they need me. I reply fast, I initiate conversation but not to the point of being needy. I can hold conversations, I have hobbies that my friends do. I try to be entertaining and funny and smart. I do all these things that everyone else can just do naturally but still. People always leave me in the end. I don't get it. What am I doing wrong. Why does nobody care about me. What did I do?

I mean it makes no sense, obviously I'm not perfect but still. I am doing so much, I don't have high expectations. I just don't want to be left on read for hours. I don't mind not replying for months, enough ppl have done it that I have become numb but I hate when people leave me on read. I don't know, it is just worse. I don't want to be anyone's best friend, just for someone to care about me. What am I doing bad? I'm so confused and hurt. It just happened again. 

I offered to hang out with a friend and they left me on read. We have class together so maybe on Tuesday I will have to see them and pretend like nothing happened but I'm so tired. I just want a friend. Why is this so hard. Why am I nobodies priority. I just seriously don't get it. Sorry for ranting, I don't really have anyone I can tell this too, for obvious reasons. I just want to get it out. I

 don't know, I seriously don't know what to do I've tried everything. It feels like there is something wrong with me. Idk. My only friend probably only stick around because I help them out anyway. They always withdraw until they need something. I don't get it how does this keep happening, why am I such a bother. I wish I could just be happy being by myself so I don't go through this. I wish I could be content on my own.  

My family thinks I am a social butterfly. They think I have tons of friends, I mean I do? I have people who I talk to, but they never care about me. They are the people who just put up with me until someone better comes along. I'm just scared that this will become my life. Constantly having meaningless connections to people. Just being the thing that people throw away when they are bored. Trying to fix it but nothing works. I don't know."

lonely,just fucking sad,"just fucking sad - I’ve been sitting in my car for 2 hours. Falling in and out of daydreaming/napping. Nowhere to go, don’t know what to do with myself. I have all this time and no one to spend it with. All these contacts in my phone and not one person I could call. 

I mean, I could just go home. But there’s nothing waiting for me there either. I suppose it doesn’t even make a difference where I am, i’m always alone. 

I bet my coworker is out here somewhere having fun. No, i’m sure she is lol she’s always out. Probably not enjoying bottomless mimosas with her countless girlfriends. No dull moment in her life. I wonder how she does it. Like, how is she not exhausted? Being that social seems so draining. But as long as she’s happy I guess.  Not me, I could never lol I’m not bitter, to be honest. I wouldn’t want anyone to feel the mind of loneliness that I do. I’m just sad for myself is all. 

She called me earlier and I didn’t pick up. I’m sure she was just gonna ask me for something. Probably some adderall. Or money lol. That’s always the only reason she ever calls. That’s the only reason anyone ever calls me, to ask for something. It’s so deeply depressing when you reach that moment of realization that nobody actually cares about you. 

It’s really crazy how alone one person can feel in the world. So many people all around me and I feel like i’m completely invisible. Am I even really here? 

I guess if i’m feeling desperate enough I could go over to his place. That’s always an option. I’d only feel worse though. He never makes me feel better. The last time I talked to him I told him I was depressed and not feeling like my best self. He told me I was already depressed for months and asked when i’d get over it lmao. Didn’t know you could just snap out of depression, my bad. I know I won’t get any empathy from him, but I know he’s always an option. I wish I had better options. I wish I could just snap out of this funk i’m in too. Maybe i’m the problem. 

Thinking about having to shower, shave, do my makeup and hair just to feel comfortable enough to see him…i’m already exhausted. It’s never that easy or simple. I wish it was. I wish I could just come as I am and know it’d make no difference because i’d always be accepted. I wish I had close female friends that are like sisters to me because my own sisters hate me.

I think i’ll just go home and sleep the rest of the day away. What’s new lol"

Don’t have any family apart from them.

lonely,"I’m over the concept of love, relationships and romance","I’m over the concept of love, relationships and romance - I’ve been single for ten years (I’m 28M). Recently, I’ve been seeing all my friends on social media getting married, having families and having a great life. Because of these feelings, I can’t help but feel like I’m missing out on life because of that. 

My ex gf from high school was verbally abusive towards me, cheated on me behind my back and refused to ever have sex due to her religious beliefs and I respected that. Turns out after she dumped me, she fucked him thus I’m a 28 year old virgin who’s never even seen a woman naked and I feel left out that I’ve never had such a connection with anyone. She pretty much made me feel like I’m not worthy of anyone’s love

I just hate seeing all these couples in public holding hands, kissing and teasing with each other. Now for those of you who say I should try dating apps, don’t. I’ve tried Tinder, Bumble, Facebook Dating and OkCupid. Every time I matched, it was for a fake profile, causing me to think that if I was even worthy of love. After about four years on those apps, I gave up and deleted them. 

Every time Valentines Day comes around, I have to control my inner anger because everyone is talking about plans and each time I’m in public, I have to force myself to ignore advertisements or whenever I’m watching TV, I look at my phone and ignore it. 

I’m sorry if I’ve soured anyone’s mood about this but I just needed to tell someone. Thank you for letting me tell my story."

The problem is that I know I am a relationship guy. Back in school (maybe 6th grade) there was a girl asking me for a date but I was too young and naive to understand that. But that was just a crush she had and no love, this date never happens because I was too stupid to understand that.
A few years later I had a crush on a girl in my school. After months of preparation I told her about my feelings. That was the biggest mistake I ever did in my life. She told me to cancel any contact with her and delete her contact everywhere (Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp etc.). But I still was desperate in love. After two years she said ""hi"" to me and I was super happy that she didn't ignored me any longer. But since then nothing really happened.
I am on multiple online dating platforms and all my accounts are over 10years old now. Never had one date.

Every time I see my friends with partners we have a good time but at the same time I realize that I am still missing someone in my life and that there is a big whole in my life.

I am super depressed and don't know what to do.

lonely,I feel like the only person I have cared about for a long time is replacing me with someone else,"I feel like the only person I have cared about for a long time is replacing me with someone else - My girlfriend[20F] and I[20M] have been together for 2 years, recently we have been having problems in our relationship of miscommunication or not being able to understand each other well. We have been working on it and have made good progress but we are not as happy and she is not as loving as she used to be. A guy was recently hired where she works and she became friends with him very easily more than her other coworkers. It has been about 2 months since they became friends and she hangs out with him all the time now. And they text every hour of the day, she is always talking to him. She is open to me about her relationship with him and has told me they just want to be friends and have very similar interests. It reminds me a lot of how she and I used to be when we met. And now  It has gotten to the point where everybody thinks of them as a couple at work. She used to spend all her time with me before. I know have a better job where I work 6 days a week and no longer have as much time to go out on dates or time to do things together because she is a student and part time worker, our schedules don't work together too well. Now most of the little time we are free at the same time, she spends with her new friend she met. I feel jealous of him because she is doing all the things that I have wanted to do with her recently with this new guy. Things like going to a nice restaurant we had been talking about going to for a while for the first time, or like I talked of going to the theater to watch a movie with her because I was really excited to watch it and she went to the movies to watch that movie with him instead, I feel like I am slowly being replaced and sad because I can't leave my new job either because we both depend on that money to be able to keep our apartment. I am also scared that she will end up falling in love with this guy that she is hanging out with all the time and likes so much, and I still love her the same way I did when I met her, I can tell she does not feel as strongly as she did then about me, she still says she loves me and we do things together when we can but I feel like she is losing that love for me. We recently moved in together 1 week ago and part of me really wants to to just let go of what i fear is happening and continue to try with her, but i can't help thinking about it over and over again and now i feel like she might be using me for money because she would not be able to live somewhere on her own with how much she is making from her job but she really needed to leave her mom because their relationship was not the best. I feel like I should break up with her sometimes but I think I its mostly because I am scared of being broken up with when I might not expect it and then feel like I would have nothing without her. What should I do and think about this?"

guess what, I'm back to being almost alone again. after 10 months. I remember thinking ""they are so negative, that's why they never will find someone to fill that void"" well guess what, being positive doesn't either.

lonely,It’s creeping again…,"It’s creeping again… - So I made it to 24. A few years ago I didn’t plan or imagine I’d see that, but here we are. In truth nothing much has changed. 

The girl I really did love dropped back in to my life when things went to shit, only to disappear off in to the sunset with her boyfriend when everything was patched up.

I tried the medicines. They don’t work. They just make me tried and give me horrible dreams. Nothing I couldn’t thing equally easily while awake, and I certainly do feel more rested. 

I’ve searched high and low with varying intensities to find my spot over the past 6 years, with some periods more intensely searching than others, but nether the less always trying. I’m now back at that mood where you really have exhausted all routes and just not found nobody. Not a soul. 

The past few weeks really have been the worst. I’ve been searching high, low, and responding to all manner of posts on here and over the internet. 

I wish I knew what was wrong with me or where else I should be looking. 6 years is long enough. Something please just come along and cut my losses. I’m too tired to keep doing this."

lonely,4 weddings and a funeral,4 weddings and a funeral - My cousin is getting married today. My parents asked me to come. Going to family weddings is the worst. I’m one of 58 first cousins. I used to go to them and Id find myself sitting alone. This is before having my own cell phone. I hated my life. I felt sooo lonely. They made me feel like I was inferior. They make a comment of how I’m too effeminate or have gained a lot of weight and I was done. My parents hate that I refuse to go anymore. They tell me family is everything. Who is going to be there when you are in trouble? I don’t care. I’d prefer to be alone then to ruin my mental health.

I play for a bit, its good distraction but then im back to feeling absolute dead inside. I  wish life was different and i had a job that i liked...

I’ve been single my entire life and have never really had a friend like the girl.

She’s kinda weird and awkward, but it makes her funny. She’s just a really physical person as in always giving high fives, pushing, punches, poking your sides and such. The other day when I dropped her off at her place after hanging out. After talking for a moment she leaned over and hugged me. I hugged her back and I wanted that hug never to end. I haven’t been really hugged in years.

She pulled away and got out after saying bye. On my way back it hit me like a train, I hadn’t felt this alone in a long time. It hurt a lot and I went to bed and just didn’t want to get up. I felt so alone after that for a couple days."

lonely,💞💝,"💞💝 - 

If unspoken words could too be carried back, I’d never regret my heart. If I could catch the happiness I felt. I’d never regret my heart. If I could repress all those beautiful tears that fell onto my dress when I cried. I’d never regret my heart. 


My heart didn’t cause the pain. It just caught it for a brief season.🌸🌺 But the one who causes the pain, will carry the pain. Whether aware or not. In this way, we can appreciate even our greatest disappointments. The hurt teaches us. It makes us wiser. And so much more brave. Our greatest disappointments can help us to find our greatest strength.

lonely,Just cried for the first time in so long.,"Just cried for the first time in so long. - Lockdown fucked me up mentally to the point where I couldn’t really tell how I felt about certain things. That was a while ago and today I just let it out. I’m a teenage boy and I’m fed up because no one at my school takes me seriously. They may find me funny but it’s mostly ironically, and so many people just take the piss out of me.

So I am left just feeling useless, like I am here for everyone else’s amusement. In England, especially where I’m from, there is hardly any Christians my age. People subtly take the piss about the fact I am a Christian. They say it’s a joke and of course I have to do a fake laugh. It’s just not funny though is it. If I pipe up, I will just get laughed at for overreacting. 

If anyone has any advice for growing your relationship with God, or just self improvement, please help me out. It would be a great way to spend my hours of empty time.

No one checks up on me, I am always the first to text. I don’t have a girlfriend nor am I anywhere near having one. I don’t have any major hobbies to keep me going in life. I don’t have any goals for my future other than to be happy, which I have no idea how I am going to manage.

I would say the only thing keeping me going is football, family and weed (which I regulate my usage of).

And typing that down is just so sad to me. But it’s true. 

I’m always questioning whether I’m enjoying my life. Sometimes, pretty much every time I’m high, the answer is yes, other times no. But the fact that I am constantly asking myself this just goes to show I am not content with my life.

And feeling this way going into winter is the worst. I’ll be stuck at home either doing homework or probably wallowing about how I’m bored or unhappy.

Fuck this."
lonely,Being alone at night is the worst,Being alone at night is the worst - Wish I can summon a bf just to cuddle with 😞🥀💔
lonely,how do you cope with being alone for so long?,"how do you cope with being alone for so long? - I have no idea how to cope with the feels anymore. Being 23 and single my whole life. You know it wouldn't be so bad if I had some friends irl. But I don't. I work 4 days a week but I don't talk to anyone outside of work.

I just go home. Play some multiplayer games alone. And repeat. I have discord that I check out of habit but I don't talk to much people through out the day. If anyone.. 

this used to be enough for me until I was like 22 and since then nothing works. I feel empty and lonely. Constantly craving friendship or close connections w/ people. Always wondering what its like to be intimate with someone ( sorry if that's nsfw ). Life feels so pointless to me. I'm jealous of so many people and wishing I could experience what they have atleast once"
lonely,"I can't stand when I'm ""ghosted""","I can't stand when I'm ""ghosted"" - It happened to me 3 times last month, which is having great conversations online with guys,  I know they are attracted to me because they would compliment me on my photos and such. Then we agree on meeting and they just stop responding to my messages. 
Why would they pretend to be interested in the first place?  They are so many reasons why someone could change their mind or something happened in their life and can no longer meet, but if that's the case just say it and I would understand, but being ignored when I did nothing wrong just hurts. 
I hate when I'm getting my hopes up on meeting new people and potentially making a friend or better a boyfriend, I've been very lonely and I want to change that. I don't have many friends and the ones I do have a busy life or live in different cities, which makes it harder to meet. All I want it's something beyond just online chatting, I want to go out for a coffee with somebody, just talk and laugh which would make me feel so much better.  I know 3 guys don't seem like much, but I've been talking with many more but those 3 felt like we had a genuine connection, that's why it felt bad when they stopped responding to my texts."
lonely,24 [Toronto] - Looking for platonic beans to hang out with!,"24 [Toronto] - Looking for platonic beans to hang out with! - Hello you!!!

About time you found me, I am a 24 year old torontonian bean. I love cooking and want to get into baking. I love horror movies and romcoms. I love long walks with ice caps and runs, writing, and reading, and listening to people talk about their passions. I love finding 'easter eggs' in people - when they tell me a seemingly insignificant story that i can connect back later to their present life. I love hearing people's stories, i love it when they give me the chance to invest in them. I love making people laugh, and helping them be better people - I think being the therapist puts me at ease because it takes the spotlight off of me, though recently I've become more comfortable venting.

People say I'm funny most of my humor is pretty dark, I write about cannibals and accidental murderers so my humor can sometimes edge into that territory, i consequently have a bunch of awkward uncomfortable stories where people have thought I'm serious when I'm not. Having to watch michael from the office feels like someone personally knew me and decided to make an attack on my character in the form of a sitcom. I promise to spend at least 80% of my time trying to make you laugh,
If you still need a better picture of me, I am really nerdy, i like harry potter, and marvel, and videogames, and there's a bunch of nerdy stuff i'm not into but I feel as if i have a duty to get into - llike dnd and boardgames.

The only real requirement i have is that you need to be a spammy, rambly person who can keep up a conversation. Sometimes I can lose interest if someone barely responds or is putting in minimal effort. I don't care what you look like, and you don't even need to give me your name until you're comfortable with it. I think it's just respect to be respectful in general. I'm hoping this can be a long term connection :3 Please be from Toronto, or at least nearby! I've found a lot of good people off of here who i meet regularly with and I'm down to meet more"
lonely,Post college depression,"Post college depression - Hey all, 
So, in high school and college, we’re surrounded by lots of people, all day every day. There’s many opportunities for socialization, etc. Now that I’m back in my hometown, I find myself feeling a bit lonely sometimes. My college friends are in a different state, and I don’t keep in touch with them too much anymore. My hometown friends either moved or are at college rn. I’ve lost a bit of touch with them as well. So I guess, I’m looking for some insights for thoughts on making or meeting new people after college. How can I meet people as an adult? If there’s anyone in similar situations I’d love to hear some insights. 
Thanks 🙏"

lonely,Why don't the women here message men when they post?,Why don't the women here message men when they post? - The men here are constantly dming women and offering comfort or whatever. Any woman that's posted on reddit knows their dms get filled instantly. Why dont women do this back? Why aren't women interested in talking to the men here?
lonely,A gift or a curse,A gift or a curse - Do you think loneliness is a gift or a curse? Sometimes I really crave to be around other people but lately my loneliness has made me more aware of how little people care for me and in return how little I care for them. Perhaps it’s just my perspective that’s changed. I’m tired of being lonely so I don’t focus on it anymore.
lonely,(17) Anyone as alone as me want to make a connection?,"(17) Anyone as alone as me want to make a connection? - Hey there, im in a really tough space and i often find myself alone and with no one to turn to. Its hard to find people around my age on here and I would really like to make a connection with someone and make a positive impact on them, so if anyone out there feels the same way, perhaps we can find something we have in common."
lonely,im lonely,"im lonely - Im 16 and I don't really talk to anybody but my family, I want to cry sometimes to destress from bad thoughts but I usually won't. Its low confidence, I'm trying to workout because I wanna start fresh for college so maybe I can meet friends and hopefully a partner, but right now I just keep thinking where I went wrong because I used to have friends. I know it sounds trivial but I really wanna just be confident and happy. I'm not suicidal or depressed I know im not I just feel so alone. Everyday im either working out or in my house all day and when im at school I usually talk to nobody till I see my parents at home. I have been humbled but I still am a bad person, and I always think that maybe I deserve this but its too much. :/

 I don't usually make posts like this I always shut myself up and delete the message after I wrote it but I really really want to say this because I want someone to see this."
lonely,I got clean off hard drugs the night I OD’d and almost died. I want to relapse &amp; I wish I died that night.,"I got clean off hard drugs the night I OD’d and almost died. I want to relapse &amp; I wish I died that night. - Everywhere I go, I’m met with rejection and hate. I’m universally hated in my town- people tell me about others who talk shit about me, and they seem to be taking delight in telling me, hoping it’ll get a reaction. I’m getting so tired. Everyone thinks I’m weird. When I do get friends, they stop associating with me eventually. I can’t keep friends. No one wants to be around me. I want to relapse. I want to OD and die. Nothing good is coming to me in this life. All my life has been nothing but abuse, addiction, eating disorders, self-hate, bullying, turmoil, isolation and misery. I’m a mistake. I shouldn’t be here. Why continue ? There’s nothing here for me. I legit think I’m cursed. My life is nothing more but a cruel joke. I don’t have any strength left. I give up."
lonely,Looking for people to talk to,"Looking for people to talk to - I kinda feel like i've got no one to talk to, so hmu. I'm a pretty good listener"
lonely,Serotonin so low,Serotonin so low - Does anyone want to chat and actually chat send laughs send memes whatever we can both help each other produce happy chemicals. So tired of all the fake one sentence conversations.
lonely,Got told people are talking shit about me,"Got told people are talking shit about me - Someone sent me a message on snapchat saying that a ‘bunch of people are talking shit’ about me. I said ‘cool I don’t care’, to which they said ‘I know, but it was funny bc they were so childish’. Truth is, I do care. Everywhere I go, I get shit talked about me. Social rejection hurts, and it happens to me everywhere, with everyone. I have like 2 friends that actually like me. The whole town hates me, it seems. It happened at the youth club, and it was a ‘bunch of people’ so clearly a popular opinion. Idk what I’m doing wrong. I didn’t ask what they said specifically, coz it would make it look like I care. Whatever they said, it pales in comparison to the shit I fling at myself. I’ve been so low lately, and this just beat me down completely. I want to relapse doing drugs again. I want to self destruct. I’m stupid, ugly, annoying and worthless. I wish I would just die."
lonely,There are 5 people in my room in dorm including me,There are 5 people in my room in dorm including me - 3 of them didn’t even come to sleep Friday night. People are staying over in their friends home. Hanging around in bars. Yet I am completely fucked up thinking about how lonely I am. It sucks.
lonely,Are you?,Are you? - Are you lonely? Or are you just peaceful and not used to it?
lonely,Another kick in the head,Another kick in the head - Abandon by everyone Hurt bullied by everyone am still standing I'd write a autobiography of my life but they would only use it to hit me with 😆 I hope one day everyone who has hurt me really gets hurt then will realise exactly how they made me feel every single day of my life
lonely,I Hate love and couples,"I Hate love and couples - Two of my best friends are in the relationship with each other, we three of us use to enjoy each other company and having fun but now because both of are in relationship I feel so left out and lonely. Sometime I feel like  I am just a third weel and want to disappear even tho there are my only bestfriends. Their pressure makes me jealous, makes me feel I am unloved and I am loser for not have my love of my life. There are close to each other, here I am alone again just like in the past didn't had many friends. I am always been third weel and match making for everyone. I was lonely and will always be lonely for life. I Hate love it just breaks my heart."
lonely,Lost my bestfriend,Lost my bestfriend - I wish I wasn’t sad I just lost my best friend now I have no one I talk to everyday and all I can do is cry I don’t know what to do anymore  I have friends but we barely talk and I lost the one person that we laugh and do everything together everyday I feel sick of my stomach I can barely do anything right I wish I had a friend
lonely,that’s it,"that’s it - i’ve made sure i’ve spoken to everyone that meant anything to me today, i’ve admitted to the person i liked that i liked them, i’ve made letters to my friends and family. i’m done. i don’t wanna live anymore. i cant stay."
lonely,please leave me alone... I'm better off when I'm alone,"please leave me alone... I'm better off when I'm alone - I miss the touch of someone else... the feeling you get when someone is so excited to see you that you can feel it when you hug them. Damn what a feeling am I right? Being so lonely plus having depression and anxiety really makes life feel so pointless. I do have family around but I'm still so lonely and I do have  one ""friend"" (I know sad huh) but most of the time I kinda wish she would ghost me. I really don't feel like I'm worth her time.

I miss having those goodnight and goodmorning texts or having friends hit me up wanting to go do some random shit. I just don't having any feeling left except loneliness or anger. Im drained inside... I try not to show it but I am. I get up dreading the day but still I put on this fake smile and laugh just so everyone else won't ask if I'm ok. But idk how long I can keep on with the fake emotions. Everytime someone says it's ok to talk to them about whatever I just can't. I've dealt with this for so long and alone that I really don't know what to say like even typing this I'm lost and trying to get what I want out. Even if I do talk about this with someone it's always the same thing like look on the brightside or cmon everything will be fine but I already know it won't. I just don't know what to do anymore except suppress my loneliness with liquor and suffer in silence. Idk what to say anymore but if anyone else feels the same way I hope things get better for you. I'm 25m idk if I'm supposed to put that in here"
lonely,Never had a girlfriend,"Never had a girlfriend - I’m 26 M and never had a gf. It just makes me feel like a loser. 

During elementary school and middle school I was awkward and didn’t know to to talk to girls

High school I at least had some friends who were girls so that was progress.

During college I had a few girls who are friends and still do. Some hookups and fwb here and there but never a full relationship.

I think I always put my best foot forward and when I’m in the  “talking” stage and when I’m on a date. But for one reason or another a relationship never happens.

Maybe I’m a bit overbearing by texting everyday. I don’t double text or anything but I do say good morning and good night everyday. 

I talked to a friend (girl) and she said sometimes a girl just gets a bad feeling and at that point it’s over and it’s not that i did something wrong necessarily. That was helpful and made me feel a bit better. 

2 of my cousins got married recently and my sister just got engaged. I really am happy for them. And most of my friends have entered serious relationships. 

It just hurts to feel unwanted and not have any intimacy with someone. 
I used to pay for hookers just to cuddle with me(I know I’m a loser). 

I’m a short guy and introvert so I know I’m not a top pick. I know I need to work on my confidence. I think I just wanted to be loved for too long that I’m frustrated with myself when I see all this love around me.

I think I’ll take a good break from dating and give all the love I have in my heart to myself."
lonely,I don’t know why I look forward to the weekends because that’s when I’m most lonely,"I don’t know why I look forward to the weekends because that’s when I’m most lonely - I’m just so tired. I want a group of friends I can go out with or just chill at home and play videogames with. I wish I never messed things up with my ex girlfriend because she was the closest friend I’ve ever had. But now she’s off having a great life, partying and hooking up with other guys on the weekends while I’m just sitting at home, mindlessly scrolling Reddit. 

The only social interaction I get is at work. I have absolutely no idea what to do on the weekends. I need companionship. I’m so tempted to reach out to my ex just to be able to talk to her again as a friend but I know that’ll be too painful for me, just knowing that she’s with other people.

I never been in a any sleepovers with any of my "" friends "", never went a vacation, never been in a party, nothing. I basicly wasted my 23 years of life in front of computer with minimal social interaction with my peers. Yesterday my cousin who is same age with me had a party before his wedding and he invited all of his close friends, his brother but not me and it really hitted me hard. Like we kinda grew up together but he always excludes me events like this. I know all of his friends and sometimes when i hangout with them, they basicly makes plans in front of me but not invite me at all (while my cousin is there). I have like 2 or 3 friends and same thing happening with them too. They make plans with their other friends while we are hangingout and not invite me because they think i cant get along with them well. I am socaily akward as hell and people mostly don't enjoy having conversation with me. They basicly get bored and i think thats the reason why i dont have good friends or friendgroup.

I vented online about this last night and was told ""well go out and join them"" as if it's that simple. :/

Oh thanks wow I’m cured. I suddenly have a robust social group just like that. I feel like natural social butterflies/extroverts/“normal” people don’t realize how easy they have it making friends. And keeping friends.

I’m out of college and in a new town. It’s a small town. I wfh. The pandemic has shuttered many activities and potential meetup groups. There are very few meetups that aren’t “60+ singles meetups” in my area. I live alone. No family nearby. 

I have tried to make friends. I’ve met up with at least ten people since I moved to this tiny town a year ago. Here’s what happens. We meet up exactly once. I think it goes well. We do a simple chat over coffee sort of thing. They usually end out meet with “oh we should totally do this again sometime!!” 

And then they never contact me again. I’ll try to reach out with “hey do you want to do x y or z activity?” And get met with “oh haha sorry I’m so busy right now”. And then nothing. Even got Unfriended on snapchat right after our meetup. 

I keep trying to make friends. And it’s just not working. And there has to be something wrong with me. But I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong. Beyond I’m kind of an eccentric artsy type person. Who is now trying very hard to force themselves to be “normal”."

That's a pretty big jump, and I feel like in that time I completely changed mindset wise and maturity wise, and I tried to go back to doing things I used to enjoy but they just aren't fun anymore. 15 to 18 is a big jump, and family I used to talk to i feel like I outgrew a bit, and now talking to them feels forced. The gap between friends grew bigger than it was as well since I didn't keep contact during quarantine, and so I feel the little social circle I had kind of imploded on itself, that on top of loss in interest in my normal activities, I feel like I'm a bit lost, I felt lonely before, I felt anxious before, I even was depressed before, but I didn't feel lost, even when I felt shit i still had an idea of what to do, now I feel like I lost that and there's just a sense of hollowness in my stomach and confusion in my mind, not necessarily sadness, more less a sense that I'm just perilously navigating a perpetual void.

lonely,Short story on how we met,"Short story on how we met -   

It was unlike any experience I have ever had in my life. Of course, most experiences are like that because you have not had them. They are a series of strung-out moments; some seem to build and bond eternal memories that we look back on to bring joy back to our lives and some bring about too much pain that it causes you to spiral downward. This was both. 

I was fortunate enough to meet the love of my life by accident. A whim of the universe if you will. We met at work and spent the night chatting. The conversations that we had were unlike any I had known or ever had with another. All I was ever told about her was that she was quiet, and I knew with my personality, that would not work. She came in as a replacement for someone who was supposed to be there that night. Then, I was awestruck at this green haired goddess. She spoke for the first time when I introduced myself nervously. Then she smiled. I will never forget that first smile. Things happened that night, changes in me that I could not explain if I tried. 

I found myself months later, several in fact, thinking about her from time to time. Not in any sense that you pass a woman on the street and find yourself curious about her life and beauty, but in the longing for a deeper connection. Passing by the place where she worked and wanting to stop in and say hello. I could not conjure the bravery. I would ask about her more than any person that I worked with from that company. Eventually I told an old co-worker to give her my number and have her call or text me because I knew I would never have the strength in me to do it myself. 

On the night I found out that my mother had Terminal cancer, stage 4 breast, I had been awake for over thirty hours and was just scrolling on my phone. I received a text message saying, “Hey, It’s Jett.” The following couple of days turned out to be paradise. Things I will never forget. I told her immediately about my circumstances and why I was so tired and rambling. I told her about my moms, and she said, “Seriously dude, if there is anything I can do- let me know.” She stated that she knew that people said that all the time, and yet somehow, I knew she meant it. I asked if she would come over and cuddle. She obliged. For the first time in countless years, my heart fluttered. (there is a sad ending)"

I think about how I could've played the game differently for the 1000th time today. How I could've just focused on minimal subjects at school so I would've been able to do what I wanted in college instead of the course they picked for me, the people I would've met in film, photography and business class, the chance I would've went to uni, had a gf and went clubbing with people. 23 years old and not had a friend since I was 16, I feel drained and humanity further seems feel more alien as the days go by

lonely,My current state of loneliness,"My current state of loneliness - Right then…

**Some context**

- So, I have a bit of issue of resisting making my acquaintance with other boys/men or conversely being unreceptive to others reaching out to me, having been more accepting of girls/women or being more deliberative about reaching out to the opposite gender for connections, and my approach with that has not been without faults, I must admit.

- I believe my resistance to male acquaintances began somewhere in childhood, quite particularly as far as my father and brother are concerned - they are much more emotionally expressive and affectionate people as compared to my stoicism and personal bubble; there’s still a bit of resistance today.

- And then there’s the more typical matter of previous school experience in which I was the quiet “nerd” compared to the energetic, extroverted “jocks”, making me self-conscious about being “nice” because “niceness” in itself was more of a “feminine trait” (I don’t actually put stock into these stereotypes, thus my quotations, I mean to speak to the culture of my public school experience) - unfortunately, this has painted itself over desires to try and befriend guys who are more like me.

**More on school**

- Yeah, I was more recipient to making my acquaintance with girls/women and am even guilty of faulty efforts to connect with them, as if I have been projecting my greater reception towards my mother upon girls/women with the underlying thought they I would provide “gentler” friendships, even though I consciously know energetic/charismatic personality traits are not bound to gender.

- To this day, I think about an on/off friendship with sorts I had with a girl who actually understood me (and was likewise neurodivergent), but I started to like her as well… …more than a friend, but because of intense social anxiety and insecure feelings, I never initiated upon that crush.

- It shames me to say that my ending communication with her only ending recently (recently being bad, because ending those things was overdue), because romantic tension grew between us - it would’ve been an unhealthy and indulgent relationship as I became increasingly codependent on her by regularly sharing my woes and she started engaging in harmful practices/behaviors that would’ve made the relationship bad.

**Lingering thoughts**

- The painful thing is that I actually had a dream about her last night, the perpetual obsession over what could have been having ingrained itself in my mind; one of my deepest, and probably darkest desires to this day is that the idea of who she was to me would “repeat itself” in another individual to befriend - and hopefully keep it fucking platonic.

- Right now, I keep on convincing myself that I am okay as I am now without any platonic connections with people my age - and yes, that is very much true as I thoroughly enjoy and *need* extensive solitude - but the friendship I had with the girl and other lost acquaintances from school has left a bit of a hole in my mind.

- And as much of an asshole as it may make me, I do have a lot of boundaries when it comes to forming genuine friendships; I just wish the intimacy element wasn’t such an obstacle to comfortably sharing silence with someone - I yearn for the experience of being alone, together.

Thank you."

lonely,How quickly things can change...,"How quickly things can change... - Two years ago, I finished my junior year of high school. Life was great: sports had some great moments to witness, I had some amazing and interesting classes, I was hanging out with my cousins A LOT (although not as much as the year before), and after three years of failure, I may have finally had someone share a mutual interest in me (I never hit them up though). 

At the same time though, there was something worsening over that past year: my social anxiety. I was always shy, but I was cool with most of the school. I had plenty of acquaintances and talked to them in school a lot. Outside of school, I made an effort to as well (through Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram). Although they weren't my friends, we had some great conversations. However, in 2019, talking to anyone outside of my school was difficult for me and I quit trying to. In person was not an issue though.

One year ago, I had just finished high school and started college. I was really looking forward for a fresh start in college as I truly thought I could fit in! One problem though: this is where my social anxiety really began to shine. The first semester I talked to no one and just went to class, did work in between classes, scrolled through social media, or headed home after class. The second semester I opted to go with four classes online, one in-person and I loved it that way. I really wish it could've stayed that way.

After that semester ended, I went through a lot of reflection which brought me to where I am now. I wanted to live happier, and I figured the best way to do that would be to change my diet and cut off social media. Both have worked, but cutting off most of social media has made me feel lonelier than ever. All I got is this Reddit and a very small Instagram page with less than 20 followers (I removed plenty over the years). Other than close family, all I got is myself.

These days, I don't recognize many people. The only people I recognize are my family, the few people in college I followed on social media before my first semester began, and the few people from high school I run into from time to time (and there's one I run into occasionally: the person that may have been interested in me two years ago. They still recognize me as well). 

It's crazy that within two years, I went from being really happy with the way things were going in life to becoming lonelier than ever. I do think things will get better eventually as I'm on the right path and am only 19, so that's good. I love life, I really do, but this loneliness frustrates me and there doesn't feel like an end to it and I hate it."

I am starting to lose hope in the world that I will never be able to find friendship, I've started to accept that that's how the world is. Everyone only seems to care about themselves and only themselves and this pandemic has really shown that. Even your own relationship with a partner, I doubt anyone really ""loves"" each other because you have to constantly have sex just to get the chemicals going so you can keep pretending that they ""love"" you.  I have really lost so much hope in this world I wonder if people feel the same way or probably knows the secret of life and that is that everyone only cares about themselves and the only key to success is to accept the fate in being a doormate and allowing people to use you as much as possible.  
Maybe I am just better off alone in solitude..."

Forced at times. Adults who observed us said I’m the best sister she could ask for but evidently she disagreed and does to this day. A stranger off the street is infinitely preferable to her own sister. I have no friends and never have, she knows this, knows how it saddens me, but I’m too “freakish” for her. Too introverted, too neurodivergent, too dorky, too whatever it is she doesn’t like. 

The latest happened yesterday. Our dad to her, “Why don’t you invite your sister to (placeholder venue) next week?” Nervous laughter, half-hearted promise she doesn’t mean. When not even my own blood thinks I’m worthy, someone who knows me better than anybody else, surely that must mean the fault is mine. I don’t belong among people."

lonely,Steady wonder how I got here,"Steady wonder how I got here - For the last year I’ve had no contact other than a couple days with my ex and few texts, with anybody except my parents. A few years ago I’d never imagine life could get this lonely, those highschool friends aren’t really your friends and those relationships aren’t forever. I try to think positive and just focus on making money which is all I can really do. Sometimes I’ll get in the mood to make new friends but just get the feeling like everybody’s already doing their own thing and have their friends/groups already set. My childhood friend has a kid and is getting married soon, so I only hear from him a couple times a year which is depressing because he’s the guy I hung out with everyday and did everything with when I was younger. Sometimes I think my commitment to relationships made me sacrifice some friendships as I’m the hopeless romantic type. When I have a girl I really love, the lack of friendships don’t seem to bother me. That’s until it doesn’t work out after 2 years and I find myself 100 steps back. I always find myself wondering how my life would be if I focused on friendships instead of relationships. Some days I feel like I’m just losing my mind, like my body’s fighting against me. On a good day I’m just depressed as normal. Who knows, maybe it’s just the weed.

This morning I woke up and was scrolling through Tiktok as I do, when I came across this exotic dancer talking about how she was paid by a customer not to strip but to hold him while he cried for a half hour. That video was stitched by another woman who said it made her sad when she thinks about men not getting affection for long periods of time. 

As men we are so filled with the idea that all men want is sex that those of us who just want affection are made to feel weak. I always assumed I was alone in not necessarily wanting sex but just someone to hug me. I haven’t been hugged by someone who wasn’t a family member in almost two years. Sorry about the rant, just had to get this off my chest."

I devote my time and energy and in the end when they don't need me anymore the become distant. I hate it, everyone has a person to hang out with, I don't, no one asks me but when u ask them either they are busy or have plans with other people, I have gone with my friends only 3 times in my entire 20 year life.

Make plans with people (even if they organize it) then all of a sudden the day of, and they forgot about me.

It really sucks turning 35 and having noone love you. My family see me as a scapegoat, my friends don't remember me, and I've never been in a real relationship. The only time I've been in a ""relationship"" was when I was being scammed online with 2 romance scams. First one last year where I lost $24,000 and one earlier this year losing $70,000. I literally lost all my life savings and went into debt (first time in my life). It's so lonely and depressing being me and I wonder why I'm even alive.

lonely,Friends left me now that we are in college,Friends left me now that we are in college - Surprisingly like the vast majority of people i have known from elementary to middle to high school have come to the same college as me. When I was really young I was a lot better looking because this was before I got into a terrible bike accident and ruined my face. Became really socially awkward after that so I only stayed with the friends I had. These guys have been my only “friends” for years. At least that’s what I thought wasn’t until senior year of high school I realized I was the only one putting any effort into this relationship. I always messaged them first for a response and we never hung out outside of school. Ik stupid of me to assume they didn’t hang out outside of school without me. Anyway we are in college now and haven’t heard a word from any of them since graduation. Ik that they know I go to the same college but I guess they don’t care. Had to delete some of my social media tho it just depresses me to watch them all have fun without me. It just weird how quickly things changed I used to feel pretty included idk. My family doesn’t really care about me all that much so I feel like I have no one.

lonely,Sick of being isolated but at the core of it I hate myself?,"Sick of being isolated but at the core of it I hate myself? - I have an inferiority complex from growing up as middle class within a wealthy community, plus being shy as a kid, I was always ignored or deemed weird by people, or outright punished by teachers for being shy. I never really got over it and always subtly put myself in last place. Growing up I attracted extremely weird people who I did not even like. But in college I shed most of that and became isolated. 

Even as an adult in their 20s I still have the same feelings of being unworthy of interacting with people. Except now it's mostly feeling like I can't converse with people in a fun way and that I'm not good enough to be associated with other people. I can't seem to connect with people no matter what I do. Even the few people I have attracted as friends or who have shown some lingering interest eventually distance themselves. As someone who is successful in their career, and not weird in their interests or habits -- I don't understand why others are not flocking to me like they do everyone else. Plus I put the men I date on a pedestal, I must seem so desperate. I really want to get over this because I'm so lonely and don't want everyone hating me."

I'm again at that point where I try too hard to connect to people and am trying to figure it out..

So I want to connect, right, but because I am getting more and more needy the more time I feel disconnected from people, I am trying too hard which can be sensed by others.

So, one solution I see is to try and hide the feeling and, you know, idly stay there and be the seamingly chill person and give the other person the space to connect and open up. Doesn't sound too healthy though.

Another way is to actually accept my feelings of loneliness and somehow be chill about it. Idk how to do that though.."

All my life, I've never really been close with my family aside from my parents and sister. I was never close to my dad's side because all they care about is drama and talking shit on each other and I grew apart from my mom's side when I came out as pansexual as they are extremely homophobic, transphobic, etc.  I further grew apart from them when my mom passed away a little over 3 years ago. After that, I really only had my dad and sister (10 years older than me.) My mom was my best friend. She was who I always turned to. She was the one that comforted me when I was upset, hurt, etc. She had a lot of health issues and I always worried about her. So naturally my loneliness grew when I lost her. My dad and I had a fairly good relationship despite him being a little strict. We spoke every day and were pretty close. But I moved a year ago. As time went on we started talking less. Now, I'm lucky if I get a text from him once a week.

I was getting ready for bed and realized he hadn't responded to my text. I noticed he hadn't contacted me in a week. And it just sent me over the edge. I'm laying on bed crying. Because what did I do to be so lonely that my own father doesn't even want to talk to me? I don't have many friends. I only have one friend that i talk to regularly. And i guess that's why it's hitting me so hard. My sister is the only person that's bothered to check on me in the last week. Aside from my friend who I live with. I've also been unable to take my mood stabilizers and anti-depressants due to pain meds I'm currently on.  So my mental state is more unstable that usual. I just. I've always had my parents.

A lot of people (not all) in the comments were telling him that he's undesirable and a loser because he isn't drowning in women and saying that it's such a turn off and a red flag because he hasn't dated before. How is this guy supposed to gain experience if A) nobody gives him any. And B) crushes the guys confidence and tells him he's a loser because he isn't banging everything that moves. 

I was starting to feel optimistic about the future and decided to come up with a plan in hopes to get into dating and maybe even get a girlfriend. 

I was going to workout really hard and improve myself up until March/April time, get a new hair style, get some confidence and take a few pictures for some dating sites but what's the point? I mean, is there any point in putting in a bunch of effort if I'm just going to shot down because I don't have a bunch of notches under my belt? I guess I could just lie and say that I've had plenty of experience but I really don't want my foundation to be built on deception. 

I guess my love life is over before it even began.

lonely,"32[M4R] Nebraska/Anywhere We're safe in here. No monsters, just us.","32[M4R] Nebraska/Anywhere We're safe in here. No monsters, just us. - Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. So, a little about me and what keeps me busy: I'm a full-time student and I work as a program administrator at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That leaves little time for friendships these days. 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude because of the pandemic. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with any depth beyond something like professional acquaintances. And, I'm too trapped by the weight of my obligations and commitments to do much about it. 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'm not promising that it's even possible given how restrained I am these days. But, I'd like to try. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time and I'll try for it with what I have. I can at least promise that. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. 


Hope to hear from you!"

i’ve done this for quite a while, not sure exactly how long, but whenever i’m feeling particularly sad and can’t sleep i talk to myself out loud, and start rambling about my issues, pretending like i’m having a conversation with someone else, and that they’re asking me questions, and things.
i act like i’m in therapy, a podcast, or just talking to a close friend, anyone.
i just sit up in my bed and talk.
sometimes i cry my eyes out, other times just tell stories, express love or hatred. it can be anything.

But, I'm wasting my life. I would never harm myself but I fantasize about change. Dramatic change. Some external thing that would change my internal perception. 

So I'm playing myself. There will be no external change. I have to change. I have to choose and actively pursue something different.

I’m still trying to find myself as a person, heal from all the pain and loss I’ve experienced throughout my life, and become a better person overall. But it’s getting to a point where I don’t know if I can keep going. I really have no motivation to keep pushing through. I don’t even know what I really want to do with my life. I just want to be happy. I want to start by making some friends. Even if they are online friends. I just don’t want to feel so alone anymore. 

If you took the time to read all that, thank you so much. I appreciate that. If any of you want to talk about anything, I’m here. Have a great night everyone :) ."
lonely,My problems never change,"My problems never change - I have a journal, that looking through it since i was 14, i can see i am dealing with the same exact problems ive always been dealing with year after year. Nothing changes. Next year will be the year i turn my life around, this will be the year suddenly being normal clicks for me and i can make a bunch of friends and have a girlfriend and all this other stuff that i can only watch other people experience now. I will one day be able to live that. I will have a supportive friend group, i will go out and do stuff, i will live the life i wish i had. But years go by. I pass middle school, things dont change, i try to improve and fail, high school comes and goes, suddenly same problems as before just greatly amplified. I miss out on so many opportunities, so many things i could of done if i was just good enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

This just further alienates me from my peers as i am unable to be like them or be to anyones standards. Around the age of 16 i came up with this massive list which i could add more to today of what i will have to accomplish before asking for love and its insane. Its demoralizing. No one else has to do this much, were they born meant for love while i wasnt? Each thing is so massive to tackle. It begins to make me feel massively inferior to anyone who is in a relationship because they must of done all this plus more and i cant. After nearly a decade, i am unable to. Ive gone beyond the point of improvement and just gone to hopelessness. I am not staring into the abyss but literally inside it as it fully engulfs me. I am unable to help myself or truly stop any of my behaviors no matter how badly i wish to because its so ingrained in my personality now. Ive been dealing with so much of this stuff since i was at least 14, and thats just recorded proof, more than likely its been going on so so much longer. I just had more hope because i was younger. I wasnt out of school yet, and in my eyes i still had a future. Now i cant shake that i am a doomed loser with no redeemable qualities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also a bit off topic but i think ive mentioned in other posts that i hug myself a lot. Especially when im stressed. Its a habit i had since i was a kid. Today at work i was sitting alone outside and hugged myself because it was a bad day and some random woman caught me doing it and asked if i was cold. I said kinda, but on the inside i was embarrassed as hell. Will have to keep an eye out for people if im gonna do that."

lonely,The singles club at my high school,"The singles club at my high school - It's very likely it's one of those clubs where nothing happens for the first few days, but that club was a terrible experience for me on the first meeting. But it's also my fault for thinking and being this way.

Afterschool was the first day of the meeting and I was excited, wanting a special one, but also wanting to know people there and maybe even become friends. At the cafeteria theres just a few boys talking looking at papers. I ask them if this was the singles club and they said yes and that they are currently waiting for others to arrive.

Some more people came by and a group of girls came by too. For now THEY were talking about ideas for activities and even laughing. The girls group said they only came for food.

I stood there waiting for an activity to start. Eventually I take a seat and wait longer. Then I notice nobody actually talked to me. Not even a greeting, just that one question at the beginning. Maybe I was hidden or forgotten? I start growing impatient and more annoyed as nothing has happened and everyone else is talking except me. I start talking to myself.

As I was talking to myself I felt miserable and left out. Hearing others talking and laughing made me sad. They have something I don't. Well, I do have friends, but I feel like I need more friends. Especially a lover. I don't know why I am so demanding of myself.

Half an hour has passed, most of the girls have left. Some boys left too. I continue to talk to myself feeling depressed. I start thinking about why I even came to this meeting. I came here for a glimmer of hope, instead I got the complete opposite. I realize I still don't know how to drive and I don't have a job yet. I'm worthless. Then I start thinking about how I am unattractive to most if not all people. How I am not pleasant to talk to. I am unoriginal, uninteresting, boring, yeah you get the idea. Being self critical at this point. I keep waiting hoping something would happen. A single Hello would've been nice.

40 minutes has passed, it's 3 pm now, my time has been wasted, I decide to leave. I may have been exaggerating or being too dramatic but that was the worst experience I had to go through this school year. I felt ingored and worthless. Something could happen the next meeting but I just don't wanna do that again."

I’m trying to work on myself and it’s hard so far. Mentally and physically it’s hard on me. I’m gonna work on it and keep going. It’s just hard sometimes there’s days where I’m fine and others where I feel like everything is going wrong. I feel like I’m reminded I’m a failure, or I’m worthless. I have memories of being told that and being told I won’t amount to nothing. And that just replays in my head."

And even though I don't want to feel lonely, I don't really want to interact with people either. It kind of feels like I'm doing this to myself. I just want to find someone I click with, and I want interaction to be easy. I don't want to have to worry about meeting people and socializing, I just want to have a couple people that I can text when I'm bored and see in my classes.

lonely,I feel like my brain is trying to suffocate me,"I feel like my brain is trying to suffocate me - things definitely aint ok playboi

Ive never really been in a healthy relationship. There was one girl who treated me well, wasnt using me for anything. Its really stupid. I havent talked to her in exactly one year. We were fwb but it just happened so fast. in my defense she said some very NOT fwb things to me but it just ended so quickly. I knew it wasnt going to go anywhere outside of sex. She was just such a better person. Like a geniunely good person who deserves so much more than what I can give. The freaking newspaper wrote an article about how she helps kids for gods sake. Now shes with a guy who can give her a lot more than I can, and im happy for her. I just keep having dreams about her. I dont ask for that. I hate it. 

I like to watch youtube videos. I was in the military and have PTSD and anxiety. When I was a civilian overseas contracting a documentary came out and it was talked about at the job. ""bro you see someone get shot in the face"". People keep talking about how the documentary is crazy or whatever, and people recommended that I watch it since I was one of the only guys in there that was a combat vet of the same area the doc was shot in. I watched it. The guy who gets shot in the face is my friend. He was my fucking friend. You get to see his face as hes desperately clinging to life after getting shot in the head. Why was that even released? he was a kid, his mom could see that. Its been a while since i watched that shit ass ""documentary"", the quotation marks because its not even a documentary, its a cash grab by a combat camera kid who just did an edit of every terrible fucking thing he could record and isnt educational or informative in any way. I havent watched it in forever, maybe 2 years, but now in 2021 that kid is shilling his war porn on advertisements on youtube so I get to see it over and over. sometimes adblock doesnt work. 

Currently in a fight with the girl im ""talking to"". she said some very mean and hurtful things that I dont think can be resolved....and now Im scared to even watch fucking youtube to take my mind off of it.

lonely,Anyone else feel they got too accustomed to being alone?,"Anyone else feel they got too accustomed to being alone? - I feel like I’ve gotten too accustomed to being alone and that I don’t really know what I’m doing wrong or right when it comes to dating/making friends.

Every since college finished, I lost a lot of friends due to distance and just lack of closeness.

I’ve been single my whole life outside of a short term fling. Probably had more one night stands than actual dating experience and it sucks.

Anyways, anyone playing new world this weekend?"
lonely,I feel like I’m losing it,"I feel like I’m losing it - So for context, I’m in a relationship, have a decent friends nest, and feel like I can generally make friends.  

But there I don’t feel like any of it is real. 

I feel like I’ve ruined my relationship and all of our conversations are awkward. 

I feel like whenever I talk with friends that they just kinda tolerate me, except when it’s 1v1. Me and another. In those cases it’s usually just silence. 

And when it comes to meeting people I always feel like an awkward mess. I trip on my words and can barely keep a conversation going due to how little I actually invest time into todays pop culture stuff. 

I guess to put it simplest, I feel alone even though I’m sure most would consider that pretty sociable. I always feel like people just tolerate me."

lonely,It costs extra to be lonely,"It costs extra to be lonely - I’m in third year and spent the last two years either at home or in residence. Everyone said college would be different but it just hasn’t and I spent most of my time hiding in my room in residence or being the human equivalent of a house cat at home. 

Multiple “friends” pulled the rug out from under me these last few years for looking for houses and I left my housing search to beginning of the semester. I asked my one friend I have in this city to look at a place for me as I live far away and can’t check places out. She did but the housing folk fell through and nothing ended up happening. After a few more weeks and a few more dead-ends I decided I’d come up myself for a few days and look at places. I asked this same friend if i could crash on their couch. I didn’t get a response for days and decided to book a hotel room. They responded as I got on the Amtrak and said it would be an awkward situation because her roommates boyfriends were over and I said it was fine and that we should get dinner while I’m in town cause she did me that favour of checking the place out earlier that month.  Nothing like a date, she knows better, just me returning a favour.

Well I’m back now in my hometown. Still no response. I’m tired of people “not seeing messages” or “responding to it in their heads”, I know better and its bullshit. I’ve had three friends total over my three years of collage and they all do this shit. It’s good for a month or two and then they just stop responding. I spent my money on three days in a hotel and it all could’ve been avoided if I just HAD FRIENDS. 

So much for the best four years of your life and living with your bros and partying all the time. I’m not even that weird,  I just want to workout and watch sports and drink."

lonely,"Tad long, I just want a little advice","Tad long, I just want a little advice - I have felt isolated from those around me for a very long time. I remember when I was in elementary school and just feeling an invisible separation between me and everyone around me.

I am now around 20ish and about to graduate with a job lined up. I am generally a positive person. But every now and then loneliness hits me hard. I have people around me that I know love me. I have friends that I share interest with and can talk to. But even then I feel lonely. Whenever I try to open up about these issues, whether it be to friends, family, or therapist, I cannot. It feels like my skin is being peeled off my body.

I am just frustrated that for as long as I have known about this issue I have been unsuccessful in addressing it. I do not feel close to anyone.

I just want advice. I want to change. I just don’t want to wake up one day in another 10 years and realize that I could have done something or I had been selfish and if only been more thoughtful and considerate I could have solved the whole loneliness issue. I am just tried of putting up a facade that continues to do nothing but put more distance between me and others.

lonely,I don’t want to be here anymore,"I don’t want to be here anymore - I (25f) hate myself. I’m in grad school and live alone and I just can’t do it anymore. All I do is school and work. I have no friends here and I’ve tried hoping things would change, but I understand why no one wants to be around me. I wouldn’t if I had the choice. 

My whole life I hoped things would get better, but they only get worse. I’ve never had a boyfriend. I‘ve only had 2 people sleep with me and then stop speaking to me. I know I’m not attractive but even unattractive people deserve friends, even murderers in prison have friends and romantic relationships. Am I that bad? Am I worse than a literal murderer ? 

My depression is getting so bad I haven’t slept in 3 days. I just lie in bed crying. Trying to think of things I could do to make things better. 

But I can’t. I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m only here because it would hurt my parents and my sister, but I wish they could let me go. I wish they knew how much pain I’m in. They get to live their lives blissfully not knowing how hard it is for me. 

I’m sorry if this is disjointed and doesn’t make sense but I have no one to tell. And while everyone is having fun on a Friday night. I’m crying at my desk because my python code won’t work and I have literally nothing better to do than next weeks homework. And I can’t even do that. 

I can only hope for the day I don’t have to be here anymore and this pain goes away"

I don’t know how I could ever be happy with who I am if there hasn’t been a single point where people were happy I was there. Except unless they were using me. The very few times I’ve ever been okay with things there’s always something to bring me back down. Even at my highest point all I had to come back to was emptiness. A half hearted life that meant nothing. Still means nothing. No matter how I might try to make things better it never gets better.

While I have a decent friend group at the moment, I still feel alone as fuck.

My last relationship was shitty, and left me heartbroken and bummed as fuck for a good while. I dont want a relationship where I was quickly replaced to be the end of my romantic life.

I am not sure what I am doing wrong ***exactly,*** but I know that I have a lot of personal issues that need sorting out. I am constantly thinking about girls, and looking at hot women or people in relationships causes me emotional pain because I feel like I am missing out and that the clock is ticking.

I would consider myself asexual until I turned 20. Idk why but I started feeling so much sexual emotions towards people. It was so difficult to manage since I’ve never felt sexually towards anyone before. The worst part is, I had absolutely no one to calm my damn roller coaster. 

I compare myself to others. Sorry but i do I can’t help it sometimes. I compare my non-existing love life with my friends and it’s insane how untouched I am. They’ve done all sorts of things and it bothers me that I haven’t. Haven’t  even had my first kiss. I’m just so touch deprived and needy, but there ain’t a man insight that can give it to me the way I want it. 

I don’t like anyone I know in real life. I got a big juicy crush on one celebrity and it will never happen. No matter how many times I dream of it so I’m feeling pretty sad and needy. 

What’s worse is my mother thinks I have a boyfriend since I’ve been taking care of my appearance and I just leave the house without saying anything sometimes, but it made me really wish I had one.

I had a gf for a little over two years and it was not healthy, despite our breakup, I’m feeling more inclined in being lonely as I have now no one else to talk to everyday. All of my friends don’t’ respond to plans I suggest. I’ve already talked about the efforts I make to see them and the results I desired aren’t there. I just have no one by my side to talk to about how the day went and what’s going on. Mixed in with how I’m not close with my family and online dating for men can bring one’s self esteem down. But do not fret, please hold your dismayed comments as I am leaving my home city and onward to a better place in a few months.

lonely,:(.,":(. - none of this may even make sense so i’m not too sure why i’ve come on here to vent, in all honesty. everything is just awful. im getting upset at school again, im getting upset at home constantly, and i cant seem to escape this feeling. i went out with friends tonight, had some drinks and food and thought it was great. the end of the night ruined it, and it’s really really gotten to me. i cant stop thinking about how much of a prick i probably was from the other persons perspective. why am i like this? why do i put myself in bad situations? i just went home and cried, i feel utterly worthless at the minute and i cant shake the feeling. i have to get assessed for mental health problems soon, in the upcoming weeks ahead, with a CAMHS referral, i was self h@rming, along with some other things. the sheer thought of it is really overwhelming me and i cant stop thinking about what i’m gonna say at this meeting. i try and look for the positives but even my friends are being negative towards me now, they’re making really harsh jokes and i cant cope with it. it effects me deeper than it should and it’s a shit feeling. i try opening up to people and letting them know “hey, i’m struggling, would u mind NOT saying this?” but it’s so hard to do. I don’t have the balls. Day to day tasks are becoming hard to do. I have no motivation anymore. I’m loosing passion for things i enjoy. Nothing is going right for me at the minute and i really wish i wasn’t alive anymore."
lonely,What are some fun things to do alone on birthday?,"What are some fun things to do alone on birthday? - It’s my birthday today and I’m pretty much lonely, how can I enjoy my day alone?

lonely,"Its not that I want friends, I'm just incredibly bored and totally aimless","Its not that I want friends, I'm just incredibly bored and totally aimless - money is a funny thing, you say you dont care about it and yet you keep saving it and you get scared if it goes below a certain percentage. This is all so stupid. Money for the sake of money is the main driver behind all of my actions. 

I havent had friends in a over a decade and I'm not sure I want them anymore either. I have never had interest in having a relationship or sex. I dont understand what else is there for me to care about. I do try to be positive, even if it doesnt seem like it, I'm thankful for being healthy and able bodied but the aimless wont go away and it gnaws.

what the fuck happenned in the course of history that made the one and most important purpose in reality to amass the greatest amount of materials before you die?

WHY do I even keep working? What is a career and why should I want one? why did I wake up today and not yesterday? 

why do i do all these things that dont give satisfaction and are the consequences of not doing them really that bad or is it the people around me who are going to punish me? 

How many of these people do I have to kick out of my life before I begin to struggle to survive? 

I dont want to be homeless and starve that much I know. How terrible for life to be reduced to a stick and no carrot"

3 WEEKS AND ALL I TO WAS AN IDK, LIKE BITCH IT DONT TAKE 3 WEEKS TO THINK OF A YES OR NO ANSWER. It took so much fucking courage to ask her out and this has made my self confidence (the little that I had) drop so much man. I was nice to her, took an interest in her life and everything and she rubs it off like she gets asked out 10 times a day. Gotta be careful boys, those girls are sneaky."
lonely,My plan sadly worked,"My plan sadly worked - , my first time posting here. So I decided to put my birthday on Facebook be hidden so the birthday notification won't pop up for other people (I know it's all fake when they greet me there anyways) and once I did this I knew immediately there wouldn't be a lot of people that would say happy birthday to me and that came to life I guess. My birthday was on September 20 so a couple weeks have passed and I think only five people greeted me that day, one knew about my birthday and messaged me and the other four are my online friends and two of them didn't even know lmao we been talking for years (they still cool though, at least they greeted me through message). I wanted to do that because social media is all about fake happiness (for me), How are you gonna tell happy birthday to me if you're gonna scroll down and forget about it later? Are you really a friend or are you just keeping me for your own self interest? You remember me when you need something but ignore me when I'm not of use to you, how convenient for you. 

I treated that day as any normal day since I knew that the moment I become optimistic/hopeful that I'll get greetings I'll be disappointed. Last time it happened on graduation day as well about half a year ago I think, I became hopeful and I wanted to get some congratulations on my friends but I didn't receive anything, what the heck.

Idk if this sounds like an a-hole thing to do and of course it's my fault I wouldn't receive a lot of greetings but in my eyes it shows that no one really cares about you unless a notification pops up so now you had to say something fake as heck and act like you didn't ghost your friend for a few months or years."
lonely,"Feeling depressed and/or anxious? Interested in trying a free, online intervention?","Feeling depressed and/or anxious? Interested in trying a free, online intervention? - \[mod approved\] I'm reaching out to communities of people who may be experiencing feelings of depression and/or anxiety and who might be interested in participating in a brief, online, self-guided intervention. This study (detailed below) examines an intervention adapted from a lengthier treatment shown to effectively reduce symptoms of a range of anxiety and depressive disorders. Feel free to share with anyone in need.

\----------------------

For my doctoral dissertation, I am examining two brief online self-help interventions to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. **Anyone over the age of 18, residing in the United States, and fluent in English is welcome to participate in this online study**; however, if you are currently experiencing severe depression, especially if you are feeling hopeless or having thoughts of suicide, I encourage you to seek treatment with a provider you can interact with.

If you choose to participate in this study, you will be asked to complete a few surveys and then you will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a video intervention, a text-based intervention, or an assessment-only group. The intervention should take you roughly 2 hours depending on how often you pause the video or how quickly you read. No matter which group you are in you will be asked to complete surveys at four follow-up periods after you first sign up, around 2, 4, and 6 weeks, with a final one in 6 months. These will take between 10 and 20 minutes to complete. **After the 6 week follow-up**, those in the assessment-only group will have access to both the video and text interventions. **After the 6-month follow-up**, those in the intervention groups will have access to whichever intervention they did not already have. All participants will be able to use these interventions until December of 2022. This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Central Michigan University.

lonely,the weekends are nightmare for me,the weekends are nightmare for me - I mean I'm just setting At home playing games reading a book watching some shows and that's all ..&amp; what come with that is I'm really fell completely comfortable with the situation it's like i use to it..
lonely,Do you ever imagine scenarios in your head where you feel accepted?,Do you ever imagine scenarios in your head where you feel accepted? - When I wake up in the morning I pretend there’s someone there next to me. At work most people don’t even talk back so I talk with the voices in my head. At home I watch YouTube videos for hours on end just to pretend I’m in the scene living a normal life. All this just to drain out the pins and needles in my brain reminding me that most people I see everywhere don’t even have to try to be friendly and everyone flocks to them just because they were born the “right” way.
lonely,i fear growing up,"i fear growing up - I have felt lonely for the majority of my life, and i was truly lonely for a while. I have friends i guess but i don’t feel like they truly care. i want someone to love me eternally and unconditionally. i don’t know what that kind of love feels like. It’s a friday night and I’m curled up in my bed holding back tears while everyone else is out having fun with friends. I honestly feel like true friendship doesn’t exist. Others are friends with you for their own individual pleasure, i’m guilty of doing this too, we all do. it’s just that i wish i could form a special connection with somebody, not necessarily romantic. i want to find someone i can spend my time with and know that they’ll be forever by my side, no matter how i look, behave or act. I know that this feeling will get worse with time, older people don’t make friends as easily and if u don’t have a solid friend group by 25, you’ll probably never get one. the worst comes at a later age, let’s say 70 and upwards. you SO has passed away, that is, if u manage to find someone that wanted to spend they rest of their life with you, your parents are dead, you don’t go to work anymore which means you can’t talk to other coworkers, you don’t have any friends and literally nobody gives a shit because no one cares about the elderly. The only human being you speak to is the cashier when buying groceries. you then return home where no one is there to greet you, you sit on the couch and simply wait for the time to pass. truly miserable"

The girl who didn't care about anything and just lived her life, which was for me studying and getting good grades and making my indian parents proud. It wasn't hard, I liked it. But now, life has gotten too complicated and I have never been this low.. I care too much, I love too much, I think too much, I feel too much and all this has been a curse.

lonely,I am surrounded by many people but I feel lonely,"I am surrounded by many people but I feel lonely - *Throwaway because of the things I use my main account for.

I'm an 18yo guy, I have a good family (two parents, one brother and one sister), a LOT of friends (real ones, but people who always help me if I ask for something), but when I am alone during my daily routine I feel so fucking lonely.

I started university's lessons a week ago, met many new people and made some new friends, but nothing can fill the sense of emptiness I feel inside me every time I'm alone.

I don't even think about it until I'm alone, so most of the time I try to distract myself hanging out with other people or doing something that makes me not think about this (playing videogames, reading, watching a movie...), but sometimes I cannot do it and I start remembering that I am completely alone and that nobody really cares about me, not even my family. The only people who cared now are dead or too far to meet them.

I feel like I never really got included in any group (my family doesn't really accept me because I'm slightly different than their expectations, my friends because I don't like football and talking about bullshit as much as they do)

I'm here drinking a beer and smoking a cigarette to occupy my time until it's time to go to bed, and then tomorrow, the day after and after...

I'm looking for any advice from someone who felt like that and now feels better, but any suggestions is good I think, I need help but I'm not strong enough to talk to somebody I know about this (also because I don't trust anyone that much and because I don't feel confident talking about this face to face with other people).

I have grown a crippling social anxiety. I am alone, I feel alone. I don't know what to do and it is paining me in a way that is tearing me apart. I can't simply go back to my country, it doesn't work that way, I can't leave my husband behind. And it pains him too to see me so depressed but he can't get me friends. His friends are assholes.

lonely,Coming to terms with not being able to hang out with people all the time,"Coming to terms with not being able to hang out with people all the time - Look guys, it’s friday, and i have work, and no plans after work, except to come home and sit in my cold dark room and do nothing. how do i enjoy it? I have no idea. 

I first want to say and offer encouragement to those who are really struggling out there. my experiences with loneliness have severed with the progression of my drug addiction. obviously, i now realize now that i am sober, that people don’t want to hang out with people who smoke meth and opiates off tin foil. i had no friends and talked to no one, and never left my bedroom, unless it was to get drugs or go to work so i could feed my habit. i was severely depressed and didn’t love myself, so it was impossible to sit with myself sober. drugs became my company. 

but anyways, still today i’m not fully capable of loving myself. i’ve made improvement. i got on tinder and bumble, i’ve had several dates and have even had the opportunity to have sex, which was a huge milestone from where i was a year ago. BUT, i feel like i’m using people as a distraction from myself. the thought of being by myself makes me sad, and the thought of coming home tonight without any plans after work also makes me sad. it is so hard to sit with myself, that sometimes i find myself desperately scratching at whoever i can that i can get to do something with me, almost like i’m some desperate cat clinging onto fabric for dear life. 

I know this may not be the best place to ask this question since many of you probably feel the exact same way and have no idea on how to break through into the shattering sunlight of happiness, but: how do you feel okay when you are alone? how do you take a friday night with no plans and turn it into something that isn’t depressing? again,  i know this may not be the best place for this question, but i had no idea which other subreddits to ask. thank you and i bid you all the strength to hang in there!!!"

When I do bring something up I get shut down immediately, talking about negative things is forbidden, ""you just get over it and stop being a baby"". I'm feeling like a ghost, I truly can't describe how painful this feels.



I sincerely resent my parents for making me. They brought me to a world that is cold and mechanical. Where the only thing that matters is money and achievements; where love does not exists; where there is no joy and no belonging.



I feel like it fucked me hard in terms of friendships as well. Because I'm programmed to satisfy others and not be myself(that's forbidden). I've only made fake friends because of this, you can't make friends without being authentic.

lonely,Embracing the Emptiness,"Embracing the Emptiness - I have been thinking a lot lately about my connection to others. I don't think I ever really felt like my peers understood me, and even around friends I have always felt isolated. As though everyone else can form these connections but I am alone in my head. It has been that way for as long as I can remember. I have since been intimate both emotionally and physically with others, but I still to this day feel isolated, on my own little thought island. I like my island, it is lush and vibrant and full of amazing fantasies and ideas. It only has one drawback...it is so lonely here. I am 25 now and I still feel as though no one really understands me. This used to be okay because I was ambitious and intelligent, I could outshine others so being understood didnt matter, I waw effective. But I feel my mind slipping more the older I get. I make silly mistakes at work and fall into bad habbits. Ambition has given way to complacency. My self esteem is lower than it has ever been and I find myself self concious about every little movement or action I make. I have just about given up on others being able to truly connect with me and I am no longer at the top of my game performance wise.

lonely,What I’ve learned and dealing with disconnection (Mental illness and suicide ideation warning),"What I’ve learned and dealing with disconnection (Mental illness and suicide ideation warning) - Ok so I am in my 20’s and I have never had an actual romantic relationship.

No bigee it’s fairly normal at my age.

But my experiences have highlighted things about my myself I didn’t realize as well learn valuable lessons about engaging with other people.

A key part to this is emotional trauma I have had (to keep the story short, my mom stabbed me in the back after she got divorced and loved a random guy she met over me causing me to have to leave my house and live with my dad)

During that time I made my first female friend (I am born male but genderfluid she is still confused with her identity.)

She opened me up emotionally and from that point forward I was never the same and became more and more neurotic, leading to suicide ideation, random fits of driving around in attempts to escape stressful situations, self harm thoughts and other problems of which she helped support me through the darkest pits of depression.

She’s my best friend and I confessed romantic feelings to her some years back thought she didn’t feel that way. We are still close friends and we are open and honest with each other even admitting jealousy whenever she would have a girlfriend or be interested in a guy yet not being ready to start anything.

I knew that just because she had good relationships with others didn’t mean it harmed our relationship but even so I still had attachment issues due to my own mom throwing me to the wayside.

I’ve had a lot of mental health issues and periodically still have these dark fantasies with people I know of doing violent and sadistic acts, having people fear for myself as I self mutilate or inflict pain upon them.

I also got with a genderfluid coworker that went by she/her and she was neurodivergent like me and we clicked very well almost scarily well. 

I only got to hang out with her outside of work twice before she left the state we were in due to getting a free house from her grandmother and wanting to start anew in life.

I wasn’t able to maintain contact with her but with the little time we did meet and text each other we were very close and she gave me new confidence in myself because she was the one who wanted to be with me though she was not looking for romance due to trauma she suffered from abusive assholes. She also had problems with BPD and ADHD. I loved her and she was really interested in me.

At this point I know I am an ambivert but I am worried about my fits of mental illness and fantasies that cloud how I look at myself. I know that I am a person a lot of people tend to like but I worry that if I become too emotionally attached to others they will leave me and forget I even exist throwing me into a spiral of mental escapism and fantasy. I can function normally in my life but I still suffer from these emotional issues. Ik that I will find someone who loved me that way but I am afraid to fuck it up due to my trauma and creeping mental problems. I also suffer from chronic existential struggle with my life.

I wanted to get some perspective from other people on if they experience similar things or if they want to ask more specific details in my case. I would happy to talk with all of you!"

lonely,i was supposed to find someone,"i was supposed to find someone - i dont know why, i just know that good things were supposed to happen and they didnt

i was supposed to be happy, i was supposed to be enough

everything was gonna be amazing, i would be the one going on dates and meeting knew places and having fun, not being stuck here having to take care of someone that only makes bad decisions

i could've been so happy, someone could've actually cared if im alive or not

i've always wanted to go on a date and just have fun and feel loved

it'd be nice to have someone to hug and give little kisses to

last year should've been different, i should've gone on dates, i should've had sleepovers where we watched romantic movies and ended up talking until 3am just thinking that that was it, that was perfection and true happiness

it's always been just me, since i was young it was always me...and i thought, finally that was gonna change, finally i was gonna find someone that understood me, finally i wouldnt have to go through all this shit by myself...i just wanted someone that actually wanted to get to know me and care about me...someone whom to share hobbies and do fun things with, maybe even plan a life together...but i guess i ruin everything

what if that was it? my only chance at love, and now, nothingness forever

New town. Boring. Not many friends. What am I doing here?

So I asked this girl out, but she said she was not thinking about a romantic relationship now. Thats still optimistic because it is not a ""no"" right? Well, not really. We used to talk and message for longer, now, feels like I lost the magic. I can not initiate long talks, and whenever I ask about her day or how is she doing in general and whatnot, it seems like I am just annoying her. 

She said she was surprised that I asked her out, and said she really doesn't wanna break my heart, but, she isnt ready for a relationship (almost the exact words). But her actions make it look like she is not interested in me.

Now, I am just stuck in this shittiest mood for two weeks, where I am just stuck continuously thinking what to do. Should I talk to her more? Should I talk less? Should I try to forget her? Should I not do anything? Anyone with any idea what is to be done now? Anyone can help me get out of this mood of constantly thinking about her? Because it is really annoying and I can not work or study properly."

I told him dad but both of them are A's but he counter argued and said it isn't full marks it's not enough. I had gotten 40/40 in my social studies but he didn't even praise me on those he compared and discredited me he things for my future only science and maths are the important subjects he doesn't even knows interests hobbies and spent little to no time with me I tried my best to make him proud but I always fail.

lonely,Worst year of my life... 17(M),"Worst year of my life... 17(M) - I turned 17 a week ago. I made a decision last year that i'm gonna change everything about myself that i've didn't liked. Now it's october and i'm laying in my bed holding back my tears. I feel like i've improved so much as a person. I've managed to discover who i am really and what should i change. I've never had a proper relationship. My ex gf dumped me after 4 days. That was in november. In march we started to talk again and we played the same game again. That was the point when i've decided that i wanna change. I felt so stupid, and naive, but i've wanted to change that. But what happened was that i've started a bunch of shit which i've didn't finished. At summer i felt even worse, and i spent the whole summer break laying in my bed and trying to sleep as much as i can just to break up with reality. I've played a lot video games like 10-12 hours a day, and i felt worse by every day passing. When school started i've decided to leave all my insecurities behind and be as social as i can. Turned out i can't find anyone who i can really connect with as a friend. I had only one friend and i've shared everything with her. But in the past couple weeks i've noticed that if i don't aproach her, she don't approach me neither. And the worst feeling was seeing that the only person who considered me as her best friend (i'm an heavy introvert and she's extrovert btw) get along with others much better. I've tried out if i don't talk with her will she gonna talk with me. We haven't talked since 2 weeks... Now i have nobody to talk to and i spend my days in my room wanting to run off somewhere far away and start everything again. My parents always argue about something and there is always tension between them, which doesn't help at all. I'm missing out so much, but nobody invites me anywhere, i would really like to go out somewhere, but i don't have anywhere to go. I'm wasting my best years and i know that i'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. I really want to be that rocker guy with his guitar who is loved by everyone and always goes out somewhere, but since i'm an introvert my social battery is a piece of crap and i can't even keep up a conversation with someone. I literally don't have anything to say. I know that i havea great personality and i have higher iq and eq than the avarage. I'm emotional as a guy and i cry very easily but i don't think that this is a bad thing. I feel a bit better now that i can write down everything that i feel, but i don't know what should i do with myself. Others see me as a cold and a logical guy who lives in his own world and doesn't need anyone to be happy, meanwhile i could die for a hug. I'm not an attractive guy i don't get any attention from girls. I'm skinny and tall which don't go along really well. I can't find any hairstyle that suits me and since i've got glasses i look kinda gay with that and my hair and i hate that. (I don't have any problems with gay people that's not the point)That takes away so much from my confidence. I hate to look at myself. Now i'l start everything again. I'l start by customizing my room so i can feel much more comfortable at home. After that i'm gonna change my looks. I try out a new hair, glasses and i change my clothes cuz they look kinda boring. After that i'l start to make efforts to improve my communication and i'm gonna find people who i can really connect with don't matter how introvert i am. It's just so hard. I really wanna learn how to love myself and my appearance. If anyone got any advice feel free to share it, if anyone wanna talk with me you can dm me😁 Sorry for my bad english😅 I will edit this post so i can track my progress and maybe i can motivate others too. If i can motivate a single person than i'l be more than happy😀"

I have been away from my home and my family and friends for about 2 and a 1/2 the 3 years. And it feels like I have been the only one trying to put forth an effort to stay connected with them.

my parents think i'm friends with someone. but they fucking left me and they don't care anymore. i have no one to talk to. nobody cares that i'm alone. they have everything and they left me with nothing. i just don't know anymore. i don't want to go on like this.

lonely,I cut things off with a woman I really care about…,"I cut things off with a woman I really care about… - I’ve heard it said by someone in the past that: if you find someone perfect, leave them alone. Because you’ll just ruin them. 

I’m pretty sure their point was that there is no such thing as a perfect person. But I came to realize that in a relationship, she would make me better, but I would make her worse. It shouldn’t be that way. 

I have horrible, awful attachment issues. I’m terrified of being abandoned and get separation anxiety. I am *so* much better than I used to be, but my neediness and clinginess showed through a few too many times, and she put up a wall. She said she couldn’t be my therapist, and that she didn’t want a relationship with someone who needed attention like I did. 

So I just told her it was better to stop things. From her perspective it seemed like I was just rolling my eyes, saying “well fine then” to her putting up those walls. I wouldn’t say it like that. It was just that when she *did* put up those walls, everything came it to perspective. 

I knew I couldn’t trust myself to be a good boyfriend. She clearly deserved better than me. And the fact that walls *were* being put up just wasn’t a good sign for the relationship as a whole I thought. So I just…ended it. 

It’s eaten me up. She thinks I just bailed because I hate for not putting out or something. And that’s not the case. But I still don’t know if I was 100% right to do what I did. I’ve been so miserable the past few days because I lost someone who really cared about me and really understood me in a way most people don’t. I hate myself and what I do. 

Edit: I want to add that I am in fact working on attachment issues. I used to be much worse than I am now. I say this in case people are concerned about what sort of person I am."

lonely,Hello Far Away People!,"Hello Far Away People! - I am alone with my thoughts. No one wants to hear them and if they do, they wouldn't understand. It's too much to convey at once anyways. Empathy and compassion are nice things and I am glad it exists in the world no matter how insignificant it all may seem. This is me sharing.

My friends and family are all gone for one reason or another; differences in opinion these days or a result of my own isolation. I act like I have agoraphobia, but that would be a misunderstanding. All it would take would be one person to get me out of the house; but the truth after all the years alone is that no one wants to or would like to. They might say they do, but do not want to. One might even want to, but not want to spend the time or effort. I justify this in others as I would myself; I will just be alone again when they are gone or are tired of me.

I get that everyone has their own lives to live. Everybody has something. I have one person I talk to that offers me empathy and compassion that I can count on. They are all that I have left. If or when I should lose them my life will change. I will have utterly no one. 

I wished I had known this was going to happen when I was younger because I would have prepared. The more I feel pushed away; the more I push myself away. The more I feel unwanted; the more unwanted I make myself feel. I have made life choices to ensure I never bother anyone or I never feel like I need someone. I basically made it so I almost never have to meet a soul to hurt or be hurt by.

It started a long time ago. All my friends and family got married, careers, etc... and I just got pushed away; no one has time for any of it. So I got a job at night and moved very far away from them all to a beautiful place that is isolated. It worked great. Family and friends were always happy to see me visit like once a year for a very short while. What I did not realize is that by doing that I had become estranged. They see and maybe feel that disconnection that we or I created. It is awkward at the very least.

I confirm to myself every time I try to contact or visit friends and family for that short while once or twice a year that I just stress everyone out. They talk about how they will have to rearrange their schedule to make time, they may have to place some condition or just a general expression of some sort of stress about my visit. I take this very hard. I don't want to be a stress or bother so I do the very bare minimum and of course, this backfires into a mess during and after the visit because of how short we all made it.

I have put myself in a very safe place away from any harm, in my own self-isolation for many many years. It's not getting any better though. It will get worse enough I am afraid to isolate myself even further. I have thoughts of selling everything here and moving even further away to a place even more beautiful without any people at all. And in some weird way, justify my existence by allowing nature to take me if it won't let me survive.

This world will not go out with a bang. It will go out with a whimper."

lonely,I don't think I'm meant to have friends,"I don't think I'm meant to have friends - My mind really wants me to be lonely. I've ghosted everybody except for my family, and most recently my last friend. Everything was going well, we were texting but it got to the point where I started to dread hearing that notification. It felt unbearable trying to keep a conversation, and I don't know why. Now they're gonna probably feel like shit and think they did something wrong"
lonely,It's An Opportunity,"It's An Opportunity - \[24/M\] 

Many of us may be very lonely-- especially given the isolation many of us have had to deal with over the past while. I feel it's healthier to view it as an opportunity for self-improvement and to be kind to oneself.

I don't want to go on about my own life story here, but I will say that while certain circumstances have led to me being single-- and lonely for other reasons-- perpetually, I'd rather try to get some good out of my time in this state. 

I'm trying to get fit, I'm engaging with my hobbies, and I'm being kind to myself. (Occasional treats, gifts, etc. every once in a while).

If I **really** need it and am in the depths of despair, I put on some music I like and write a journal entry. It helps me to calm down, and sometimes rethink things or learn about myself.

Believe me, I'd like to introduce myself to the sub, but that would take to long. Being a ""good writer""-- apparently-- means that I tend to go on for ages. Having done most of a philosophy degree, I also therefore tend to go on for ages and try to revisit points. E.g. everything I write, even if it's casual, comes out like I'm trying to write an airtight philosophical essay. Haha.

I just can't switch that off, so if I'm meant to write about my circumstances relevant ot my lonliness, it'd be a long-ish post. To be sure.

But that's me, and I'm sure many are the same way. No doubt.

\-----I'll try to sum up:

\-Never been employed.

\-Never been in a relationship. Three dating site accounts; no luck. I never hear back.

\-Live at home.

\-Anxious, chronically, severely depressed, **really bad** agoraphobia for all of my adult life thus far.

\-Only child.

\-Two friends but barely see or talk to them-- even in the ""Before Times"".

\-Having to drop out of school the end of this semester for personal reasons-- even though I'm **so close** to getting my degree.

\-----Positive points:

\-Aspiring musician; getting quite good with keyboard, still learning guitar, and would like to learn violin. (Have one but can't play it for reasons). I have a Soundcloud and am building a professional presence online.

\-I write poetry and occasionally I write philosophical things for fun... Would like to write short stories eventually.

\-I love my music, so I more-or-less collect it. I have about 80+ CDs now! (Not sure about a few of 'em, though..)

\-I try to get in my workout every day; I can do 115 push-ups now, for example.

\-I like cleaning and cooking.

That's all for now. It's frustrating that I'm so alone, but I have all these other things I'm \*trying\* to do with my life that some days I don't really notice. It's bad for the mental health to dwell upon that. To want something which is out of one's control. Learning to not care-- to ""zen out""-- or to accept it and be proactive with an acceptable solution-- the real meaning of stoicism-- is kind of how I approach it.

Being interested in romance stuff and gothic stuff, though, I admit I \*do\* get melodramatic like either Angel or Dracula over my lack of a partner. Haha.

That's me for now, however.

Thank you for your time and be well."

I've been holding back tears all day,checking my phone to see if i got any messages but nope, i have zero friends and its kinda my fault for isolating myself."
lonely,I keep looking back (M 29),"I keep looking back (M 29) - I left her in another state after getting back together to try and fix our 5 1/2 year relationship because I needed to make sure my parents wouldn't lose their minds, but because I thought I no longer had any idea of the concept to what this commitment entailed. I knew I would be lonely returning to my parent's house, but it isn't the same after you try to make a future with someone. There are plenty of friends here, but it seems no one wants to try and make new connections so I feel like no one is available for certain desires, except her.
She would immediately take me back in a heartbeat, but that same beat breaks my own heart because I would not take her back because of our history. I knew what I was getting into when I decided to drive across the U.S. to start a new life with her 6 years ago, but I never imagined meeting another man she had previous relations with to approve letting her have sex with him when I was too busy with work to satisfy her. I recently realized it's still a fresh wound regardless that it was 3 years ago because I set one rule: not in our bed. She broke that rule almost a month after my approval. I immediately cut her off.
I don't really understand at that time why I didn't just retreat to my parent's home, but now I do. When one person is guaranteeing their unwavering love for the rest of their life it is difficult to be on the receiving end especially given the circumstances. It's hard to not look at where I am now and imagine what I could have being with her again.
I looked back again today. I felt it all over again. I suppose I could at least be happy that I didn't have to hear my Dad yelling at my Mom for being drunk."

lonely,"""is there anything you like about yourself?""","""is there anything you like about yourself?"" - No, theres not. There is no reason to be ok with any part of myself at all. I am a weak pathetic man, no woman wants that at all. No woman wants someone who is probably shorter than her and about as weak. No one wants someone who has no idea what they are doing in life. People tell me i have so much money saved up, and i have such a good credit score for my age. But none of that matters. No one gives a shit about any of that. Im not 16 or 18 even anymore. I am almost into my mid 20s. There are dudes who are making 100k a year by now and have actual careers. I just cook food. Nothing to offer. 

And i know i could self improve. But fuck  that. Fuck my body, fuck anything about me, the pathetic piece of shit. I hope i one day die so fucking hard i can never come back. I hope i die early. I dont want to improve my life because i fucking hate i am still breathing. I stay physically active due to my hobbies and my job, i still hate myself. I still dream of one day being able to watch myself get my own head blown off with a shotgun or something. What an amazing sight that would be, to see such a waste of oxygen get removed from the earth. For now, i will only torture my body tell it screams out for a relief that maybe one day will come. When i get naked to take a shower i can already see the pain in my body that is caused by sometimes just starving myself because i am too angry to eat. Even the pills that used to help me no longer work. 

So no, there is nothing i like about myself. I will always be inferior, and i will always be nothing. I will never get to experience living a real happy life. Sometimes its almost too much to talk to my parents because i am so angry they brought me here and put the burden of leaving on me."

It’s been half a decade now and I’ve only had myself this entire time. I am incredibly sad and feel like the best times of my life are behind me. 


For some reason all the people I meet are so uppity. It’s like all of the people in my area/community think they are better than me. 
They already have friend groups and know a bunch of people so they don’t need someone new and “quirky” to be around them.

lonely,I don't fit in with anyone,"I don't fit in with anyone - All the way back in first grade, I met another dude in my class who we'll call Joe. We instantly became best friends, and since we lived half a mile away from each other, practically every weekend for years was filled with visits to the others house. In middle school I didn't have many friends, I didn't fit in anywhere. As a result, I followed around Joe and his friends for a few years. Joe hung out with the other ""popular"" kids, who I didn't click with, but I always clicked with Joe, and Joe always treated me well. Going into 8th grade, the last year before high school, I started to click with some people, and I had a small friend group for the first time ever between Joe and a few others. Now, being that these people were the ""popular"" kids, they started smoking and doing drugs around this time. I have no care for trying that, but my mindset is that as long as people treat me/others nicely, I don't mind if you smoke. Then came freshman year, where I met a decent amount of new friends from different schools in my classes, and it was awesome. For the first time ever I felt like people cared about me, and I cared about a lot of my friends. However, Covid would cut my freshman year short, leading to online school. For my sophomore year, the school district gave each student the option to either continue virtual instruction, or we could switch to in person. Many people, including a lot of my friends, switched to in person, but I stayed virtual. This meant that I went an entire year without seeing anyone else from school, and if you think about it, it was actually around a year and a half. Junior year began last month, and I didn't have any classes with my few friends. Furthermore, since I chose virtual instruction, I missed a year of socialization and of growth. Everyone else continued to bond together and build friendships, while I was stuck at home. At this point, people have already formed their friend groups from last year while I'm still stuck at Freshman year. I have no one who I can fit in with, people have moved on. Everyone who I used to hang out with has formed a deep friend group, and I don't have many classes with them either. This leads me back to Joe, who is in lower classes than me so I don't see him much, but we are still good friends and he treats me nicely. He has driven me home a few times along with his other friends and they've been smoking in the car, which I don't mind. As long as they treat me/others well, then they can smoke, I don't care. This moment got me thinking about how I don't fit in with everyone, I don't have any friend groups, or even many friends. Everyone else, including Joe, has formed their own friend groups, made their own friends, and I was left behind. It's like the car drove off without me. In addition, I'm terrible at socializing, and I can't hold conversations. The few people who would be willing to make new friends I'm either not interested in, or I can't hold a conversation. Everyone else is having fun, hanging out, and I go to the football games like I did a few years ago, but now with no one. I'm alone. I don't fit in with anyone."

and the salt on the wound is knowing there’s nothing you can do about it - you cannot force feelings that aren’t there, you just have to accept that they don’t feel the same anymore and move on, which is difficult in its own right especially if you think about what it was like when they were interested and dating you, or even interested in general.

Not once, but 5 times, all of them. Mind you I'd try to back off at that point if we're still together, but then it turns into ""I don't think I'm the person for you, or I'm not ready for a relationship right now"" either which every time.

This last time it was my ex randomly telling me over a year and a half after us breaking up that yesterday, because he woke up to 4 messages from me (1 news article, 2 memes and one was just asking what almond milk he buys) that it was overwhelming for him, and of course it brought up all this past defeat, and burned me worse than before because I thought he was THE ONE who would never say it.

He said it. I'm 5/5 at this point. What am I doing so wrong? One second it's why do you message me so much, I go quiet ""What's wrong? Somethings off?""

I can't win, and it's normal to send content/memes where you find it no? (INSTA, Twitter, Facebook, snap, etc.. so that's why it was 4 seperate over the span of """"2 hours"" he quoted.

I'm so hurt, and I feel like I'm going to be alone forever because I'd rather not just risk being told to shut up again when I'm just excited to share my life and things I find with someone.

I'll be quiet for now tho, thanks 💬"

Thanks for stopping by my post!

I'm looking for meaningful connections, not just chit chat, so:

&amp;#x200B;

For me, it's important that you don't drink, smoke or do drugs, that you're a feminist and that you're an empathetic person.

&amp;#x200B;

If you check all three, feel free to send me a message!

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about me:

&amp;#x200B;

\-I like drawing, music, science, maths, art in general, I like playing videogames too as long as they're not sexist, which is pretty hard to find sadly. I like a lot old point and click adventures, and fantasy games in general.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I like partying all night, but not the parties most people have, for me a party would be music, karaoke, some board games and maybe some games on retro Pie, nice food and some fruit juices, all night long, maybe go out to see the sunrise at a high places that feels special.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I like board games, table top rpgs, poetry and much more!

&amp;#x200B;

\-I speak English, Spanish and Italian.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I don't like dark humor, or videos where people get hurt, or stuff like that, I don't like people suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I have depression and a couple more mental illnesses.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I'm disabled rn

lonely,19F nobody seems to want long lasting friendships/relationships,"19F nobody seems to want long lasting friendships/relationships - I find it so hard these days to find someone who genuinely wants to be your friend and actually stick around, everyone seems to talk to you a few hours or weeks and disappear and if sucks because I want a long lasting friendship and can’t seem to find it anywhere I’ve tried it all online and travelling it’s so depressing 


Dating is so hard when your not looking for teenage fun or short lasting relationships, it seems to me 90% of people only want temporary things and it sucks for someone who wants something serious, as a romantic I find dating impossible and it’s depressing. 

But with that said I’m not going to complain if like minded people want to be friends or something as It would be nice to have long term friends."

I'm like a walking black hole, a parasite, and at the end of the day, when I'm all alone, and I only have my own energies to feed off of, I hit new lows. The distractions are good but never last.

Alas, I'll be taking myself out of the equation soon. I can't live the life THEY want. that's the problem. they GAVE ME THESE DREAMS. to become self sustainable financially. find my own place. find a ""soul-mate"". work my entire life, then die with this person.

lonely,"I don't fit in with anyone, I'm so damn lonely","I don't fit in with anyone, I'm so damn lonely - All the way back in first grade, I met another dude in my class who we'll call Joe. We instantly became best friends, and since we lived half a mile away from each other, practically every weekend for years was filled with visits to the others house. In middle school I didn't have many friends, I didn't fit in anywhere. As a result, I followed around Joe and his friends for a few years. Joe hung out with the other ""popular"" kids, who I didn't click with, but I always clicked with Joe, and Joe always treated me well. Going into 8th grade, the last year before high school, I started to click with some people, and I had a small friend group for the first time ever between Joe and a few others. Now, being that these people were the ""popular"" kids, they started smoking and doing drugs around this time. I have no care for trying that, but my mindset is that as long as people treat me/others nicely, I don't mind if you smoke. Then came freshman year, where I met a decent amount of new friends from different schools in my classes, and it was awesome. For the first time ever I felt like people cared about me, and I cared about a lot of my friends. However, Covid would cut my freshman year short, leading to online school. For my sophomore year, the school district gave each student the option to either continue virtual instruction, or we could switch to in person. Many people, including a lot of my friends, switched to in person, but I stayed virtual. This meant that I went an entire year without seeing anyone else from school, and if you think about it, it was actually around a year and a half. Junior year began last month, and I didn't have any classes with my few friends. Furthermore, since I chose virtual instruction, I missed a year of socialization and of growth. Everyone else continued to bond together and build friendships, while I was stuck at home. At this point, people have already formed their friend groups from last year while I'm still stuck at Freshman year. I have no one who I can fit in with, people have moved on. Everyone who I used to hang out with has formed a deep friend group, and I don't have many classes with them either. This leads me back to Joe, who is in lower classes than me so I don't see him much, but we are still good friends and he treats me nicely. He has driven me home a few times along with his other friends and they've been smoking in the car, which I don't mind. As long as they treat me/others well, then they can smoke, I don't care. This moment got me thinking about how I don't fit in with everyone, I don't have any friend groups, or even many friends. Everyone else, including Joe, has formed their own friend groups, made their own friends, and I was left behind. It's like the car drove off without me. In addition, I'm terrible at socializing, and I can't hold conversations. The few people who would be willing to make new friends I'm either not interested in, or I can't hold a conversation. Everyone else is having fun, hanging out, and I go to the football games like I did a few years ago, but now with no one. I'm alone. I don't fit in with anyone."

A clever algorithm that covers age, gender, common interests (probably the best feature), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"

So lets start: when I got into university I used to live in a dorm alone. Used to eat alone in the cafeteria and I remember one day I cut my hand very badly and had to have it converted.

I would eat with a painful hand while listening to music and completely alone. No people to the right, none to the left nor front nor back, in a room filled with hundreds I was alone.

I would smoke alone, drink alone, give presentations without partners.

Never in my 3 years did I ever get approached, but I also I'll admit I never wanted to be approached so I probably gave out those vibes.

I was top of my class and the presentations used to go well, just ne giving a 2 hour presentation while other required 2-3 people within a group to keep up.

Im 20(M) now, and I haven't kissed a girl nor went on any dates till today, well had a few crushes in school and college but never confessed to them.  
2 years ago, I thought that the reason no one likes me must be because I was fat, so I hit the gym and went down from being about 95kilograms to being 77kilograms at the time of writing this. Even though, now I ain't fat, nothing has kinda changed.

I dunno what is wrong with me and I'm in the middle of thinking about what is wrong with me. I am a bit awkward in public and at times clumsy which lays off a bad impression and I'm trying to change it, but IDK I dont see much progress in that sector. Well, eventually I gave up everything(except gym) and expect nothing now. I finally give up  
This might seem as though, I'm trying to blame the girls for not dating me, but I really don't blame them, I can see why I am unlikeable.

Emails instead of phone calls. Zoom sessions for in-person meetings. Running errands hidden in the darkness of the night. 

Every single day, I convince myself that I’ve got the perfect life, removed from the unreasonably demanding social world. I’m so sure that I boast about my comfort with being alone to family, friends and acquaintances. Regularly, I scoff at the thought of feeling loneliness when I have enough going on in school, at work and with friends.

And yet, there is at least one night a week that I tidy up my apartment two hours earlier than usual, turn off all the lights, curl into a ball under my thickest blankets and suffer in the existential loneliness that threatens to shatter my psyche. 

Why? 

Why would I be lonely when I feel like I can barely keep up with the social demands of friends, family and work?

How? 

How could I be lonely when my social battery drains to 5% by the end of the first hour of the day?

No matter how many times I ask myself those questions, I fail to come up with the correct answer. It doesn’t make sense, and I feel like I’m trapped on a high-speed rollercoaster with no emergency stop button in sight. 

Minutes pass and pretty soon, I succumb to that powerlessness. I ache and yearn for a closeness that feels all too unattainable, for the detached intimacy within the uncomplicated and undemanding relationships conjured up in my imagination.

I suffer until the acuteness of the pain begins to fade, and I drift back into the soothing sensation of my sheets. The anxiety relents, and my mind slips back into the safety of my comfort zone. Just like the time before, there is no deviation from the routine. I plug in my phone, rest my head on my pillow and convince myself that it is just a passing paranoia. 

The next day, I laugh and shake my head, reading the sloppily written note I left myself before deleting and dismissing its contents as nothing more than the ramblings of the madman living inside my head. 

I will laugh until the next night when I close my eyes and find myself once again caught in a cyclical ritual that feels more perpetual than the orbit of the planets."
lonely,just wish I had someone,"just wish I had someone - I don't really have friends, not social and people have generally ruined me. At least I let them after all the years.  I am a 33 year old man who works constantly and goes home to nothing.  Hell only text messages I get now days are from work when they need to know about something. Otherwise it's like I don't exist.  I dreamed of having a wife and kids together.  That's my dream, but everyday seems like it's impossible."
lonely,"I don't know why I'm doing this, but here we go","I don't know why I'm doing this, but here we go - Hello, people that are on here! I'm... in a very crappy place in my life, I'm lonely, constantly being replaced and I just feel worthless and like I'm just all alone in the world. Just the existential fear of being alone for the rest of my life is weighing heavy on me and I don't know what to do. 
For anyone wandering I'm 19, nonbinary and European. My whole life was spend being sickly and I couldn't do much, I did good in school, but I don't know... it just didn't feel earned. I rarely had friends or if I did they left really quickly.
For some reason people just leave me all the time, I can't hold anyone for over a day. 
I don't even know what the point if this post is really... is it venting? Am I looking for a person that will be there for me for more than a day? I really don't know... I just want to share stuff that excite me with someone to talk about the dumb stuff that make me laugh, but I feel like I'm in a glass box that I scream I'm an no-one hears or cares. 
It might be the fact that I'm a bit shy and awkward at first? I really don't know... 
I'm sorry for wasting your time if you read that, but I appreciate you doing so, i hope you have a good day/night!"
lonely,Dreaming sucks.,"Dreaming sucks. - I keep having dreams where I'm not alone, where I have someone who loves me by my side, and where during them i genuinely feel happy. Then i wake up. Reality is nothing like that, even my friends make me feel alone, i have nobody ny my side, and I'm rarely happy. I've been trying to find someone since my ex left me but I never get responces. Dating apps suck. Subreddits like r/MeetPeople kinda suck too. And I suck at talking to anyone in person. Guess i just need to embrace dying alone."

I just want someone to care for, it’s been 4 years since any sort of meaningful relationship and I can’t see myself finding one anytime soon, I’ve lost a lot of motivation and it’s showing in my work and my personal fitness. I’m just so tired of chugging on acting like it’s not effecting me, but I have no idea what to do about it."

lonely,29M Not entirely sure what I'm doing here...,"29M Not entirely sure what I'm doing here... - Hello; would anybody like to talk? Get to know each other and all that? I'm not always the most diligent messenger, unfortunately, but I would like to be &amp; am trying to get better at it if you can be patient. I haven't made a new friend in a good while, and I miss being &amp; having one more than there's words.

Some backstory, I guess; spent 5+ years traveling the US for work with my incredible wife, but was forced home at the start of this year by COVID and my own degrading mental health. Didn't really want to come back, but psyched myself up for the return thinking about all my friends here and the good times we'd have ahead.

Fast forward ten months and virtually all of those friends have proven my worst fears from the road a reality in some way or another. Turns out ""out of sight, out of mind"" can so pervade a relationship that even once the other person is square in front of your face again they either can't or won't see you anymore. That hardly sums up the ways in which some of those people have hurt me this year, but it's the gist.

Tack on my psych of many years prior my cross country days retiring the week before I got back &amp; six major deaths of varying origin across every facet of my adult life in the last 15 months and I am...fragile, these days, to put it lightly. I've withdrawn from what remains of my social life to the point I'm genuinely unsure of why I'm posting here.

I guess we all gotta scream into the void some nights. Thanks for reading; hope to hear from you, peace &amp; love."
lonely,Teslabot,Teslabot - So I just heard about the Teslabot that Elon Musk announced and the only thing I could think of is how cool it would be to finally have a friend. Then I realized that I am extremely lonely. What are your thoughts on using AI that could potentially learn and somewhat evolve for platonic companionship?
lonely,Anyone relate?,"Anyone relate? - I feel lonely around people. I feel lonely in the sense that I was dropped off at the wrong party and my parents already left and they’re never coming back. Except the party is earth and no one is having a good time. I feel lonely because there’s so much I want to say but I don’t know how to articulate it. I feel lonely because I feel partly superior and partly inferior in relation to the human race. I feel lonely because sometimes I look at a person, really look at them and wonder if when they’re alone at night do they have these same wish of wanting to be seen? Not in a physical sense but Actually *seen*, understood. I feel lonely cause I know I’ll never know how to ask without coming across as depressing. Eh maybe I just feel lonely cause I’m an only child who grew up with emotionally closed off parents. I feel lonely cause I just turned twenty years old and something tells me I’m going to feel this weird loneliness for the entirety of my short stay on this on this 4.5 billion year old planet. And I know that when I die, no one will remember me. I mean truly remember me. They may remember me like a child remembers a lost parent or like people remember dead semi famous celebrities (if my writing career takes off) but I’ll never truly be remembered. None of us will. The planet will burn up one day, we will have learned nothing and chances are somewhere in this vast ever expanding universe, extraterrestrials are making the same mistakes as us and will also not be remembered. Everything feels pointless and I feel lonely. I don’t know maybe loneliness is just part of the human condition.. anyways, anyone relate? Then let’s chat!"

I still haven't paid for my session this coming Saturday because I feel like it's not going to be worth it (and I'm broke af) :( But I know I still will go for it because who else will I talk to about my shitty life decisions and shitty life problems?

lonely,I hate having a job,"I hate having a job - Didn't have a job for a long time. Was on government assistance. My life although mostly shitty looking from the outside wasn't all that bad. I was lonely and didn't do shit all day but overall, I had peace of mind, I wasn't worried about a whole lot, I could live comfortably. I did rely on parents but even if I didn't, I could get by with the government assistance for a while.

Going to work reminded me of  what an outcast I am. Not to mention, I've become extremely stingy with money to the point that I'm spending less money now than when I was not working, there's just a mentality that comes along with working.

When I was jobless, I could justify to myself why I didn't have any friends. But now with a job, I'm just constantly reminded that even with a whole lot of people, I'll still be alone."

I’m a pretty quiet guy who keeps to himself and doesn’t really talk to people all that much, and I am currently doing grade 13 in high school so the one good friend I had is at university in a far city. I’ve kinda never really gone out of my way to talk to girls or seek relationships with people in general. I was just looking for some insight, should I be trying to reach out and talk to girls in my school hoping to find someone I connect with or will it naturally occur when the time comes?"

lonely,Maybe it's time to end this long running farce.,"Maybe it's time to end this long running farce. - I haven't felt hope for the future in a long time, even before I graduated school I never felt like there was a future for me and now I am all but certain I was right. 

I have been single my whole life and while I have tried to be happy being on my own it just isn't working, ir doesn't help I am particularly very harsh on myself with everything I do in life and usually give up before even trying. I am also completely directionless, I had work for 6 months ths but had to leave because of an injury that the job would have made worse so now I'm stuck looking for work I hope it won't take years like last time. 

I do have friends but I know I'm not as close to them like others are, which is fine I don't need to be everyone's favourite but it just seems like if I don't make the effort they won't after awhile it just starts to hurt. 

So now here I am 25 and already done with life with no goals or aspirations with thoughts of just ending an existence that ulimately doesn't matter to anyone."

Sometimes I wish I was a boy to be free and happy ...... girls only care about beauty and how others are in comparison with them as if they were perfect or something, they only care to talk about boys and if one is more beautiful than the other .....

lonely,I hate how much effort I have to put in just to keep friendships alive,"I hate how much effort I have to put in just to keep friendships alive - I don’t mean that it shouldn’t be work, because it should, that’s the whole point of maintaining friendships.

But, it just always feels like a one way street. The second I stop initiating, it’s crickets on their end. And every time I make new friends, they’ll tell me that they’ll be different, but then they do the exact same thing.

And even when I put in the effort, it’s still minimal on their end. Every time, it’s always “sorry can’t talk I’m busy with school or work” and then next time you talk to them, they tell you about all the fun stuff they did when they said they were “busy at work or school”.

I’ve been actively not initiating conversations for a while because sometimes it makes me feel more in control of my loneliness, but it’s also just so depressing how few conversations I have because of it. In this last stretch of doing this, I’ve had three people “initiate” a conversation: one to flex their new computer, one to flex the hockey game they were at, and the other to ask me a question about a committee we were in a few years ago. None asking me “how I’m doing” stuff like that.

It’s just so frustrating how little people seem to give a shit about me. I’m easy to forget, I guess."
lonely,I'm the problem but I'm not the asshole. TW drugs and suicide,"I'm the problem but I'm not the asshole. TW drugs and suicide - I have a social circle, nobody there knows me nor do I enjoy their company.

Most of the people I know don't know where I live or that I've been in a 4 year relationship. They don't know about my past, interests, hobbies, really anything about me. Not because they don't care but because most of my life is based on a lies I have to tell to not be socially shunned. For example being gay and not in the USA, a former drug addict, taking psychiatric medication for BPD and Bipolar, suicide attempt scars, I can't even wear a T-shirt without a jacket around them...

I'm the problem for accepting living like this, lying to people but I don't think I'm the asshole. Kinda sucks having to hide everything about yourself out of fear."

I decided to connect with my ex female friends this week. they reminded me why I stopped talking to them, everything gotta be about them. why can’t it be about me too? asking to see my self harm scars.. how is that okay to do? pressuring me to give them $$$ knowing damn well they won’t pay me back, so when I say no, they decide to say “I thought we were friends” no we are not. friends don’t do that to each other. I wish I can tell my family that so they would stop annoying me about“why you don’t have female friends??” but sadly I cant."

Im an extroverted person but smiling isn't really working anymore.. i go out attended some birthday parties. Yes, it was fun but it doesnt fill the void inside me.. 

Now, im currently laying on a sofa procrastinating to my academic responsibilities where i sleep and wake up as i only live with my cousins. Btw, im at 2nd year of my college now.

It always feels like i've got no one. I really got no one. I can't cry or anything it just blank. Sometimes i get dark thoughts like 'what if i just end all of this maybe ill get reincarnated or whatever' i know it's silly but when you are at this point it feels nothing

lonely,Being okay with being alone is a lie I tell others…and myself,"Being okay with being alone is a lie I tell others…and myself - Leave at door delivery. Emails instead of phone calls. Zoom sessions for in-person meetings. Running errands hidden in the darkness of the night. 

Every single day, I convince myself that I’ve got the perfect life, removed from the unreasonably demanding social world. I’m so sure that I boast about my comfort with being alone to family, friends and acquaintances. Regularly, I scoff at the thought of feeling loneliness when I have enough going on in school, at work and with friends.

And yet, there is at least one night a week that I tidy up my apartment two hours earlier than usual, turn off all the lights, curl into a ball under my thickest blankets and suffer in the existential loneliness that threatens to shatter my psyche. 

Why? 

Why would I be lonely when I feel like I can barely keep up with the social demands of friends, family and work?

How? 

How could I be lonely when my social battery drains to 5% by the end of the first hour of the day?

lonely,I cannot trust anyone.,"I cannot trust anyone. - I just realised that my ""bestfriend"" is not even my friend. Iam just so done with everyone and everything."
lonely,I can’t handle another rejection,"I can’t handle another rejection - Hi I’m really sad. I like a girl and I know 100% she doesn’t like me back. I’ve liked her for 3 years now knowing fully well she won’t reciprocate. Now she’s distancing herself and I can sense she’s getting tired of me and doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore. I can’t bring myself to accept that she doesn’t like me back because I can’t handle another rejection. Every time I force myself to stop thinking about her and start to accept that she won’t like me I get profoundly sad. I can handle it for a few days and might be in a good mood knowing I won’t be chasing after  her anymore. But as the days pass I get sadder and sadder until I break down and start hurting all over. It’s like my brain and my body shut down and I stop doing things and functioning. I stay in bed all day and I over eat until I have to forget about the rejection, and convince myself that I still have a chance with her. That’s the only way I can get up from bed and get my life going again.

I’ve dealt with rejection my entire life, I got bullied since I was 8, all through middle school, and a bit into high school. I’m in 2nd year of University and things got better but I’m tired. My heart is tired and my soul is tired and I can’t handle another person rejecting me. The last girl that I liked to this level rejected me really bad. I confessed to her and she never said another word to me. I didn’t approach her after the confession at all but she still avoided me like the plague. She would just turn around and walk away if we were in the same space, she wouldn’t make eye contact with me, and it was like she couldn’t handle breathing the same air as me.

Long story short she ended up blocking me on all social media and I never heard from her again. Like I said things got better lately, I cleaned up my appearance and I don’t think I look that bad anymore, I lost some weight, I shower everyday (I didn’t before because I was severely depressed), I bought nicer clothes, I’m not hot or anything but I look clean and cute.

It took me so much effort to do all that, to get that little bit of confidence, but the fact that I’m the same position again makes me feel like it wasn’t enough and that I’m still faulty somehow. 

I know it’s a stupid thing to get depressed about, because relationships aren’t everything and I probably don’t even need one right now. But it’s just the rejection that hurts me, and that I feel like I’m not good enough for anyone. Or like romance just wasn’t made for me.

I’ve tried to forget about her and crushes in general but I don’t have anything else that makes me happier than that. She’s the most beautiful thing in the world to me and if she’s out of my life I feel like I won’t have anything good in my life anymore. Everything else looks so ugly and horrible. I can’t find anything else that brings me the same amount of joy. I’m so sad and I’m tired of pretending like I’m not. I’m so sad and it hurts so much. I just want to feel special too.

TL;DR I’m 19 years old, I’ve dealt with rejection all my life. I got bullied, rejected by every girl I’ve ever liked, and I can’t find joy in anything else. Now I’m getting rejected again and I can’t accept it, it hurts too much and I don’t know if I can live like this anymore."

lonely,I feel so down,"I feel so down - I feel like I’m forever going to be lonely. I recently became very close with one of my coworkers who’s rather more social and outgoing than I am. Honestly I would say me and her instantly clicked right away mostly because of the cultural background that we both share. I found her to be extremely funny intelligent, and talkative whenever we first started speaking. When nobody at my workplace knew who I was she was the first person who made an effort to actually converse with me. We would normally speak of things that we thought were funny and about our personal lives. But sometimes this is honestly the hard part for me because I usually don’t have anything that goes on in my life and have little to no friends. And I’m starting to think that she even sees it because I rarely ever talk about my social life. Like today we had talked about how I wasn’t able to go to a party and she kind of basically said it was because I’m a loner in like a messing around type of way.

You feel as if you are in Groundhog Day and battling an inner demon that you seem you cannot win. I’m here to tell you that none of that is truth. You are amazing. You are worth more than you can possibly imagine, and I wish you saw what I saw in you. If nobody has told you today that they love you, let me be the first to say I love you. I love having you as a friend. So please don’t cry. Don’t hate yourself. Because I see someone who will be successful. Doesn’t matter how long it takes, I know you’ll get there. Stay strong. Stay positive. Love yourself. Because know I’m rooting for you in the end."

lonely,I have been practically in lockdown since March 2019,"I have been practically in lockdown since March 2019 - So, I (17 M) have been practically in lockdown since COVID started spreading worldwide. My family has become very cautious literally with everything and we stay home most of the time. Basically, the only ones that go out are my parents but just if it is extremely necessary. In my own case I’ve gone out less than 10 times maybe (even though I’m already vaccinated, as well as my entire family).

Sometimes I really do feel confused about myself and how I am holding up. After COVID started, my school went online and continued like that for a year, I also went from middle school to high school in this time frame. I just started a new school year two months ago and my school decided to implement a hybrid class system. My family chose online, as well as the majority of other students. However, more people have started to choose going to school (at my school you can decide whether if you are taking online or not each month). Additionally, during the last year or so I have made myself very perfectionist and I must admit I put a lot more effort when it comes to be about school, so it turns into effort and time consuming. Sometimes I have even thought this is my way of coping with the circumstances, and that subconsciously I want to be busy doing something to keep myself away of “reality”.

Also, I haven’t been able to see any of my friends in “real-life” for almost a year and a half, which sometimes makes me feel somewhat lonely and a bit sad. There is also this girl I like a lot, and I think I could even like her. Unfortunately, she moved to a different country than mine, but she may return in a couple of months. The bad thing is that I may not even see her. As mentioned previously my parents are kinda overprotective (of course I really appreciate them caring for my health and well-being), so it is very unlikely that they will let me see basically anyone. There have been lots of occasions in which friends have invited me to hangout and do something, and I really do want to go out with them but I know that my parents will just say no and it is very frustrating. For example, on one occasion one of my closest friends went to study abroad and there was this farewell-party I was invited to, and while mostly everyone was already vaccinated I wasn’t able to attend. 

So, this has been very frustrating for myself and I really feel very lonely deep inside. I’m not the type of person that expresses true feelings frequently and I’m not that emotional as well. Still, I feel desperate, unmotivated and I feel like my life has turned into a boring and monotonous routine(in a sense it has definitely turned like this). I’m afraid that I’ll be having the same reality during 2022. I have 1.5 high school years left and I’m also really afraid I missed out/will miss out all this period of my life.

Edit: Thanks if you took the time to read all of this, I just really wanted to unburden myself."

But reading the withdrawals for kratom it seems to be pretty minor, shakes, sweating and fatigue is pretty mild. I know opiates feel like a hug which i need occasionally. I also need something to replace the feeling so i stop looking at porn or having a sex drive(since im straight but too ugly for women). Im hoping i can use this as a way to mediate depression and cut way down on porn since i hate that i watch it but cant stop due to the relaxing feeling climaxing to it causes. 

Does anyone have a way of dealing with touch starvation that has mild side affects? I was also debating getting a massage but it feels weird going to get one as a dude in his early 20s.

I don’t really have friends and the ones I do have are more obligatory acquaintances. I’m looking into getting counseling but that feels like I’m just paying for friendship. This is my first time really looking to like the internet to share my thoughts but it’s vast and this is anonymous. There is this piercing fear I get whenever I make eye contact with anyone. The drive thru is the worse. Outside of feeling pressure to rush and the judgement from the window person or the attitude they have that somehow I take personal like I ruined their day. 

I don’t have any family both parents are gone and no siblings. I have two kids but they are very young. So I guess I’m just looking for someone to talk to, not even for me to vent to but we could just chat about movies or books."
lonely,good news?,"good news? - It's me again from yesterday and a few days before. I spoke to my father today over text and he could tell I was deeply unhappy here and becoming increasingly isolated. He agreed to let me begin the transfer process to another university closer to home and in a smaller town, as long as I made it through this quarter with decent grades. I am excited at the prospect of leaving this place.

I'm aware this is the pussy way out, but I don't really care about it, honestly. People in LA come and go like a revolving door. I got off the phone with my 3 best friends from home today and began to cry because I realized I will never find anyone who loves and cares about me here like they do. Here most friendships are superficial and very surface level, and people here do not understand my energy like my friends from home do. I'd rather study somewhere else. My parents think suffering builds character development but I don't think that that is fair. They've always treated me this way, not getting me therapy after my self harm episodes back in middle school due to bullying, and making me ""tough it out"". I shouldn't always have to suffer to learn another lesson about the cruelty of life. I already understand it plenty. If I have an opportunity out of here, I will take it happily.

I went to a club meeting for my last commitment today to quit. The members were supportive and I am grateful. My new guitar amp arrives soon and I am excited to get back into playing my guitar. I am swamped with schoolwork but I'm trying to get caught up. 

And I also found out yesterday randomly in the middle of class that I can't live alone in a double anymore and that I'll be receiving a random roommate. She moves in Friday. I hope I'll be able to fall asleep at night because I'm a light sleeper and it's hard when someone else is in the room. I'll probably go back to insomnia and just downing melatonin it will put me to sleep.

I am numb to it all. I hope to quickly learn to turn off my emotions and function like a robot essentially, just getting my tasks done with indifference. If I don't learn to, I'll be forced to pretty fast. I just wish someone would hold me at night and tell me it's going to be alright. 

Sorry for rambling about my life events that nobody cares about. And again, thanks for being a loyal and understanding community."

I feel like a burden, because I am always angry and tired, I'm no fun to be around and it's like the people I'm closest with don't even want to be around me. I've gotten into drinking, I used to smoke but I stopped, and I cannot take it anymore. I go go school and nobody asks how I am or speaks to me unless they need something from me. I come home and it's chaos, yelling, or I just get really depressed and sleep until morning. My mom has always been someone who listens to my problems and I can't tell her anymore because it's affecting her a lot. I would speak to others but I've tried and it feels like I'm not welcome anywhere. I hate living the way I do, I try to be nice and I try to be happy but I cannot control my anger because of my resentment towards myself. I cannot afford therapy and I dont have the energy to find hobbies or things to do alone especially because I already feel alone. Last, I had one friend who would talk to me all the time, and it would only be about him being depressed, I never got to explain myself and I have spent nights scared he would harm himself. He told me everything and after spending time that I could've had fun, I was trying to keep him alive and sometime this past week he told me he didn't need me. He said I would only stab him in the back and told me to leave him alone. I dont know what to do because he was like family to me and I cannot speak to others about these things because they don't care or they've heard it all before."

My perception of time is drastically different from normal people living happy lives.

lonely,Would anyone be interested in joining a Discord server that gives everyone a certain weekday where it's their responsibility to keep the server active?,"Would anyone be interested in joining a Discord server that gives everyone a certain weekday where it's their responsibility to keep the server active? - I'm thinking that a big part of the issue of joining big Discord servers is that people find it hard to engage and break through.

So what if we made a Discord server where people have a weekday role (like ""Tuesday"" or something) and it's the responsibility of that smaller group of Tuesday people to keep the chat active on Tuesdays?

They would keep in mind on their weekday to try:

* tagging new people and saying hello
* trying to include people who don't know how to join in the conversation
* meeting new people they haven't talked to themselves
* interacting in both text and voice channels if they're up for voice chatting but that's not required if they're not comfortable
* maybe people could even host some events if they're feeling up to the bonus challenge, like a Jackbox game night or something
* and if they see a fellow weekday member not interacting, checking up on them to see if they're alright

This would be like their dedicated ""alright, let's get up and interact and make an effort!"" day, and then they'd be able to let others take over on other days.

This is probably a better idea with only a few people per weekday, so once people got comfortable with the server and feel like they don't need that extra responsibility motivation, they can step down from having a weekday and just be a general member. :)

Thoughts? If you're interested, leave a comment and upvote so others can see the idea."

I've locked myself in isolation for a while due to my loneliness and feelings of not fitting in. so I'd be more than happy to chat with some people about pretty much anything and hopefully make some new friends :)

SOMETHING TO ADD ASWELL. I'd be mostly comfortable with people around my age only. so 15-20. I've always felt a bit uncomfortable speaking to people who are older or younger than me. so around my age group would be nicer as i feel much more comfortable and safe.

Love yourself. Treasure your own heart more than the finest of riches. Love your heart deeply, that it should never need those permanent stitches.

Your heart is most valuable and sacred. It has no time for games nor jokes. Lastly, remember that your heart is beautiful. That it only deserves the best. No matter what surrounds you or captures your eye. Never settle for anything less."
lonely,My only friend hurt my feelings in the weirdest way,"My only friend hurt my feelings in the weirdest way - I need outsider opinions on this. 

My friend has been acting weird lately and it really stressed me out cos she’s all I have.
When I confronted her about it she told me she was having a conflict of ‘reevaluating what (she) expects from this friendship’ because she initially thought she had a crush on me but it turned out she didn’t. 

And I don’t know. It kind of hurt in the weirdest way because we were online friends for a while before meeting regularly so it looks like she had a crush on me and then she met me. 

Sometimes I think about it and it’s just. Why did she tell me that. I didn’t need to know. It’s not even a big deal. That happens. But she didn’t need to tell me.

lonely,Is there just something wrong with me?,"Is there just something wrong with me? - Right off the bat I’m just gonna flat out say that I was a loser in school. (still am tbh)

I never once had a girlfriend, let alone even received any attention from one no matter how hard I tried. I’ve never even kissed a girl.

So here I am at 20 years old, waking up every morning in a King size bed all alone. I spend my days sleeping, playing video games, or making crappy ass digital art that somehow makes me a living.

I keep trying to make myself happier by buying things that I never even really use all that much. My PS5 at this point is just a Netflix machine. 

I’ve tried dating apps. I’ll sometimes get lucky and get a match with someone and every single time, they’ll just stop responding and ghost me after the first few messages.

I’ve showed friends and family the messages and asked what I’m doing wrong and they all say that I do a great job at communication but the other person just doesn’t seem interested in me for some reason.

I don’t even know if I’m ugly or not. I look at myself in the mirror and I don’t hate myself, but I also don’t love myself either. I’m just content I guess…

I’m not tall but also not super short. I’m not skinny but also not obese.

I’m just average.

People tell me that I’m such a wonderful person and that I’m the type of guy that a girl would wanna marry… but I feel like it’s all bias.

I question myself if a girlfriend would even make me happy or if it would just create more problems. I drive myself crazy at night with this.

I just want the straight up answer to what’s truly wrong with me.

I went to the mirror and splashed water on my face and realized how blessed I am. I have a friend like you, I have my family. I’m alive. We take advantage of that last one. We think the world is against us, but yet we wake up with a roof over our heads and food in our bellies. We should be thankful with each breath we take. You aren’t alone, you aren’t an outcast or a loser. You just haven’t found your calling. People can be jerks, we get bullied online nowadays. I’m sorry about that. I wish I can tell you what to do, but I can’t because I’m in the same boat. I want you to know and really know that I really do love you. I really want what’s best for you and I never want to lose you. I’m glad we are friends and I’m glad I met you. You are someone I want to see grow up to be successful because I do believe you will be. Just please keep pushing yourself to change your mindset. Love yourself. You are worth so much more than you think."
lonely,A surreal Dream experience,"A surreal Dream experience - [ I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO POST] Please read it as a story.
06.10.2021
I haven't met her in 4 years. I saw her a couple of times, sometimes with her husband. But I tried not looking at her face. It's hard for me you know.
I do miss her everyday. We broke up 6 years ago after a 4 year relationship, a high school relationship.
Today I had a dream. In that dream someone close to both of us was on death bed. (Don't know him in real life) And we encountered each other there. The dying old guy seemed to know everything about us. Me and her were sitting together on the bed trying to talk and comfort the dying guy. We gazed in each other's eyes and held each other's hands impulsively without saying a single word to each other after all these years. We held on to each other's hands the whole time, knowing that after this event we probably won't meet for years, if not ever. I felt so emotional but tried to contain it. After it was over She went away. I was the last to go. Upon exiting the old man's house I discovered myself in a breath-taking Landscape. An endless green field with a curve path leading to the horizon towards the drowning sun.
The breeze was light to breath in, flocks of birds going to the east back Home. As the sun was going down, slowly the light was shifting away from me and continued to go far ahead. I felt a little insecure in this growing darkness around me and thought I should run and try to stay into the light part of the field. As soon as I started running I started to feel the air becoming heavier and heavier until it was hard enough to breathe, the speed of the light going ahead was increasing exponentially as well as the speed of the darkness following me. I panicked and started to run with all my energy. But couldn't outrun the darkness. The trees and grass and birds started Deflating like  balloons and everything looked lifeless much like in the painting ""The Persistence of Memory"" by Salvador Dali.
I woke up. I was practically drenched in sweat.
The experience was so surreal, unlike any dream I've experienced so far in my life.
The dream wasn't the end of this weird day. I went out to get a smoke, and was randomly passing by a restaurant. My eyes caught something and I instantly froze seeing HER and my other ex girlfriend together drinking coffee. XD
I wasn't even sure if I was awake, Lol.
Anyway, I don't know why am I writing this. I never do this kind of posts. Actually I never post.
If you came upto this, then Thank you so much for listening to my bullshit. I'm truly sorry for wasting your time.
Oh and sorry for my bad English."
lonely,"I just want to attend parties/festivals and cons with friends, not by myself anymore.","I just want to attend parties/festivals and cons with friends, not by myself anymore. - I am just getting tired and frustrated at this point. Whenever I see something I want to do and I think people I know would too, I ask them if they want to join. Mostly not, but here and there I can find someone to go with me. 

However, people never really invite me to stuff. A cool band playing at my local venue? Let's just avoid asking Deathhennefos and just make him jealous with pics on instagram. A night out? Definitely not ask Deathhennefos.

Even when I just wanted to be added to our pokemon go town whatsapp group I had to ask 7 people and still nobody adds me. 

It's sometimes just frustrating knowing people just don't want me to be around, eventho I have no idea why? 

Sure doing all those things on my own is alright, I have done it plenty of times, but sometimes people inviting me to something would be great too or at least to feel like I am part of a group, instead of this guy just trying to find some group of random strangers that don't mind some random guy standing with them for 1 evening."

lonely,I think I am content with being by myself for the rest of my life.,"I think I am content with being by myself for the rest of my life. - I guess this is just me venting. I’ve been doing that more often as time goes on. I am a 20 year old male and I think I am content with being by myself for the rest of my life. I have never been in a relationship once in my life. It’s not like I haven’t tried to make any attempts, but all of them failed. I tried my best to get the attention of girls that I did like for the past few years. I usually am a good sport about it and I know when to stop. As soon as a girl says no, I will back off. I think I have tried around 10 times and it affected my self-confidence. Even the people I went to school with managed to get into at least one relationship between middle school and present day. My friends tell me that I’m somehow charismatic while also being socially awkward. It’s a weird mix and I am socially awkward due to Asperger’s syndrome. 

Slowly I have become less social and less confident. I still have friends, but we can never find the time to hang out due to everyone having school or full-time jobs. Nowadays smoking pot and music fills that void a little bit. I guess you can say I just kinda gave up. I’m most likely going to be alone and my mindset doesn’t seem like it’s gonna change. Also I’ve heard the line “there’s plenty of fish in the sea” more times than I can count, that quote has done nothing for me everytime."
lonely,Some guys are just too lucky,"Some guys are just too lucky - I'm not gonna go incel mode. I don't hate women.

I guess it's just gotten on my nerves. Some of the guys I know seem to be getting with girls left and right, and I don't know what it's like. I don't hate the girls, or my friends either quite frankly, but I get jealous.

I'm 15, so I assume some might say ""you're a young guy, give it time"" or ""you're too young to focus on girls"". I'm not a loner, I have a good amount of friends, and most of them are reliable. I know that the guys I know who get girls are smokers and flunkers, and so are the girls, but I guess it's the pessimism that counts. It makes you a sour person, you know. Just being romantically lonely and jealous can suck, no matter the age.

What do you guys feel, depending on your age and experiences?"

lonely,I would rather have no friends.,"I would rather have no friends. - Strange thought for a group who's problem is being lonely, right? I have not had a real close friend since I was 10 years old, and even then I'm not sure it was genuine. I've been invited to hang out by many groups, and especially so in university where my roommate drags me with his friends every evening which would seem like the ideal life for a lonely guy. However, every moment of being in a group is miserable. I can put up an act as a friendly confident guy but that takes more energy than the most intense exercise and soon I just am the guy walking quietly behind everyone. I get no enjoyment from socializing and only think about what excuse I can make to go back to my dorm. I like talking to people, like being with family or going on dates with one other person, but the type of socializing that would give me a consistent group of friends is just so exhausting that I actively avoid these situations. For example, last night while I was drawing,  a girl from this group knocked on my door and said they were going to get ice cream and some guys were saying it's weird they never see me studying in the lounge or going out with them. Immediately I felt like someone hit my head and just the thought of going downstairs with them gave me physical pain. I told her I didn't feel good this evening but it's obvious she didn't believe me. It's unfortunate how socially unacceptable being alone and not having many friends is. Everyone I tell this to judges me and I wish I could have this quiet life and still create meaningful relationships with a couple close people without being seen as antisocial loser."

In times desperate or bored it does happen 

Respite is not for me, out of my command 

I charge on and my hopes they do blacken 

But then I was always a fool who ignored such forebodings

I have the love of family but powerless are they to console 

No matter how they tut and pat and go on a-hoping 

They know not the abject misery found in this wayward soul 

Grasping in the dark for a friendly hand, it is my refrain 

Without resolution the circle continues on 

And with this next and final line I shall end this tuneless song 

Forevermore my days will spent in the rain, rain, rain"

10th grade we were still very close and she would listen to me and we sent audios to each other and do video calls.
she never invited me to go to her house that often.
she would tell me all of her plans and I was her confident and she was mine.
we have been through a lot together
I still remember the pics on the fieldtrips and how close we were.
11th grade she found a new friend
I started getting suspicious of how close they were together.
She would rather sit next to her and give her all the attention.
she isn’t afraid of inviting her to her house.
she switched me so fast and she doesn’t even care how much it hurts to see that all the time together was in vain
If I wanted to be alone with her I couldn’t, she said that I needed to hang out with the rest of the class.
she is now a stranger to me.
her new friend doesn’t like me for absolutely no reason.
I hate to see that they are best friends
that should be me.
I just found watched a tiktok video I made for her on the 10th grade of how much I appreciated having her as my best friend

we were so close damn.

Hopefully I'll be around for a while as this group sounds lovely. - I've been off work for the last week and it makes you realise how distant people can be. Being off during the week has given me time to reflect on myself but abit too much and now I've started to have dark thoughts (not suicidal or illegal) but just in general. My current partner has kissed 3 other people in the past and I found out recently their might be a 4th. I've tried my hardest to hide this from myself but when you're on your own. These thoughts just come flooding back. 

It means alot to me as I've been with her for nearly 10 years. I love her to bits but can't bare her at the same time. 

This has made me incredibly lonely and sad. I've never had a partner I can fully trust and the person who I thought was ""the one"" is just the same as my ex's. 

My job sucks ass, I'm a self employed carpenter and I just can't seem to catch a break. If I'm not getting paid on time, then my truck breaks down. 

I'm at a loss with no one to turn to apart from my best friend who isn't always available and I can't turn to my family because they'd look down upon my partner.

Please tell me I'm not just overthinking things and this is actually a genuine reason to be concerned? I've overreacted to small things in the past due to things building up"

lonely,:(,":( - I'm , going on 18 in a little over a month. I was raised orthodox christian in a large family. I have 7 sisters and one brother that are all older and have moved out. I have a mom that I'm close with, my dad is there but he doesn't like me. I was supposed to be a boy, but instead I've turned out to be an overweight girl (which he likes to joke about, and about much more). My mom never stood up for me in front of him, which hurt me a lot, but she would try to consol me with words (christianity) when we were alone saying I have a dad in heaven (didn't work). My parents didn't know how to raise kids emotionally. They thought that taking care of us physically was good enough.

I'm currently in my first year of actual college, although in highschool I got my associates degree through a community college (my current college took 65 of my 78 credits). I have always fell back on my achievements, and who I have made myself to be. I'm pessimistic, but I try to find the good side of things. With my dad situation I have always seen the side that my dad hurt me emotionally so much so that I cannot be hurt more by anyone else in this world. I finally have come to the realization that my achievments can never and will never fill the emptiness I feel. I want to be cared for, and hugged. It's hard to see everyone around me in college have happy relationships, and to have to be alone. A guy here lead me on. I really liked him. Turns out he has a gf. I'm glad nothing happened before he told me, but it has made my emotions a lot worse. It's shoved in my face every time someone asks me if we are dating because we (still) hang out a lot (he's a good guy as a friend, but clearly not as loyal as I thought). 

It's just hard. I have been told that it's better to feel slight pain now then to date a guy for a long time just to break up. I cannot believe that. I want to feel cared for. Even if it ends I will have been cared about and loved for a period of time. I'm sick and tired of waiting. I'm lonely. 

Thank you for reading if you got this far.

(With the christianity part I still believe in God, but definitely not going back to orthodox. That was very religious and fake.)"

The cops were called frequently(even on Christmas), father had harassment charges, parents divorced at the age of 12, mom used to tell me she regretted having me, CPS called to the house every couple of months, and etc. I have somewhat salvaged a relationship with both parents, but I still feel a lot of resentment. I feel like I was robbed of my childhood. I have a hard time making friends because of the mental trauma I endured during my youth… but I’m working on it with therapy and I start meds on the 13th. 

Cue meeting my only local friend. For YEARS she was my best friend. We did everything together… until she met her husband, got married, and had a baby. I’m happy for her… but I feel like I can’t be around her. She doesn’t even make an effort to hang out anymore unless it benefits her. She makes me sad. I am in a happy relationship… but I’m jealous because I don’t see myself ever having kids because I’m too afraid of messing them up. I decided a couple of years ago that I would be a bad mom… even if it’s something I kind of want. She has a LOT of friends and I only have two. My other friend lives on the other side of the US so I only see him once every few years unfortunately. He came from a broken home like mine, so I never experienced these problems with him. She married rich. She has a nice home, vacations, dogs, a yard, cars, and she has the respect of the people around her.

lonely,I feel horrible and everything sucks,"I feel horrible and everything sucks - Lately I've been feeling extremely lonely. I'm a college student set to graduate soon and I haven't formed any significant friendships during my time here. I thought I met my best friend a short while ago. We had a lot in common, had fun stuff to talk about, and just always had a jolly ol' time. But recently they randomly started ignoring me, which really hurts. I've always had trouble making and keeping friends (except in high school, where for the last 2.5 years I felt like there was a small group that I belonged to and could always lean on-- but we fell apart after high school) and this time I thought things would be different, and that I'd potentially found a life-long friend. Guess not. Now they only text me if they need something, and if I ever need something they're dismissive about my problems. Overall because of their behavior lately I've been feeling like a burden, like an interloper that no one really wants to be around and is forcing their way into things. I don't think I deserve this but I'm also terrible at making and keeping friends. I've tried reaching out to old friends, and even though they're nice, we just don't have anything in common or anything to talk about anymore.

Sometimes I wish I could start college over again, and this time maybe I'd put more effort into being social. I've tried bumble bff but everyone I meet on there either just wants to gain instagram followers or rope me into their pyramid scheme..

My family's also going through a fuckload of shit right now. My dad's refusing to work and my mom is always depressed and excessively crying and worrying about money, which in turn makes me super anxious and prevents me from focusing on schoolwork. (this is just the tip of the iceberg but just in case someone i know is on here, i can't say more)

I don't have anyone to talk to about this stuff and it's really weighing on me. It's become incredibly difficult for me to find any motivation to be productive. I used to have a good head on my shoulders; I would dedicate hours on end to learning something new or something that pertained to my future career, I was able to just sit down, get shit done, and then some. Now I just sit and mope all day, worrying about stuff that I have no control over. I used to cut a few years ago but I stopped. Recently I had a fleeting moment where I thought about doing that again and that in turn progressed into some suicidal thoughts (which have recently become more frequent).

I just started my freshman year of college this year, I’ve got great roommates and I just got initiated into my fraternity last week. I became quick friends with my pledge brothers and all the other brothers, but despite all the good stuff I have going for me, I still feel alone. I’ve been struggling with PTSD since a pair of brain surgeries I had last year (one caused a stroke and the other was a procedure to remove the part of my brain causing my epilepsy), and don’t know anyone here that’s had a similar experience with epilepsy or any kind of brain surgery. Could that be it, or could it be because I haven’t found a therapist to work with yet. Sorry if this post sounds kind of like a venting kind of thing, I just had to get it out somehow."

There was a kickball tournament happening where the whole entire school went since it was part of class. All the people who I talked to didn’t want to sit next to me so I was at the game by myself then when the game was over a saw one of my crushes walking to the exit and I quickly went inside a shed and hid. After the game everybody was able to go outside at recess all the grades were there too and everybody was having fun running around in the playground and grass doing football and soccer it was PACKED full of people but I was walking by everyone and nobody noticed me or talked to me even when I walked past a acquaintance. I then saw a little corner of boxes in the far end and saw a someone sitting on it. I came there to sat down I looked for a ring tone to wake up since current ringtone wasn’t loud enough then I found one played it in my phone then BOOM ‘I wake up in real life’ is there any meaning to my dream?

We talk almost ever day and although we don't agree sometimes, we do see each others pont of view.

On our most recent facebook video-call conversation she complimented my looks and was being generally very cute. She is a very kind and complementary person but I think she also was dropping subtle hints to me. The issue is that we live so far from each other. A plane ride would take over a day to get to her city and would cost a significant amount of money for me as I am a student. I do have the money to see her but was saving it to buy a new desktop. What would you do if you were in my situation? Even if it doesn't work out with her I am just grateful to spend time with someone who knows me and wants to get to know me better in that way.

Red flags, I know what your thinking. I’m not a school threat or neckbeard. I’m just a teetotal that works full time + school so I’m fairly boring person/life and not in a environment to make new connections. 

Anyways I have a few close extended cousins this is my only form of social interaction excluding close family/work small talk. We are all in the age range of 18-21. I’ve never seen something like them before. They are a Nerd/Jock hybrid. Here’s a quick description of them:

- Nerd Side: They are N.E.E.Ts. government scammers, on discord till 5am gaming addicts. my aunt is their personal butler, babied and fed. Think of that guy from South Park. 

- Jock Side: Look and built like a frat guys. Very popular 2k+ IG followers. Had/have multiple girlfriends/tinder hookups easy sex. Lots of Irl friends. Drinks, goes to parties etc.

Are they an anomaly? I’m curious how they can live this life style I find my self a bit jealous. Any thoughts or advice appreciated."

I just wanted to feel included I don't even really want to go it just hurts to as always be the one left out.
Even when I went out with my childhood friend the other day they never messaged me back I thought we had fun.

Is this how my whole life will always be?

lonely,I'm new to high school and I have no friends,"I'm new to high school and I have no friends - In my middle school I was the first person to come out. That gave me a reputation of being the gay one. But I wanted to be known for more about who I am as a person when I went to high school so I tried to figure out was I was myself. I thought I finally found it but then I came to high school being extraverted, making jokes, and by the second day people were making fun of me. I have never cried so much in my whole life. I made friends during preseason but they aren't really my people. I could be close with them if I wanted to be but we don't have much to talk about and I wouldn't be happy. I have never felt so alone. It's been three weeks of school and I have no close friends. There are other new kids at this school that are so popular, and good at sports. I love soccer but I've never even played in a game. Everything is just crushing my spirits recently because everyone has decided who I am before they even know me. It started with people saying I wanted to date my step sister just cause shes 15 and we both have had like messed up family lives so shes super sensitive and clingy and I don't want to hurt her feelings when I tell her that like sitting on my lap is weird but honestly it's fine cause we're just super close and neither of us mean it in a sexual way. I've told this to my friends a million times but they won't listen and now the entire grade thinks this. and then people started making fun of my instagram but what they don't know is that the captions I post are all ironic. the people at my middle school knew that. and people just keep making fun of me. I had this one girl who's the meanest make fun of the way I drum in front of me. And then one night I got super drunk and made out with my best friend and got a hickey and someone took a picture of it and posted it on their story and everyones been making fun of me.

lonely,I feel alone,"I feel alone - Hi !!  I(34,m) feel really lonely these days. I moved to US last year for PhD education. During covid I couldn't meet anyone as friends. Just the people in my lab who I work with. My supervisor, master student and some undergrad students. My supervisor is very unsupportive and selfish. The master student looks down on foreigners.  


I tried to find friends outside university.  Even though I meet people,  whenever I want to hangout they're busy all the time. Unless I ask them, they don't ask me to hang out at all.  I lived in 3 different countries before I came here.  Never had problems with having friends and establishing circle.  But right now I feel so alone first time in my life. I miss to talk to someone, to have genuine conversations, to have fun together.  I don't know what to do! I started therapy but I can't overcome my feelings."
lonely,How to get friends by a loner,"How to get friends by a loner - This is mainly IRL

1. Talk to them. If you can make the first move that's the best alternative. Find something they're interested in and talk about it.
2. Listen more and speak less. I'd say listening 80% and talking 20% of the time while in a conversation is the best. In the beginning it's harder since the other person might be shy. When this happens you need to talk a lot with the goal of making them talk. Best way to make them talk in my experience is to ask them questions.
3. Seem genuinely interested in what they have to say. Listen to what they say and ask them questions. Most important thing is to always seem like you're interested in what they have to say.
4. When you see them somewhere else than wherever you usually meet like work or school you need to greet them. This reinforces friendliness and makes them feel like the connection between you two is safe. You can also start a conversation if you think that'd work better but I think it's safer to just say hi in the beginning.
5. When it doesn't work and the person really doesn't want to talk to you see this as learning. Think about what you could've done differently and do better next time.

I'm also going to be honest and say it may be that people don't actually like you a lot. In my case for example people don't like me. I haven't found out the problem though I think it's related to my personality which is very out there. Also that I've got a very unattractive face, that I'm skinny fat, that I look like I belong to an ethnic group that is looked down upon in western society, that I usually walk alone because no one wants to be with me, that I may have a lot of mental health problems which is making me unable to connect to people in fear of rejection (which happens anyways), that I'm stupid, that I'm not talented, that I'm not reliable in any way, and finally that people notice the infection of loneliness and desperation I carry in my head and just talk to me cause they feel bad for me."

I feel so worthless rn. I am not usually like this though. There are times wherein I feel so empowered and inspired to organize activities for some sectors of our community. But this time, all insecurities and anxieties hit different. I see everyone moving forward and maturing, while I, on the other hand, stayed stagnant. I try to expose myself socially—since I think it’s the area I’m most weak at—but I have no success. People simply do not respond to mundane greetings haha. Does anybody else feel this way?

lonely,I just wanted to be her friend,"I just wanted to be her friend - This happened a year ago but I still think about it sometimes. I met a girl in a group session I was going to and I really enjoyed talking to her because we shared a similar experience with each other and so far I had yet to meet anyone my age who could understand. So I got her number and we talked for a couple of weeks. I noticed she wasn’t going to ground therapy anymore so I asked her if she wanted to get coffee and catch up. She might’ve taken it the wrong way cause she then said that she prefers not to make friends in therapy groups. This confused me so I asked her why and she just said that it’s just what she believes. I told her that I understood and that I’ll respect her choice. But honestly, that really hurt. She was the first person I felt could understand me and I just wanted to get to know her more but she clearly did not. I wasn’t asking her out on a date, I truly just wanted to talk. I’ve always wanted a real female friend.

Sorry I just wanted to get this off my chest as I’ve been feeling this for a while."

lonely,Why is the past still so hurtful in the present?,"Why is the past still so hurtful in the present? - No matter what I do, my past catches up to me. I get constantly reminded of not being enough, not being this or that and what cringeworthy and flat out embarrassing shit pulled in high school. But that isn't even the major problem. I constantly reminisce over what could have been if I had done this or that in regards to ghosts from my past. How do I stop my creeping sadness ready to strike me whenever I'm vulnerable to haunt me?

I found two people on instagram who I got very close to during a time where I had no friends in school. A couple months later and I ended the contact all of a sudden because I gained some IRL friends in school who I valued more and thought it was ""embarrassing"" to have Internet friends no matter how awesome these two people were that I talked to. I regretted my choices a couple weeks later and messaged them again. One blocked me for almost a year and the other I could never find the account of ever again (I think he deleted it or blocked me). And fuck, if I had the choice to ge back in time and undo my mistakes I would do so immediately. I was such an asshole for breaking up the contact like that and lie. Now, I'm here, 3 years later (for the first contact) and 1 year later (for the second contact) and I just feel empty and miserable and sorry. How do I stop this? Do I even deserve redemption? It eats me up inside and I have been having dreams about what could have been knowing full well I will never hear from them again and it's all just a what-if story at the end of the day."

I had to struggle and fight my whole life to create the life I desired and I have it, and I’m happy and grateful for it, but I have no one to celebrate and share with.  In fact, I never did.  My “parents” gave me up for adoption to abusive people and well that right there just ruined my whole life.  I’ve had friends before but as I did inner work and pursued goals they fell away.  Cause of my trauma I despise people who use others to get ahead, and that’s a good chunk of people out there.  Now, cause of my age, the other chunk are married with kids and busy or they are weird as hell or have problems.   And, I have a almost non existent family support structure because it’s better for my mental health.  It hurts but I’ve had to come to terms with it (other peoples capacity, or lack thereof, to care about your life and very existence) and embrace the good in life.  However fostering relationships has completely left my life and it just hurts.  Dating just feels like a band aid for loneliness.  The holidays are the worst and approaching fast.   Major milestones in my life like graduating, preparing to buy my first home and a major birthday all go unacknowledged.   Just hurts and I don’t have the will to satiate empty ego fed superficial relationships.  But I just wish one person fucking cared about me on a daily basis.

Almost never my phone rings or text come in.  If so it’s super rare and brief, or someone trying to sell me something. 

It’s made me so awkward and uneasy that I feel no one understands me anymore."
lonely,"My one and only friend accidentally invited me to another group chat, but then quickly removed me from it.","My one and only friend accidentally invited me to another group chat, but then quickly removed me from it. - My best friend accidentally sent me a group invite to another chat, but when I joined I saw that all the people that were in it were the same people that were in the last group we were all in. But that chat was long gone and nobody talked in it, I guess I finally figured out why.

After a few seconds I was kicked from the group and my friend texted and said that it was an accident that he sent that.

He’s my only friend, I don’t wanna screw up what we’ve got."
lonely,"Im just so lonely, and im terrified ill die that way.","Im just so lonely, and im terrified ill die that way. - Im a 21 year old male. I've never had a girlfriend, and I can point to about 8000 reasons. To list a few, im heavy set, struggle with acne, an introvert, was homeschooled (so social situations are iffy) and im a Christian. I care alot about my faith. But in this way its limiting to try to date only those within my faith aswell, to share values and stuff, and I think its pretty important. Anyway, I grew up a romantic, my mom raised me so I have alot of ""feminine"" view points on love. Where other kids wanted to be firefighters, I wanted to be a family man. I just never learned that those dreams don't come true. About once or twice a month I just get depressed, I cry alot too. It just gets so hard not having someone... everyone else around me either seems to be fine with their singleness, or they have others that they love. I just don't understand why im so unworthy of love. Why whether through God, or just my own ""luck"" I cant seem to find one single girl that loves me. I also have a horrid tendency to fall in love with people who barely know I exist, that just ends in me breaking my own heart. I know that love isn't everything...but sometimes I just feel like I can't go on another year of my failed childhood dream. I'm too self conscious, and self loathing, to go on a dating site, and im kinda just waiting for a girl to come along. I feel though that, the day won't come where that happens. And ill die alone, without family. With regrets. Any advice beyond ""be confident"" or "" just go get em""?"
lonely,I am functionally not a human being,"I am functionally not a human being -  I'm going to be 24 in a little over a week and I have never been in a relationship and I see no means by which I could have one at this point. I never learned how to properly talk to and meaningfully connect with people. I've moved to a new town, don't know anybody here, and am not capable of ""meeting"" people in the way most people are. I am an offputting presence to anyone who doesn't already know me.

My few friends, all from high school, all live hours (at least) away. I stopped attempting to talk to any of them about my loneliness years ago after it resulted in the loss of, or negative reactions from, a few old friends. I would tell them I felt like a ghost who was already dead, who had lost whatever minuscule ability I ever had to connect with people. I no longer speak to any of those few to whom I opened up. I don't blame them for reacting as they did. But I do not talk to anyone about my emotions any more. I sit with them on lonely nights and drink.

I have given up on any possibility that I can have a significant other but I cannot stop thinking about my desire for a significant other. I like to hike and drive to lonely and interesting places and I want very badly to share these enjoyments with a stable life partner. But I cannot talk to women. I live in a duplex and my neighbor is an attractive woman. I have no interest in her but I cannot even say hi to her. I said hi to her once as we crossed paths and I was shaking for 10 minutes afterward. Apparently in order to meet women you are supposed to simply walk up and start talking to them, which strikes me as absolutely insane. I know if I did this, my strange speech patterns that give me away as someone who very rarely talks to other human beings would set off alarm bells, and she would try to quickly excuse herself from the situation.

I cannot do online dating. I have tried. I matched with one person once who almost immediately unmatched me when an attempt I made at a joke fell flat. That's it. If I had the photos I might be able to craft a profile that would attract likes, but I don't have the sorts of photos that men are supposed to use, the kind that ""show and don't tell"" about your hobbies. I don't know anyone here so I can't get them taken. Even if I did I wouldn't want to ask them to take them, because it would be embarrassing. And even if I had them, I still wouldn't want to engage in online dating, because the whole enterprise disgusts me. I can't stomach putting myself up in a marketplace and presenting myself as an advertisement on a billboard. And when I look through the profiles, I don't even recognize the entities who are using these apps as belonging to the same species as me. I simply cannot relate to people, except the few friends from high school, scattered about the country, who I still occasionally spend time with a few times a year.

I have rationally known for several years that I am going to have to accept an entirely solitary life, but I have been all the while emotionally searching for a way to escape this fact. I hate that I have to accept living like this when I see couples together everywhere, who, if asked how they got together, would often say something along the lines of ""it just happened."" Finding romantic partners is something that simply comes naturally to most people but there is something fundamentally wrong with me and I cannot. For the same reason, I cannot make new friends.

I'm tired of sitting alone with these thoughts and drinking (I don't always. I have things I like to do, reading, hiking, etc. But nothing can provide a permanent distraction from having essentially no permanent human connections). As I said, I don't talk to the few people I know about these sorts of things anymore. So I have nowhere else to say these things. But all this rambling is really just the death throes of whatever emotional force is trying to get me to fight the inevitable decades of solitude that are ahead. I know it will serve no purpose in the end but I'm just throwing random stuff at a wall that will never break."

lonely,"I'm being abandoned by my ""friend,"" group. This is the first time I've ever felt crippling loneliness.","I'm being abandoned by my ""friend,"" group. This is the first time I've ever felt crippling loneliness. - I have recently found out that my recent friends have been gossiping behind my back and have started alienating me. They don't really recognise me as a friend anymore. I have known some of these guys for 10 years, and I am questioning my worth and have anxieties about some of the things they might do to make me feel as lonely as possible. My friend group has done this to others, practically systematically bullying them out of the group (I was regrettably a bystander in these situations), and I never expected for it to happen to me. I always perceived myself to be, as another post mentioned- a ""backburner friend,"" who's just sorta there and I can safely say that I have no close friends within the group. It's also extremely nice of them (/s) to do all of this in my final and most important year of high school, just when you need that support and friendship to fall back on whilst undergoing academic stress, they've deserted. I've felt really dejected, stupid, scared and anxious lately, and this is by far the loneliest I have ever been. At the moment, I don't just feel lonely, I feel practically unsafe, around my ""friends"" on social media and at school.

I need someone to talk with who genuinely wants to listen however, I encounter another roadblock here. My parents are extremely emotionally conservative- they are super religious and tell me to pray or sleep when dealing with feelings like this, ignoring how I truly feel, not allowing me to process any of these emotions. I feel like I need a therapist to do this, but I have no idea how to ask my parents for it.

I'm not sure if this community is particularly an advice subreddit, but any and all advice would be appreciated.

lonely,Can you .. and I .. be friends?,"Can you .. and I .. be friends? - Loneliness to me feels a lot like sinking, slowly. Like sitting in a dark pit, alone, unable to see any source of light. Like slowly succumbing to the cold numbing your bones, spreading through you. Like running out of air, a vice grip on your lungs. A pain in your heart so fierce it is debilitating, a weight on top of you that feels like it is slowly crushing you.

The daily grind of trying to pretend to be fine, to keep going, to struggle through life alone, has gotten to a point that is now unbearable. I have to admit I haven't been okay for what feels like an eternity. I long for the presence of another human being in my life. Family, love, friends. I have neither. Haven't had anything resembling genuine human contact outside of work and superficial banter for years and years. I .. am so goddamn lonely.

I long for human presence in my life.  It feels like a dream that is far away. To share the small and big things, to have someone to immediately want to run to with exciting news, someone you are eager to talk to everyday but when you do not, it feels like no time has passed. Someone who, when around me, doesn't feel the need to wear that daily mask that is required of us, but who can feel free to be exactly the way they are because we get each other. Someone to share even those things with that you need to feel you have to hide from the rest of the world. Someone you want to have by your side no matter what shit life throws at you. Someone you are eager to greet in the mornings or to call after a long day to ask about their day. To laugh about the silly things together, to share all the random little memes and pictures and insignificant things that happen, to rent and vent and to cry together when things get rough.

I have so much love to give, care so deeply for the people close to my heart, but I cannot seem to find anyone that is for me. That stays.

The harsh reality is getting ghosted. Being replaced. People seemingly losing interest. A phone that is deadly silent day in, day out. The continued pain when hearing the phone go off, that hopeful second of a racing heart only to discover it's just yet another Domino's ad. Nights that seem neverending. Why?

All these hurtful attempts at trying to reach out to people, to establish a connection, have almost made me give up so many times, only to pick myself back up again and again to keep trying. Honestly, I am .. tired. I've seen numerous similar posts to mine, read comments of people desperate, feeling like giving up. Yet even when contacting them, most of the time I can't seem to even get a reply. I don't understand. Is it really just me?

If there's the slight possibility you can relate to any of this and feel we could maybe get along and chat, please do reach out to me. Would you like to try and see if we can be friends? I understand the struggle is hard and that sometimes the only solution seems to be giving up because you already know it will just end up like all the other times, but please stay hopeful. So many lonely souls on this subreddit, it simply can't be that we cannot find each other. Keep your head up, let's see if maybe we can be that light that will brighten each other's days, that our smiles next time will not have to be forced :)

(If you feel I'm not your kind of person, that is perfectly fine, why not consider reaching out to someone else? :) )

How does loneliness feel for you? What are your circumstances, what brings you here? What are your passions, your dreams? Was there something that made you smile today? Anything you want to vent about? Please, I'm so eager to hear from you, make yourself at home and never hesitate to try and fight for what it is you wish for in life, I still believe loneliness is something we do not simply have to accept."

lonely,"34 M Indian expat in the US, feeling extremely low","34 M Indian expat in the US, feeling extremely low - Hello there, I’ve been sorta a nomad moving cities and jobs, and have had a mixed group of friends. But lately I’ve come to a realization I’ve been not forming deep relationships/friendships for a while. Or what I thought were good friendships weren’t so. Distance and lack of communication due to health, and mental issues has also added to that. 

I’m in Florida, not too many folks from my background around me. I don’t have anyone to check on me in the same city or state. Live by myself, and have a friend who seems quiet aloof/unattached. Not been in a relationship since past few years because I couldn’t find a good match, been low, had health issues was skinnky. Now all of the health issues are gone, and visiting family in India. But dreading going back to Florida and being alone again.  

I used to be Jovial, and a friendly person who didn’t have issues making friends until 25. But a few bad breakups and living alone seems to have changed me. Always been a sort of an introvert, but not have lost confidence and get this over whelming feeling no one cares. I don’t know how to make friends anymore, it feels like it. I don’t know what to do to have a social life and cannot seem to find anyone I like to date me. I myself feel lack of enthusiasm and smartness, feel boring. I didn’t think I was this way. 


Any help on getting out of this rut? Any advice for introverts/nerds? I do enjoy biking, hiking and partying to an extent. 420 friendly, and adventurous when motivated. But when feeling like utter shit all of this seems to go out of the window.."

This last time I can honestly say that was not the case I came to live with her for a few weeks in that time I managed to sober up was ready to do things the right way unfortunately she started using behind my back at work lying to me about it and we relapsed pretty hard . I started to get really paranoid, depressed, scared she was going to start cheating and leave me again after I spent all my savings on hotel rooms and our habbit. My fears became quite real when she quit her job had me pick her up and couldn't look me in the eye after. 
I know I should have called it there walked away with my head up but if you love someone enough you just want them to be satisfied even if it means allowing them to have a fling from time to time. I dont mind swinging if my partners honest with me and the person respects our relationship and doesn't go blasting her phone up. 
Long story short she takes me over her cute girlfriends apartment where I was very polite and didn't insinuate anything of any nature. However she decides to walk away telling me to stay with her friend i didnt want to do anything with her friend she had no ride nothing just walks out of the apt and starts walking away i eventually drove by and scooped her up took her to her dads apartment she says to me good luck with the book there wont be a movie and just walks away into the complex not answering my texts or anything drugs may have caused her some dilusions or possibly the lack of sleep from partying like every day since she lost her job in hotel rooms. Later that night I left my phone on the dash of my car while I was booking a hotel room come back out and its gone. Now I don't have her number to find out anything. Here's where it gets fucked up.

I get sick while I'm at the hotel and end up stuck there quarantined for a week with no phone praying that I wrote her number down somewhere  but my car was so ransacked I couldn't find a 100 dollar bill spray painted neon orange in it. After quarantineing I decide to get some help with my drug issue and check myself into a detox. I detox out over 12days then make the next step to go to rehab having no insurance active yet I only really had one option which was gardencia place is a shit hole but I tried to make due with the people there everyone was pretty nice I overhear someone talking about a Jenna in there and I asked if they knew her last name ... it was my ex who checked herself out 1 day before i got there. I attempted suicide that night failed then got combative with the manager of the facility after he gripped me up for calling my emergency contact. I end up in hand cuffs in a cop car shoulder out of socket and at Wilmington hospital in the capes unit. I just finished 15 days of detox and I'm now staying with my grandfather until my insurance kicks in and I can go to banyan. Maybe the girl this is about will see it and message me to let me know she's ok dont have very high hopes tho"

For now at least, I can manage daily life with it.

Managing daily life unfortunately isn't the same as being happy with it. The symptoms, which I will refrain from talking about, are... A pain in the ass to deal with. I pretend to be alright and try to be happy and present my best side to everyone I meet, but it still feels like a veil covers me from people. It feels like a layer of fog separating me from reality. 

Recently, I moved to Spain, to study a four year degree here. It's a wonderful place, but the language barrier and my own health just wears down my mental state. I'm tired and exhausted and I'd just like a friend or a companion or just a hug.

This was just a vent, I don't have anyone else to tell this to nor would I randomly impose it on someone. An advantage of an anonymous internet community, am I right? 😂

Sometimes I get so desperately lonely but at the same time I’d rather sulk in my bed than hit someone up to go for a beer or something, just because I don’t have the social juice to be around them for any meaningful period of time. I’m just being transparent. Anyone else feel like this?"

idk I don't leave the house often so I guess I rarely get the chance to meet people, but even when I do it kind of feels like the person I was isn't there anymore, I don't feel any connections, kind of realised how bad it'd gotten when I realised if I died there genuinely wouldn't be anyone there to notice.

lonely,"Struggling to get over someone, advice seriously needed.","Struggling to get over someone, advice seriously needed. - Where do I begin.

I'm a 30 year old man working as a carer currently so do not get much in the way of social interaction.

During the lockdowns I struggled immensely with alcoholism and went into a downward spiral, I was struggling badly.

It came to a point where I subconsciously reached out to my neighbours, I stayed far away from the door naturally. 

I was greeted by a smiling woman who patiently listened to my inebriated nonsense, I was bedazzled by her beauty.

I became obsessed with her, like she was my ticket out of dodge, finally an interesting person who could uplift me and reintroduce me to the wonderful world of social interaction. 

I tried to message her on Facebook once and was promptly blocked, I was quite sad but figured OK she isn't it, I moved on.

Weeks rolled by and she started appearing physically  I mean literally walking up to me in a supermarket locking eyes, I was shocked, she slowly approached me looking me in the eyes happily, I didn't know how to respond so I walked away, huge mistake.

There have been other encounters but I always avoided and ignored her, ghosting is the phrase I think.

She eventually stopped, the times I see her now she looks very unimpressed, angry even.

In a drunken stupor I recently tried contacting her again asking why she behaved like that, blocked.

Clearly this will never go anywhere, it's a dead end, her change of heart clearly went away and she doesn't care, how do I move past this?

I regret ghosting her she seemed really nice but my social anxiety is crippling and I was in a very bad place back then.

Any advice is greatly appreciated."

lonely,My attempt at being vulnerable,"My attempt at being vulnerable - Not sure if this belongs here but here we go.

Being open with how I feel has never been a strong point of mine. I normally keep any unsightly emotion hidden and to myself, never letting anyone see me cry, and honestly I feel like I've become isolated from everyone around me. I know the solution to this problem is to be more open but the problem is that I feel like no one will care or they leave me or think less of me in a way. 

I guess the main reason i think this is because I have no self worth. I find the whole idea of people just liking me for just being me unimaginable, even with the one close friend I do have there is a part of me that sometimes thinks they might be hanging out with me out of pity since I won't have anyone else if they left me. I know that's not true but I can't help but feel that way sometimes.

I sometimes cry myself to sleep wishing that someone would hold me and tell me they love me but feel like no one would.

I constantly feel touch starved but at the same time afraid of it, afraid that if I let someone hold me lovingly that I might breakdown and show the more vulnerable side of me, the side of me that's a complete mess, the side of me I'm afraid people won't love.

lonely,Is it common to keep loosing friends and having fall outs? [23 F],"Is it common to keep loosing friends and having fall outs? [23 F] - Here’s so context: 

I’m 23 years old and I don’t have any friends. I’m getting my masters, I work, I try to work out, pay my own bills, and people would consider me as attractive. I still live with my parents. When I do make friends I try my hardest to be a good friend. I listen to them, I pay for them, I drive them everywhere, I ask them when they need help, i always meet their parents, etc. I self reflect critically when I see them pushing away. Trying to asses what I could do different so they don’t hate me or find me boring. But ultimately they end up leaving. I’m just confused because partially I know it’s not my fault because I’ve tried hard to be their friend when they didn’t try to be my friend. I had a couple best friends from college. But my boyfriend told me that they were taking of advantage of me. They never wanted to come over my parents house or meet my parents when I asked them to do me a favor they never seemed to want to do it. We would only hang out on their terms and I was the only one that was listening to their problems. But if  i had nothing to do with them leaving then why do I keep loosing friends? Why do I feel like the common denominator? Is it because of the people I choose to be friends with aren’t emotionally developed or is it because there’s something wrong with me?"

lonely,How are you supposed to make friends without social media?,"How are you supposed to make friends without social media? - I'm 23 and have literally zero friends and have no idea how to make any.

I'm a sociable guy, wouldn't consider myself introverted or shy but used to be in middleschool and highschool. 

I've been through college 2 times (dropped out the first) and the best I can do is acquaintances, either people I worked with for group assignments or my roommates. I got along decently well with everyone I interacted with, but it never seemed to get anywhere. 

When it comes to online friendships, it's the same. I can talk to tons of people on discord, no problem in voicechatting strangers, but no one is open to forming bonds. I joined hundreds of random servers and they're either full of kids, people who already formed their own groups, or people that simply don't care for socializing. 

I don't really like multiplayer games much but tried playing a few to see if something would come of it, though it's the same situation. People are already playing with their friends, and adding strangers won't do much, at best it's another acquaintance that might share some messages back and forth once a week. 

My hobbies don't include anything sociable and I have no time to pick up a sport or anything like that. 

Though somehow, I never had problem with dating and relationships. I've had multiple girlfriends and a few boyfriends (I'm bi), which I end up investing too much into and becoming somewhat codependant due to my lack of friendships. 

The only time I had friends was when I was 17 and it only lasted a year or so. I was a mess at the time, going through severe depression, very shy, and could barely talk to anyone, as well as overweight. I was accepted into a group because one guy started speaking to me on the first day.

I'm guessing my problem is I never had social media, so I can't follow people I talk to and create a social circle. I remember on the first day of one of the colleges I attended some students wanted to add me on facebook, and when I told them I didn't have it they lost interest.

I can't fix this either since you need a social life to have social media. Or at least I should have made some friends in highschool, and went to the same college as them

Am I permanently screwed for not being able to go back in time, beat my introverted self up and force him to create a healthy social circle? The more effort I put in the more I believe this. Lately I have just given up and have been focusing on my gf and hobbies, but there's always something missing."

The second I could take care of myself, I was then “capable” of caring for other people and most of the time that burden was emotional. I was “mature” for my age, and adults talked to me like I was another adult. I don’t regret being there for anyone emotionally, I actually enjoy helping people and being able to bring joy and make a difference for someone. But no one ever asked if I was okay. I’ve had a handful of friendships where at points I could have sworn that this person, or these people, would be in my life forever. That I was happy, and thankful for them. But it was almost like regardless of what I did, at some point I was just fucked over for lack of a better term. I was never treated as well as I would see them treat their other friends. I feel like an inconvenience in friendships or relationships, and I don’t really get why.. let alone how to change it. It’s probably worse now because at this point I just don’t really open up anymore and I’m realizing just how alone I feel. I’m realizing that just because I can cope and be “fine” on my own, that I haven’t felt anything more than just “fine” (or worse) in a long time. I’m tired of this numb auto-pilot.

I believe god will always love me no matter what so keeps me going. I feel lonely surrounded by friends and family. I’ve never had a best friend and nobody has ever liked me for who I was. I wish someone saw me like they see the sky and stars. I have so much to give but nobody sees it. Nobody has ever complimented me and nobody approaches me at all. Sometimes I feel like I have nothing special. I’m short, not a 4.0 student, not that athletic ( I used to be) , my confidence is destroyed after so many years. Every day I hope someone will care about me. I want to do so many things to show how much I would love someone but I don’t think I’ll happen. I know “ it’s all your mentality “ bs lmao. I’m not dumb lmao, I’m self aware of what society thinks and on the individual level of certain people o have met. I feel sad. I don’t need help from nobody as nothing will change and words won’t help for shit either. I just hope someone comes along and cares about me as I would care about them. Maybe one day…… but I don’t think so anymore. 20 years of my life I’ve never been liked or loved so what’s 60 more years yk?"

I know I'm not weak but my strength is getting weary. I seek a connection beyond what the earth has to offer. I feel lost, I need a way out of these shackles keeping me in this body.

lonely,Village life,"Village life - 5 years ago I moved to a village of 1 300. I'm 14 years old and it's starting to hit me that I have no friends. There are literally no people of similar age in this village. This caused me to started turning from an extrovert to a rather introverted person and I hate weekends and holidays, because I just stay home, since I've got nobody to hang out with.

I am so excited to turn 18, hopefully make some money and get out of here. My hope to have a great social life before 18 is 0%.

lonely,Nobody Talks to Me,"Nobody Talks to Me - I guess this will just be me ranting about how I feel(though I'm not sure how far from the norm that is here lol), most of my life(21M) it seems like people have avoided me. Whenever I sit down for a lecture I can't help but notice the space that people always leave between me and them(this is true even before covid). People get together in groups at classes and bond, and I'm left alone, and I'm getting tired of nothing changing. I'm just tired of the stress that comes with this idea that the only way I can make more friends or connections is by me reaching out. This is the same frustration I experience having to always be the one to confirm meetups with friends lest I end up somewhere alone. The worst feeling I get though, is when I'm surrounded by friends, and everyone is having fun, I get this moment of disconnection, where I'm left looking at the ground wondering what the fuck I'm even doing here, what could I possibly add? I'm sure it is a shared sentiment, but no matter what I do it seems nothing ever changes. Honestly even writing this makes me afraid I look entitled. 
I'm not sure what I've accomplished writing this, but I guess the least I can hope for is that someone resonated with what I've said and feels a little less alone for it.

lonely,What was the point,"What was the point - I spend the last few years working and preparing so that I could go to start my study and pursue a higher career. All the while I was lonely and depressed, but I channelled all of my depression and sadness into energy with the knowledge that it will get better once I make it.

I did it. I don't have to work for a while as I study. I'm doing well in class. I should finally be happy, this is what I was waiting for.

I'm not.

So what's the point.

I'd rather take those years back and spend them with friends, or someone who loves me, instead of shut in by myself grinding away at a pointless goal. But in hindsight I don't have any friends and the only girl I've ever loved didn't love me back so that was probably never possible anyway.

I'm 23 now, most people tell me I'm young and I still have plenty of time ahead of me to make choices, but I already feel like the end is getting pretty close. It's just a feeling you know? When I look ahead at the future I don't see where I am in my 30s or 40s anymore. I can't see that far, because I don't think it'll come."

Can someone let me know how it makes you feel? If it feels like a attack, or wordy or complicated.

I am open to suggestions!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why do you suddenly care about my personal life now?  
&gt;  
&gt;Please this cycle we have together is unhealthy.  
While we are at work we catch up, grow, help each other, bond. But when we are not at work I'm left to be ignored, felt expendable with no closure as to why.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The expectation was that we would at least be BFFs, but I suppose that was naïve of me.   
Seeing our track history of asking you to hang out was simply ignored.  
Then anytime the subject change a response would be swift along with a apology.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s gotten to a point where your apologies to me are simply a epimone of semantic satiation.  
&gt;  
&gt;You have raised me up from my darkness and shown me what is truly important in life. Friends and Family.  
I have always had it as a afterthought, but now it’s a part of me worth protecting. Only for me to realize that I have missed out on so much. I concentrated on what isn’t important.  
&gt;  
&gt;You were there when I needed cheering up, or calming down, but when I need you the most or when you need me you aren't there, I want to help you in your time of need, to lift up your spirits as good friends do.  
But how can I even call us friends when you don’t even what to talk or get coffee or something mundane?   
Even with friends. I have always had hope that you just needed space and when I extend an olive branch to you, that too gets ignored.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I've already had four emotional breakdowns in the past month. Because I genuinely miss your company, and my slow sad realization that I have no one. Not even to talk to.   
&gt;  
&gt;It’s too much for me to handle. My mental health is deteriorating as a result.  
Where I grew up from, being ignored is one of the most gravest of insults.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If you need me to be at your side I will be there I will drop whatever I'm doing and come to you, no questions asked, no judgements. Because that’s what good friends do.  
&gt;  
&gt;But please never talk to me about anything that isn’t work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hence to we are strictly co-workers.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;That’s what you wanted right?  
What did you want from our relationship? With no closure to our expectations."

Second relationship ended after a year of dating because he apparently wasn't over his ex.
And I had finally met someone who I instantly connected with and felt that genuine love again, only for his therapist to say he should be focusing on his mental well being rather than a relationship.

I don't understand why I can't just have one nice thing like this for myself :( I'm tired of being alone and never having a chance, even when I do make a move people are so dry or just reject me right off the bat. I'm tired of being lonely I just want to feel loved again and have someone by my side. Maybe I'm just meant to stay alone, or maybe I'm just not good enough for anyone..."

So my big 21st birthday was spent at a small sushi dinner with my girlfriend and me getting drunk alone in my room.

I wish my friends were here. I wish they even remembered today was my birthday.

I know that messaging me isn't really worth it when they are all living together, but I wish I got a simple happy birthday without having to remind them that it's my birthday."

lonely,I'm loosing my mind! I miss human touch!,"I'm loosing my mind! I miss human touch! - Seriously, there is no one in my circle of friends that understand what I'm feeling. I havent had a relationship in 5 years becusse my self confidence has been destroyed by the previous relationship. Any attempt at a one night stand leads me to a dead end. 

I also live with two couples for roommates. One of them aren't so bad, but the other are always being affectionate to each other, like always giving little kisses and hugging every single day. I try not to let it bother me, it's their home too and they should be free to do what they want, but I absolutely HATE it when they do it in front of me, as it just reminds me of how pathetic and lonely my life is.

All I want is human touch. I go through a depressive state almost everyday now. One roommate (the girl from the couple that aren't that bad) is kind and always says if I need someone to talk to that she's there. But I feel she wouldn't understand. 
I FEEL LIKE NO ONE UNDERSTANDS.

Most of my friends are in relationships, and those that are single are just as happy as those who are in relationships. And I'm partly happy to be single, I like the freedom, but sometimes it's so damn hard, especially when you look at those who live with you who remind you every single day about what you don't have.

I wanted to stay single so that I could get involved with other people on a one night stand basis and explore myself before allowing myself to start dating again. But I can't even do that right as I haven't had sex in 5 fucking years.

I've lost so much hope. And I know I have friends, but there's still this empty, lonely feeling inside of me. 
I mean, Do I have to just learn to live with this? 
Cause if so, I don't know if I can!

Rant Over!"
lonely,I don’t know how to be independent,"I don’t know how to be independent - So ever since I was little I would hide behind confident people as a way to navigate life. That continued throughout high school too. Wether it be friends who eventually left or relationships, I’ve never truly been on my own. 

I was in a relationship for over a year. But  my partner was a confident personality that I grew à dépendance onto.  We had an argument that now we basically have to start from scratch again, almost like an extreme break. 

I feel alone, he is/was the only person present in my life and that I actually enjoy having around. Now it feels like I have no one and I’m left alone with my thoughts. He used to help me a lot, especially since I’ve moved out on my own at the beginning of September for the first time. I feel like I don’t know how to function and I have now confidence in my choices. It’s such an isolating and negative feeling."

A lot of the time i feel too desperate for some type of human interaction to fall asleep. I can’t shut my brain off cause its just desperate for that feeling.

I have sleeping pills from the doctor which i do take when this happens, but a forced shutdown doesn’t feel good. Whats worse is when the pills don’t put me all the way out, then i’m just confused and groggy and sad.

lonely,Never been so lonely in my life until now.,"Never been so lonely in my life until now. - I’m an only child (F29) and was raised by a single mother, grandparents, few aunts and uncles plus cousins. A lot of my relatives have passed on, including my dad. 

My parents immigrated from Europe to the US but my mother moved back aboard. I only have one aunt, one uncle and one cousin here, that live 2 hours away. 

Living throughout the pandemic by myself has been incredibly lonely. I mean, at first I kinda liked being at home, not having to go to work, I still saw my relatives a couple of times in the summer of 2020. And then my aunt got sick, had to undergo treatments and I wasn’t allowed to visit anymore as I posed a risk. She was immuno-compromised and terrified of covid. Don’t get my wrong I am too, but I’ve been super careful all this time and knock on wood, haven’t caught it. 

I had a friend invite me over for Thanksgiving last year but I spent Christmas alone :( Then a few months passed, I felt so numb, I isolated myself from some friends. When I reached out and apologized for my lack of communication they turned their backs and wanted nothing to do with me. So I lost a couple friends :(

Fast forward to now, my aunt still refuses to have me over. She said I’m not allowed to come over and stay, if anything she might be willing to hang out with me outside…
The last conversation I had with her just left me in tears. I couldn’t control my anger and sadness. 

Throughout this pandemic, I have completely lost a sense of family. I haven’t celebrated any holidays with anyone in 2 years now. My friends left me, I still have a few other friends but they all have their busy lives, with families, nieces, nephews, partners. I legit have no one. 

It hurts so bad, especially because I’m very family oriented. I always longed to have my own family and become part of a future partner’s family. There’s still time for that I guess, but in the meantime, I’ve lost my will to live. I hate my life now, especially the part where I’m unable to celebrate events with family. I see my mother, celebrating the birth of her stepsons baby but I’m so far away , I can’t be there. Plus travel still makes me nervous during covid. 

Anyways, just needed to get this off my chest. Whoever reads this, thank you 🙏"
lonely,I just want someone who is always genuinely interested in talking to me,"I just want someone who is always genuinely interested in talking to me - I absolutely hate having to initiate conversations first but hell if I don't then it'll never happen. Sometimes I think friendships aren't even worth it, I'd honestly prefer to be filthy rich with no friends than to be poor and have no friends. Makes it so much worse with ADHD cause I'm constantly thinking that I'm not good enough for a genuine friendship/relationship. And when I get in those ""moods"" I don't do a damn thing. Trash collects in my room until I force myself to clean it or when it becomes too much. And don't get me started on laying in my bed listening to music for hours and hours until work. Eh, I'll be fine in a few hours when I get home from work.

lonely,"I’m emotionally exhausted by my “friends”, who constantly talk over me, belittle what I have to say, and actively ignore me.","I’m emotionally exhausted by my “friends”, who constantly talk over me, belittle what I have to say, and actively ignore me. - The only time my friends hang out together is when I plan something (well in advance) and be a nuisance about it happening. The only time I get to catch up with them is when I bring up how my life is going. They plan things together and don’t invite me. When I bring up wanting to go, they say “next time,” but next time doesn’t happen either. I feel so isolated from people I thought loved me and cared about me. But none of them care to see me. None of them are ever the first to reach out. It’s genuinely always me putting in the effort. 

My trivia team will consistently ignore my (correct) answers, interrupt me when I’m contributing to a conversation, and talk down about my likes and hobbies to me. (I’m sorry liking the Bachelorette isn’t cool, I guess.) It’s getting to the point that being on my team is so draining to what used to be my favourite hobby, that I don’t want to go anymore. I get purposefully excluded from plans made directly in front of me and I can’t complain, because I feel like they’d treat me worse for doing it. 

The new friend groups I get introduced to always seem to end up neutral towards me at first and then do the same thing. They talk over me, ignore my input in conversations, or ignore me in settings where they don’t have to associate with me. I feel invisible in new situations/with those people, even though I’m an extrovert. 

If I’m an asshole, why can’t I just be likeable to other assholes at least? I’ve been to therapy over this. I feel like the biggest dick whenever someone stops me mid sentence to change a subject. I have to be, right? I don’t think I’m being problematic at all, but for some reason my friends make me feel so lesser. I’m never a priority to them. 

I’m so alone. It never feels like anyone in my friend groups care. Even when I tell the person I call a best friend how I’m feeling, I end up getting shrugged off and overlooked. I’m drowning in loneliness, despite being surrounded by friends. 

If I knew how I was being such an awful person or being so annoying or what about me was such a terrible thing that makes people act like that around me, I’d fix it. I’d do anything to fix it. I want to be likeable. I want to make friends and feel like they appreciate me too. 

I just want to have friends who treat me like a friend, too."

lonely,I don't know what to do anymore. I want to end things now more than ever.,"I don't know what to do anymore. I want to end things now more than ever. - I have never been intimate with a woman or ever been in a relationship. My whole life I have felt so alone and worthless because of this. It has hindered any ability for me to feel positive or confident in myself. How can I ever feel good about myself when no woman has ever wanted to have sex with me or even love me? Every single day I wake up to a life that I hate and despise and I have no one else to blame but myself. All I ever wanted was a normal life and every single day I am reminded of the fact that I have never been good enough to obtain that. What can make a man feel more worthless than being devoid of any kind of love or intimacy in his life?

I just called my parents today and I blew up at them about how much I have hated my life and wanted to end it. They couldn't even believe it, as they had supported me financially throughout college and even now in med school. It was an incredibly selfish and entitled thing today to them but it was true. I had no one else to say it to. That I didn't even care about med school anymore because of how lonely I was. I couldn't even tell them the real reason is that I'm just a stupid pathetic virgin because they would never understand. I have failed as a son.

I just want to go back to when I was a kid and right my wrongs but I will never be able to. I simply just can't stand this kind of pain anymore. It is numbing me so much. I can't enjoy anything in life anymore. Every day I just want to get high and go to sleep. This is such a shitty life and I don't want to be a part of it anymore. I'm sorry that I failed everyone. I wish that I was better."

Throughout my 20’s I’ve tried hard not to let this bother me and succeeded mostly because 1) I keep focused on my goals and what makes me happy, and 2) I’ve always had this belief that I’ll meet the right friends in time, that it will happen naturally and will be sort of “meant” (the same belief I have about eventually finding a lasting partner). This belief has kept my mind mostly at peace with my social situation. 

But that belief is dwindling. I feel as I get older I should forget about that and accept that I may be alone for much longer than I’d like. I’m just horribly depressed and wanted to vent"
lonely,just venting,"just venting - I used to have big ass energy going to college thinking i might find the one.

 Now I'm almost at the end of my 4th year and i don't go to college anymore cause i literally lost hope. i can easily say i haven't had any romantic shit in my life, which is suck. somedays I accept the fact that i'm a mess and no one would ever even think of choosing me, but other days it become so hard to cope with it. we all want to be chosen, loved, cared about. it's human nature. but i guess it's so much to ask, at least for me."
lonely,Birthday Today,"Birthday Today - Tough one. Been a hard year. I’ve never treated birthdays like a big deal, but for the last two years my best friend made them special.

This year, me and that friend went separate ways (by their choice), so I wasn’t sure how this year’s would go. I had known them for going on six years, and that split ruined me earlier in the year. Thankfully, some friends on Discord made me feel welcomed today and we all watched a movie. 

I know there are people on here who’ve been through the same things as I have, and I also know there are people on here with less than me. I just want to say to keep your heads up, and to keep trying. Not to say, “it gets better,” but if you keep trying to make things better for yourself first and foremost, it can get better.

lonely,Is there an end to this pain?,"Is there an end to this pain? - Hey everyone - it's been about 15 years since I was an active member on Reddit...wish I was coming back under better circumstances.  I was actually a bit nervous to post because of the subject matter and worried that my post would just get passed over....Anyways, I was married for 12 years, we had an amazing daughter, and then we divorced 6 years ago.  She re-married quickly and I remained single (not for lack of trying).  I feel broken and unwanted.  I tried all the ""quick fix rebound"" apps and even paid services.  Nothing.  NOTHING.  I was paying for a daily reminder that I am unwanted.  This really pissed me off and I cancelled everything.  I haven't had the company of a woman (even just as friends) or the gentle touch of a woman in 6 years....agonizing.  Up to the point of graduating college, I always had girlfriends, so this wasn't a chronic issue....these days however, it feels like a living hell (there are other issues, but loneliness is the big chief of the tribe).  Every girl that I've been with I've met in a natural, fluid way, and they've all been multi year relationships....the apps and paid services seem akin to 'hunting' down a relationship and that just seems forced and kinda gross.  My best friend's girlfriends have all been from apps and not a single one has made it past 6-8 months.  God, I can't adequately express how much pain this is causing me.  It's to the point that if I see a happy couple, I feel rage inside, because they have the very thing that I want most in my life.  I feel like I'm branded with a scarlet letter that wards off any potential interest or that some metaphysical force has taken an interest in me and feeds off my pain.  Must be delicious.  I read somewhere that severe loneliness can have the same effect on your health as smoking a pack a day.  Just gets better and better.

All I ever do is overthink all the negative things that I think are happening. In reality I’m just putting myself down, letting this vicious cycle take over my life. 

Okay, I’ve had a bad situation for so many years, so what? I haven’t taken the step to overcome my struggle, it’s on me. I don’t have any friends? I just need to find some and really put in that effort to befriend a person. I have a disease that makes it, in my mind, literally impossible to feel happy and find my place in the world (friends most of all), should I listen to myself? No! I’m just being a hindrance to my own growth. 

I felt sorry for myself each and every time because I sit on a wheelchair and I can’t do things like other able-bodied people. Who the hell cares? I literally got tired of myself and I’m really feeling down. But man, I’m such a dumb guy for letting myself down. Eff that, I’m gonna live life how I envisioned it, not by something I fed to myself for years. 

This is gonna be a reminder to myself for a long time to come. I’m myself and I deserve a place in the world, I know that. So I’m gonna become a better me, and overcome this loneliness.

lonely,"Feeling trapped in an endless loop of pain, sadness and numbness with no one to talk to","Feeling trapped in an endless loop of pain, sadness and numbness with no one to talk to - My parents were divorced since I was 3, now im 17 and in the past year I have been tortured with heartbreak, abusive relationships, loneliness, failure, depression, anxiety, stress and the worse part is I don't have anyone to talk to about this.

The heartbreak I had to endure a few months ago also came with the loss of my best friend who I talked to on and off ever since I was ~8, I said some stupid, untrue things that I regret saying and it led to her not wanting anything to do with me, I honestly think its for the best because we cant make it work, we tried.

She was the first and only person I ever cried and opened to, at one point I truly felt like I found someone I could spend the rest of my life with, you can imagine how I felt when I realized she's never coming back, I still think about her everyday.

The abusive relationships are my mom and brother, bothI truly hate from the bottom of my heart.

my mom is the most manipulative and heartless person I know, last time we talked she shouted at me and told me to pack my things, I said nothing but as I was getting ready I started crying, not because I care about her but more of like coming to understand how fast my life is going downhill, she noticed and started crying herself and told me not to go, I left and went to my dad's.

As I was walking home, my brother sent me messages like ""you always ruin everything"", ""you are a shit brother"" and it was very painful for me so I turned off my phone.

My brother lives with my dad and has a room here but since my mom ""has custody"" my dad couldn't spend money on a bigger house with a room for me so I sleep in the living room, play on my pc most of the day there which basically means 0 privacy, I have had a few breakdowns because of it in the past but I tried to overlook it this time.

Now my brother hated me from the point I arrived because basically he believes and sides with anything my mom does and wont listen to anything else so as I got there he screamed at me and my dad when we were having dinner, I just didn't reply

The following week I tried to small talk with him to see if he calmed down and it kinda seemed like it but then came today, today I was playing with my friends on my pc at 6pm and as I said before im in the living room and I raised my voice because I didn't know anyone was home, then my brother screams at me to shut up and that he is trying to sleep, I told him that I didn't know and he screamed shut up when I tried to say anything, I got mad and told him that hes an idiot and he came and hit me on my head, I got very angry and he made fun of me and told me a lot of hurtful things.

I went outside to breathe and relax and 10 minutes later my dad comes and I tell him what happens and basically my brother denies it and screams and it led to another fight, at this point it reminded me of my mom and I couldn't hold the pain back so I started crying and went to my computer and blasted music because I didn't want to deal with this shit anymore.

This has been going for the past year and I just cant do this anymore I want to find a job and save money so I can live by myself finally as soon as possible.

I doubt anyone read all of this I just realized I have been typing for 30 minutes now, but this is the only way for me to share my feelings with anyone"

lonely,"If this is my last chance, can we be friends?","If this is my last chance, can we be friends? - Trigger Warning(s): self harm via isolation, starving, suicidal ideation

Before I get into the main post I would like to provide some background information. I am a 22 year old female that normally works 2 part time jobs, and is also a full time student. I have a roommate and we both normally work about 35+ hours a week to maintain our small apart because we have both moved out to escape toxic family situations. Since moving out I wanted to believe that my mental health would magically improve since my family was a major part of my issues. Spoiler alert: it didn't.  The past 1 has proven it. Nearly 7-8 months ago things were looking up before crashing down. 

I started having intense mental health issues that nearly sent me to the psychiatric ward once and has caused panic attacks, emotional episodes, and disassociation. I went to multiple  medical professionals and was given a proper diagnoses that were linked to my problems. It turns out that my toxic family trauma has done far more than I was willing to upset. 

I have a therapist, take daily medication, and will soon be having a psychiatrist as well as needed to help with the severity of my mental health. My first therapist left due to receiving another position and while I was crushed I accepted it because I wanted/still want the best for her as she is an amazing woman. She has been a significant part of my mental health journey and accepting trauma. I left my first customer service job due to the harassment of the customers and lost pretty much more work/friends I have had. I started another job in which my manager degraded me in every way shape or form. I was told I was useless and a waste. But I had no choice but to keep working and I made some what friends there. Things there took a severely negative turn. I ended up leaving that job to another employer that ended up firing me for something seemingly race related but it is not enough to actually build a case over.

 I was jobless/still am jobless to this day and due to an error I made on my unemployment I was denied and now have to continue to wait to fix it. Which is even more frightening because I have no money for food, medication, bills after selling/pawning most things I have that are of value. Even with all this happening the only thing that delivers the most hurt is the fact that I am alone. I do not fear death but rather the possibility that no one will know I was gone. I would rather have nothing and be someone's everything. Then just have everything and be nothing to anyone. 

And with all that I have no friends, near or close to me. I stay in my room and I cry softly to not disturb my roommate. I don't go anywhere, I have little to no food in my home outside of food for my cats. After nearly attempting suicide my family has tried to be supportive but ultimately has seemed to push me as an afterthought until they decide to drag me into their drama or want something from me. The few friends I had have either ignored me or more or less diverted their attention to their life. I can honestly say that I have no reason to live. I am so used to making sure everyone else around is taken care of that I no longer know how to really care or do things for myself. 

I go to therapy, I have tried positive thinking, crafting, I take my medications and have even tried to force myself into exercising and going down a route to become healthy in some sort of hope that it will make me want to continue to be here. I cook and clean, I care. I vent I try to do everything to somehow pull myself out of this dark space and I do for a while just to fall down again.  I have given up on trying for myself, it is wasted effort if I don't know what I want or how to obtain it. But one thing I can always say is that while I may not have much I enjoy friendship. Having someone to care for or to talk too. So if this is my last chance at happiness  I would rather spend it being useful but also something that I can enjoy as well. 

My life has been misery and while I may not be able to stop or control at the moment I can control one factor. Which is to not shut everything out. So if I only have this chance can I be your friend? It doesn't matter what we talk about, experience, or go through I'm more than happy to sit and be friends with any or anyone that way. The loneliness will fade and no matter what happens or what is done. No one deserves to be alone by default. I'll always try my best to message and reply and enjoy the good moments while they last."

As i grow up i learned that the idea of having best friends shouldn't be forced and whenever i have a best friend it always goes to an ending, also the idea of having a girlfriend for the intent of feeling loved and wanted, i find myself numb to feel love because i had a bad experience that was very bad emotionally and got me off at the time with the lessons that led me to believe that i could never trust woman or being truly loved, but now i feel much more relaxed and i've tried to talk to girls by dm's and it was a good experience that got me off of feeling terrible for not having the confidence to talk to a woman, i can't date because i'm in a bad life situation, finished my studies and there's no jobs and im in a poor country, it's the single most painful thing it's like having no life and you're stuck, i'm trynna find a way to leave its extremely hard to be able to leave my country people are drowning in the sea and risking thier live in little boats just to have a better living, and the idea of leaving gives me the little energy to keep up (sorry this id out of context but it still important to mention). I've always been depressed and stressed, stuck in daydreaming and very frustrated, and i had no support or care from anyone, it was just me all along and now i got used to be me, and i look at the entourage of people surrounding me and i feel good that i'm lonely, i see a lot of hypocrisy and negative energy and envy in these people, i run for 20min  everyday and i do little bit of home exercise with so little,(i can't afford a gym membership), i listen to music, i read pdfs, i'm a fan of the UFC...

lonely,Remember: Keep your exepectations low but not your standards.,"Remember: Keep your exepectations low but not your standards. - Yeah, we get it, majority of us are probably friendless, touched starved, or in a relationship but perpetually feeling alone type of people here. 

Just because you found one “friend” or someone to talk to in years doesn't mean you won't be alone anymore in the future. 

Just because you got a gf/bf now doesn't mean you'll be in a happy relationship for years to come. 

You need to not only lower your expectations but to raise your standards to realistic levels. Not only that but it's important to not place your happiness on that person/group of people. Because what are you gonna do if they aren't around anymore? Sit around in a sad state until someone comes around to make you happy for a few months or years and goes away just like the other friends/lover? 

I'm not telling you to act like some edgelord or tsundere pretending to not want to be friends with people but you want to be friends with those people but you hope that they can indirectly pass your emotional walls. I'm telling you not to expect much or anything. Because expecting one person to be your BFF or lifetime soulmate causes shallow relationships to happen because that person isn't filling that void you've been feeling.

I realize that loneliness makes most (not all) people desperate so they'll latch onto anyone who shows them the bare minimum of kindness and basic decency. But this also ends up attracting toxic relationships. Build up your self-worth. If no one respects you, start respecting yourself. Don't settle yourself for less but don't expect much. If you think this is some motivational I ripped from a TED talk or even a motivation post, think again. 

This is to prevent and plan feelings of disappointment."

I’m sick of being alone but i know if i find someone I’ll just end up shutting them out like i do with everyone. I have nothing to give anyone anyways. I can barely hold a conversation and I don’t have anything special about me. It’s a never ending cycle of “i want this” but “you don’t deserve it”.

lonely,I honestly don't know anymore.,"I honestly don't know anymore. - During summer I felt awsome. No problems in life what so ever. I had finally let go of the person I fell in love with but she didn't see me in the same way. I'd finally managed to just try and live life to the fullest.I almost forgot how it felt to be sad. 

But now that the summer is over, i'm starting to feel how that constant happiness that I had felt before is slowly fading away from me. I'd most likely be very depressed at this point if it weren't for my  friends.

One thing that I learned while I was constantly happy was that being alone felt better than being together with someone, that being alone ment that there is nothing that I have to think about other than myself. I told myself that I'd rather live alone with my thoughts and use the time to find myself. 

But now.. Now I don't know anymore. I'm still trying to tell myself that living alone would feel better but I don't know if it would. 

I am afraid to catch feelings for someone I have known for a couple of weeks now because of the fear that I'm going to feel as down as I did when I fell in love the first time. I want to keep my feelings for her as neutral as possible just because of that fear and because I don't want to lose our friendship if things wouldn't go in the way i'd like. 

Is there anyone who has been through something along the same line?"

Here’s a link to my pictures. Now let’s look at the facts. I am 26. My whole life I’ve struggled with making friends. Not one friend I had ever lasted. Not one. I never had a girlfriend. I feel like I’m the one who is always more interested in other people than they are in me. Now look at the average person my age. The average person my age has been in multiple relationships by 26 and many have had friendships for years.

As a matter of fact I have tried for years to get with a girl I liked and she never accepted me. Another guy became her boyfriend only after 3 months of knowing her. It implies that there is a problem with me. Other people have something I don’t or they are doing something right that I’m not doing.

People usually don’t *seem* interested in me but my perception/interpretation could be wrong. Can you look at the pictures and tell me if you notice anything or get any vibes from me that could be causing these problems?

She was my first kiss, too. We got separated and unfortunately had to break up like 9 days into the relationship because we were both busy with our lives and we lived super far away from each other. She ended up breaking up with me and at first I thought I was alright. I was kinda relieved because I didn't take the separation very well because my love language is physical touch. I felt all of the stress coming off me when she broke up with me, but about 2 days later I started to feel lonely again. Every time I see her on social media, how much fun she's having since the break-up, I feel a rush of emotions pumping through me. I feel like I can't breathe and feel very light-headed, like I'm gonna pass out. I feel so lonely. It's been 3 months since the break-up and the loneliness is just not stopping. I see all of my friends changing girlfriends like socks and I still can't get over a 9 day relationship.

  
I've been watching a lot of romance films, especially films by Hayao Miyazaki, since the break up and they make me cry every time. I don't even go hang out with my friends that much anymore. I feel so ostracized by my peers when they talk about how they ''found a new girlfriend in the subway while going to a hockey match'' and how they ''love her so much'' even tho they end up dumping her 2 weeks ago because she ''didn't send enough nudes''. I feel like I can't relate to any of my peers.

  
I know that this is only the start of my love life, but I had this brewing in me and I just had to somehow  vent these emotions I have somewhere.

  
Sorry for my English. It's not my first language. Thanks to this community I can vent here and thank you for your time and for getting through my abysmal grammar."

lonely,how do you fall in love again with the idea of loving someone new?,"how do you fall in love again with the idea of loving someone new? - i have been alone now for some time and im extremely good at isolating from friends &amp; family off and on. 

im content with being alone, but i know there’s a part of me that knows there is more to life. companionship. adventure. love. i experienced a love worth more than words could ever express, but it was toxic beyond belief and maturity. i loved with so much passion that i fear it’s unmatchable. that the next love will be me settling or just doing something i won’t like. i know im only 22 and im not necessarily looking and have time ahead of me, but i don’t know where to start again. i just feel like im stuck in this lonely space of an okay life but i know that i deserve to feel like there’s more &amp; more that i am capable of grasping. 

so...

how do you fall in love again with the idea of loving someone again?

when you fear that you’re going to end up back alone again?"

lonely,I have never felt more alone.,"I have never felt more alone. - I've felt extremely lonely for about three years now - it's been four years since my last relationship. I can't shake the feeling that no matter what I do or who I talk to, I will always be by myself. Even when spending time with friends I feel like I'm the only one in the room, as if I am isolated despite being surrounded by people who, I hope, care about me. However, I was able to convince myself that my loneliness was simply the result of factors such as my environment, a static group dynamic etc, and that I would be able to create new relationships whenever I took the next step in my life.

I recently made the move to University, and I was forced to come to terms with the fact that, no matter where I am or who I talk to, I will always be alone. I still feel like I'm locked inside my own head, unable to speak to anyone about anything that matters. My relationships with those around me have already stagnated, and it's proven impossible to become a part of any new groups as everyone has already created new relationships and friendships - I've missed my chance. I'm typing this out whilst I'm sitting in my room, with no choice but to think about how completely isolated I am from everyone else."

If someone DMs you and tries to get personal information, such as your name, location, phone number, email, etc, report and block them. 

Report and Block.

well lets see:

* *I discovered a new youtube channel, and bingewatched them for 36 hours*
* *I noticed the dishes in my sink had started to get moldy, so I finally washed all of them*
* *I somehow have managed to remain employed at my job, doing just enough not to draw the ire of my boss or coworkers, but also not advancing, or doing anything exciting*
* *I noticed a gray hair a few weeks ago, and plucked it out*
* *I talked to someone on the elevator about the weather a few weeks back*

**""So what are your plans for this weekend?""**

Oh boy this weekend is going to be an absolute banger:

* *Sit alone in my apartment and pass the time shit posting online*
* *I might also do some laundry*
* *If I am feeling particularly daring, I might go for a solo jog or do some solo weightlifting*

Is this weekend going to be a drinking occasion? You bet it is, but not so much that I have a hang over the next day. Drinking is an excellent way to numb the boredom of being alone, but best not to over do it ya know? After all my college days are behind me.

**""Anything new in your \*wink wink\* love life?""**

*Yeah, after exhausting all of the people in my area on Tinder a few weeks ago  I managed to land exactly one (1)  awkward first date where we learned we had nothing in common and never spoke to each other again.*

**""So how are you liking &lt;city of employment&gt;?""**

\- Well lets see, &lt;city&gt; has grocery stores and you can order take out, so thats pretty cool. 

\- It also has lights that come on at night, and when you are on &lt;bridge&gt; you get a great view of them. 

\- It also has &lt;sports team&gt;, and they seem to be doing well this year. Go &lt;sports team&gt;!"

lonely,Living without expecting romance : My Story,"Living without expecting romance : My Story - As a person who hasn't been in a committed relationship &amp; who hasn't had close friends (and who in all probability never will in the future), I would say that self help and self improvement makes you comfortable in your own skin, although they won't guarantee that you'd find a person interested in having a long term relationship with you. Improve on what you want to improve in life for your own satisfaction &amp; your own satisfaction only.


 I used to go to college, get a good job in programming, go to social gatherings with  expectations of finding a great partner to settle with &amp; good close friends who'd be great to hangout with. None of that happened and I was distraught for a few years. I let all that despair flow instead of bottling and ignoring it. While none of that stuff (going to college, getting a well paid programming job etc) helped me to get into a committed relationship or have close friendships, they sure did help me live a good life for myself. And now, I do a lot of things as I have a lot of free time on my hand. Just get the thought of improving yourself for another individual out of your head. Do it for your own satisfaction, or don't do it at all.

Enjoy the small things in life, have minimal expectations in your life, take vacations and go crazy somewhere because you don't have obligations in your personal life to any person as you are not in a relationship. Whatever you do, make sure you don't carry a heavy baggage ( both literally &amp; figuratively).  This has helped me to focus my mind elsewhere than on this shortcoming of mine. I'm preparing myself to die peacefully with no incomplete obligations. 

Life's got a plenty of other things to enjoy if you focus on them. You don't need perfect ambitions for a great life. A man spending his entire life in a prison cell can be happy with the right mindset ( though it is hard to be that way).  I hope my perspective helped you in some way. Good luck to everyone here. 

Au revoir!"

lonely,Loneliness is like drowning,"Loneliness is like drowning - At first there's the dim realisation of what's happening. The sudden instinctive alarm bells that ring throughout your entire being. Desperate, you thrash and flounder with single-minded determination, pushing out against inevitability with your entire being. 

Every now and then, your face might break water, giving you the smallest shred of hope - just enough to keep the struggle going.

But eventually your muscles tire. Your spasmodic flailing proves futile. No one is coming to help you and you now understand that you're too weak to help yourself. You start to sink, and panic turns into existential dread. Why you? What's going to happen? Who's going to care?

And finally a part of yourself - the truest part - gives in. You stop struggling. You stop resisting. You lose all will and strength as you dip beneath the water's surface, submerged by cold, only nothingness.

And there's a sudden wave of peace washing over you as you realise that this is it. The worst part is over. Your fate is sealed. All that remains is to close your eyes and wait until it all slips away. Peace at last."

Believe me, I'm happy for them and I've never had any desire for a relationship with either, but it still hurts. I know this is selfish and I might make me a bad person, but seeing someone I know in a relationship just stings. It's like someone eating in front of you when you're starving, even if they try to be considerate and not flex it in front of me, I still know it's there and it still hurts. It's not their fault in any sense, if it's anyone's fault it's mine. It just seems like everywhere I go people are happy with someone else or themselves, then there's me, who feels like I'll probably die alone. 

I don't really know what I'm trying to get out of this, I want to talk to people I know about it, but they're all either happy being single or in a relationship, so I just don't think they'd understand how it feels. I don't want to cut them out, I know it would probably help me in the long term but they're my friends and they've done a lot to help me especially with these types of problems. Cutting them out for something that isn't even their fault just feels wrong."

All I do is sit and watch TV and YouTube all day fantasizing about the active social life I had when I was in high school but even then I only had a very small handful of friends. I’m simply stuck here alone with myself, my thoughts and what glimpses of society I get from the media I consume. All I do is think.

lonely,This might appear like an odd question.,"This might appear like an odd question. - Do people get a kick/ego boost by not replying to somebody? You know, I'm not the most attractive person and would consider myself to be quite average. So I recently joined some university whattsapp group chats which are dedicated to different courses/things like (programming, chemistry, maths, physics etc.). We even have a party group chat which has like 48 people in it and I wrote my first message into this group by asking who would be down to go to a certain festival this Friday. I got ignored by like 20+ people who read the message and don't get it because before people already eagerly planned and replied and just did stuff together and went to pubs and shit. That leaves me wondering why people just wouldn't wanna reply to me? So far (4 weeks in), I didn't even interact with anybody really and don't think I did something wrong at all. Maybe it's my looks? My aura? Or I should just drop the question and fuck it and go with my former school colleagues which invited me to come with them instead 🤷‍♂️. I just tried to be inquisitive and tried getting to know people from my field of study (BioMed btw). I swear it just sucks to be the person who always pushes for a real, human connection and failing.

lonely,Do you feel like in order to not be lonely is to “put up” with people?,"Do you feel like in order to not be lonely is to “put up” with people? - I am lonely. I feel like I’ve only really had superficial friendships and step away from people as soon as I see what I consider red flags. I’ve always had friends but never the type to turn to or count on. 

I generally just find it really difficult to like people even though I don’t want to be that way. It’s like a running joke that I hate new people but i genuinely do and don’t understand what it’s like not to.

For me people start off as “bad” when I meet them and it’s like in the back of my mind I expect them to prove themselves to me, which nobody could ever live up to because nobody owes me anything. But it gets in the way and I just feel like the people I call friends are just easier to tolerate than other people even though I don’t think we aren’t close.

But whenever somehow someone talks with me about their experiences or past activities from their lives I can't think of anything I could tell about mine because I never experienced any... At least that's what I think... But maybe it's just me trying to hard to find something to talk about. 
Is this common for being lonely?"

Now my partner in loneliness is gone. - We were a team, it felt like we were against all this uncertainty; I help her, she helps me. We could be talking nonstop for days, and the following week have time alone each, and repeat. 

Although she wants to still in touch, it isn't the same it was and its clearly over. It feels strange, I have lost the person with whom I shared everything, even the smallest and most absurd thing. I feel like I'm not going to find someone like that, I look around and I only see people with whom I know I'm not going to fit in, not because I'm pessimistic, but because I've already met people like that, I know how it ends, and I know I'm not comfortable with that.  I also feel lazy to get to know new people thoroughly, I know in part how it will end.  I have no problem meeting people, it is indifferent to me, it is just that I see that it will end badly, and that I will not find another person who wants to be a team and share their loneliness, among other things (also that I still love me ex since she break up not because something bad on me at all but because her personal issues).  

I'm not writing this to ask for advice, I know what to do and what not to do (new advice is always welcome tho), I just wanted to drop it or at least give it a try, and talk to people who might understand it"

lonely,I can’t tell if I’m in a depressive episode or I’m just lazy,"I can’t tell if I’m in a depressive episode or I’m just lazy - my background:

last summer i met up with a psychiatrist the first time. honestly, i felt like i didn’t get to talk about everything ive been feeling, but i got prescribed w/ prozac for 6 months anyways. our first meeting felt so rushed. it was sort of like, “oh just answer the following questions about your family history and your hobbies then we’ll be on our way.”
it was kind of a let down since i had been fighting to get professional help for 7 months before that. But anyways, I got prescribed with Prozac for my low moods (idk if it’s normal for psychiatrists to do that, she didnt say anything about depression)

these past 3 months I’ve been on and off my meds (mostly off), and these past 2 weeks I’ve been feeling really off. it’s been a huge rollercoaster.


1. I’ve been behind on school work. I cant get myself to do it at all, and I feel terrible.
2. I haven’t been attending most of my classes (i’m anxious about my teachers confronting me about my missing work, i had a traumatic experience with a terror teacher once, so this is why).
3. my body dysmorphia has gotten worse, mainly cause of my mom’s comments on my body.
4. empty. Brain fog
5. Have had two major meltdowns these past few weeks, one of them I almost relapsed into self harm
6. Withdrawing/isolating myself from my peers. I can feel them getting worried, including my teachers. I can’t open up with them, I don’t want to because what help can they give me that I haven’t already tried myself?
7. Had a couple of suicidal thoughts during those two major meltdowns


Please help me. I don’t know what to do and how to get on track again."

lonely,Is my friend jealous of me ?,"Is my friend jealous of me ? - Hey guys,

So there's this girl i know and she's said quite a few harsh stuff to me and it really got into my head and made me question my self-worth (it wasn't just what she said but a combination of what she and others said that did). She's said these stuff before to my face:

\- ""XYZ is pretty, not you""

\- ""XYZ can sing, you can't""

\- When someone was complimenting me saying that I looked good, the person who complimented me asked this girl whether she agreed and she didn't really agree with it and I was standing right there!!!

\- She neverrrr compliments me but compliments everyone else

\- She always laughs so hard and gets excited when people put me down and she adds to it - it's like she's waiting for that moment.

I for a fact know that (not bragging), I objectively do look better than her even though that doesn't mean much. But do you guys think she keeeeeeeeps putting me down because she is insecure of herself? It hurts me so much when someone outrightly says stuff like that to my face and i take it to heart even though im learning not to.

if all these comments are coming from a place of insecurity or jealousy, this is really pushing me harder to work on my appearance (like i feel motivated lol)

I think she likes me personality because we used to get on quite well until she started putting me down for my looks.

thanks!"

lonely,Pushing everyone away because my dad died - replacing them with drugs :(,"Pushing everyone away because my dad died - replacing them with drugs :( - My dad died to covid a week ago, I’ve (F20) blocked and ghosted lots of peps since. People that know me since a kid know this routine and just wait for the episode to go by- which has taken months of no contact before. 

Difference is that I moved out of my moms houses and I live alone. So the loneliness is amplified by 100. 

I’ve ditched work and just tripped on lsd, done coke and eat aderall as much as possible. My excuse which I had to to take care of legal stuff but I really didn’t need to have a whole week off. 

I was doing coke for 2 months everyday, and trip every weekend. Now I got a prescription for aderall I don’t need and I’m eating that, haven’t done coke in 5 days but I still want some. 

I had a little manic episode and the day my dad died- I got the call in the early morning and still decided to go to work. I felt so much pain that it switched into euphoria. I was on scooter and I live on the top of a huge hill heading straight into downtown. For a second I was convinced I was god and jumped of the scooter. Fucking myself and trembling down. I went into work full with bloody clothes. Which tripped everyone out because it’s an office. 

I feel like I’m falling apart and I haven’t talked to no one since - no work just me in my home snorting stuff and crying all day. 

I want to feel some emotional support form my dad passing but it seems that people don’t know how to react and just distance themselves. 

I don’t know how I’m going yo socialize again after blocking almost everyone I know. And tbh I’m not even a person people are excited to be around. 

I don’t know how to be a normal person - I Maybe deserve being this lonely."

I think I'm so lonely usually that my brain took all of this the wrong way, and now I feel like I haven't really been rejected. I feel like I wanna text her and just talk about stuff like we used to do, but more now because our emotional bond made our friendship stronger. Except... It's really not the case.

Why the fuck can I never tell anyone how I feel about them? Did my parents fuck me up or is it all me?

I know I could get a lot of hate for this, but it is my genuine opinion because it seems like some of you guys think that you won’t be lonely anymore as soon as you get a gf/bf or whatever. I honestly was convinced that I wouldn‘t feel lonely anymore as soon as I and my gf met for the first time 9 months ago. But let me tell you, I do still feel lonely from time to time because there are problems that not even my gf can help me with and they do make me feel lonely even if she‘s right next to me. Yes there is the better emotional support because I can talk to her about a lot of stuff, but that is not what solves the problem nor does it make one feel less lonely. All I‘m trying to say here is, do not focus on finding a partner thinking that it will fix EVERY problem and issue with loneliness. I certainly can‘t tell you what to do, but keep in mind that a partner can‘t and won‘t fix all your anxieties. It‘s a lot of weight some of you try to push on another person for them to carry. This is also what can destroy a relationship very quickly and turn it toxic within weeks even days."

lonely,just missing out on my 20s,"just missing out on my 20s - I am trying to go out more, i am trying to create a social group after mine basically immediately dissolved after high school, but i feel like i am missing out a lot on my early years of adulthood. I feel like ive been made to stay indoors because i was always raised to believe the outside world is dangerous and full of shitty people. Which then brings me to the over all regret my parents have in having me since the world is so bad. Of course they try to over protect me even though i am well above the age of adulthood and living alone. I feel like i cant travel or really life any sort of life since they are trying to smother me constantly and i dont want to completely break contact with them. 

Ive felt this way since i was at least 14, where i am just pissing my life away. I have always felt like im going to die young and never experience anything. I am almost to my mid-20s and havent experienced a romantic relationship as an adult. The last relationship i was in lasted a short time and was when i was still a teenager. Ive tried to get into relationships but everything points to me not being ready for one. I get brutally rejected again and again. Why women feel the need to be so mean i dont know. And the loneliness brings me to darker corners sexually and i become more and more irredeemable. I also seem to become weaker, more gross looking and over all more unattractive as time goes on, which just results in me destroying myself further. I am also in pain nearly all the time and wish i was never born.  I also feel like i am getting dumber as time goes on which is probably because depression massively messes with my sleep. 

Being out in public is painful to watch sometimes as well. I see couples and wonder why im not good enough. Why am i not worthy of feeling what they are feeling. Why do i have to watch. Am i that bad? If so, why keep me on this earth? Why make me get worse if im that bad?"

lonely,he ruined my perspective on love,"he ruined my perspective on love - ever since he left me, i’ve been so numb towards guys. i try to make them hate me or i hurt them because of him. i don’t do it on purpose, i just don’t know how to set boundaries and i can’t seem to have feelings for guys anymore. not after him atleast, he hurt me so much. he’s the only guy i’ve cried over. it’s been months and i still am hurt over it, why me? what did u do to deserve that, i was nothing but good to him. he made me feel so wanted and loved and genuinely cared for, and he left. for no reason. out of nowhere? i thought everything was good. i didn’t deserve that. i haven’t smiled while talking to a guy since he left."

lonely,This is what I need to hear,"This is what I need to hear - I've been seeing a lot of these posts from strangers lately. ""I'm proud of you, I love you,"" and whatever else gets added on there. Sure the message is nice and all, but it does literally nothing for me -- **especially** when it's coming from a complete stranger that's just addressing the masses reading it. Kind of like how you are right now

I don't believe I need someone to tell me they're proud of me, or that they care about me... How could they when even I don't even care about myself? All I do in my free time is play video games and shitpost on reddit to fill the empty void in my black, lonely heart. 

I have one ""friend"" and even she agrees I'm ugly. She won't outright say it - but she doesn't disagree with me if I ever make an off-color remark about the way I look. Just yesterday I showed her a picture that my work took with my coworkers and I in it... She proceeded to list off which ones she thought were cute for no reason. Guess who wasn't on that list? Me, as fucking usual. 

Places like Photofeeler, they've never rated me anymore than a 3 at best, no matter how I take the picture or how I angle it. Acne scars don't help, then again neither does having what one girl described as ""fat cow lips."" I'm sure a lot of my physical imperfections could have easily been forgiven too - if I was taller. I SHOULD be 5'8"", and while that's not by any means tall it's a hell of a lot better than 5'3"". Thanks, chemo! 

Life's so fuckin unfair. Y'know what I need to hear? (Also the **TL;DR**)

""I think you're cute."" I've purposefully went out of my way to let other people know that my whole life -- even the girls that I genuinely didn't think actually were. But I knew they needed to hear that and that was the right thing to do, in my heart. Nobody will do that for me, though. 

Nope. I'm just supposed to sack up and move on with my life-- only to die from a stress-related coronary in my early 30s from having all these fuckin feelings multiplied by my loneliness and nowhere to let these feelings out except an internet forum that MIGHT be seen by MAYBE 10 people at best.

lonely,Hello darkness my old friend,"Hello darkness my old friend - The last post I made in this sub back in February led to an amazing person reaching out to me. We started to talk casually and eventually got to know more about each other. We kept talking and eventually it led to a long distance relationship. I've never really been one for those but with her it was different. I've never connected to someone so much before not to mention someone I've never met in person (no she wasn't a catfish either thankfully lmao). Unfortunately we lived on opposite sides of the US from each other.

 The downside other than the distance factor was that she was also battling cancer. I promised her that I would be here for her through it all and kept every bit of my word. We were waiting on her health to improve before I flew out so we could meet for the first time. I hadn't heard from her in 3 weeks now and this morning I woke up to the terrible news from her cousin that she had passed away. I feel so numb I can't even begin to describe it. The one person who I could always talk to and was there for me just as much as I was for her, is gone forever. I know she wouldn't want me to be sad or probably even be making this post but fuck this hurts so bad 💔"

lonely,Making friends is impossible over 30,"Making friends is impossible over 30 - I’m a mid-30s guy in a major metro area. I’ve moved around a bit so I don’t have long-term roots in the area. As such, I need some friends, but it’s next to impossible. 

Guys my age seem to mostly have families and long-term friend groups that are hard to penetrate.  I get that family comes first and the limited time they’ve got to socialize won’t go to people they don’t really know.

lonely,Toxicity and being alone,"Toxicity and being alone - Idk if this is the right community but okay. Does anyone else have a head time getting rid of toxic friends?

I can recognize toxic signs but it’s like I try to ignore it. You see these people are the only “friends” I have and I guess I’m scared if I drop them I’ll actually have no one. I hate being lonely. 

Now I’m fine with being physically alone and doing my own things but sometimes you need a friend and sometimes the idea of being alone is worse the the action. I also am scared of they’re reaction to me dropping them. It’s like I’m grasping at straws to save our relationships but it sucks. Im just really confused and it’s been triggering a lot of guilt and loneliness. I kind of stopped talking to people and no one has taken notice. I feel left out and un appreciated. If I lose these people I’ll actually be alone. It’s really draining worrying about them. Thoughts?"

lonely,Loneliness + difficulty leaving the house by myself,"Loneliness + difficulty leaving the house by myself - I (20F) have realised that in the past couple of years I have rarely left the house by myself unless people are expecting me somewhere, ie work or meeting friends socially. 

It feels like there is a huge mental block stopping me from going outside by myself. I have been really wanting to go for a walk outside my apartment building (there is a river and nice walking tracks close by) for months but my housemate doesn’t want to come with me so I haven’t gone. It makes me so sad to see how beautiful it is outside but I am stuck inside all the time, especially since I am now unemployed and not studying. We order our groceries online so the last time I left the house was over a month ago to get my vaccine. 

In the months after high school finished but uni hadn’t started yet I used to take myself out to the shops or parks just to get out of the house and be around people since I was so isolated. My family was abusive and most of my friends from school had drifted, except for a couple who I am now close to again. I was desperately lonely at that time which I guess is why I was able to overcome the issue of not going out by myself. 

I remember once I was drinking a slushie alone in the shopping centre food court and one of my high school friends was with her sisters when she saw me, she was so awkward and later said that her sisters felt sorry for me because I was alone. I was so excited to see my friend but she didn’t want to hang out because she was always busy with her family. That is the only time period I remember going out by myself for anything non-essential. 

As a kid I only really went places with family if it was a pre-planned thing or just grocery shopping. I didn’t have any friends or pocket money to go out with (my friends didn’t really want to hang out outside of school). 

I have moved out of home this year which is amazing, thankfully I live with my best friend so I am not alone when I am at home. 

It’s really depressing for me because I am naturally someone who loves to go out to different places, before lockdown I was so excited whenever I managed to convince my friends to go out with me. My best friend and current housemate is a homebody and is content to not leave the apartment for months on end, he only ever wants to go out for specific things like seeing a certain show or going to a convention. In contrast I love to see different places, go to restaurants/cafes/venues and be outdoors. 

Before lockdown, I practically had to beg my 2 friends to hang out with me. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to be around me, they were happy to chat on the phone every day. They just didn’t want to go out of their houses. They have very low social needs and I guess mine is much higher. 

I got to go clubbing for the first time earlier this year with my old housemates and it was so much fun,  I loved it so much. Now I don’t have anyone to go clubbing with and most likely never will again. That makes me really sad because I felt alive and like myself for the first time when I was at the club. I also had my first kiss there and since online dating sucks, that may be my only kiss. 

I see people on social media going places with their friends and it makes me so sad and jealous. On the occasions I have convinced my friends to come out with me it feels like I am dragging them along all day. I just want to do normal things like hang out at the shops, go to the the beach, go to cafes etc.

My parents, especially my dad, used to make fun of people who went out by themselves. They would call them losers who had no friends etc. it’s ironic since my parents have barely and friends and rarely go out.

I know that I will have to learn to go to these places by myself or nothing will change. It just makes me so sad that I can’t experience those things with friends or a significant other. It won’t be the same and I will always be seeing friends and couples when I am there alone. Often that just makes it more depressing so I’d rather stay at home and avoid seeing that."

lonely,No one ever comes thru,No one ever comes thru - You know what I always find wild? The fact that I find alot of pages that are like this one where people meet up and talk about how alone they are or that there trying to find friends but no one ever comes thru. My wife has fibromyalgia and she's stuck at home alot and because of her not being able to go out much because she's in pain all the time all of her old friends are pretty much gone. Ghosted her pretty much.  So she's always trying to find people to just chill and game with. Even if its not gaming just watching a movie together in discord or something. All of these different pages she's ever attempted to find friends on always have people say that they'd love to hang. They'll share discords or gamer tags or whatever and she'll add them and gets excited and then nothing. Literally if she's lucky they'll send a message saying hi and thats it. Never heard from again. Are people just afraid to talk to new people now or just like to give false hope. It breaks my heart to see her struggle to find friends when she's the sweetest person I've ever met. She's had people come and go in her life before and she never understands why they leave when she's always been supportive and just an awesome friend who's always there to listen to you vent and gives advice when she can. I just wish I understood. If its because she can't always say she's doing good when people ask hows she's doing then thats fucked. Its not her fault she's in pain all the time. She has her good days but she won't lie to you on her bad days. Or ever for that matter. Idk. I just hate seeing her so lonely when I can't be home to keep her company. Sorry. Rant over.
lonely,I [M18]should be happy for my [F17] friend,"I [M18]should be happy for my [F17] friend - She was the only girl I was comfortable with, lately. We usually went out after school, ate something and joked about our silly teachers or made jokes to each other. 

In the last period, I fell in love with her, but she was in a relationship, and still is.

Now, I’ve almost accepted the fact that nothing romantic will ever happen ( I got used to it. It’s not the first time that a girl I’m interested in gets in a relationship with someone else ). 

But it still makes me feel lonely. I had nobody to hang out with. I’ve spent the last year in a strange situation. She was there to go out after school, and we still have fun like before. But it’s different. I’m kinda happy for her, but not for me. 


I know this is just a phase, I’ll get over it,

but my suicidal thoughts have been going on for about 2 years now

I’ve thought about cutting my veins. It’s not just because of this. It’s also due to the fact that I feel like a ghost, like an invisible being. I see other people having fun, going to parties, getting to know new people, making new friends, finding girlfriends/boyfriend. 

It’s so easy for others. I just want to fade away."

lonely,Though I'd been alone I'd never been lonely... till now.,"Though I'd been alone I'd never been lonely... till now. - Sometimes I know I'm falling apart. Lately I feel like I'm really going to break. It's like being in a deep black pit, one so deep I can't even see if there is light at the top, and all I can do is walk around bumping into solid walls. I feel there must be a door somewhere, but I can't find it.

I've always felt things deeply. I'm aware of that. Sometimes too deeply, and sometimes things were much more important to me than they were to others. But lately everything, everyone, seems different. It's like every relationship is shallow, or those who are your friends are selfish friends. Either no one wants to truly talk about anything important, like your problems, or they only want you to talk about their own problems. 

I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure last winter, any time I even mention anything about it with my supposed best friend you can tell he's either tuning it out, or he finds a way to end the conversation. Yet he'll go one and on to me about his problems which is just work drama he's talked at length about on a dozen occasions, nothing new at all. And you have to think his problems are the biggest, or you're the one who's being selfish.

The last person I knew truly cared for me was an ex-girlfriend, one of my earliest loves, and possibly one of only two true loves I ever had. She'd hurt me, and I just needed time, but she wouldn't give it to me, she needed us to be friends. I tried to tell her I couldn't, then to push her away, she wouldn't listen and kept trying. And for that, I knew she cared, so as much as it hurt to even think about her, let alone talk to her or be around her, I gave in and put in the effort to be her friend anyway. And because of her, I never felt lonely.

I knew her since she was a happy but shy little nine year old hanging out with one of my cousins. We went out once briefly in our early teens, later in my mid teens. Neither was a major relationship, we hardly saw each other, but it was enough to create in us the feelings for each other that brought us back together when I was eighteen for one of the most significant relationships of my life. So she'd been in my life for a very long time, about 30 years to be precise. Even after we moved to different places, opposite ends of the country, we kept in touch, she kept contacting me, and we'd have long conversations of blocks of text on Facebook or over the phone. And now, for five years, nothing.

She'd kept the pain going for so long, to be honest, kept me from really getting over her, kept me hanging on. But I'd known she'd cared all that time. And all for what? Just to finally ghost me. She was in the city, wanted to see me, we made arrangements and she didn't show only to text me hours later and say she'd run out of time... and then nothing. I messaged her more recently, and rather than the usual happy energetic and humorous responses of the past, it was emotionless and short. All that time... and now nothing.

But, I had always known she'd truly cared. Now, I have no one. Because of her even when alone I'd never felt lonely. Now, I am alone, and I am lonely."

lonely,Just had my first kiss and it was amazing,"Just had my first kiss and it was amazing - So the other night, a girl I've been talking to on snapchat asked if I wanted to go on a late night walk with her. Keep in mind that this was at 10PM so most parks were closed. Now I really like this girl so I obviously said yes and drove both of us to a park I found that was open 24hrs. We walked and talked and eventually she suggested that we lay down in the grass and look at the stars. I thought that sounded nice so I went with it. We just stared at the sky for a good 20 minutes until I saw that she was slowly getting closer to me and started moving her hand towards mine. I worked up the nerve to do the same and our hands met. So there I was lying in the grass and holding hands with the girl I liked. At this point I was kinda freaking out on the inside because I've never gotten this intimate with a girl before. After a few minutes she snuggled up next to me and rested her head on my shoulder. We laid like that for a while and then I noticed that she was tilting her head up to look at me. I met her gaze and after looking into each other's eyes for a bit, we kissed and then just laid there in the grass together. No words were spoken until around 2AM when I asked if she was getting tired after she kept yawning. She said she was, so I drove her home and then went home myself. The next day I texted her saying that I really enjoyed spending time with her last night and she said she felt the same. It was the best night of my life and the first time in years that I was actually happy. The only problem is that she works 40 hours a week so trying to find time to hang out is gonna be really difficult."

lonely,Just alone,Just alone - Im 21(m) and my ex committed suicide we were together on and off for 5 years shes been gone for about a year but was with an abusive person for her last year.

lonely,Confidence,"Confidence - Why do people talk about confidence like it’s something I can pick up from the grocery on the way home. Shit is so confusing, so I’m gonna be single my whole life unless I become confident that I can pickup women whenever I please? And how am I supposed to do that. “By talking to women and asking them out” how is me getting rejected by a bunch of women I now have to look out for when I go in public gonna make me more confident about asking women out. This makes no sense. So tell me, where do I find this confidence, can I order online, is shipping going to be delayed bc of covid maybe unless I pay extra?"
lonely,I just want my ex back,"I just want my ex back - Things weren’t perfect but our problems were so basic and fixable…they just never got fixed. I rarely get out the house so my only way to meet someone else is online. It’s just so annoying texting a bunch of different guys and trying to remember all this random information about them all to keep the conversations going deeper. None of us are probably compatible either. 
I just want things to go back to how they were. He refuses to be with me as if I cheated or something. I just don’t understand :/
I’ve completely disregarded any self-respect I may have had by trying to get him to love me again over the past two weeks. At one point he even said he was going to get back with me but I said something to make him change his mind¿ But I know I shouldn’t have to beg anyone to be with me. It’s just hard throwing away the two years of history over something so fixable."
lonely,Feels like I’m kinda left out in my friend group,"Feels like I’m kinda left out in my friend group - Alright so I have a group of 8 friends (including me), where we met up at a gaming club since the beginning of September and made a group chat ever since. I’m a transfer full time student as a junior so I had a lot more assignments/work and have to work at my job also, where I spent less time hanging out with them. In the group chat, it seems like everyone just ignores me and they have someone to click with. I’m introverted and shy but I try my best to crack jokes and make conversation. This past Friday, I met up with all of them since it had been 2 weeks since I last saw them all (I couldn’t attend the last two gaming club meetings) and they didn’t seem excited to see me, except for maybe 3. We were just walking on campus and everyone already seemed to get along very well with each other while I’m trying to get to know everyone still. Everytime I talk, no one pays attention. I worried that they’ll most likely make a separate group chat eventually and then I have no group of friends to mess around with. Also, I’m the oldest (22) while most of them are 19-20 with one being 18 and the other being 21. I hope it’s not an age thing where the 19-20 year olds are getting along better and doesn’t see me as a loser who’s trying to fit in with them. I do have a mature mindset but also can goof around. I regret not hanging out with them more but I’m just so busy and out of all the clubs I’ve been in, this seems more my type but recently I feel like I’m excluded. Hell, it makes me lonely af because no one wants to talk to me"

lonely,I'm scared to tell my friends why I'm depressed,"I'm scared to tell my friends why I'm depressed - It's because I haven't had physical affection in over two years. Every relationship I've ever had has been ruined by my own insecurities, worrying they'll leave me, or they were insane in their own way, and made it their mission to make me suffer. All I've ever wanted is to be held by someone who cares about me, I've had it before, but that bridge is ashes, and no woman who doesn't know me already would give me the time of day. The only girls that ever show interest are ones that I do not find attractive, physically or attitude-wise. I want to provide for someone. I want to buy food and cook for a woman, drive her to appointments, build a life together, experience monotony with someone else rather than do it alone. But it feels like I will always be alone. I've changed my style, I've changed my hobbies,  I eat better, I exercise, I have a good job and a car, and no debt. And yet all this stress keeps building and building, and I have to endure it by myself. 

I see my friends with girlfriends who will be wives someday buying their first homes/entering careers and starting their futures already, and all I can think when I'm around those couples is that everything would be easier and I would be happier if I wasn't so alone. I wouldn't have to pay all the bills myself, and I wouldn't have to watch a TV too big for one person. I could relax and work with someone and life could be beautiful, but I don't know anyone, nor does anyone have any useful advice to finding a soulmate. I just need to be held sometimes."
lonely,I feel so humiliated,"I feel so humiliated - I am discriminated against, picked on and made fun of. 

Sometimes people will tell me how smart and empathetic I am and that I will be happy and surrounded by people that love me for these qualities and who I am.

 Funnily it's never them. 


I'm almost as isolated as can be and I just feel like people deep down really don't care for me. They certainly don't feel the need to show much appreciation or affection.

lonely,Trying to be normal,"Trying to be normal - Hello. I just joined this subreddit. 

About 3 months ago I started feeling weird. Until then I was happy with my life but it’s like everything from the past year with the pandemic and stuff just caught up with me and it manifested as the most soul crushing loneliness. 

The stupid thing is that I have so many people around me who love me. People who saw changes in me without me even having to say anything and tried to reach out. But it’s like I was suddenly in a place they couldn’t reach, they became just white noise.

I began doing silly, impulsive things. I began forming toxic relationships with people I met online who don’t know or care about me. Speaking to them felt like breathing space, but ultimately it just made things worse. They do not know me or care about me. They left me more empty than before.

Right now I feel like I’m going through the motions. This weekend my friends took me out to a bar and I spent the whole time trying to act ‘normal’ but inside wishing that things didn’t feel so wrong. 

Just wish I knew why this was happening to me."
lonely,Im out of a relationship and im just plain lonely.,"Im out of a relationship and im just plain lonely. - I recently got out of a 4 year relationship and decided to try to do things that would make me happy. I was hoping making friends would be one of them but honestly, im lonlier now than ever. My ex and I are still good friends but since we broke up, shes made more friends now than ever and hangs out with them often. Meanwhile, I have a hard time even getting old friends to text me back. No new friends and barely any old friends. I try not to think about it and try to focus on myself but I always have the thought: ""this would be fun with a friend"" or ""man im bored. I should try to hang out with some friends"" but it never happens. Ive always been kind of a quiet person. I guess this is the drawback. At this point, I just spend a lot of time alone at the house or at the bar when im not at work. I just dont know what to do anymore. Being lonely isnt eating at me or anything. It just makes me really sad. Like i have nobody."

lonely,Wrote some poetry to vent my emotion,"Wrote some poetry to vent my emotion - Myself is whom I don’t know 
Lost in the parallels of identity
All trapped under a life of sorrow 
Getting nothing but the occasional pity
Discarded, left on the side, is myself 

Alone

I don’t know myself 
The epitome of alone in a room full of friends 
They don’t know myself 

I welcome emptiness 
I welcome pain 
I welcome depression 
Because that is alll I know 

Flurry of emotions as frequent as daylight 
Yet emotionless
Gives all myself has
Yet only makes a loss 

So I put on a mask
A mask that shows the paradox
A mask that is liked
A mask, that is mask
A mask that shows happiness, kindness
But a shattered mask beneath

Watering dead plants
Is something I enjoy
Something that breaks me
But that I keep as a symbol of hope
Of what life could be 
If that plant started to grow again

“Oh sorry, money was tight so I couldn’t invite you to the party”
I’m used to that
I’m used to isolation
Loneliness
Discarded
And the pictures tell the story that I was never missed 

No one cares about me 
Left for dead, but already dead 

Alone"

lonely,I Hate That People Are Not That Different From Animals,"I Hate That People Are Not That Different From Animals - I'm not sure if that's the right place, or the right time, or whatever. There's just something stuck in my throat that I think maybe somebody here can identify with (or no, I really don't know), I'm not even sure how to put in words, what I know is that have lot to do with sex and the idea of humiliation. I watch people and everybody, even myself, we are humiliating people all the time. Sometimes we don't even know, but we are, judging every fucking time. I'm feeling like I hardly could trust anyone, and even if I could, something about people disgust me so much. Like, we're always seeking something to us, even when we're not. When we think we're helping others, in some way, is primarily to make ourselves feel better, I know that shit cause I developed some weirdass superhero complex which is the most selfish thing ever. I've been fetishising the idea of a loner, I freaking know I do, and I've been quite hating happy people in some way, like there's something wrong with being happy, I feel selfish when I'm happy.
I'm just crazy because I've seen people being humiliated ans it's making me feel sick, cause I can't stand it, I can't understand it and I can't do any fucking thing about it, sometimes I even worsen things. I can't stop thinking about sex in association with the idea of humiliation, cheating makes me want to vomit in ways I can't even explain. I can't stop seing sex as a way to cheating and to superficiality, and I know it makes no single sense, but I can't stop seing sex and intimacy as a gigantic open road to humiliation, to vulnerability; I desire and hate sex so much sometimes I wish I could be asexual, it would be way easier. I can't stop thinking that's why there are so many fucking loners here, loners in every fucking way. Loners because everybody wants power and there are people with no power. To be the hottest, with most control, most money, most sex, most happiness. Like, we're animals. Animals do that, have pleasure and survive. This is so hollow to me is like I lost any meaning I could perceive about life. If everybody works that way, is damn easy to be lonely. You're lonely cause you're boring, toxic, hateful, uninteresting, ugly, without attitude, any shit. Why can't everybody be happy? Why it had to be the loner and the one full of friends? The poor and the rich? The happy one and the guy who wants to end his life every single day? My coworkers are always judging people's appearances, this make me sick, it's like all my fears come together. Somebody out there -- maybe lots of people -- think I'm disgusting, and then I find myself weak for not standing, because the strongest survives and the weaker perishes. The science books explain me the world that way, but I can't fucking stand it, it's so fucking unfair, maybe that's why religion is a thing. Sex is almost the embodiment of all that. 
So I've been romanticizing the idea of loneliness, unhealthy as hell. I have a suicidal friend, instead of helping is like I'm giving him motives. I'm not sure where I'm getting, I'm frustrated and depressed with a lot of stories here and in other places and even IRL. I don't even drink to use that as excuse, I'm just weird. It's not unlikely that I delete this post, everything is so out of place in my head."

I’m on a sports team, but people think im weird so it’s been hard making friends. I have two jobs and lots of classes and when I’m busy and interacting with people I’m so happy and excited to be with people. But then those obligations end and everybody leaves to be with their friends. I’m so jealous, its consuming me. I want nothing more in this world then to befriend a person or people and share new experiences and enjoy life together. I’ve just ruined everything for myself after wasting my college years.

Recently I've realized the majority of my co-workers have informal get-togethers all the time. I don't have any issues or static with anyone and interactions are pleasant and familiar.

While I’m awake I almost always think about how much I want to meet someone and fall in love. It frustrates me immensely and makes me very sad all the time. As soon as I hear people talking about their significant other I get very jealous and can’t help but feeling sad and lonely. I have trouble sleeping since I can’t seem to clear my mind of this. It feels like all I think is fun is overshadowed by the feeling of loneliness. It has gotten to the point where I have lost all my passion for anything and the dreams I had for my future have faded away. The only dream I have now is to get a girlfriend. I feel like I’m without purpose and I’m only living for others, rather than living for myself and building up something. I’m not suicidal but I have a hard time seeing any reason for me live.

Specifically for relationships. Not talking about sex… I’m talking about the whole concept of a relationship, looking in the eyes and being in love. Also about the sacrifices you have to make. Literally everything about relationships.

I’ve never had friends. I’ve never been able to party and I spent my 18th party alone. That’s also because I had invited my classmates to my 17th party. But nobody came.

And, worst of all, I never felt good enough for a relationship, as i said above. Never been able to attract a girl’s interest. Absolute nothing, even if i go to the gym and feel good with my body. I got my own interests too. 

Love is just something I don’t see in my future. It might sound a stupid reason why to cut my veins, but I’ve always dreamt about it, but it never came, and I don’t know how ( and if ) it might come. I just cry, and see how simply other guys get in relationships and have fun."

I’m assuming it may be cause people have different personalities and they tend going towards something fresh or “more to their liking” but it hurts the fact that you can know someone for so long and they would rather have you as a backup because they know even if they’re distant with you, you’d still break an arm to see them again without hesitation.

I love my friends who has other friends but why is it acceptable to just replace people like they are trash. Then when their friend has other priorities or other ppl to hang out with, my friend comes back to me because they are alone.

I’ve never really liked having a friend group because that is the source of drama and pick me type of thing. I also don’t like mixing my friends because the most unfortunate situations happen when you do and jealousy too."

It wasn’t enough that I had undiagnosed adhd since childhood that’s only getting addressed now in my mid thirties.  It wasn’t enough that I had little self esteem and felt terrible that I didn’t have a “desirable” body.  It wasn’t even enough that I’ve done a lot to educate and better myself.

Despite everything, all I really want is the ability to pursue my passions and find a partner that I find attractive.

I can’t even do that.  The only people willing to give me a chance are those I don’t find attractive.  I settle because experience has taught me there is no point in doing anything else. 

Wishful thinking (eg. you’re a catch, etc) is worthless and only makes the person saying it feel better.  It doesn’t matter if you can’t find a partner who brings you joy and you bring joy too.

I bring joy.  I will never be a bad or inconsiderate partner.  But I am lonely and know that I will always feel like I won’t get what I see everyone else enjoying.

lonely,Do you wonder if things will stay like this forever?,"Do you wonder if things will stay like this forever? - It has been years like this, and more to come from how it’s looking.

It’s just been lonely, so very lonely. Lonelier than I could’ve imagined. Everyday, nonstop. No one to open up to, no one to trust with my weak self. I don’t know what I’m living for, a purpose of some greater fulfillment isn’t very clear to me.

Some days I fantasize about packing my bags and leaving this city. I want to fly off the radar if this is all live has to give me. I’ve lost so much and I’m beginning to rip at the seams that hold me together. Maybe it is all for nothing, maybe kindness is a burden and I should indulge in my impulsive nature, and maybe carelessness and sex is the answer to my worthlessness. I don’t want to believe in a greater good, I just want to have it all to myself before I’m dead someday."

Just now have I realised what I had written there. She haven't responded to any of my messages and she keeps ignoring me even tho I've said sorry multiple times.   
I have 35 people in my class of which 29 are girls. I have never had female friends and I am unable to create new friendships with any of them because of my weird mindset and the way I am. Lately I wanted to start talking to that girl and yesterday I wrote to her because I was at a party and I felt more relaxed with myself friends were encouraging me to write to her and got courage to do that. I regret every decision that I've made on that Party. I wish she wouldn't read those messages."
lonely,I'm done.,"I'm done. - That's it. I () can't fucking stand the fact that up until this summer, I was in a 2-year long period of isolation. Sure, there were some friends from past years. But that didn't help change the fact that those two years were the worst years of my life, so far. I was overloaded with work, procrastination issues due to my stress, and horrible sleep issues. What's astonishing is that when the pandemic hit and my state went into lock-down, I actually felt a bit better. The next school year (2020-2021) was similar. In May, I heard about a summer program I could join. Thirty-six days of travelling through other states with 40 or so other teenagers + counselors. Initially, I was reluctant to join, but I eventually did. When the trip started two days after summer vacation did, I was prepared to go through the same isolation. And that's exactly what happened, at least for the first twelve days. Then I began to notice this girl I found to be very attractive. The trip continued on for another 3 weeks or so. A few days before it ended, I spoke to one of my friends about my emotional problems. But on the last day, I decided to tell her that I really liked her. We ended up hugging after that. And I think it was then that I began to realize that I really needed to stop being so isolated. But the next day, the trip ended. A few weeks after, I briefly re-established contact with that girl. We talked a few times, but as of mid-September, we haven't. I'm afraid that I pushed her away because I talked to her about my issues. But whilst I was doing so, I didn't care. I hadn't been able to talk to anybody else about these issues and feel relieved. But we've lost contact due to our lives going onwards. And I still have that feeling I shouldn't have spoken to her about my issues. And with that, I've lost contact with almost everyone from that trip. 

I'm tired of hearing stupid shit like ""just move on and/or find something to fix your anxiety."" How am I supposed to fix it? I've tried numerous therapists, numerous medications, etc. It hasn't helped a bit. ""Just change your view on life!"" and ""Step out of your comfort zone!"" is what they say. People who say that need to go ram this nonsense right up there, because it doesn't help. They'll say ""I know it's hard!"" and other things that don't help. I'm tired of trying to make myself less isolated because I probably end up pushing people away (there's nothing interesting about me). That's all."

lonely,Sad and need to vent,"Sad and need to vent - Hi, I know it's mostly pointless for me to post here, but I need to vent somewhere and I can't stand the ""Hook-ups"" and sugar mommies/daddies on Whisper.

I just turned 26 the other day and I just don't know what to do anymore. Out of my like four friends, I feel like a pathetic extra, just kept around out of pity. I know it's not true, but it hurts nonetheless. Two of them are making pretty good money, and all four of them are better adjusted for society than me, mostly because I was diagnosed as a child with Asperger's Syndrome. They all make more money than me, have better jobs and are able to work more hours than me, have each had relationships... I feel like a child compared to them, a stupid, useless child.

Despite my Asperger's, I recently have been cripplingly lonely. It never bothered me growing up, but now I don't get the same satisfaction that I used to from watching movies or playing video games by myself. It's like there's no point in doing the things I like if I'm all alone while doing them. But it doesn't matter, no one's ever had an interest in me aside from one woman, but... I can't be with them because they're in a relationship with someone else because I fucked up a couple years ago and withdrew from them. I don't even really care about being the only person I know who's still a virgin, I just want someone to give me a hug, hold me and tell me I'm not the worthless, pathetic loser I feel like I am. But that won't happen, I don't deserve to be cared about, and so I silently march on until I just can't take it anymore and become just another statistic about depressed adults with autism.

I'm sorry if this post is a bit scattered and long, I don't really have anyone to talk to about anything because I always just feel like I'm burdening other people with my stupid autistic problems, even if they tell me otherwise."
lonely,My Only Friends at School Moved Away,"My Only Friends at School Moved Away - Yea. So, now all I have are three girls who are nice to me but speak another language. They offered to let me hang with them, but since I know from experience that they'll just forget I'm there and only speak to each other, I'd rather be alone.

Other than them, I'm not close with my other classmates at all. So therefore, I think I'm gonna be lonely asf at school, most of the time.

I have some friends at school but they go in other classes, and in a different buildings so we only hang sometimes. I at least have them I guess.

I just feel like I'm getting mentally prepared to be alone at school. Again. Since I have been totally alone at school before. So I also know how painful it is.

Just wanted to let that out."

lonely,I can't stop crying,"I can't stop crying - Hey I just want to apologize if there's any  grammatical errors or misspelling, I currently can't see through the tears that are forming in my eyes. Uh so a lot of you must have seen that I have a podcast called ""One Time For A Good Time"" and I've promoted it on the subreddit a few times. Anyways my podcast means the world to me, I talk about my mental health, Sexuality, the insecurities I go through, depression, anxiety and the whole nine yards. When it came to my work I didn't tell my family or anyone close to me because I wanted to keep it close to my heart (which later I found out I should). Sorry I'll get to the point, anyways I was having a conversation with my brother thirty minutes ago and we started talking about things I wanted to  do. So I thought this was the perfect time to bring up the podcast, so I said ""well actually I have a podcast that I would like to pursue"", he proceeded to laugh in my face and say ""who will listen to it?, no one cares about you?, your a bum, you're a nobody, you will never be anything"" etc. My anxiety and heart went through the roof, it led to us screaming at each other for like a good 45 minutes before I just walked away and started crying. When it comes to my podcast I'm already very insecure about it, so hearing my own blood say all those horrible things to me just threw me over the edge. I feel alone and I can't stop crying, I just wish people could love my work as much as I do. I don't know if this is allowed, or if anyone wants to check it out but I'll post it if anyone is interested.

lonely,Emptieness (17 m),"Emptieness (17 m) - I don't know why, but I have just felt so empty recently. I just graduated high school, and so I've had a lot more free time. As such, I've been attributing a lot of my ""lack of purpose"" to that, but I've been feeling it way before school finished. 

My gf, who I genuinely loved with all my heart left me so she could go out and party. We always discussed the matter of going out and partying. She always wanted to makeout with other boys, and so naturally I told her if she feels that way, why stay with me? It wasn't entirely her fault, but at the same time, my hands were tied. 

I've been trying to use ""friend making"" apps like Yubo to fill the void she left, but it has only made the problem worse. I'm now obsessing over completely random girls who I find semi-attractive.  

I was on top of the world a few months ago, and it's all come crashing down. Nothing majorly bad has happened, but I've sort of just folded on the inside. 

When I finish my work, I just sit on my computer now as none of my friends really talk to me anymore. I've known these guys literally since I was 3 years old in day care, but they don't wanna talk to me now. I don't know what I've done.

I don't know what to do, I don't know what I want to do, and it's all too much right now.

If you've read this far, then god damn you deserve a patience medal or something haha

TL;DR - fresh high school graduate has too much free time, his GF left him, and his childhood friends dont talk to him anymore."

lonely,"Blacked mailed &amp; buried by family, friends, then joined the military, only to be used against me.","Blacked mailed &amp; buried by family, friends, then joined the military, only to be used against me. - The issue I’m dealing with has been planned for me &amp; forced against my will, due to being out numbered. My plan in life was to go to school and join the military then after service finish school. Unfortunately, that wasn’t allowed in my family, instead I had a mother that enjoyed burying her kids/make someone look bad and everyone to feel powerful. My father is a G.C that told me going to school would be useless, since he said I’d never make it that far (I was a teen at the time). The reason he didn’t want me to go to school is so I can be controlled easier with the lack of education at the time; like corporations/LLC don’t like education at the bottom of the of the corporate ladder, due to bigger numbers.

Honestly, I thought it would stop there with the level of depressing family drama just to turn to a friend over 8 years, that kept building an army of rumors with friends/exes and, his only example of a parent is a person that only used the lovers for money, sex, &amp; drugs. To grow to become a opportunist networking &amp; manipulating people with money to achieve fame, security, &amp; possibly a business that my family built up to watch it fail due to lack of education (Ironic), but the licensing is there which is the key asset. This wouldn’t be an issue if people left me alone, but issue being, they need a captain for ship, and I grew up in the field (I wanted to go a different direction in life).

If you’re not careful in life, there is a chance you’ll be pulled down by people, even if it’s people you love, and care about. As I joined the military it’s was insinuated by surrounding people that my old job was telling people that I might be “Schizophrenic” or “Paranoid”, which I think it was a prepped slanderous tool to make me fail as I obtained a license, while I was servicing, and was going to use it while I finish up school (People became jealous &amp; use the mental decline to aid them, covid).

Let’s talk about a change of colors in people, and I’m not lying about everything that happen within a years time. Before joining the military, my ex-girlfriend was caught cheating, as a result of her guilt she decided to try to bury me, because her cheating was my fault? She kept in contact with my step mother, joined a stagehand company to work and use as a tool to bury me, which isn’t good for business, and my old friend that she stated that sexually harassed her are friends for networking reasons, then tried to put a restraining order against me, which didn’t work because no grounds. After we broke up all my friends took her side because of sexual attraction. Then my old friend tried using Starbucks employees to bury me by his friendship with some of them then contacted my new friends which had friends in Starbucks/worked there.

Again, this wouldn’t be an issue, but now I’m being puppy guarded by neighbors to find out what my next plans are in hopes that I don’t start a business, unless I become friends with them......... I don’t trust that. So to make things even more fun the people I helped get a jobs in the past all want to make sure I don’t use my license, and want me to become a bum....not far off. Again, this all shot up because I have a license, which I can’t use due to being national guard, one unstable officer or SGT could destroy any service members business, plus people don’t think you should own a business till after service but again part-time soldier.

Here is the summary/rumors to jealous people that don’t want me to succeed, Step mother girlfriend works for Edison energy company/ revenue over 13 million and their markets reach is over 200 miles. The Icee company, I asked my service manager did they put something out about me because their accounts such as taco bell knew who I was and I didn’t service those accounts receivable make friends, he said no. That companies reach is thought the United States with 8 accounts that they service that reach through the United States as well, which included Starbucks, Target, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, 7-Elevens, Chevrons, Shell gas, &amp; Arco. My ex might have been in contact with my step mom to join a swingers club called iaste local 122 (stage hand),which spans over my state and seen in marvel movies and more. All that drama jumped over to my military service which is the National Guard, which cops &amp; other law enforcement is apart of, double dipping in cash. 

I have no one to stand up for me because of the intimidation factor of these companies, and it feels like I have a gun to my head with the phrase of, “do as I say or else.” Just because I got license and people got jealous. I’m still a service member &amp; now my jobs are being affected but I’m not locked up? Feels like my entire military career will be me being buried &amp; people taunting me to get me to hit them, and I’ve already had a SSG touch me and say I’m a federal agent &amp; a other SSG if I wanted to have sex with me with witness, also told stop going to school as well later down the road (fuck these people)."
lonely,Loneliest person in this world,"Loneliest person in this world - First let me say that i know that i'm obviously NOT the loneliest person in the world. However does it help anyone to know that other people are doing worse than yourself? It never helped me.  I'm not trying to make a competition out of it and don't want to hurt others with that statement.  
This is just how i feel constantly. 

If you'd tell me other people have it worse all it does is making me want to meet those 'like minded' people. I wish i could meet someone that is as lonely as me so that at least someone could understand me a bit.

Even writing this costs me a lot of energy and i don't even know where to begin.

Maybe say something about myself?   
I'm 32 and i live in a city where there is absolutely nothing to do.  
I don't even know how anyone has ever met another person in this shithole. 

Friends are nonexistent. I never had anyone that understood me. Connecting with people is super hard for me because my hobbies are just videogames, movies, books and art - stuff i can do alone. Nothing that can help me socialize with people.

The only people i talk to are coworkers and i don't like any of them and i'm sure they feel the same about me too.   
I hate work and yet i feel even more alone when i'm not working. Every minute i'm awake i feel depressed af and have to do various things to make my mind shut up.  
For example i cannot bear silence, i have to constantly either listen to music or something like podcasts in the background. 

Therapy did not help me. It didn't help me cure my loneliness one bit.  
Now someone surely is gonna throw 'you gotta love yourself first yadayada...' at me and i do agree. However how is this ever supposed to work?  
I don't hate myself but if no one is ever giving you any positive attention in your whole life how is that supposed to work? I've been bullied my whole school life because i was the shortest one in class and that has left some serious scars.

I'm ugly and short. So i've been ruled out by natural selection from the start. Just how do people cope with that? The realization that someday i will rot away alone in my room is haunting me.  
Romantic love is out of the question for me but i cannot even get love for money. In the city where i live there are no prostitutes and i don't think that would help me much anyway. I'd prefer to pay a woman just to lie in bed with me and talk.

I could go on for so much longer. This is not even half of it... but who is gonna read such a wall of text anyway. 

I wish i could have some hope for the future but i'll probably just continue on like this until it's finally over."

After that came jumping from group to group, when playing video games or discovering a new interest. No more long lasting friendships, only a people who stayed for a few months until they just lost interest in me and stopped responding to me.

Or there was just too much drama and my mental health forced me out of those groups.

When it comes to friends irl.. never had any after middle school. I don't get how people people even make friends, if the ones they made in childhood  happened to disappear. 

I feel like it all boils down to the fact that I was really quiet as a kid and never learned how to properly socialize  Was selectively mute even. My father got angry at me for not making friends, while my mother coddled me and thought I'd grow out of it and become a people person like she did.. 

Where do I go from here? I feel like I am going in circles. I've been told I overthink these things, but the loneliness just gets to me too much at times."

lonely,Birthday today and i cant wait for it to be over.(24M),"Birthday today and i cant wait for it to be over.(24M) - My birthday is filled with people telling me what’s acceptable or not acceptable to do. Does anyone else feel this way? 

Birthdays to me are just another day, I would love to be vacationing in Hawaii but realistically it won’t happen so it’s just another day on the calendar.

I feel this sense of pity excitement from my family because they know I don’t usually do anything on bday. And I appreciate the gestures but it’s excruciating.

It’s like if u don’t have a group of friends and then get shitfaced drunk you aren’t having a good birthday (according to everyone else)

Anyone else having birthday blues?"

lonely,I can't stand being alone for much longer,"I can't stand being alone for much longer - These last two years of the pandemic have torn my friend group apart. People who used to be friends had major fights and now frw people will talk to each other, which makes making plans basically impossibile. 
I just came back to uni, in a different city, and seeing people go out and have fun breaks my heart. I wish I had friends so bad. I'm so tired of being alone, it hurts. Last night both my flatmates were out with friends, having a blast, and I was just here rotting in my room. I know I have just moved here and it will take time to know people but...I'm so tired. I feel like I have suffered way too long and I just find myself thinking ""well the last two years have been hell, so now things should get easier, right?"", but no. 
It's so cruel. It feels as if I already had my share of pain and loneliness and now it just doesn't make any sense that there should be more to come. 
I'm trying to find friends through instagram, people say they wanna create friend groups and to comment on their posts so they can dm you. Never got a message back. It's starting to feel like I'm doomed but I'm so tired of the pain."

I hung out with him tonight and it was really fun but I'm afraid I ""overstayed"". At some point he said something like ""I'm getting tired, I'll probably go to bed soon"" and I said okay let me know when you want me to leave but I feel like I should have just left right then and now I'm afraid I was annoying and he'll never invite me over again. He was probably just too polite to say ""yeah I meant you should leave now."" I'm just so awkward and bad at reading social cues.

I've already secluded myself beyond what I could've ever imagined. I just feel numb. I think my brain can't take on all the hurt and pain and loss so this is what I'm left with.

I hate to wake up and I count the hours until I can crawl back into bed not that my dreams are much of a comfort. I want to be better, to be ""normal"".

lonely,i just want someone to talk with irl,"i just want someone to talk with irl - im 14. i have always been not the most talkative or outgoing person in my childhood, but i still had a small, but tight-knit group of close friends + some friends/accquiantances. one of my close friends lived in the same apartment complex 1 floor below mine place and we would visit eachother almost daily. we would play videogames and stuff and enjoy ourselves.

that changed when i was in the 5th-6th grade. that close friend who lived next to me moved out and lived in a different part of town. i still saw my other close friend in school, but he was mostly socializing with his own friend group, while i was talking with other classmates. i still didnt feel lonely, as i socialized with half of the class, even making some friends there.

then everything changed again, but for the worse. i soon went to a different private school with a way better education system, meals and etc. (public schools in russia are really bad, maybe even worse than american schools) once again, im not the most outgoing person and making friends, especially at school, isnt fast for me, but i managed to talk with some classmates, sometimes hanging out with them after school.

then everyone, whom i had talked to, left the school due to various reasons. one of my classmates liked programming at that time and so did i. we couldve been close friends, hadnt he left to a more programming/math centered school. bcus of that i stopped programming entirely, realizing it might not be the thing for me. it was after christmas and after that everything felt... empty. i didnt know who to talk to bcus i didnt think that anyone would want to talk to me (i dont think they want to now).

now in school everyone sees me as ""the quiet kid"". everyone in school arent even accquiantances to me, theyre more like strangers. i feel like im a background character, not even an npc, because an npc at least talks. i dont even want to talk to anyone there, basically self-isolating myself.

now the only friends i have are the few online friends i have. i enjoy being in their company, but it doesent feel the same as having an irl one, because it feels more real having someone you like being with being with you rn in the same spot and timezone as you. you feel a more deeper connection than with an internet friend, so i feel like my online friends are a bit insincere and dont care as much about me as i do about them.

i feel like this has to do with the online world. it has given me a lot of benefits (learning the english language, knowing a lot about history, geography, making me find people with similar interests) but it has made me antisocial and lazy. i heavily procrastinate and it might be because videogames and other stuff. sometimes i just cant stop being at the computer all the time, despite my parents being worried about me and trying to make me stop.

idek at this point what should i do. im uncertain about my future. will i make friends or will i continue to suffer in my own antisocial behaviour? i just want someone to talk to me irl, to find someone who has the same interests as me.

ill just wait and see."
lonely,Why,"Why - I'm almost 21 years old. As a kid I was bullied and treated unfairly by everyone at my first school, I think that's what messed me up socially. After that I switched schools and made some friends, but most of people still picked on me for reasons unknown. All the girls I knew in highschool despised me, and really just threw so many insults at me for no apparent reason. I was a nice guy, so I never really pushed back, so I was just an easy target I guess. In my 8th grade I had enough and basically went silent up until my senior year. The couple friends I had wondered why I didn't talk to girls, or anyone for that matter. I just told them I wasn't interested in a relationship or anything like that, because that was easier than talking about my past. They bought it so I've just stuck with that reason ever since. I've always wanted a relationship though. In my 10th grade I liked this one girl. That year I decided to go to our schools homecoming dance, just to try and hang out and be social. This girl I liked approached my friend, I was right next to him. She starts talking about how she wants to have a dance with someone, but she doesn't know who. My friend suggests me, but she says she can't because I'm ""ugly"". Looking back I'm glad she didn't want to dance with me because I have no clue how to dance, and would have probably made a fool of myself, but it hurt a bit how the one time I try and go out and be social another female has to reinforce the idea in my head that they all hate me. After that I no longer liked her for obvious reasons. (Nobody knew I liked her to begin with by the way).

In 11th grade I got my first job at a local restaurant. It really helped me just talk to people in general because I was a host. 11th grade ended and this girl from school, who I recognized but never interacted with her started working there for a summer job. Since it was basically me and her working host together all the time we got to know each other a bit. This was first experience talking to a girl that was being friendly. I liked her alot, probably because she was the only girl to talk to me, but I still liked her and I know she liked me back. It was then senior year, and everything fell apart. Covid hit my town and everything shut down, school went all online. Nobody knew when school was going to shut down, but this happened on the last day we had in person, me and a friend were walking back to class to pickup some stuff. She was in the room we were going to and we ran into each other. Me and her talked a bit, my friend was in on the conversation a little. When we were done talking we said bye to each other, and said we'd see each other on Monday. Me and my friend walked out and he told me I should ask her out to prom because he thought she liked me. I said I was already thinking about it. 

But after that day I never saw her again. This was 2020, so covid was on a rampage, so school shut down and we didn't have a prom or graduation. The thing that sucks is I had mentally prepared myself to ask her to prom, I know she would have said yes because I know we were at that stage in a developing relationship. I hate looking back because I wish I would have just asked her out sooner. Now it's been a year later. She has a boyfriend now. I'm pretty much over her because it's not hard to just accept things and move on by now. 

Right after my ""graduation"" I tried going to college for a semester. It was all online and I hated it. I pushed through and finished out that semester, though I took the next semester off and worked a terrible 80 hour work week factory job for 6 months after that. I'm back to college now that's in person, and I feel so left out. I commute so it's hard enough to meet people. I haven't talked to anyone yet. I just feel so lonely and I'm back to worrying that no matter how hard I try nothing will work out with a girl. I hate it so much because I've always wanted a relationship but I cant even get to a point where I find someone that might be interested in me. I don't understand because I don't think I'm unattractive, I really have my life together, but still nobody likes me. Im so frustrated and about ready to just give up again just like I did in the 8th grade. Like my friends have told me they can't even see me with a girl, I know it sounds harsh and rude, but I can't either at this point. Everyone I know has had many relationships and has no problem finding girls to be with. Like we are just sitting in a restaurant and these girls come up and ask for everyone's snap but mine. I don't understand what's wrong with me. I don't know why someone can't just give me a chance. I feel like I don't even have enough experience for a relationship, like I've only talked to one or two girls in my whole life. I want to believe there's hope, but I've wanted to believe that for years and years. I see all these people so happy together and I just want that so much but I feel like it will actually never happen. I don't know why I can't talk to my friends about this, I just feel like it would be weird talking to them about it because they think I just don't care about relationships. I'm so frustrated and tired of it, I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't know what I did to deserve this life."
lonely,Loneliness,"Loneliness - Hi! 

I'm new around here and I just wanted to share this. I'm 27, due to my religion when I was younger I never had a girlfriend even though I could. In recent years I've had two sex partners, however I never saw them as possible girlfriends, and every single time that I'm interested in someone they are either in a relationship or are dating someone. For example, the last person I asked out said yes but she never confirmed me a date and never gave me an update, and just recently I saw some photos that apparently someone is courting her. Also, I see that my friends are in a relationship and they are happy and that really bummed me out because I would like the same. I know that I'm not good looking or with a great body, but I'm funny and nice, and I know that I would be a great partner to someone. I'm just tired of being alone, sometimes I wanna cry because I feel so powerless. I know that I have myself and I'm in peace with myself, but I see years passing by and I'm just still, wanting to love someone, just alone. 

Thanks for reading me and if you have some advice I'd really appreciate it 🙂."
lonely,“But how could you be lonely when you have 4 kids?”,"“But how could you be lonely when you have 4 kids?” - This is something I’ve given up trying to answer to those who have never experienced debilitating loneliness. 

I love my children (four teens). I will not overly burden them with my own struggles or loneliness. 

I crave adult conversation and connection. Having my person when at events. To sleep next to. To talk about my day. Have intimacy. 

Kids don’t fulfill those needs. Not at all. 

I share 50/50 custody with their dad. And when the kids aren’t with me I just work my ass off or watch Netflix until really late. Trying to fill that hole of loneliness with distraction. Go to bed so late that I exhausted and fall asleep immediately instead of laying there sobbing. 

People just don’t understand that having kids won’t take away the loneliness."

My parents are cutting me off financially next year. I get that. So I’m working two jobs and I still don’t really have friends where I’m at.  My youth has been wasted and I’m going to be mediocre. I’m too busy/stressed for my hobbies. All I do is work out, school and work. I’m still lonely and friendless. Not to mention that five of my friends just died recently. I should be going to football games and hanging out with people. Am I just meant not to have fellowship? My stepdad texted me yesterday asking if I was enjoying myself out here. I can’t even reply to him because I’d rather say nothing than tell him the truth. I’m afraid of never coming out of this."

lonely,loneliness engulfs me,"loneliness engulfs me - i cant take it anymore. its eating me up on the inside. i cant fucking live like this.

i have pratically no friends. i had a few in high school but we’ve pretty much stopped talking. i have one childhood friend but we rarely talk. so basically, i have no friends.

i am a month and a few weeks into college and i am still unbearably lonely. joined a club but i keep on missing the meetings, which are infrequent as is. hopefully i will meet people through it.

but basically, i have nobody. people pass me by, completely unaware of how utterly sad and hopeless i feel. i just walk by without saying a thing, like everyone else.

nobody knows. nobody knows the utter desolation inside of me. nobody knows how lonely i feel. nobody knows how existential my thoughts are, how i feel as if i will never find what it is i truly want to do with my life.

i dont even know who i am, because i never have the time to think about it. just constantly stressed and depressed.

lonely. so fucking lonely. so alone. so isolated.

what is it like, what is it like to have an irl friend whom you truly love? who you truly care about? who you dont just like, but feel a genuine emotional connection to?

what is it like to visit a friend’s house on a late saturday night and hang out, talk, watch a movie, wrestle, go to the park, visit the mall, and interact with? a friend who you just dont like, but genuinely love?? who you feel as if you could talk about anything with?

i… have never experienced this feeling before. in all of my 18 years of life.

and it eats me up inside. it makes me want to cry.

all of my friendships have felt incredibly superficial. we just talked about either school or video games all the time. i shouldve opened up to my previous friends emotionally, so i am not trying to cast blame. they are good people. i was an idiot who had and has no self-worth or initiative.

i dont wanna consume the latest piece of entertainment just to relate to other people. i hate how all of my friendships were only founded based off the shit we liked. i may as well not have a friendship at all if we can only relate to each other through school, youtube videos, or video games.

THIS SHIT DOESNT MATTER. none of it does!! people matter. i hate how i feel as if i have to “work” for friendship. like i have to custom tailor myself for people to like me, because i just dont really care about anything. i have dreams but my depression overrides my autonomy. so i cant do anything.

im so fucking uninteresting. i have no personality. i hate my life and i hate myself. i am inhuman.

but friends. true friends. do they even exist? could anyone ever love me?"

I slept with him but felt awful after doing so, like it was his plan all along. It happens every time I get to know a guy. I sleep with them because I so badly crave intimacy. I lost my first kiss and v card all in the same night last year, and it's been a non stop cycle of boys showing me that they might care about me, only to be used for sex. I don't really know if I can trust another guy again. The pain is absolutely unbearable. I am young, 19, and I know most guys only think with their dicks, but I get so shocked and jealous when I see my friends in healthy happy relationships. Its like I'm fuckable but not datable. I pretend like it's all okay, but it's not. It's so cold and lonely. 

On a happier note, today I ended things with a guy who only ever wants to talk about sex with me. I usually get ghosted. But I feel okay. I still crave his attention even though I know he won't ever be able to provide real feelings for me. It sucks. I get attached so easy. 

I'm working on stopping this cycle of sleeping with guys and craving more, but it's hard."

The people I can talk too just say ""find a way to distract yourself"" or ""I've been there before I know what it's like and to be honest you don't have any reason to have those thoughts"".

I was definitely introverted growing up and was never a part of the social kids in school. It just kind of seems like people just pretended I didn't exist or wasn't worth their time. I rarely tried to get into social situations outside of track and cross country in high school, but that's also because I just felt like I couldn't. I've always had very limited friends and being social is something I've struggled with my whole life, especially considering that I have problems with my mental health that make everything difficult.

I'm now a senior in college and I think I've greatly improved with talking to people and being social. However, I'm still usually alone. I always feel like the ""backup friend"" in most of the groups I've been in and I just feel like people don't care about me as much.

And of course, I still haven't dated. I'm not ugly, I am decently muscular, and I'm 5'11 (because that matters to many people apparently), and I can also now say that I'm pretty good at socializing. But I just don't know what to do or how to start. My university is around 60% female, so there's definitely no shortage of women. But I just don't know how to meet them. And me not trying, like in high school, is no longer a valid reason because I am a part of several clubs and student leadership organizations. I just don't know why it's like this for me.

I just feel like I don't have the key to that door, like I'm cursed, like I speak a different language or I'm just not a human. Tinder doesn't do anything for me either, as I don't get matches.

They never give a clear reason as to why. If I ever get back in contact with them in the future, it's as if they never address the ghosting (and usually proceed to just re-ghost).

Sometimes I wonder if I'm clearly insane or something and everyone else can see it besides me."

lonely,Have friends but still feel lonely,"Have friends but still feel lonely - I am a 21 year old grad student. I am still at my undergraduate institution because I am in a 3+3 physical therapy program, so I am still around my undergrad friends and boyfriend but have also gotten to meet some new people in my first year of grad school. I am a social person and get along with a lot of people around me but I feel lonely quite often because I never really get invited to hang out with people. This causes me to be over-reliant on my boyfriend to hang out, but I obviously can’t expect him to be with me every moment of my free time. I also am an RA so I live alone, which certainly causes me to feel lonely sometimes. I am almost always the one to reach out to friends to hang out, which I don’t mind doing usually, but it would be nice to be invited by friends to hang out on weekends. I am quite busy between classes, studying, and my job as an RA, so I think most people think I’m busy most of the time, but sometimes it feels like I’m my friends’ back-up option and/or they just don’t think of me unless I reach out to them. It sounds silly to say as a 21 year old, but I wish I felt more connected to my friends and sometimes feel like I need new friends. Not sure if I should just try to make new friends or share how I feel with my current friends. Anybody relate or have tips?"

So I’ve been seeing my school counselor/social worker to talk about my problems bc as you know I am lonely. And she’s been giving me great advice. But my mom isn’t supportive of it at all. She believes that it can go on my record and that info can be used against me somehow. I’ve told my counselor ab it and she told me to try to let my mom know that it isn’t like that at all. I tried to talk to my mom about it but it ended with her yelling at me and telling me not to see the counselor anymore. What should I even do at this point? I’m just really upset ab this whole situation.
lonely,i need a couch,"i need a couch - this is........very stupid but i've been trying to find a couch for days since moving into a new apartment. i see so many options and I'm willing to go for them but I'm alone by myself. i can't buy the couch that comes with a loveseat. there will be no one to sit on it...and even then, I cant just buy a couch because that means I will need help to pick it up and bring it into the apartment. i don't know anywhere here that's willing to help me. the process will be me doing everything alone...as usual

growing up isn't what I thought it would be. i'm suffering doing everything alone and with no one to share that with. i got an apartment. idk if anyone is happy for me about that. i thought moving out away from past roommates would be good for me, and it has. but this is different. now, no one knows if i'm happy. no one knows anything about me or my well-being. it's like I don't really exist anymore. i closed myself off from everyone."
lonely,F21 Kind of scared that I might never have a father,"F21 Kind of scared that I might never have a father - Grew up without a dad here. When I was really young I didn’t care, but around puberty I started getting awkward with guys and I guess was subconsciously interested in father figures. A few years later, after my first relationship with an older guy, I felt a bit like a baby duck looking for someone to follow and learn from, maybe even imprint on lol. Now I don’t have those relationships and I’m 21, realizing that I might never have a father figure. Is it too late? The best thing I can think of is to marry one, but I can’t find any, and historically speaking my taste in guys stinks. 

So what is there to do, but get over it and accept the jealousy of other girls and the fact that I’ll never have someone to lean on?"
lonely,Ramblings of a stranger,"Ramblings of a stranger - I don’t have anyone to talk to so I’m just going to use this post to get out all of my thoughts in hopes that it’ll clear my mind. Feel free to ignore if if you do choose to read this Im sorry if nothing I say makes sense or is confusing, I probably won’t include much context for the things I mention being as this post is more for me to vent into the void.

Im honestly not really sure how to start, I just feel worthless, pathetic, and like a disappointment. I hate everything about myself from my non existent personality to my lack of talent and purpose, my looks, my past, and I hate the fact that I am getting worse at pushing down my emotions. My entire life has been dedicated to not being a failure yet here I am, feeling like I’m failing everyone around me. I can’t talk for the life of me or express my thoughts as you’ll be able to see for yourself through this pathetic novel. speaking is incredibly difficult for me and therefore even though people try to talk to me I end up making the other person feel awkward. I’m an awful friend, older sister, and an even worse daughter. I’m never good enough, I suck at everything, I don’t deserve my friends or anything good that comes my way. I recently found out Im on pace to become my schools valedictorian and instead of being happy I feel worse than ever. I’m no one special, there are so many people who deserve the title much more than me, Im a fraud. I’m a fucking fraud. If I do become Valedictorian Im sure everyone will hate me and I’ll feel undeserving of the title but if I don’t get it I’ll disappoint everyone and myself. The way I feel is the complete opposite of how I present myself. Everyone thinks I’m collected, like I’m a ray of sunshine, always happy, always smiling, respectful, shy, this perfect person incapable of every doing anything wrong, but that’s not me at all. I can’t do anything right, i let down everyone that’s important to me, there isn’t a single day where I don’t feel like garbage or where I don’t wish that life would just end. how I act in public or online is the furthest thing from an accurate reflection of me. Im so tired, Im tired of everything, I’m exhausted, and i can’t even stick to just facing my own problems, it seems like there’s a giant banner of my head that says “free therapy” or “unload all of your problems into here”, I’m glad people see me as a happy person who has everything figured out but Im tired of people using me as some sort of therapist.  I of course still give everyone a listening ear and unconditional support because I’m super afraid of having people dislike me. I can’t even help myself, how am i supposed to help others. I don’t know what to do I feel like I’m falling apart I can’t even form clear sentences I’m just overwhelmed by everything, I haven’t slept in 3 days thinking about school, my future, and everything that’s wrong with me, my brain just won’t shut up i feel like I’m losing it. I’ve developed the ability to act completely different than how I feel. You wouldn’t be able to see a hint of sadness in person, and through text even less! It’s so easy to act ok through the screen. Just add exclamation points and a smile at the end of everything, maybe a few emojis, and you’re the happiest person in the world! 🥳 anyone can do it, I just don’t know how long I can keep up this act. The only reason I haven’t done anything to end things is because I’m a coward and it would be selfish to die, I know it would break my moms and my sisters’ hearts and I couldn’t do that to them. I have no intention of harming myself but I really don’t want to keep going. Im so afraid of the future, I have no aspirations or goals, my existence is meaning less, and as a senior in hs I feel like I’m running out of time to get my shit together and decide what I plan to do for the rest of my life. I’m so full of fear and hatred, specifically towards myself and my shit father who has been able to continue to ruin my life without even being in it. I can’t sleep due to me reliving events he has caused and I can’t even hear the sound of a phone ringing without getting anxious and feeling my heart sink. I despise him, I feel like everything that’s wrong with me is somehow his fault. I often get compared to him by family on his side in an attempt to connect us since I’ve refused to see or speak to him for several years, and it’s just so fantastic being compared to the person you hate the most, doesn’t make me feel like shit at all being compared to a manipulative, emotionally abusive, misogynistic, and narcissistic parent. I get criticized for not forgiving my father and I feel like no one is on my side. The only thing that makes me feel ok is validation from father figures and I feel pathetic for admitting it. There isn’t a single person in my life who has seen me break and I intend on keeping it that way, Im worried that if I ever share how I feel the people who I don’t even deserve to have will leave me. They’ll think Im crazy, I’ve been putting on this act for way too long now, it’s too late to pretend to be anything other than ok. Thank you for listening to the pathetic ramblings of a sleep deprived teen and sorry my thoughts are so scattered, as I mentioned speaking and just expressing myself in general is not my forte. Hope you have a great day"

lonely,was going to watch porn again,"was going to watch porn again - Like some of the people here i use porn as a cope since i cant reasonably expect a girl to have any feelings for me since i am a short weak dude. Even if i work out i will still be a poor frame, short dude. As i was lubing up my fleshlight and getting ready to pull up another video, i stopped. I tried to keep up with what i wanted to do. I told myself, ""you have to, you arent human but you have human desires, this is the only way you can control yourself completely"" i still didnt move. ""youre not a man, this is what you have to do, women want to be with men"" I thought about the hundreds of couples i saw at my job today. I remembered how they touched each other, how the women looked looking at their men. The men were so much better looking than me, taller, stronger. It made me wish i could be born with the genetics to be like them. I will never have a woman look at me like that. I looked at all the men who were better than me all day. To go home after such abuse and screw a rubber toy felt..humiliating. I cant keep living like this but i dont see an escape in sight. I wish i was never born. Or if i was, at least be born as a normal man so id at least have something to work with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work hard i try to tell myself, yet no woman wants me. I try to tell myself i am worth something but i am extremely touch starved and have gotten reassurance i am ugly. I am only useful for what i can do, if i can no longer do the work i do, i get tossed to the side, not valued as any more than an object. And its been this way my entire life. Girls might one day want me for my money but i will not be a woman's fantasy. I will just be good enough for the time being. Tell better comes along. And in that time i cant be imperfect. I will be competing with so many dudes. 

&amp;#x200B;

So i continue to sit here, overdosing on porn and trying to replace the feeling of affection and human contact."

lonely,I’m tired of feeling like the odd one out,"I’m tired of feeling like the odd one out - Ever since I was a kid, I have always felt like I am the one in the group that is left out, or that no one wants to talk to/hang out with. I am an introvert and shy, but I truly care about people that are a part of my life (I am a cancer after all) and can count on one hand how many true friends I have. I will be the first to admit that I am awkward in social settings as well. I was bullied in high school and don’t have a lot of confidence in myself. Because of this, meeting new people is very intimidating and it takes me a long time to warm up to people. 

I’ve been at my current job for about 3 years and I have a handful of coworkers that I consider my work family. One of them was supposed to get married last year, but then had to move her wedding twice due to COVID. In the summer of 2020, we had gotten to know each other more and became friends. One day on our break last year, she had told me that if I wanted, I could come to her wedding reception, after the dinner to celebrate. I was so excited and couldn’t wait! I didn’t mind that I wasn’t invited to the entire thing, I figured that the guest list was already made prior to her having to move her date. And I know how expensive a wedding is, since I’m currently planning my own. Since then, I would say that we have became pretty good friends and have spent time together outside of work with other coworkers.

Fast forward to the day of the wedding. I confirmed with her what time to be there after dinner. I’m about to start getting ready and I see a post from a coworker. There is about 10 other coworkers and they are all at her wedding ceremony. I instantly feel my eyes well up with tears and I can’t control how upset I feel. I had only known of 3 coworkers that she was very close with that were invited, but I didn’t think that so many others were invited and I wasn’t. Two of the coworkers pictured have only been working with us for about 6 months, so the whole idea of the guest list being set last year was complete crap in my mind. I told my fiancé that I did not want to go anymore because of how upset I was and I ended up spending the evening on the couch watching movies. I still texted her, apologizing for not being able to make it, and wished her congratulations, as I was sitting there crying. 

I don’t mean to sound petty in this post, but this just has me feeling so down on myself, that I’m not good enough to be included in things. I don’t know what I expect to come of this. I guess I just need to vent, and to feel like I’m not alone."

I don’t ever want to have sex again or date a woman, or even be close friends with a woman.  I don’t enjoy masturbation much either.  I don’t by any means believe all women are like that and I’m sure lots of men are borderline sociopathic too, but even under the best of circumstances I don’t want companionship or intimacy.  I don’t want friends either.  I to tell you the truth just want a dog or animal that will love you unconditionally and always be there for you."
lonely,Not trying to think negatively but it seems like I have to,"Not trying to think negatively but it seems like I have to - Alone on the weekend again. 

I started thinking about how my childhood experiences, of not being able to go out, of being criticized all the time, and yes of having anxiety or my personal personality characteristic caused all of my problems in connecting with people. And I also thought of how I kept going back to my parents now I was able to understand the grey area of my parents were really there for me in some ways, but in being unconditional and developing love they failed miserably so having that distinction instead of black and white thinking helped me calm down.

 I thought of how people directly took advantage of that, people who took advantage that I had no support to fall back on like they did. That I had to fight for my independence while they had it handed to them as teenagers, could go out, etc. It only bites at me now because every potential friend I meet has those things to fall back upon. 'remember when i was 14 and having a sleep over' When I have no such experiences to talk about, no I didn't hang out with buddies younger though I wish I got to. Trying to relate with normal people. There are so many damn people why do they all fall back on this?

I also thought of how I directly paid my dues in therapy, and volunteering, the countless times I joined groups, tried to meet people, directly talked to them. All the work I put in to love myself and not hate myself. 

It's all about taking actions to help yourself be better but it gets to a point when you Have actually done *all of it*, and the reason is you can no longer do it anymore. You can no longer go out alone anymore or join groups and pretend you don't hate yourself when you talk because you know you do and you are tired of fighting your own battle. And then try to pretend you are interested in the subject, of trying to talk to people my age, and then connecting with people in their 60s. Meet people and try to not blurt out that actually you'd be happy if you had one friend but you can't seem to just accept yourself. The pain I go through when I force myself: 'you're going alone again. they can tell you hate yourself. why are you doing this, for other people? why are you still trying so hard. All those people from college are working good jobs and have their relationships. why am I the only again? What the fuck exactly happened to me again. Why do I still feel like this like I was 10 years old. If I don't go, sitting at home isn't helping. I get so angry.'

I just hope there are people who could see me and pray for me. The past therapists I had. Those friendly people in the past. I'm just hoping that not all of it was malicious and they could actually see that they got things I never did and I was actively trying to work around it, instead of taking advantage of me. I was hoping people had some ounce of empathy and understanding."

A clever algorithm that covers age, gender, common interests (probably the best feature), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀!","Find-a-friend with only 28 questions! A clever algorithm that covers age, gender, common interests (probably the best feature), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"

I message them first all the time and Im genuine in how I talk and pay attention to them but it's like they don't care.

I understand life is hard right now but what should I do? We've barley talked at all and it hurts when they ghost me."

lonely,i want whatever it is to be constant,"i want whatever it is to be constant - I don’t understand it. It keeps on repeating the same patterns. One day I am depressed and can’t do anything or have the desire to do anything and then the other day I want to do everything all at once and in a few days or hours I am back at the same old slump. It’s the fact that this keeps on repeating that makes me mad. It’s either I have to do everything or I can’t do anything. I don’t know when I will fall out of this cycle.

I truly appreciate my parents trying their best to support me in getting my mental health back in order and providing me with resources to fix me. But the thing is, with the sudden outpour of help and understanding I feel like everything I have felt in the past two years have dissipated, I’m not even sure if I was depressed. Every feeling of sorrow, desperation, hopelessness and worthlessness I felt seems like it never existed to begin with.

I still don’t feel happy. Honestly, I feel nothing but I am not sad. Yet it is frustrating when what you have felt disappears in an instant and now you come to question whether all this was a façade that you created. But it was so real. All the emotions feel distant now.

I don’t know how to explain how I’ve been feeling when the doctor asks. I haven’t met the doctor yet but I feel like when I would meet them I would be completely blank. Like everything I have felt was a lie.

Right now, I want to get out of my bed and do something. I have been creating playlists on how to photoshop pictures, sketching lessons, and various other things. The thing is I want to do it all now and the thought that if that's the case then I would never be completing anything is overburdening. It’s crippling sometimes to not understand why you just can’t start now, right now and let whatever the future holds be it. Everything seems at a hand’s reach but at the same unattainable."

I’m starting to hate my bestfriend’s friend. - Is it wrong to feel like my bestfriend that i’ve known for 15 years has been taken away from me? She has this friend that she met at work a couple years ago and since the pandemic, they have been closer than ever. I don’t mind my bestfriend having friends or other bestfriends but her friend seems very possessive and when we all hang out, she seems passive aggressive. It’s like she wants to claim my bf for herself and make me feel like an outcast. Of course my bestfriend won’t say anything cause thats her bestfriend.

I’ve never had an issue with her but she seems shady towards me sometimes and my bestfriend see’s the face I make unintentionally when I feel her friend is trying to be disrespectful or funny probably without knowing. Also, I feel like she talks behind my back to my bf because sometimes when we hang, she acts different but I see through her and I don’t like that.

 So, i’ve been distant with my bestfriend and she doesn’t seem to like it because she always sends stuff on instagram and try to interact which I don’t really anymore. I was a very caring and helpful to her and her family for years. Am I crazy to think that? I’m also Libra, I love everybody but people don’t know their boundries and I feel like i’ve endured too much and i’m getting tired of this fakeness. Could I be crazy or should I trust my gut feeling?"

I don’t have anyone who prioritises me. Everyone has their friends and their priorities. I am not anyones priority. I am the last option. When nobody else is there, and there is nothing else to do, some people flock over to hear about the life that barely is. 

I hate my life and I genuinely want to end this. My friends saw my scars and took away my knife. But I’ve ordered a new one. It’ll come soon. It’s the only outlet I have left. I have no friends anymore. I’m alone, and that’s all I’ll ever be."

I would like to express what I feel right now :) - I’m lonely, very lonely. People at school talk to me, and I feel that they like me. A couple of days ago was my birthday and I felt very loved by a lot of people, but I feel that I am not close to anyone, and probably that I would never be. My strongest points of sadness are in the weekends, during the week I feel mostly fine, because I feel accompanied by my classmates and some friends, but just when the weekend arrives my sadness increases, everyone plans where they will go, What they will do, and I have never been part of these plans. I ask them what they would do on the weekend, to see if that way I can receive an invitation, but no, they tell me about their plans, without even thinking about me (which they shouldn't, but I would like them to). Usually I get tired of people, I don't like many of them and I tend to walk away, but at the same time I have this desire and necessity, to go out with them. The more I know someone, the more disappointed I am, and I know that probably when I get this thing I desire so much, I will end up disappointed. I am alone, and I think I always will be. I don't see any hope of getting better anytime soon, but I see my adult life even worse. I have been to two psychologists and a few talks at school with some teachers, they have all told me that I am not well and that I need to do something to be better. Everyone has also told me that many of the things I feel are not ""normal"" for my age. Right now, I’m not going to any psychologist, and I haven’t talked to no one of my problems for more than a year. I haven’t done anything for a month, no activity whatsoever, my favorite activities have bored and disinterested me. I do not have something that motivates me at the moment and I doubt very much that I will in the future. I went to two friends asking if they would like to go out; Mainly what I wanted is to be invited to one of the meetings or parties to which they go…. Unfortunately I did not receive a satisfactory answer. One was last week, and she told me that she had nothing planned for the day, she is a very good friend, and she has helped me a lot. The other person I asked was yesterday, I still haven't received an answer ... I don't know if I will. I have said this to both of them at an emergency point when I feel like I can no longer handle this painful feeling inside of me. I don't like how my actual situation is, but I think that if I continue like this, my future will be worse. I don't know what to do, I feel like every day I am drowning more and more, until there will be a point where I will make a decision, which probably a year ago I said I would never make ... every day I think more and more about making that decision. I felt the need to express this, thank you."
lonely,Only 21 but I know no one will ever love me (romantically),"Only 21 but I know no one will ever love me (romantically) - (21M) I am the most popular loser you’ve never met. I have more loving and caring friends than I can count, some of which have done things for me I can never repay. I have a plethora of good friends, acquaintances, educational colleagues, ect. who I have met and appreciate here at college. I’ve single handedly connected a web of hundreds  of people at my college who now have friends they’d never meet without me. I am invited constantly out every social event you could imagine. If your still reading this, you must be asking yourself “why is this idiot posting here then?” 

Well the reason is that even though I am a master socializer on a platonic level, I am the worst people on earth at attracting anyone romantically. I’ve tried and tried but in the end I get shut down. I have all the friends in the world but not a single kiss to show for it. I’m a kiss-less short fat virgin loser whose only good at making friends with people who are all objectively much more attractive and valuable than me. It’s like I’m cursed. It’s like the sheep who made friend with the sheepdogs. They love me, appreciate me, help me, but at the end of the day were just not the same people. Imagine going to a bar and seeing 10 6’ 3” handsome dudes all hanging out and having a good time, and at the end of the table is their 5’5” fat and ugly friend that’s out of place. That’s me. All the women I know have never even showed a morsel of romantic affection towards me. I have introduced countless couples, one night stands, lovers, ect. but none of its for me. 

The attention me and the close friends attracts at parties is palpable. Every woman in there wants to fuck every single one of my friends, but not me. Not to be mean, but not even the unattractive girls like me. You know how many times I’ve walked up to a few of my friends at a party while their talking to strangers, and my friends literally have to spell out the fact that we came together? Doesn’t happen to anyone else We know. Attractive people and ugly people tend to not mix in friend groups, but I’m the sorry piece of shit who was born in the wrong body I guess. 

I’m making this post and asking if anyone here is in the same boat as me? How do I get away from this curse???? Please. I’ll take any advice. Almost all of My friends have  tried setting me up with their friends, but since they’re attractive, so are the girls they introduce me to. Let’s just saw I’ve never even gotten close with their friends. Save me."
lonely,Relationships sucks.,"Relationships sucks. - Idk if this subreddit is the right place to vent- I mean I do feel lonely, and I hate it, I’m new to reddit and I don’t even know if reddit is the right place to vent, I can’t vent on discord because my bf he’s with me in all servers and I’m currently mad at him and I don’t want him to know I’m online. Ugh I just want to fucking cry for eternity, it really hurts what he did to me, I’ve gave him everything, love, care, attention, staying by his side no matter what and I do anything to make him happy, I even stay up at nights for him and I’ve skipped classes for him when he felt really down, I got in so many troubles for him, I save up money for him to pay money for his uni stuff, why do I do that? Well my bf he’s the only person I have who I would go to when the whole world is against me, back then he used to love me a lot, he used to call me cute names, he used to calm me down and he also was always by my side then all the sudden he have changed and we went through so many arguments because of his change, he stopped loving me, he stopped caring about me, he talks so cold to me and idk why he started to be like that towards me, he says he loves me but where? His friends says he loves me as well but I don’t see it anymore, I tried to talk to him asking him why he changed and why he talks so cold to me and he said ""I’m always like that’s"" or he says that he feel stressed, and I was like ok sure I understand that but even in summer vacation he barely loves me, just rarely, we used to sleep on calls with our camera on then we stopped.. we used to talk to each other on the call with microphones on and that also stopped, so many things have stopped and I always ask my self did I do something wrong? 
Then this week he said something that hurts me more then that one time when we argued with me and called me ""bitch"" or says ""fuck u"" to me, i mean it hurt but we were really angry and I said some back as well cuz I was really angry as well, but this time it crossed the line, it went too fucking far, I went through so much for him, I loved him at good times and bad times, my PayPal balance is at 0 because I gave it all to him (and no he never asks for money, I give him when he needs it because I fucking care for him and because of covid he doesn’t have a job) I am working really hard at my uni so I can see him and live with him, I’ve did all my best for him, and you know what he said about me this week? That i am not special.. that im like everyone else in his life.. u know why he says that? Because I’ve asked him where did he go when I was waiting for him because at that time I really needed him, and he knows im waiting for him and he knows that he should tell me because we both agreed ages ago to tell each other what we did today and what we are doing right now so we know that we’re busy and we give each other the time for them selfs.. that day I was feeling shit because of my abusives dad, I went to talk to my bf to speak to him cuz I needed him and he ditched me and he went outside without telling me.. I wasn’t mad at him I just asked where did he go cuz I waited 3 hours for him and he said ""I live a lone life and ur not special ur like any other person to me I forget that u exists"" and that day it really hurts me, it felt all my love efforts just went away, like it’s nothing to him, I got upset and I’ve told him it hurts me what he said and then he said ""ur stressing me out don’t speak to me"" and I asked him if he fucking cares about my feelings.. he said no. 
U know, I don’t have much friends I don’t have friends who are free to talk to me and hes the only person I have in my life who used to stand by my side all the time, now idk how I feel about this, I feel lonely In this relationship,I feel so lonely all the time cuz he never pays attention to me.. it hurts, I just wanted love I just wanted him to fucking communicate with me properly instead of acting that way, but I can’t change him, I’m a dumbass for even trying too for a while, all the love I’ve gave him, ment nothing to him, I’m not special to him, I’m nothing to him, I can’t stop crying, I love him so much even now but, I love the old him more and deep down I always believe he will change but I was so fucking wrong.. I’ve poured my heart to this man, now I feel stupid, I don’t wanna speak to him again until he realise what he said is the most horrible thing ever, for now, I feel really lonely, I need a friend to talk too or anyone, I don’t wanna break u- with him, I’ve dated him for 5 years now, but honestly if he wants to leave me then he can.. but I cannot love anyone else, I can’t love someone else who isn’t him, he changed me and he knows who I really am, it’s so hard to just start over and love another man, it’s impossible, he’s all over my heart even tho he treats me like shit.. I need a new friend right now, that’s why I’m here, if anyone wants to talk to me, the dms are open. 
And guys and girls, please don’t give all to someone who treats u horribly, even if ur alone, even if ur desperate, just don’t fall in the same hole as I am, I can’t even pay my own books for uni cuz I give it all to him."

However, I've now started speaking to a guy who I really like but now I'm talking to someone, I feel more lonely than I did when I was speaking to no one and I don't understand it!
It's making me paranoid and extremely lonely, and I don't think it helps that we live in different cities (I study in a different city). It's too early in the relationship for me to bring it up.
Does anyone else feel like this?"
lonely,Why is it easy for others?,"Why is it easy for others? - (F/early 20s) I don’t know why I can’t seem to find anyone I’m compatible with?  Others make it seem so easy and when I tell my friends they always tell me just find a new person. But, it’s not that easy for me as them. I keep getting ghosted or the people I’m talking to seem to just simply loose interest and stop replying or don’t put in half the effort that I do. I’m always being told oh you’re so pretty and similar things but I don’t feel it. I try to be outgoing and I’m always compromising with others and I just want to care for others but it makes me feel that there has to be something wrong with me for this to keep happening for the last 3 years. At this point I don’t even know why I am still pursuing trying to be in a relationship. The only thing I’ve been thinking about lately is I just really want a hug from someone and be it anyone. I genuinely haven’t had one in so long. I just want compassion from someone but it seems people will do it for others except me."

lonely,Just wanna be heard... I guess.,"Just wanna be heard... I guess. - I'm  feeling so lonely  and unloved right now. Even though logically i know I'm  loved. My doctor told me i have to have surgery again, it isnt a major surgery but like imma have to heal alone this time because i have no one here. 
I pushed myself to read all of my articles due for next week so that tomorrow  I could enjoy a trip with a new friend but, that got canceled because she got injured.  Whoch isn't  her fault i completely  understand just after  the news from the doctor  and  pushing sohard through my reading sucked so bad. 

Then to give one more try at saving our friendship, I tried contacting  a friend who was upset with me and invited her to hang out with  me and a mutual  friend.  I sent it yesterday  morning and she didn't  respond.  I was/am so tired of  being in a relationship  that I worked hard at and then being ignored  and feeling unloved amd unvalued. So I told her that  and that I am understanding  her choice of not interacting  with me as her no longer wanting to be friends and not valuing  the friendship we had and officially saod goodbye. 

Even Friday evening Ibhad dinner plans woth another lady and that got canceled too. Again, i understand why and it isn't on her. I waited all week for this weekend and everything and just notbturned out the way I expected and  kind of needed... it like confirms this illogical  thought in my mond that I'm  unlovable or  like no one actuall really like me. Like I'm  just a space filler for people."
lonely,10 months of loyalty,"10 months of loyalty - TL;DR I got fucked over after 10 months of being with a man who didn’t have any plans of trying to be in a relationship with me. Now i’m looking like a clown, feeling lonelier than before this. 

(F 28) I met this man at work in november. (Yea, don’t date your coworkers, whatever) We both have kids the same age, worked at the same place, have similar interests. Our friends at the work place noticed we both are single for a substantial amount of time. I made the first move to talk to him, and he reciprocated and we got on pretty well. He didn’t want a relationship (said that he would try to be in a relationship with me) and i was aware. I’m the type to be like whatever my feelings/heart is gonna do it, it’ll just happen. Well, by end of december we were telling each other i love you. I didn’t think it was too soon, as things like that happen… until..

Fast forward 10 months later, our kids have met, we’ve went on trips together etc etc. and six months before today he stopped saying i love you. We went though some rough patches, never defined what kind of relationship it was, we were exclusive to each other. I was okay going with whatever we were doing. Last night he told me he’s been mean to me on purpose to get me to leave him alone, now he just wants to be friends and yea i’m heartbroken because typical woman caught feelings, i’m still in love. I’m more upset at the fact that i wasted time trying to get someone to want a relationship with me and letting him drag me along. Why couldn’t i have been stronger and left it at a one night stand. 

Now i sit here, lonely af because i was loyal for 10 months and got crushed. I feel pathetic and i honestly don’t know that i want to try dating or meet anyone for any kind of relationship, even friendship."

All of them abandoned me within 6 months. It’s those people that I miss when I say “I’m lonely”. Since then I’ve been scarred, I can’t talk to new people. I can’t make friends. It’s been so long since I’ve tried talking to someone new, but I can still hear the “fuck off” “go away loser” “get lost idiot” (to put it mildly). I just don’t know if I *can* find a new friend. I guess I look pretty unapproachable, because all this time I’ve been hoping someone will just talk to me instead. or maybe people have the same fear I do, of rejection, of being the black sheep. I don’t know anymore. And I don’t think I want to."

Everyone is in a different city my only respite for talkin' on the phone with my friends now all they talk about is there cute relationships if they ever call. And I am happy for them they deserve it. But  when will I have someone to do cute couply things with :(.

lonely,"Today is the day I admit that I am lonely. I tell everyone being unmarried is liberating, but it's actually the worst.","Today is the day I admit that I am lonely. I tell everyone being unmarried is liberating, but it's actually the worst. - Like many other unmarried people in their 30's, I tell people how being unmarried is actually very liberating. I tell people how it's financially easier, how nice it is not to have someone constantly look over your shoulder.

But it's a lie I just tell myself.

Today, October 2, 2021, is the day I rid myself of that lie. I am 31, unmarried, living with my parents, and lonely.

I have many friends to talk to and hang out with, but apparently you can also be lonely even when surrounded by a million people. That's because loneliness is not a physical issue, but a social one. When you are not high up on someone's priority list, you are lonely.

It's time to admit that once you reach a certain age, you just need a long-term companion. At some point, you have to suck up all the flaws and negative aspects of a relationship, and accept that it's just the way life is. The alternative, being lonely, is a cold barren wasteland, devoid of any life and is no way of living life. It is a prison in the middle of an isolated island in the harsh winter.

Tonight is the night I admit to myself, that I am ready for a serious long-term relationship, preferably one where we can live together."

I've been trying dating apps but with the pandemic and restrictions still being serious where I am I haven't met anyone. 

To top it off my dad tried to be helpful by saying ""don't worry, women these days don't need a man to be happy. You can find a way to be a single mum. You don't need a man to be happy."" It just made me sad because it feels like my dad doesn't think I will find anyone either. Just like my ex said"

The last person who I could call a friend, the only one who ever checked in on me &amp; I just lost the last person in the word who cared about me  …. 
I’m disabled, not working, I live alone, don’t have a car &amp; have absolutely nobody left. I don’t know what I did to deserve this but I wish I could take it back.  I am so lonely it hurts, I don’t know why nobody cares &amp; it hurts more each day that passes, it’s not fair.

I have no reason to get out of bed, my life is meaningless, I’m lost &amp; scared.  I’m not sure how much longer I’ll be able to live like this, I don’t want to die but I don’t want to feel like this anymore, I didn’t know it was possible for a person to be this sad or lonely &amp; it’s all just too much for me. The very thin thread I’m holding on by is quickly breaking &amp; I am terrified of what’s going to happen when it inevitably breaks. 

Again I really don’t want to die but I can’t help but to think it’s my only chance for some peace.  It would really prove to those once close to me how much pain I was really in &amp; how lonely my life was…. 

It might not seem like it but I’m trying to fight, I really am, but the darkness is bigger than me &amp; I can’t fight it alone.  

Why doesn’t anybody love me? Just 1 person to care is all I want, is that asking too much? I’m so sorry for whatever I did to deserve this …."

lonely,It's going to be six months since she left...,"It's going to be six months since she left... - ...and I still don't know how to cope with her presence missing. I'm still living as if she's here. Sometimes I'm still talking to her non-existent ghost. The other side of the bed is empty but I still make the bed every morning and wish a good night and good morning to the person that isn't even there. I still feel so empty inside, all I do is just work, excersise and sleep but everything is so disconnected and automated.

Ironically I don't miss her as a person anymore. Her image in my mind had dissolved in to some non-specific idolized person and it's the memories and feelings that I miss. Feelings of emotional warm, of belonging, of being someone's significant other, memories about those short moments of genuine happines... It feels like a septic wound now, that is slowly chipping away foundations of my personality. I used to be so fucking mentally strong. Grinded alone by sheer will through the shit most of you only read about in news...

I never felt that empty inside. Like if a part of me died or something. I rarely cried in my life. I didn't even cry when doctors told me to consider a chance for an amputation of my left arm if they won't manage to put crushed joints back together using implants (they did). But today, in my 32nd year of life where people are grown up adults, I cry like a little whelp that got his favorite toys taken away.

Sometimes I see her. She seems so happy, full of energy and fresh. As if I was that iron ball chained to her ankle that was dragging her down. Sometimes few mutual friends we have give me updates. She's socializing with her friends, visiting local cultural events, etc... meanwhile all I now know is just job and working out. I isolated myself so deep inside of my shell I lost the way out and I'm slowly losing it...

I feel so alone now that I know what it’s like to be loved - I’m (26F) growing up I had so many friends back in my home town (moved to a different state when I was 20) so many so that when I went back there I couldn’t see all of them cos I’d run out of time. Now when I go back I have one friend left to see, she’s been my best friend since we were like 4. I’m beginning to think there’s something wrong with me, they all just said I’d changed.. I think I’m just sick of always people pleasing and being the happy person all the time when I’m not actually happy. In the state I’m living in now, I made heaps of new friends but they’re all busy all the time, I don’t see them as much as I’d like to, I feel like I surround my life around them but I’m just an option to them. In January, the love of my life broke up with me cos he said he wasn’t sure if he could see a future with me right now and he moved away. I literally feel so alone, like I have no one. I also barely have any family, my mother is schizophrenic and always goes off her medications and is untraceable for weeks / months at a time ( she is currently ignoring me for no apparent reason) my father passed away. I’m an only child. 
Losing my S.O I feel like I’ve lost my best friend, we’ve just gone 27 days no contact so far, I miss him so much, he brought so much happiness to my life, I felt so loved and safe and he was my biggest support. Recently my grandma died, then a week later found out my grandpa has stage four cancer and I cant vent to my ex about it. My friends that I do have are sick of hearing me talk about all my problems and the break up. I feel so unsupported and alone in this world. I’ve been trying to find a good therapist for months/years but doctors keep saying to me that my problems are just situational and it’ll pass, but my life has always been chaotic, especially with mum. I need help!! I want more reliable friends, I wish my mum would just be okay for once, I wish people wouldn’t die and I wish my love would come back to me.

lonely,Do you ever feel like you have to play a different personality around people?,"Do you ever feel like you have to play a different personality around people? - I only ever really see and speak to people during my college classes. Although we never really speak outside of college, I’d still call them friends. 

But when I’m with them, I feel like I have to always be a lot extra. Trying to be funny (to varying results lol) and a lot louder. Recently they said it was a bit much so I’ve toned it down, and they seem fine with it now. 

Playing it up seems to be funny for the boys in my class, but I put it as one of the reasons I’ve never been in a relationship lmao. 

Even with it, it’s exhausting, and it’s something I just do by default around them. I don’t think that I *have* to do it, it just kinda happens. And I think it’s because back in school, I had to play up this big personality since I noticed it was the only way to avoid getting bullied. 

I think I even kinda play it up a bit when talking to my family, who I still live with. 

I don’t really have anyone I can be myself around. When I’m not with them, I don’t really say or do a lot, and really boring. I don’t really enjoy a lot of stuff. 

I recently started playing VRChat, where I noticed again that by default when I speak to people, I play up this personality that I’m not a fan of. I don’t mind being funny or anything, but I don’t really get a time to just be chill around people.

I am starting to hate being around them because they all have significant others, and I don’t.
I truly am happy for them, but I’m also jealous. I’ve never been in a real relationship, and I don’t have much confidence when it comes to talking with girls.

lonely,Toxic upbringing,"Toxic upbringing - 

Hey everyone.

I am a 22m from Northern California.  I was born and a raised here to a family of middle eastern immigrants.  My father moved here when he was 12 and my mother when she was 18.  I have 7 siblings, me being the second youngest.

My father has worked hard for what we have.  We aren’t crazy rich but we are well off.  I’ve lived in the suburbs my whole life and never had to struggle for anything.  I now own my own successful business that I started with my own money.  I did receive the knowledge and mentor ship on how to open up a business from my father.

I am very grateful for what I have.  I would not be in the position I am in right now without my family.


Now that being said

Due to the circumstances of my childhood being very easy and clean, I find myself feeling very guilty being depressed.  What do you guys feel about this?

A great deal of my depression comes from the toxicity of my family/parents/and dysfunctional upbringing.

My father is very toxic and our relationship has gone to shit in this last year.  Our family is pretty dysfunctional.  None of my siblings talk to each other.  My parents relationship with each other is pretty trash as well. 

The reason I’m so sad is because I’m so exhausted here.  I am currently working on moving out as we speak.  Im so exhausted at my parents house.  It’s so unhealthy for me here. (Obviously the answer is leave, im working on it). One small thing happens here and we get into a fight.  It’s so toxic, my dad is honestly a peice of shit.  The stories I’ve heard about him are terrible.

Anyways, am I wrong for being depressed and feeling like this from my family and what not.  Im just so exhausted

Thank you for reading.  My dms are open btw &lt;3"

lonely,I've been Lonely for too long I think HL vs LL,"I've been Lonely for too long I think HL vs LL - Oh, here we go again. There is always someone who needs it more than the other partner.  I lived through all of it. Planning day after day of hopefully getting tonight, for sure, I just know it to another night of I'm too tired or my stomach hurts or back or head or legs...... you know the story. Well after many many years and rejections later I have learned to love myself. And I really like to love myself. I am just horny all the time and when I couldn't fuck someone I would fuck the next best thing that would not cause a divorce, I learned to fuck my ass. It took a while to work up to a dildo size but now that I have mastered that and leaned how to give myself prostate O's I really enjoy it but I tried to bring it up and she made a gay comment but I am anything but gay and by the way she created this sexy beast. We have a beautiful Vaca home in the mountains. Its got an amazing view a hot tub and now that the kids are grown I thought it would finally happen. She could finally relax. Still nothing extra, plus she sleeps even better at 8500 feet. LOL

So couple things.

Since she doesn't give it to me except once every 2 weeks sometimes 3, Now with 2nd home I go to the mountains and have my way with myself with my toys and then go home every 2 weeks to satisfy her. Stay for a while and then boogie back up the hill. It works out great till something needs to be fixed at home and I do miss her. But it is getting harder and harder to try and not make some friends. They have lots of things to do up here.

1.Ladies, is this ok in a real man, not some whimpy Ladyboy but like your manly husband?

2.Do any of you ladies like to chase the rabbit when you tickle the trunk? or is that just like a never, no way thang that just never enter in to a girls mind?

3.Do any Ladies think it's hot and sexy, want a man like that or just think that it could be fun?

We did all the things we were supposed to do, kinda more apparent now without kids we are on separate paths. Is just the lack of Libido in one's partner worthy enough of a reason to get a divorce. It does cause some friction and possibly resentment due to the fact that it's always been like this HLvsLL. And if anyone did was it worth it?

We have been thinking about it for a while. We could just stay but it might be time for us to fly!"

lonely,Why do I always end up crying alone?,"Why do I always end up crying alone? - Ever since I was little, I always remember crying alone. No parents to come for me, no friends or anything, just me. A lot of heavy stuff lately (parents divorced, grandmother passing and other tragic funerals) and through it all it seems like no matter how many times people tell me they'll be there, or they're always here no matter what, it seems to feel like when you need someone they're never there. I get home from a funeral today after my roommate promises she'll be home, and end up crying in an empty apartment. The same person I caught scrolling through her phone a few months ago while I was describing the pain of watching my family fall apart through this divorce. She said she just didn't know what to say in the moment and felt uncomfortable. I don't know maybe I don't ask for help enough or something, I'm just so so so tired of crying alone"

I've done a lot of research on how to take care of cats. I feel like animals tend to be comforting. I know it won't cure my loneliness or any of my mental illness but I know I'll be grateful and happy. I had a betta fish from my childhood that I still miss and think of to this day. 

I think taking care of a cat is better than sitting all day on the computer and pitying myself."
lonely,Can you keep consistently pushing to achieve your goals in spite of being lonely?,"Can you keep consistently pushing to achieve your goals in spite of being lonely? - I am a freshman in University majoring in a science undergrad in hopes of pursuing medicine after. It is an extremely competitive field and the chances of getting into it are ridiculously low.

I am not an excellent student but I graduated high school with a really good average without “trying hard”, like I did study but it was super inefficient and wasted 80% of the time. I am unorganized as shit, no friends really, diagnosed ADHD (no meds, cuz they don’t work, or any learning accommodations) and finally mild depression lol, according to my psychiatrist. 

I started working on myself lately (before uni started), trying to get more organized, adapt new techniques, fixing sleep schedule… etc. And I made some progress. However, after a couple weeks, I am starting to burnout, and fighting this battle alone makes it harder to rebound everyday cuz I am the only person that supports me cuz simply nobody believes in me (not even my parents although they never said so but I can tell), I usually get motivated for a little while by such fact but it sucks. It sucks because there isn’t anyone around to push you forward, Nobody to share your small wins with and nobody that gives a shit period."
lonely,alone in my dark room,"alone in my dark room - This is my first ever reddit post, so I apologize for any mistakes I might have made. I apologize if this isn't the right forum either

I recently moved to my university campus and my depression and loneliness have only worsened. I'm surrounded by many people daily but I have never felt more alone, even more than before. Social events make me weary and I've spent the last few days in my room, only leaving to get food. I've been crying nearly every day the past few weeks because of how depressed I am.

Today a friend from home texted me to let me know he now had a girlfriend and the manner I was texting him was inappropriate. It cemented the feeling of emptiness again. He only ever liked me because he wanted my body and he always said he wasn't looking for a relationship.  He was my best friend for 4 years. Now, I haven't seen him in less than a month and he already has a girlfriend. It makes me feel more worthless than I already do because I know that he was able to develop feelings for another girl so quickly... so it was never an ""in general"" thing. I just wasn't good enough.

I have much love to give but nobody who would like to accept it. I just yearn to cuddle with someone, I even think about cuddling with my mother like I did as a child, before bed so I can comfort myself to sleep. I am so alone. I've lost interest in most passions and my antidepressants do nothing. I wish I could touch someone and hug them over and over...I would definitely be the last person to let go. But nobody sees any worth in me or would want that from me. I miss my family terribly. 

I need to accept that I probably won't ever be happy here in this new city and that no matter where I go, I'll never be comfortable or fit in with anyone. I'm just hoping the numbness will go away and I can accept what my state is.

I'm so sorry for rambling. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this."
lonely,Feeling Down,"Feeling Down - I just recently started going to school and for the first two weeks it was amazing I met new people and I started making mutuals. I started talking to this one girl and she was nice and my type of girl. While this was happening I wanted to join the football team but my school didn’t have one so I had high hopes to play for another school but staying in the same school. After those two weeks it started going down. I emailed the athletic director and asked her about it. She told me there was no way to join another school. I asked why and she said it was a bi-law. Honestly I was put down tons cause I had worked so hard to play for a team. My luck is terrible because I could just switch schools but since parents exist I can’t switch schools. I still had the girl to talk to and it was going good. I might’ve done something wrong because this girl stopped messaging me and doesn’t talk to me at school anymore. All the people I talked to had stopped. I don’t know what to do, was there something wrong with me? I feel like I have the worst luck somehow. Was it the way I talked? Was it the the way I dressed? Was it the way I acted? I don’t know what else to do."

My friends from home all kept hanging out, and I'd visit them whenever I came back for summer/winter break. Recently tho I kinda fell out of the friend group and seeing them all hang on social media has been hard cuz I want to hang with them too. I feel like I'm always the one reaching out and now I feel like I don't really belong here. Granted I'm grateful for the times I had with them and that my family is here, but why do I feel like an outsider when I was born and raised here? 

Reddit really is therapeutic since writing this made me feel a bit better and cope with the situation, as small as it may be."

lonely,Serious question,"Serious question - This keeps me up at night. If everyone had the exact same social life as you would you still care about being lonely? When we were in lockdown and everyone was confined to there rooms all day (which was basically most of our realities beforehand) I actually no longer cared about not going out and not having many friends, I enjoyed the isolation when I knew everyone else also was experiencing the same thing. 

Its kind of the same way I like when the weather is shit and no one can go out, Im happy Im not missing out then. I feel really egotistical for feeling this way but I actually dont care that I'm lonely, its only when I compare my life to others and when they judge me for being a weird loner that it matters. 

Does this even make sense to anyone lmao"

I am a loving, loyal, smart, nurturing person. I’m the kind of gal who comes running when I sense even a tiny bit of sadness or struggle in those I love. I also live to make others laugh through words and deeds (only good hearted pranks though). Toxic negative people make me sad and scared.

My anxiety and self esteem are ruining my life. Why the fuck should it, though? 

We need to give ourselves more credit, guys. We are cool people. Some of us might be weird — like me 😀 — but we all have some things going for us. Everyone here has value and is worthy of love.

Anyway…. Let’s be each other’s favorite for just a moment. Take this hug (hug yourself for me!!!) and know that you matter. Your feelings are valid. You deserve to be not just included, but loved. 💜"
lonely,"Kicked out at 17, abandoned by parents, no female relationships whatsoever","Kicked out at 17, abandoned by parents, no female relationships whatsoever - I’m not looking for pity, but here’s my “sob story”. I was born to and Alcoholic father who was(is) absent from my life, and a narcissistic mother who never liked me for pretty much my entire life. I was kicked out of my house on 18 August for telling my mom that I wanted to do community college and transfer to a larger University, but she wanted me to go to a 4 year school. I already applied and got accepted to one earlier without any of her help. Seriously she made me do all the fafsa forms and I had to guess on some of the questions. I didn’t want to do this again so I told her my plan’s. She kicked me I that day and I grabbed my documents, and everything that could fit in a suitcase. I had nowhere to go. I worked at a grocery store but I eventually had to quit due to my situation. I couch surfed for a while until someone I use to go to church with agreed to pay for a motel for me to stay at until my 18th birthday. About a couple days after that my cars head gasket exploded and I couldn’t get food or do my laundry for a week until I could get a new car, and once I did I was completely broke. I managed to get a pretty decent job that I start on the 7th of this month


Now I’m 18 and I’ve managed to rent a room in the town I live in. Since my first night here I’ve been lonely as hell. I put it down to never having a nurturing mother or father to let me know that I’m ok, so all I want is a woman to reassure me. I tried online dating but ended up being scammed out of $100(long story), and it led to nothing. I’m a virgin, and the only girlfriend I ever had ghosted me. I have a small circle of friends that I party with but I feel like no one really gets how bad I’m struggling. I told a girl my situation and she left me on opened.

So I guess my question is, What do I do? Could a girl every be attracted to someone like me?"

lonely,Head full of noise,"Head full of noise - I thought I made it out into the calm. Things seemed to slow down and the weight had seemingly gotten lighter. I was able to do a few things I miss doing for a few short days, feel a little less choked by constant despair. It’s so hard to keep these days going when It’s so easy to get overwhelmed again. But I’m back sink into the noise. It surrounds you like a heavy dark fog. It’s not only hard to see through but even to move gives a feeling of lethargy. It’s not a new normal, it’s been like this the whole time. And when it goes it’s not even like a “light shines through”. It simply thins out before dropping back down. 
I wish I had something good to believe in. That I won’t become every stereotype of misery. I’m already leaning into it as hair falls and strength leaves me. Maybe it’s not just depression that’s getting me. But in some way to say, whether be time like all else, the fog in my head or something else I know something is withering me"
lonely,"Screens are company, and I hate it","Screens are company, and I hate it - Does anyone cope like this?  
Every meal I eat with a screen, because the alternative has become tiring and sad. My breaks, I grab my phone and reply to friends' ig stories, or see if they tweeted anything. And now I do that with strangers, get excited when people I sort of fangirl (my fave workout influencer or digital artist) reply and chat with me a bit. For fun, I watch something. To unwind, I watch something. 

But, when I was in my college town this time spaces during the day were filled with short talks, updates on their mood or life. Sometimes all the roomates had lunch together. I miss people. 

I dont find it hard to have friends to go out drinking or partying with. The thing is I miss having close people, people to do nothing with, to stay in with. To order pizza and laugh, play games and have warm drinks.

I'm scared of dating because I fear if I like someone they'll become the only person I'm close with, and I'll become codependent. I just don't feel ready for it. 

And on friday nights, like today, it all just comes rushing in.   


But then again, I'm writing all of this on a screen, hoping to interact with someone, instead of putting it on a journal. When I need a basic level of comfort, I come to a screen for aid. I used to have comfort movies, shows, podcasts, fatetime buddies, but I'm just so tired of it.   


I'm just so desperately lonely sometimes, and idk if it's just life's circumstances right now, or if there's something wrong with me.  


Anyways, whoever's reading, I send you a hug."

lonely,I haven’t been able to get over my ex.,"I haven’t been able to get over my ex. - It’s almost 3 years now that me and my ex broke up. We were together for 2 years. She was fucking my best friend and ultimately left me for him. I was in the middle of working towards greatness. I was going to college, working a full time, and had lost about 150 pounds when I found out that she was dating him. (We never properly broke up, she just stopped talking to me) At this current time I have sadly reverted my progress as a member of society. I have not been able to find that spark to help myself ever since me and her stopped talking. Any advice? For context I just stay home all day and I’ve tried hobbies friends anything to make me happy but it’s all just dull. I just want to get back on track but doing it alone seems to be far more difficult than I expected."
lonely,Writing posts to this group is almost therapeutic,"Writing posts to this group is almost therapeutic - It genuinely helps me consider/empathize with the positions of those around me when I start typing and realize there were factors I hadn’t considered. I don’t post those, since it’s enough for me to just see the details and feel a little better.

Granted I still feel isolated and alone all the time, but it can be nice to have other factors that help explain how people act… makes things feel less personal sometimes. It’s really easy to slip into that egotistical solipsism of every action being a personal slight against me for some reason, and while there are plenty of times I’ve been right/it didn’t help my mental/emotional health because the fact that *everyone* has problems doesn’t invalidate mine, but… yea.

I’m as isolated as a human can be without living in a light house or Antarctica. Sometimes I wish I was that isolated because then I wouldn’t see happy people around me all the time when I walk outside. My mind is going every day. I work from home alone I sleep alone I do everything alone. My dreams haunt me and they tell me I’m going to die soon. I feel like I’ve wasted my whole life. I have achieved nothing and I have nothing to show for myself. No one from my past ever reaches out to me. I know I should see a therapist but I’m so poor I can’t even afford whatever’s left after insurance.

Maybe we’d act in ways we can’t understand, but figure “I love you, so I’ll help you with it anyway.”  I want that kind of romance where it feels like you speak a new language together.

I don’t think that kind of love exists.  I think people will always use you, people always have an ulterior motive.  I don’t trust anyone, I’d never allow myself to get close enough with someone to fall in love.  Right now I live my life so small I remain invisible.  I don’t speak unless spoken to.  I don’t tell my coworkers anything about myself.  I don’t speak about my interests.  I come across so cold and detached.  I deleted my social media and the accounts I still have I remain anonymous.  I don’t want anyone to get to know me because I’m scared they’ll see the real me and hate it, and they’ll leave too.  But this life is so lonely.  I’m so lonely and tired.  I don’t want to be this way forever but I can’t imagine anyone, not even a good friend, caring about me enough to have that level of closeness.  I crave it, I’m so hungry for it.

We live in such a complicated world. Such a hard world to understand sometimes. Today I was wrongly accused. Because they chose to listen to others. 

Being misjudged can hurt deeply. I don’t know who else is going through the same thing right now. But I want you all to have a reminder that will hopefully bring you a comforting smile. I’ve experienced this once before. It was a true nightmare. 

This world can be cruel. But not everyone will misjudge you. When people choose to listen to other’s heads instead of their own hearts? It’s ok. Cease all fires. Release all anger. Because not everyone will have the ear to hear. It may not be easy to forgive. But I know that pain of being wrongly accused…does not last forever. Forgive them anyway. For they know not what they do. 🌺"

lonely,I made an app where you can hold hands with anyone who's available,"I made an app where you can hold hands with anyone who's available - *\[ reposting this due to mod approval \]*  
A few weeks ago, a close friend of mine was going through a difficult time. I really wished I could hold their hand as a way to comfort them, but they were miles away. It inspired me to make an app that lets you hold hands with anyone regardless of distance.

The way it works is pretty simple. You wrap your fingers around your phone as if you were holding hands with someone. When two people ""hold hands"" like this at the same time, they'll connect and their phones will vibrate until someone lets go. That's all there is. You can't chat with anyone, upload profile pics, anything. It's just about holding hands.

It's available for both Android and iOS, and it's free. Well, there is a paid upgrade if you want to reach out to someone specifically (it's really just to offset potential server costs and prevent abuse; if you really don't feel like paying, just DM me). But if you're just trying to reach out to *anyone at all,* there's no charge for that.

I realize that this isn't a great replacement for physical contact. I also understand that if not a ton of people are using the app, you may not make a connection.

But just maybe two people will hold hands for a while and feel a little less lonely. &lt;3

lonely,Trying to make myself into a robot so i wont feel as much...failing miserably,"Trying to make myself into a robot so i wont feel as much...failing miserably - Im mainly just venting here so bear with me...

I've posted about my current situation before under r/caregiver. But to make things short...I've been the primary caregiver for my mom who has stage 4 cancer for the last 4 years and its the loneliest existence I've ever experienced. Its such a full time job that i haven't had much time to dedicate to my dream career which now seems irrelevant and a waste of time anyways. 

 My sister has five kids under 7 yrs old. I help/primarily run her household every single day since she deals with depression and i do that while still caring for my mom. Im tired but im also incredibly lonely. 

 Today was her and her husbands anniversary (16 years!). I stood back and took care of the kids, made sure the house was perfect so they could celebrate together. I cooked a 3 course meal so it would be special for them and i just watched them be all lovey dovey to each other, read heartfelt cards and exchange cute gifts. It just made my loneliness feel even worse. I feel like my whole existence is me, having this out of body experience where im standing in the background making sure everyone elses lives run smoothly while mine is non existent and running away from me before my eyes. Im 25 and though i know that isnt old, I feel like my life has already been wasted. I've spent my 20s inside 4 walls, always running and always caring for someone and trying my best to dehumanize myself so that way this loneliness and the feeling of being totally irrelevant wont take me to a dark and depressing place. I've been to that place many times and I've learned to turn myself off. I try to fashion myself as some kind of protocol driod (yes i love star wars) i do everything for everyone but since i try to not be a human it shouldn't bother me when none of my efforts are ever reciprocated. But i feel myself slipping. Im allowing myself to feel human emotions such as loneliness and its making me feel sick. I feel so incredibly selfish even just writing all this. I should be able to do all these things for my family and not expect or desire anything in return."

lonely,The ramblings of a college freshman,"The ramblings of a college freshman - Since going to university, I have been a part of the marching band, the country swing dancing club, and the symphonic band. I have crossed paths with many people and made friends with a large amount of them. 

Due to the drastic increase in physical activity, combined with the weightlifting I have been doing with my cousin, I am shedding fat and building muscle, albeit slowly. I have also started growing a full beard so I actually look my age.

Compared to high school, I have a large legion of friends of many different majors, and surprisingly few enemies. I even went on a date, and though the chemistry wasn’t mutual, we remained friends. Overall, I am happier and healthier now than back in high school, and it has only been a few months. 

However, I still feel lonely, because at the end of my day, as I sit in my room contemplating life before I go to sleep, I realize that nobody has been there to say that everything is alright. Nobody has been there to be my canary, to watch over me and let me know if I am pushing myself too hard. My oxytocin’s been zilch for quite some time. 

I will continue to wake up, day in, day out, and pull myself where I want to go, as I always have. I have enough ambition, and enough capacity, but I will need to find a better long term solution eventually, because even if I can not see it now, I am going to hit a mental limit somewhere down the line, and I don’t want to be dead in the water when I do."
lonely,"So, uh, I’m lonely?","So, uh, I’m lonely? - Hi yeah I’ve not posted here before? Not used to meeting new people.

I used to get my kicks going to night clubs and just generally only talking to people when drunk (which, helloooo, I aaaaaam right now) but yeah. I’m trying to be an actual person now and especially being free of the 13yo thinking, I think I can make decisions regarding online behaviour a bit better now. So if you’d like a friend who’s online, and in the age range of 20-25, no matter who you are, let’s speak. See if we connect. I’ve been a bit of an outsider my whole life so please, if you feel that way about yourself, even more so, message me 😊"
lonely,Materialistic Things Aren't Enough To Fill The Void...,"Materialistic Things Aren't Enough To Fill The Void... - ...I overcomplicate things. It's basically my thing. I'm that guy in the friend group that says a little too much, but yet, doesn't have much to say of any value or substance *at all*. I've made myself the class clown in the lives of those around me since Elementary School. and if you were assuming those manic highs of comedic outbursts would be equally matched with manic lows of depression and low energy, you would be correct. 

Even walking the streets, I question myself everyday. Say a car almost hits me while crossing the road. Doesn't matter if it's my fault or not, I question my own perspective. I blame myself. I question existence. I wonder if I would be happy with my legacy if I died today. I wonder if I'm taking full advantage of life. My life feels hollow, filled with only materialistic objects, that I was told my whole life would fulfill me, yet ironically, instead just remind me everyday how meaningless it all ultimately is. My overthinking is a curse. I know everyone isn't like this. Some people are actually happy and I really wonder how they do it. Or maybe it's just how it seems on the outside, but I swear people have things figured out way better than I do.

I can have all the money in the world, but I find there's only so many things to buy. I can surround myself with all these interesting people, but I still feel alone... It feels almost like I don't connect on a real level with anyone. Sure, I can connect with someone, 1 on 1, to a degree. I feel as if we often act as projections of our own perceptions of what our personalities are, so it's not usually 100% genuine and from the heart, but I can usually relate to other people's struggles. 

But when we're in a group? forget about an intelligent conversation, because we're young, dumb, and supposed to be having fun 24/7 (I guess?). Instead of talking about deeper things, we're too busy trying to be tough and showing off. oh, and also, forgetting about our problems. I wish I connected with someone on a deeper level. But I guess I'm just an old soul trapped in a younger man's body. I don't think this materialistic world will ever make me happy but if I left society that would be an even lonelier and bleak reality, so I guess for now I'm just complacent."
lonely,AITA for reseting my friend circle?,"AITA for reseting my friend circle? - (20M)At this moment I have no friends( I just got off all my friends and I'm choosing new ones)  and I chose to do that myself because I just cut off all the toxic, negative people in my life without any explanation. I'm dumb for picking these people as my friends because they were either sociopaths, or friends that would degrade me and think so little of me. They made we question my existence and tried to manipulate me. They thought I was dumb. 

I had to move away from those people because they act like they walked a mile in my shoes.. they didn't match the mindset I had anyways. I even had a friend who I just cut off because he tried to fight me for no reason.  That's not what friends are for. 

AITA? I'm still looking for new friends through omegle and snapchat. But this covid 19 is making is hard to go out and actually interact.

lonely,I miss my friends/growing up. How to handle?,"I miss my friends/growing up. How to handle? - I (24F) never had many friends growing up. I had a few pretty superficial friendships, or friends that also shared my drug habits, but I had a pretty lonely childhood/adolescence. 
When I was 20, I was incredibly lonely because I was in a very abusive relationship and was getting pretty sober (ish) from 18-20. I had a friend from high school repeatedly try to reconnect with me, and I took the chance and did, and he and another guy became my 2 best friends in the entire world and helped me space my relationship and saved my life (literally).

From 20-24, I had a great time. Myself and my 2 best friends and my now ex were really close. I was never not hanging out with one of them. They were the most important parts of my life and I was so happy. My current fiancé came into the picture, but before that there were people in the group growing apart already—me getting into a relationship with my current SO was another wedge in the friend group. 

Now, we’re all 23-25, and I’m lonely yet again. My two best friends are off living their lives, working, in serious relationships just like myself, and trying to build their adult lives up. And that’s wonderful! I’m so proud of them and happy for them! But we don’t talk like we used to, and I rarely see them. I spend most of my time with my fiancé. I know this is part of growing up, but it’s hard to deal with. I miss them terribly. I feel like I have no friends now, or that I’m thrown away when I was once “the thread that held the friend group together”. It makes me depressed, and it makes me feel old. But I know this is a very natural thing to happen. How does one deal with this kind of thing? Coming to terms with really truly growing up and things not being the same?"

lonely,Accepting solitude,"Accepting solitude - Im sorry for the long post. In a week i will be 22 years old. I've been dreading this day for 2 months now since it's a reminder of how much of a failure i am. I've been doing a lot of self reflecting lately and i wanted to finally share my story somewhere.

I was born in a family of immigrants in a country in europe. I have 2 brothers and 1 sister but all of them are much older than me. I grew up in an area of a small town that is very much isolated from the rest of the city. 

I had no other children near my house and my family never gave me attention growing up. So from as long as i can remember my self, i was alone. Playing alone and being alone. My father wasn't present in my upbringing and i only had my mother. My sister was a very toxic individual, abusing my mother verbally and psychologically. She neglected her school work constantly only for her to be out with friends and drink constantly. My mother having little to no money kept supporting her, even though it was a wasted cause. My sister completely used my mother and didn't care for her. My 2 older brothers were already having their own lives and working etc. So growing up in this enviroment was rough. I was a good student and my mother kept saying to me how i was the only one who made her happy (since i was getting good grades and all). As a child, i saw how much sadness my sister gave to my mother by only focusing on her friends and clubbing and also seeing how happy i made my mother by being a good student, so i made the connection in my brain that i should only focus on studying and not on friends. How stupid i was. Even in middle school i would reject invitations from classmates to hangout, so i can make my mother happy. Fast forward to high school where i realised my mistake in the past but it was already too late. I was never invited to anything ever since everyone knew i would decline any invitation. Through ups and downs, fighting my social anxiety and depression, i managed to get to a university at the capital of my country. Having very little money i had to rent an apartment in a distant area from my uni. The first few days i had some hope that i could finally make friends but very quickly everything was shot down. Almost 90% of people attending at my uni were already from the city ( the capital). So most of them already had friends outside of uni and didn't much care about making new ones. Also the few people that i did manage to connect at first were living nearby each other. Every day while i was getting the bus alone to go home, i watched all my classmates get in a different bus all together, then hearing how great of a time they spent together the day after. Again i was completely alone. 

While having some motivation to at least get my degree and move on with my life at least, the university decided to completely reform and change pretty much everything about it. So suddenly i was stuck in a university trying to get a vague as fuck degree, 2 years worth of progress wasted and i had to restart again. Soon after that covid hit and i was completely isolated at my apartment doing nothing. Having absolutely no motivation to do anything, i became fat and i started failing my uni.

People will say im still young. Life will turn around, i just have to wait. I completely disagree. Im too old for my life to turn around now. Im brown Male in a country that is somewhat racist. I have no social media presence at all. I don't listen to music, I don't drink coffee, alcohol or smoke. I don't even go outside anymore. I have nothing in common with anyone anymore. Even if i meet people they will quickly find out that im a nobody. If that doesn't scream ""RED FLAG"" i don't know what is.

The few times where i've talked to people and had a conversation i've made them laugh, i was a good listener, i kept the conversation flowing, i helped them and tried to befriend them. But nothing ever works.

Everytime i think about my future i get even more depressed. I still have 2 more years of studying, then i have to go to the military ( It's mandatory to have 1 year of training in my country) and then i will have to find a place to live and work. I will be 25 at that point. Other people have already started their lives at my age now, but i have to endure all of this for much more.

All my life i thought i was miserable and unlucky to be in this situation, but i was wrong. Everything i've done in my life that brought me to this point of misery has been of my own free will. I was just too stupid. I don't want to live my life thinking ""oh i just didn't know better"". I was and still am too afraid to live. Always crawling back to my safe space of loneliness, thinking that one day everything will get better. Well now im pretty sure that it will never happen. I lost all my chances of living a normal life. I lost all my chances of making memories. I just have to accept that i will be alone for the rest of my life.

I haven't talked to anyone about my life. Even though i get to share a small part of it online and just knowing that even a single person read it, has brought me a little happiness. So thank you."

lonely,fluctuating moods,"fluctuating moods -  I don’t understand it. It keeps on repeating the same patterns. One day I am depressed and can’t do anything or have the desire to do anything and then the other day I want to do everything all at once and in a few days or hours I am back at the same old slump. It’s the fact that this keeps on repeating that makes me mad. It’s either I have to do everything or I can’t do anything. I don’t know when I will fall out of this cycle.

I truly appreciate my parents trying their best to support me in getting my mental health back in order and providing me with resources to fix me. But the thing is, with the sudden outpour of help and understanding I feel like everything I have felt in the past two years have dissipated, I’m not even sure if I was depressed. Every feeling of sorrow, desperation, hopelessness and worthlessness I felt seems like it never existed to begin with.

I still don’t feel happy. Honestly, I feel nothing but I am not sad. Yet it is frustrating when what you have felt disappears in an instant and now you come to question whether all this was a façade that you created. But it was so real. All the emotions feel distant now.

I don’t know how to explain how I’ve been feeling when the doctor asks. I haven’t met the doctor yet but I feel like when I would meet them I would be completely blank. Like everything I have felt was a lie.

Right now, I want to get out of my bed and do something. I have been creating playlists on how to photoshop pictures, sketching lessons, and various other things. The thing is I want to do it all now and the thought that if that's the case then I would never be completing anything is overburdening. It’s crippling sometimes to not understand why you just can’t start now, right now and let whatever the future holds be it. Everything seems at a hand’s reach but at the same unattainable."

I hardly hear from them or see them. No other family is there. I have one friend that I genuinely believe cares but i only hear from her once a month, and it will be one text message.

I have a boyfriend but I cant tell how important I am to him. I know he cares but we've almost been together 3 years and he seems scared to start a life with me and has almost broken up with me once when I was having a hard time. I had insomnia for months and had to quit my job. I had a lot of anxiety and was emotional. He also has only been with me and one other girl and felt like maybe he wanted to have more fun. But he also feared that since he's close to being 30 he might not find someone like me again.  He doesn't want to get a mortgage and a house together when i get my bachelor's degree this spring because he doesn't know if we'll be together a long time. So we're struggling to find rentals. Its hard to know if we're going to be important to each others lives. . . even now hes on discord with his friends playing games. Which I love him having friends but I'm just lonely and I don't know if I'm equally important to him. He calls me his best friend but he's so nervous about starting a future. Hes against marriage and I don't know if he'd ever be comfortable enough to get a house with me. 

How can I tell if I'm important to him? Are people just genuinely not important to each other. Will I never be important to someone?"

A few things contributed to this like isolation / working from home for some time now, breaking up with a close person recently, having almost no friends to hangout with.

lonely,Being replaced,"Being replaced - It hurts when your only friend is moving ahead without you. I tend to isolate myself when I fall into another depressive episode, and it is happening again right now. Meanwhile my friend thrives socially, they have made some new friends and go out a lot with them. I’m happy for them, but it also hurts. They rarely text first and if I start the conversation it ends up feeling stale and unnatural and I feel like I’m a bother since I can’t bring up to be fun and entertaining. We drift apart and I’m slowly being replaced. I know I’m not blameless in this, but I find it almost impossible to genuinely connect to someone right now. It feels so lonely."

I’ve had a best friend in the past but I don’t have any friends or family anymore ... it can get hard at times with holidays and big events when you’re face to face with other groups so suppose

lonely,The only initiator,"The only initiator - It sucks being the only one to initiate things. For reference, friends, family, etc. They never start anything.

Dinner? 

I figure it out or they bitch. 

Chores?

I get up first or they sit there on their phones staring at nothing. 

Hang out?

I text or call them first. 

Want to have a conversation?

I start it first. 

People will sit there for HOURS until I initiate whatever it is that needs to be done. And yes, I've been open about it and I must be showing a foreign language. I'm always the bad guy when I point out other people's lack of initiation/care for what needs to be done. 

I'm so lonely. Yeah, find better people- but it's not that easy.

lonely,Do I want friends?,"Do I want friends? - Hello, I am a 19 yo guy, and the last time I made friend(s) was when I was 14, we were friends for about two years but then moved to other cities and just stopped keeping in touch. Kinda glad, she was mean and not really on the same wavelength. But I started at a new school this august and I thought I wouldn't even try making friends since everyone is like 15-16 since they came straight from what we call high school in my country. But then this guy started talking to me and I've tried to make conversation with him and it's been mostly fine but sometimes I just have no idea what to say to him. He says something to me and I just do not know what to respond. It's normal stuff but I never learned how to talk with people, idk small talk, I always feel like what I say is the wrong thing. And usually my comments stop the conversation for some reason. My doctor thinks I might have autism so maybe that's why I just don't understand people and the normal way of talking to them. Or maybe I just never got to learn, I was very shy as a kid. I couldn't talk even if I wanted to, which I mostly didn't lol but the words just didn't come out, my mom thinks I had selective mutism. So now I'm just wondering if I actually want friends or if I just feel bad not responding to the guy when he talks to me, bc I would rather be quiet. But I get really lonely and sometimes I wish I had someone to hang out with and talk to. But I feel kinds weird about him bc I think he's 16, so lol he's pretty young and I don't know if I wanna be friends with a 16 yo. I don't think we have much in common w/e tbh. I hate being like this, I wish I could just talk to people normally, most ppl in my class didn't know eachother before and they've already made so many friends in just two months, I've barely talked to just that one person.. How the fuck do people make friends so quickly, even with the girl I was friends with at 14 had to wait like 3 months before I could be myself around her. Anyway, thanks for reading, maybe give some advice if you can? Or send me a message, I'm good at making friends online, it's a lot easier"

I was good at the job, and was moving up. By far the owner’s favorite employee. 

I’m also an alcoholic who’s been diagnosed with clinical depression for some time. After a failed suicide attempt I knew I had to get back on my combination of anti-depressants. If any of you know much about those meds, you under NO circumstances can drink with them. 

So I quit, for the betterment of my mental health. I haven’t received ONE text message from the people I considered my closest friend group. The people I spent 40 hours a week for two years around. And it hurts, damnit it hurts like a mutha. 

I’m moved back in with my Dad, and I’m in between jobs. I could go work at McDonald’s, or a private security company, but I’d rather not go back to a minimum wage job. I’ve been applying left and right but I guess two years of booze slinging isn’t a selling point to employers.

lonely,Does anyone else feel left behind?,"Does anyone else feel left behind? - I get jealous over the little things now, like seeing a group of friends hanging out at a park or people going to clubs and festivals on Instagram. I felt so upset at my sister's graduation because she had made all these new friends and memories and that's when i knew I had a problem. 

I've always felt different and insecure but the older I get the worse it feels because everyone else has moved on and is having fun with their lives, and I'm just sat at home on the weekends rewatching shows and drawing. 

How are you guys coping with being lonely and trying to find happiness by yourself?"
lonely,I have nothing now.,"I have nothing now. - Long story short I met a girl last year we dated then for some study related reasons had to move into long distance. I asked her multiple times if she'd be comfortable with that and she said that the only thing she wanted was to spend the ""rest of her life"" with me, ngl I did too. The starting two-three months went like a dream. We would text/call/arrange meets and we would do almost everything we needed to do to make it work. After a few months though she started to act estranged. She wouldnt pick up calls, she stopped sharing things with me like she used to. Whenever I decided to make plans she'd come up with dumb excuses, like one time I said lets watch a movie together and she said I dont have earphones while I could literally see it on her status she was listening to music (she never listened to music without headphones, Im embarassed I still remember these details about her). So I talked to a couple of my friends about this and they told me to just simply ask her what she felt about us at that point in time. She ignored the question but after a few days she confessed that her feelings for me were dying down and instead of talking to me about it she blocked me after that. I went to her house after a few days and she said she didnt want to talk to me anymore because it was awkward. The reason why I said I have nothing now is that I was dumb enough to invest all of my time into her. After my studies the only thing I did was give her time, talk to her or do something with her. I lost soo many opportunities to make friends with people because of her. I still have everything I had before her, I may have more or less but the thing is it doesnt matter anymore. The kind of grief this has left in me cannot be filled up by anything that I know of. It might be my fault for putting in all my effort into her but I cant do anything now other than be sad about it.."

I get really insecure even to the closest friends, I still feel like they just need someone to hang out with and not because they want to spend time specifically with me.

Nobody likes starting conversations with me, I gotta spark all the conversations in order to receive messages and replies. I don’t expect people to fantasize about me but they should give me a chance to be their ally. Just wish people actually considered me as a friend.

Back in middle/high school, there was this friend I had who understood and accepted me as I was - aspects of my nature I have been led to perceive as a burden to people I try to befriend (ADHD, introversion, anxiety, depression, sensitivity) were all things she understood and even related to. 

We had messaged each other back and forth until fairly recently, when I had decided to stop it; the talks of liking each other coming up every now and then, but it wouldn’t have been a healthy relationship.

Still, the idea of what she meant to me has manifested in my dreams recently - by idea, I mean her personality and likeness coming through in different bodies; it is an underlying desire of mine that who she was to me will come up in reality one day, but I feel like such a chance has passed since I am beyond high school now.

Thank you."

It still doesn't matter who I end up with, I just hope they will care for me. I know it's not time yet, but I'm aching for a kiss, for someone to give my pent up love to.

Travelling solo as ever, so prices for staying places are more expensive. But that's to be expected really. I'm fine for the first few days, but then you meet relatives who go on about how x person is doing and how the pandemic has done some small amount of good for them, and all I can think of is how shit I feel not living up to their example. And I don't have anyone to talk to about this trip. No one to share the pictures I've taken with. I thought I'd have someone but they broke whatever we had off a few weeks ago, so adding rejected to this feeling of loneliness and ineptitude.

But probably the worst thing about this week has been facing my suicidal thoughts and realising I'm too scared to go through it. It wasn't going to happen this week or even this year anyway, but it's annoying to know there isn't a way out. I've got this shit until I get old, get alzheimers or motor neurone disease, and become trapped in my own head even more than I already am.

Still got more days of this shit to go through. More relatives to see. More people to compare myself to and come up massively short.

lonely,I need to accept that I’m going to have a shitty college experience,"I need to accept that I’m going to have a shitty college experience - I went to my hometown college, and spent part of freshman year and all of last year at home during COVID. This year, I got an apartment to live away from my parents, essentially betting on myself to make friends, have girls over, do stuff on weekends, etc. And I tried my best. I tried my best to talk to new people, make new friends, put myself out there. Nothing major changed. People were friendly and talkative the first couple of weeks, then just turned cold. Some people were just cold from the beginning. Then, a couple of weeks ago, I suffered a major injury that won’t let me do things like intramurals, rock climbing, going parties, etc for at least a couple months. 

As I sat on my couch reflecting on a hectic first month, I realized that I had failed to be normal and make friends yet again, just like my first two years. There’s something wrong with me, I probably have Asperger’s disease, that’s what I have to conclude at this point. There is something about me that makes me extremely unattractive as a friend. 

I want to stop putting pressure on myself to have a good college experience, because all  of my knowledge tells me I’m incapable of doing so. I’ve already accepted paying rent for the apartment as a sunk cost. Are there any tips for accepting that I will have a shitty college experience and that I will have almost no friends going forward?"

But think of those YOU love/like and how they would react too: the girl you like, that guy at work whos nice but you dont talk to much. Think of them. I know suicide sounds like the best option but its not. Its really not. Its not the best to go with a permanent solution. Maybe tou can try something long term or short term like therapy or talking to people about it (like making a vent post on this sub). Think of your bucket list and all the things you havent done yet, you need to be alive to do those! The world would be so much different without you! If you haven't heard this in while, listen.

He’s going to go on just Fucking fine doing exactly what he wants. Fucking random people and not having any actually fucking responsibilities. I don’t know where to go from here."
lonely,My life isn’t gonna get better,"My life isn’t gonna get better - My life is slowly coming to ending

My girlfriend broke up with me a couple months ago, my friends are gradually hanging out with me less and less, I don’t see any of em anymore. School is draining and I’m not doing very well. I’m a 20 yo virgin with no confidence. I’ve had very few relationships and this was probably my last. I have to admit I’ve come a long way, I use to see myself as this ugly deformed creature and now I’m forced to believe I’m actually decently attractive, but none of that matters because I could never approach someone if I found them attractive or was looking to be more than friends with them, there’s just no way. I just feel like I have no friends left, no one to love and no one to love me or help me through this difficult time. I don’t want it to end this way, but I feel as if everything I’ve known, everything that made me happy is slowly fading away. And I feel like I will never obtain any of these things again, I will never be happy again. I will never have a friend group again and I will never meet anyone again. I see no path for me or my future. And I don’t see anything changing. Everything just gets worse."
lonely,My dreams are my escape from reality,"My dreams are my escape from reality - The end of the day is the best part for me because the moment I get to lay down and close my eyes, I imagine all these different kinds of scenarios and eventually find myself dreaming. My dreams are so much better than real life too I basically create my own world subconsciously. I’ll dream about my loved ones still being alive and talking to them or I’ll dream about family members and friends who no longer care about me anymore in the real world and reminiscent about the old friendships we had. I’ll even dream about someone have a crush on and imagine we are in love.  I can be anything in my dreams and that makes me not want to ever wake up. The moment I realize the few moments of bliss I was experiencing were a dream my whole day is already ruined and I look forward to the next time I get to sleep. It’s gotten to a point where some days I’ve been sleeping for 13 hours or more just so I won’t have to deal with my reality but to be fair why would I when I can imagine a world where everything is perfect? In the real world I have no friends , barely any family , no aspirations, and everyday I’m reminded about things that pain me to do. However, In my dream world I can be anything I want and have anything I want even if it’s not real."
lonely,I dreamt that I had a girlfriend last night,"I dreamt that I had a girlfriend last night - Last night I had a dream that I was at a party (which is a place you'd never see me at) and a girl (never met this girl before in my real life, except apparently our brains can't create new people so I guess I've seen her before), was crying about something, so I talked to her and she eventually leaned in, I thought at first for a kiss but she spread her arms and I hugged her, and we just hugged for a while. In my dream I knew she was my girlfriend. I remember I was talking to her while hugging her, and I got some of her hair in my mouth, which I thought was funny in my dream, but in real life I realized that I'm pretty sure it was just my own hair in my mouth. Then I woke up and none of it was real. Down bad hours :(

I also don't know why she was crying. I don't know why my brain created this specific scenario."

now that i’m older, i really can’t remember the last time i cried from hurting myself by accident or if something hurt me by surprise 

i only cry from emotions now. so far i’ve cried every night for the past few weeks over stupid things i overthink or wish that i had done or how alone i really am

not sure why i’m writing this, it’s just been something i’ve thought about a lot the past few nights i’ve been awake thinking to myself

i’m just really tired i guess"

So i've been trying to focus on myself like all the self help gurus say. I've been exercising, trying to lose weight, and engaging in hobbies I enjoy like creative writing. But I still feel so lonely and sad. I wish I had friends to hang out with and talk to. i wish someone who is kind and not out to use me found me attractive enough to approach and ask out. Being by myself all the time and seeing other people with friends, holding hands etc. still gets me really down. Especially at night I get really low and wish I had someone to talk to.

lonely,What kind of music does everyone like?,"What kind of music does everyone like? - Being lonely is the worst. I'm not very good at talking about myself. I've had issues with drugs in the past which has resulted in me moving away from friends. I've got some family, and I'm so grateful for that, but that's about it. No one else really. Anyway, I often find that distraction is a good short-term remedy. So, what kind of music are you all listening to? If you're not big on music, then what films you all watching? I've been listening to Radiohead a lot. For some reason sad music often tends to cheer me up. ""There, there"" is probably my favourite song at the mo. Awesome lyrics. Hope everyone is ok. Thanks."
lonely,Finding hope after years of disappointment,"Finding hope after years of disappointment - Ever since I could remember, I was always more or less of a loner. In early elementary school, I would try and talk to the other girls in my classes and hopefully make friends, because that's what my dad told me to do. Soon enough, however, I found that that advice didn't really work. I would always have to initiate conversations, I would always say ""hi"", I would always do everything. And yet, I never got anything in return. I was alone during lunch periods and was never really invited anywhere. I made a few friends in the fourth grade, but they all moved, and didn't bother trying to keep in contact with me. I wasn't even very close with those few friends that I managed to make. Apparently, according to my dad, I cried almost every night because of how lonely I felt.

The same story repeats itself throughout my life in middle school. In sixth grade, I made 4 friends. Four friends, who, for the first time ever, made me feel like I wasn't lonely. And so the crying stopped. For a little while, I felt pretty happy. *For a little while*. 

The next year, they weren't the same. We had all moved to the Jr/Sr high school, where we would be with *high schoolers*. They became snotty, and just plain cruel without even realizing it. They never changed, no matter how much I convinced myself that they would. They made me feel like shit. My friends, the people who I thought were my best friends, constantly made fun of me ""as a joke"" without even considering my feelings for a second. They don't even remember when I tell them about it to this day.

I only consider them my friends because I have no one else to go to. No one else to call ""my friend"". And, ever since I moved away from that town a year ago, my relationship with them drifted even further.

I remember two-three years ago, I had attended a field trip for band, to perform at a festival. I had no friends who did band, so I was all alone. The best part of it was really just playing/performing. It was really the only reason I went. We had a period of 3-4 hours to just enjoy the festival with our friends before the performance, but I had no friends, and I just felt embarrassed to walk around by myself, trying to navigate a giant building that I had never been in before. I sat on a bench pretending to be busy on my phone (because really, what can I do with no friends to text and no internet to watch shows), hoping that maybe, *just maybe*, someone nice would sit with me and, *I don't know*, talk to me. Acknowledge me. Accept me. For three hours, I waited. I saw people I knew look at me and just walk right past me. Of all the hundreds of people who were there, not a single one was interested in speaking to me. That hurt.

Now, at my new high school, I'm completely alone. I always heard stories about loners making friends in their junior/senior years of high school. I sit by myself at lunch, and I no longer sit longingly, hoping that someone would randomly start talking to me. I've pretty much accepted it. I've pretty much believed that I would be like this forever.

&amp;#x200B;

But, then, two days ago, my faded dream came true. Someone randomly came up to me, and genuinely wanted to get to know me, sat with me at lunch, and I had a fun conversation with this person. I was able to be myself for the first time in a while when I talked to this person, and it was pretty refreshing, since it seemed like this person like me for who I am, and not a personality that I try and force in order to seem more sociable. With my past experiences, though, I believed that it was a one-time thing; that, when that person realized I was boring, or not worthy of being their friend, they would leave me be, alone again. *Just like always*.

I was surprised to find out that this person came up to me the next day, asked me to exchange phone numbers, and we are apparently now going to sit together at lunch again on Monday.

I still believe that soon, this newfound friendship is just going to fade away like all the others, and I'll be all alone again. Maybe it's true, and maybe I'm being delusional. But I'll enjoy this while it lasts.

At the very least, this one day restored my hope that maybe I won't be lonely forever, and that someday, I might feel confident that I have people who love me for who I am, and that I don't need to change who I am to make friends.

&amp;#x200B;

To that person, thanks for making me feel like I'm okay. ~~(also I really hope you don't see this post hah)~~"
lonely,29F I absolutely have no personal life outside of work.,"29F I absolutely have no personal life outside of work. - Working keeps my mind busy. It doesn't help much that I work from home. Even so, I'm thankful I have a job to pay my living expenses. But does it pay me to live? As in, live a meaningful life? With friends, or a significant other? Live a purpose outside of work? Unfortunately not now.

When I'm done with an assignment, I resume my lonely life. I'll be hitting 30 next year and the thought of being on this Earth without ever having a love life of any sort sickens me. There have been many times I've cried myself to sleep. All the crying has mostly stopped, but I have not grown numb to loneliness. I painfully choose to tolerate it. I've decided to wait. Waiting is not gonna do it. I need to force myself in the market, but it's hard to do so alone. 

I needed to express my feelings. I'm glad I did online as I have no one to express them too. Thanks for reading."

This is for an AP English class, so I can’t exactly just not do it or cheese it, and I’m just stuck on what to do. I might just BS it, just to have something on the sheet, but if my teacher asks like who it was or whatever I won’t be able to say a thing. I might take a gamble and just not do it at all, this is just a small part of a larger project so she may not check it, but it’s too big a risk. I just have to figure out something. It truly does suck that I literally have no one to interview whatsoever, but I’m so used to it that my only concern is how I can just cover it up. But hey, it’s at least senior year, only one more year left of this."

lonely,Lol,Lol - Me and my “ girlfriend” have been going thru it lately . She wrongs me alot. I forgive her every time. She doesn’t cheat on me or nothing not to my knowledge. But I try so hard for our relationship. She doesn’t try at all. She broke up with me a couple weeks ago. I’ve been fighting for her back since then. Ik Ik stupid of me. But this is my first ever serious relationship. I’m a 10th grader btw. But lately she’s been getting more and more distant and dismissive with me. Like when we text shel text back with very short answers she doesn’t seem as excited as I am to see her everyday. I literally have no other friends. I stay to myself all day at school. Well I actually only have one friend . But I just met her.  We haven’t rlly made that much of a connection yet . Currently though we aren’t together but act like a couple . She said she was going to give me an answer a few days ago I still haven’t gotten the answer. She’s so quick to shut me out . I don’t get females. My mom tells me I should leave bc she’s using me. I don’t think she is. Maybe she is right. Idk . She was the 1st girl I ever cried over too. One day I took her phone and I seen a convo wit her and some dude from the summer time when I suspected that she was cheating on me bc in the summe she would not talk to me for days and all we had was over the phone communication  at the time . Ik she would be talking to other guys too she’s so friendly she talk to any and everybody but I love her I’m attached. I have so a big heart and she’s taking advantage of it . I literally only talk to her forrreal at school at lunch I sit with 2 people but I don’t rlly like talkin to em so I isolate myself mos of the time and be alone. I hate it though but I don’t like talking to them I think they know too lol . I walk alone in the halls every class i talk to nobody unless it’s my class with her i sit with my head down majority of the time bc I’m always stressing about this or feeling some type o way about it . She stresses me out so much in class sometimes my heart be beating so fast and my chest be hurting and I be wanting to cry.  People often catch me staring into the space and they jus look at me. MYea mom noticing it to I feel like I’m letting her down I feel like I’m letting my dad down too. Life just sucks Frl

lonely,Brain Dump,"Brain Dump - My mind is all over the place 24/7 so this is gonna be a trip that makes zero sense(also I'm sorry for my awful grammar/punctuation). I have had trouble feeling emotions and dictating what those emotions are for almost my whole life. I'm not sure what has changed recently but I have found myself feeling overwhelming amounts everything more frequently. Seemingly it's only the bad emotions, the one that hurt in my chest. I'm not sure I remember what it feels like to be happy, all that remains is some distant memory from a foolish child. For once it feels like my life has slowed down and i won't get thrown in jail or beat but that paranoia, I worry, will never leave. I was gonna write about trauma but i can't help but feel like I'm being weak, should i feel this way about things that happen to so many others? On a different note(again) I wish my mind wasn't so all over the place all the time, maybe if I could focus on something for longer than .5 seconds i would do something with my life. It seems like the only time i can sit back and reflect is when I'm high, which has helped me with my anger problem thankfully. I have so much to type but can't put anything in words, everything hurts? I feel clueless to my own well being almost like I'm working against it, it's so frustrating. Why does everyone i meet hang out with me once and leave, am i doing something wrong? I had two people i worked with previously hang out with me about a month or two back. That day seemed bad to me but they said they had fun, but I haven't heard from them since. I just wish someone on this forsaken world was honest to me. Can't forget that I'm ultra stubborn and shame myself the second i feel good about anything, don't know how to stop that. I've tried therapy to no avail, I don't want to talk to someone who only listen bc I pay them. The main point to all of it is that I'm lonely, I've had no friends who will listen since 2016. Even when i do find someone who listens they inevitably leave because I dump all of this and more on them constantly. The temporary satisfaction from typing this is really nice!

lonely,My mental health has instilled permanent apathy in me and I don’t think I can ever shake it.,"My mental health has instilled permanent apathy in me and I don’t think I can ever shake it. - It doesn’t matter if I’m in shape and have friends and family to talk to and hang out with, or how many “cool” hobbies I have. Something years ago stuck to me that is unshakeable, and it’s only gotten worse. I feel emotions deeply, but at the same they’re clouded as if I dissociate from them. Deep down I’m indifferent about most people in my life. Friends or people I date will fade and come and go. They will live their own lives. Something inhibits me from really feeling people’s energy and connecting with them. Most people over the years I have passed by and didn’t maintain connection with. I just find other people to spend very finite time with, and I don’t really care if I see them again. Regardless of any social circles I’m in I can’t help but feel terrible loneliness. I remember staying the night in the apartment of the last person I dated a couple years ago. I was in her bed and I remember feeling so sad. I stared at the ceiling in the dark while she slept. I wanted to stay the night to some extent, but when I actually happened all the pleasure dissipated. I just wanted to go home in the middle of the night and sulk alone under big blankets. Idk what the hell is wrong with me but it’s been like this for well over a decade. I feel nothing when people say nice things. I only reciprocate good deeds because it’s the right thing to do."
lonely,How do I stop the hate?,"How do I stop the hate? - Cry for help.

I, early 20s, have no one to talk to and when I don't want to just talk to someone because I'm afraid what I say will be used against me. I've been through so much therapy and even they can't/don't understand so it's starting to feel hopeless. 

I've done so much, probably more than anyone in my situation, I've joined groups, met people, held conversations, taken leadership, worked out, everything. 

But I have to keep reaching out. I have to keep taking in everyone's shit. If someone teases me about something I know I shouldn't get that mad which I don't but sometimes it pissed me off because I think they can never relate to the work I put into being a better me. If I don't reach out no one is there for me. The world ruined everything. I'm already brave enough to face what I never had growing up, and to solve it, and the *world* handed all the problems, plus all the negative results from the problems, and wanted me to handle it alone even after I reached out to help multiple times over again. 

I have to be the one who keeps reaching out, even after I tell them what's going on, they don't seem to be able to understand the magnitude of my feelings, how intense this is for me, the depth of the hurt. I didn't even know if I was hurt I just assumed I was if I felt so negatively. 

How do I stop being angry at so many things. How do I not just withdraw? It seems the only solution is to withdraw. Do people really not care? How do I not lose it after I've done so much."
lonely,I’m turning away everyone who cares about me,"I’m turning away everyone who cares about me - I just feel so fucking lonely, dude. I’m so socially exhausted.

I’m insecure about the people I hang out with so I’ve distanced myself from them because they are still happy and it was also making me feel better, but now I’m just quiet and I have no one to talk to. 

I’ve done it to myself but they were just so inconsiderate in general and I’m not only insecure of them but I also don’t really like or relate to them much anymore. Yet ditching them has just ruined my mood, I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to anymore.

Im getting less confident, my mood is suffering, I have no motivation to try in any form in any way at all anymore, I just live life on autopilot.

It doesn’t help that I’m sexually confused, I don’t know if I’m into trans women or non trans women and I’m afraid if I go with one I’ll feel insecure and it will be an easy dig to be picked on with, while the other might not be entirely what I’m into.

lonely,How To Meet Similar People? [27M USA],"How To Meet Similar People? [27M USA] - I (27m, USA) was in a relatively long (3 year) relationship that ended about a little over a year ago. Since then I’ve had a lot of trouble actually meeting anyone.

I know the standard advice is “meet someone through your hobbies” but all of my hobbies are solo activities or activities that are probably 95%+ men, and I’m very passionate about my interests without much time to take up anything new.

I think I’m at least moderately attractive, 6’0” (183cm), am very physically active in weight lifting, have a great career (own a biotech company), and have a good education (Ivy League). As a partner I always took care of my ex, and even though we are no longer together we still get along well since it was a mature breakup; so no baggage. I don’t smoke and I rarely, if ever, drink.

But for the life of me, I can’t meet anyone even remotely similar. I don’t get any matches via online dating (Bumble, Hinge, Tinder) and any likes I get are from people I have absolutely zero interest in. If I was getting matches but not dates or not second dates then I could chalk it up to a lack of connection or personality mismatch, but I’m not even getting to that step.

People always say to work on yourself first but I don’t know what else I can do and I’m
beginning to feel quite lonely since I’d really like to settle down and start a family in the next few years.

TL;DR - I have no luck actually meeting girls similar to me, and I don’t understand why."

lonely,True words,"True words - ""Youth is a lie, it's all but evil.
Those who look to rejoice in their youth,
deceive themselves and those around them.
Accepting and fold the circumstances that devour them.
In the face of the great and reverent word youth, they will twist any common interpretation or accepted notion out of recognition.
In their minds lies, secrets, sins and even failure are nothing more than the spice of youth.
If failure is truly the designated mark of one's youth,
then would it not be considered abnormal for one not  in his youth to still fail at befriending anyone. 
But I'm sure none them would admit to it being true.
They only define youth to their own benifit.""

lonely,I believe I for the first time am feeling somewhat starved for attention and social interaction,"I believe I for the first time am feeling somewhat starved for attention and social interaction - In my day-to-day life, I only talk with people online and a home support plus my therapist once a month. 

That was until recently, I've been interacting with other youths (am 24 years old) with similar issues such as myself and I feel like I wanted to interact more and do stuff but my mental health limit me. 

I suffer from severe anxiety and moderate depression so being outgoing is extremely uncomfortable and nearly impossible for me. So I spend my time at home, which I do enjoy. But at the same time, I wish I had people in my life or form any connection with someone. 

I lost my family and I have few friends who live far away so I feel incredibly alone. It wasn't been a problem from an emotional standpoint but recently life has become unbearable and that is often brought on by increasing cases of anxiety attacks and severe depressive episodes. And when you have no one, it's very hard to keep one's head above water. 

It's not helped by the fact that I have been sorta thinking about ""dangerous ideas"" recently as a testament to my extremely isolated life"

And whats annoying is that these people would often tell me that they will be here for me no matter what, but it turns out those words are just a bunch of bullshit and lies.

lonely,Feeling alone in times of change,"Feeling alone in times of change - Hey guys, just thought I'll write my recent thoughts down here. So although I am actually kinda extroverted and enjoy being with people my friend circle dispersed pretty hard since corona. It happened a few times before that friend circles kinda dispersed with everyone going their way and having new people while I always feel left alone. 

Right now I have some difficult times since I found out I hate my job and want to learn something new. I will look into 2 different professions in the next 2 weeks (so 2 internships). I'm kinda excited to see what it's like but I am also scared that if I don't like either of them I have no clue what to do. The only people I can share this with right now are my mom and a friend who is really inconsistent at answering messages or voice notes. 

Actually got an appointment and had my first session with a psychologist this week, but with the internships the next 2 weeks I will only meet her in 3 weeks again. Talking about such stuff felt pretty good and I am kinda sad that I won't be able to talk someone outside my little circle about this topic. 

Idk I just kinda wish I also had this group of people who you have consistent contact/meetups and can share such things. Right now I have to force myself to get outside my room so I don't feel completely miserable, but although I feel being outside is good for me its just not the same with always being alone. No matter if I take a walk, or ride my bycicle or whatever I just feel so isolated from the world while all I see outside are people being together. This really sucks right now."

lonely,Soulmates,"Soulmates - We spend our whole life searching for them. Isn't it what we're all looking for in life? A genuine connection? 

But most of the times, it's not something easy to find, so we take a step back and we give up, thinking all that ""made for each other"" and ""better half"" thing is just some unreacheable cinematic fantasy we foolishly believed. 

But, are we really meant to bear in this crushing solitude forever? 

I don't think so, at least not today. Today, for no reason at all, I want to believe soulmates do exist, just not always romantically. 

This person doesn't always have to be your ""significant other"", it could simply be a friend, parent, professor or anyone you've ever interacted with. I think it's possibly to come across with certain people in life with whom you will connect on an incredibly deep level, finding mutual understanding like never before.

I've never felt like that with anyone in my life though. But I hope someday I will get to experience the magic of a bond like that. And I hope you, lonely people out there, get to experience it as well."

I do not feel any emotions anymore. 

Not love/happiness/anger etc. Everything i used to love doing kinda sucks now. I have to pressure myself doing music/play games or do other hobbies.

lonely,Lonely and Low,"Lonely and Low - For context, my dad had a transferrable government job, so I kept getting shunted from city to city as a child. I didn't lay down roots anywhere. It doesn't help that I belong to a very linguistically diverse country. Neither does it help that I speak a rare dialect of a language, because language is one of the things that fosters community spirit where I live. I was also bullied in both physical and verbal ways and I lashed out in response or was destructive as a child. So I burnt more bridges than built them. I was never entirely friendless, though.

Then came college. I pretty much kept busy by immersing myself in extracurriculars. I also fooled around on dating sites. I was never deprived of contact with humans, but I didn't really make friends. Thankfully, I didn't make enemies either.

I worked for a couple of years after college, and I enjoyed the collegiality of my workplace. I also continued using dating apps. I was often lonely after work but could drown myself in the crowds and sights and sounds of the big bad city. 

Throughout college and those two years of work, I engaged in quite a few hookups, a fair bit of sexual activity. But I attracted jerks and weirdos like a magnet. As far as the few nice ones are concerned, either I didn't stick around or they didn't stick around. 

I went back to college after working for a bit to improve my prospects. Again, it was like work in that I enjoyed camaraderie with my classmates. I was also surrounded by interesting and driven people. But then COVID struck. Everything moved online. I went back to live with my parents in a completely unfamiliar city where I don't speak the language.

I just don't have the energy to even try and make friends or go out anymore. I don't leave home for days on end. It's just work or binging TV or chores for days on end. I'm just so low that it's interfering in my ability to work. I'm just drowning my sorrows in TV. I don't know why, but I'm crying as I type out this post."

I want these things but I find it so hard to get the motivation to do anything about it. I'm very introverted and really shy around girls I find attractive and I need to work on that. I'm not letting/making myself get better at it.

I know I'm really young and I have plenty of time to work on things I want to. I'm where I want to be as a person, but I'm not where I want to be financially. That's a whole nother can of worms though. 

I find that it's too easy to just sit at home and not do anything to better myself. I have all these wants and ideas for the future but I'm not acting on them. They're really more of wishes than goals and I need to change that.

lonely,what do you talk to people about,"what do you talk to people about - whenever i try to text someone it just ends up with me not being able to come up with something to talk about or respond with something more than ""okay, fine, lol"" etc. it's not that i can't talk at all because i managed to have online friends that i had both small talks and deep convos with but it doesnt seem i can do it again. trying to talk to people here has become very boring and predictable. it always ends up the same so i just lost all my motivation. can i change it somehow?
also im down to talk ig, but i cant really promise that our convo will last long."

lonely,"Wherever I go, I don't fit in","Wherever I go, I don't fit in - I don't belong anywhere. I try and try and try, but no one accepts me. ""If you would just lose weight, or wear makeup, or girly clothes, or smiled more, or stopped being depressed, I'd totally hang out with you"". I get it, I'm no good. I'm always going to be lonely, because I'm such a difficult person to be around with. I make everyone around me sad, and tbh I wouldn't be my friend either. 

But it still hurts. I know I'm the most kindest, most helping person you can find, someone you can trust 100&amp;, but no one is willing to put any effort in uncovering that version of me from under all the layers of protection I wrapped myself into. I have been betrayed and thrown away like trash by every single person I have ever met. I don't blame them, but it has caused me major trust issues. And since there are so many much easier and stable people out there, no one is willing to put in the effort to gain my trust.


Do I just accept my fate and die alone, with no one holding my hand in the end? 

I guess I have to."

lonely,I hate it,"I hate it - i don't have anyone to think about. my only good friend moved to another school. his friends think I'm weird. found out my crush has a boyfriend. I crashed my bike and now there's a gash on my cheek and my face will most likely be scarred. I can't talk. I eat through a straw. 
I'm so lost. 
my homework is piling up and I can't find any motivation to get it done. at all.
I'm coming towards the important end of school and it's declining at an alarming rate.
I hate everyone at my school. and my parents are on my ass about work constantly but I can't explain it to them without them saying it happens to everyone for a short period.

this shit is hard. I'm already trying so much but I'm neck deep in my own shit and I'm drowning.
it sucks so fucking much.

I cry myself to sleep each night about it.

goodnight"
lonely,My only friend is a kid,"My only friend is a kid - I’m 18 almost 19 and my best friend, or let’s just say only friend that consistently texts and calls and plays with me is an 8 year old. I’ve had a few friends my age, every single one has either ghosted, unfriended or blocked me. I ain’t even doing anything to make them they just one day decide I’m no longer worth keeping around even though I do nothing but spew adoration and care. So I’m left with some little kid who somehow shows me the affection no one else is right now by looking up to me."
