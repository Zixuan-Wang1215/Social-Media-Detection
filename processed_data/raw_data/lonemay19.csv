lonely,"Whatever I expect, I get less","Whatever I expect, I get less - So I want a family right? oh wait no thats not an option anymore  


Still a loving partner is- no just got used and abused  


I guess I can just have casual se- noooo far too risky, you wanna risk STDs or getting attacked?

&amp;#x200B;

Well I can be happy single person with hobbies and frie- wait no, my leg is injured now, can't drive, can't play sports and I can barely leave the house before getting exhausted on crutches.  


  
Just feeling lonely RN, like the walls are closing in on my life. the next thing that could go wrong is that my technology starts dying, and then I will be truly isolated."
lonely,"I have been in this subreddit for quite a while. Today, I say goodbye.","I have been in this subreddit for quite a while. Today, I say goodbye. - For years I felt lonely, and that I had no one. These feelings would come in waves and I'd spend long periods of time sad and depressed, on the verge of tears.
I began dating my girlfriend a few months ago and though she is an amazing person, I didn't want to leave this sub before I was 100% sure that I am not lonely anymore.

So today I say it: I am not lonely.

I don't say this to flaunt but to pass on a message. It's possible to leave this place. It is absolutely 100% possible and many times, all it takes is one person. I read the posts on this subreddit and sometimes I get very emotional doing so. But I know one thing: it is possible to not be lonely. Don't give up on it.

See you on the other side my friends. Thank you for the support when times were rough.

lonely,"How to cope with that sad, empty feeling in your chest when you wake up?","How to cope with that sad, empty feeling in your chest when you wake up? - My boyfriend and I broke up last week and while I'm not sobbing constantly now, I still wake up and feel utterly alone like I used to before I met him. I look at my phone and realize there are no more good morning text messages, and it makes me sad. I'm copping better through out the day as I try to keep busy with things I need to do and hobbies, but that feeling when I wake up is still there, and I desire to be in his arms again. One thing that haunts me was the first night he told me he loved me where we were laying in bed together after a lovely date. We were holding each other and I said ""it would be wonderful to end and start everyday just like this"", and he told me that he would love for that, too, and that he would definitely never get out of bed and would always be late for work if that were the case! Then I told him I loved being with him, then he said he loved being with me, and a few seconds later, that's when he said it - ""I love you"". No one ever told me those words and I melted. I dreamed of cuddling in bed with someone like this and for someone to show me love, and it was happening. Now he's gone and I feel like I'm going through withdrawls at some point. My body craves his touch like crazy and I wish we were holding each other again. 

So, how does one cope with that empty, sad feeling in your chest when you wake up? That itself makes it difficult to get out of bed sometimes. 

I wonder if he misses me at all. Breakup was very mature but teary eyed from us both. Complicated situation where he isn't where he wants to be in his life, so that's why we parted. I didn't want it to end but he didn't see how he could sustain his part in the relationship with doing what he needed to do."
lonely,"Titles are hard, I really just feel alone.","Titles are hard, I really just feel alone. - Hello random void of people. I'm sure someone is out there right? This will probably have some random rambling but I just need to get it out of my system. I'm 25 and I really don't know how to make friends anymore. I have one friend who I talk to on a regular-ish basis, and I have my husband. I used to really like interacting and making new friends (at least online), there is some really great people in this world. I feel like all ties to those people have been long cut and there is no remaking a tie to those people though. 

I really wish I could hold onto a friendship, have a group like I once did but I feel like i'm becoming too old. People my age have their group, they have their ties and thats that. The last group who really accepted me and I really loved those people, I stopped talking to them because I couldn't be in my abusive house anymore, so all my time was spent out working, or just napping in my car. We lost touch for months while I saved up and moved out. I tried to mend fences and rejoin the group but by then it felt like everyone ""moved on."" I understand life happens and people move on, I still am sad that I could not spend more time with them. 

Since then though I got married last year, I have moved across the country and been adjusting to a new life. I've lost 40lbs since new year and i'm trying to improve myself, I'm trying to better myself so I can be healthy and happy. A new place, a new me, same old mental health. I've been depressed for longer than I remember, I've developed insanely bad anxiety, and I also might have bi-polar disorder. I never really let out my feelings to anyone. I try to stay positive. I try to find people to play video games with on a weekly basis but none ever stick. I will keep trying but I am losing hope. At least I have my husband and his family and my friend, I know a lot of people are less lucky than me. I am appreciative to my life that I have and I hate to sound like i'm complaining but there it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

If by any chance you like video games, D&amp;D, or just need to talk you can message me."
lonely,I just want someone to hold me and tell me things will be okay even if it's just for one night.,I just want someone to hold me and tell me things will be okay even if it's just for one night. - I just want someone to hold me and watch a movie or tv with me or something. Maybe go to the park and look at the sky or just cuddle in bed and listen to music or something. Play with my hair hug me tight and softly kiss me and tell me things will be better. Even if it's just for a night and just want someone to tell me that they love even if it's fake. I don't know.
lonely,"My(M24) wife( F23) packed up, took our dog and left because I wont stop smoking weed.","My(M24) wife( F23) packed up, took our dog and left because I wont stop smoking weed. - I've been smoking since I was 18. I started after I had a suicidal episode and found out I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Weed has helped focus calm myself down and feel incontrol over myself.  I usually smoke about a bowl and a half a day. Less than a gram for sure. She used to be ok with it, and smoke with me when we wer younger  untill recently she started reading her bible again and gave me the ultimatum of weed or her.
 I explained to her I would try my best and I stopped for a week. But during that week i had major mood swings. Suicidal thoughts. Anxiety and I hated myself to the point where I just didn't want to live anymore. I then found some kief in an old jar took one hit and felt balanced after that.   
I explained to her that if I have to quit then I need medication to help me with my thoughts. She agreed but said I still couldn't smoke. I told her I would do my best to stop. I wouldn't buy anymore weed but if I got it for free by working or doing it on the side I could compromise. She stil said no. 
Yesterday I went to help out my neighbor who I work with.  
He has his own company  cannabis catered  events all over Los Angeles and everyone there smokes. I get a call from her saying she's leaving and taking our car and our dog. I told her not to and we'll talk about it when i get home. I get home around midnight and the car is gone &amp; so is our dog, along with her clothes.  I've called her all day today and she hasn't answered me and her mom hasn't answered me either. 
I'm not a bad person. I don't drink, I stay home, I pray, cook, and clean.  I make sure all he needs are met before mine, but when it comes to this I feel like I have to stand my ground for my own self control or at least untill I can get the right medication for myself. Am I wrong? Am I picking a drug over my family?  I'm left in this house feeling empty without my family here. I just want them back."

lonely,That about sums it up.,"That about sums it up. - Some friends asked me the other day if I get lonely. I'm still not sure if they were being genuine or just stirring me to get a reaction.

lonely,My aspie husband doesn’t even know how much he makes me feel alone.,"My aspie husband doesn’t even know how much he makes me feel alone. - My husbands on the spectrum and it is a whole mother work of being alone when your married to an aspie. Empathy does not come naturally, he loves me but can’t meet basic needs that I’ve spent hours bluntly telling him I need. The loneliest thing about it is when people don’t see it. It’s sooooo different at the end of the night. When all the people go home and you live together. No body sees the real internalized pain I’m in. I am stuck, lonely and devastated. No one sees or feels what this feels like at its worst you cant breathe and you can’t talk about it with anyone. Because either it’s just being newly weds or he’s a monster that so bad but they still don’t understand. They just try to sympathize... it’s just a broken record of my not being able to get through to the one person I love more then anything that I would do anything for and sometimes it’s like I’m talking to a computer that doesn’t care about me or anything I saw if I can’t reason it out. I need a PhD to logically explain simple concepts so he might do things that would make me happy."
lonely,The only people that even remotely care about me are all 600 miles away,"The only people that even remotely care about me are all 600 miles away - I moved to a new city/state almost 4 months ago now and I regret it. I love the city and the state as a whole, but due to some last minute issues, I work +60 hours a week just to scrape by. I've had 12 days off in the past 4 months and I don't have the time or money to even attempt to have a social life and meet people or really do anything. I had so many plans to break out of my rut back where I came from, but everything has just been amplified and gotten worse. I have no friends out here and no outlet to meet anyone. I'm tired, I'm physically and mentally burned out, but I have to work my life away to keep my head above water, and no one could care less. I come home every night to my two cats, and they're really all I have here. I was so excited for this move and to get my life on track, but now everything has gone wrong and I have no friends or family or any real support system to help me. Sorry for the rant, but I have no one to talk to and I feel like even if I did, no one would actually care."
lonely,"Due to my painful habits, I lost another friend.","Due to my painful habits, I lost another friend. - I'm not going to get depth into what happened, I just need to vent this out because my mind is racing a bit and I've been crying for the last few days after work because of it.

I hurt this person, I like this person and cared about them but continued to hurt this person? What I don't understand is why do I continue hurting people which makes them leave. No matter how apologetic I am, nobody stays and then its back to square one wondering that I can have a stable life where I haven't been super depressed for a few months but I can't have a stable relationship with people. Literally everyone who has met me, they end up getting hurt by me. Before you ask, I have seen professionals about it  (4 different ones) but they don't help but asked me about other questions that are so off topic? ""hOWS YouR SLEep?"" So I'm stuck continuing to trying to figure things out. I'm considering about isolating myself from any kind of relationships except my family. I'm tired of having to take care of my feelings when these things happen, it's just exhausting and at times, I'm not sure what to do. 

I know in time, I will move forward and I will heal but with thinking about my habits how it hurts people, years passed and I still let it slip. I've been in these situations so many times with people but I haven't learned or figured it out. I thought as time pass, trying what I can do to cope with my mental health, I thought I would be okay to have a stable relationship with anyone. 

I wish I could take all the pain away from everyone who I hurt in the past, I've carried this guilt for too long that I can't figure it out, it just continues to poison people who wants to get close with me. 

**To everyone I hurt:** I'll always be sorry for everything that happened between us. I still think about you all at times, I'll sometimes look at your profiles to see how you're doing without me and I hope that it's happier without me. At times, I want to message you and ask how are things but I know it's not my place anymore to do that. For everything that has happened, I hope I learned something from it where I can try to reverse those ugly habits when someone new comes into my life. 

That's all I needed to say."

lonely,I just want a hug,"I just want a hug - I’m so lonely I haven’t had a friend in years. I have selective mutism and can’t talk to anyone because of it. I’ve never seen someone as lonely as I am.

I started homeschool this year cause I kept having panic attacks every night and morning. That has only left me more isolated but I can’t step a foot in that school without shaking. 

I “connect” with celebrities for a false sense of friendship.  I watch a lot of movies and tv shows, that kinda stuff. It almost feels like I know these people. Like I have a celebrity crush and shit cause I don’t see enough people irl.

I’m feeling especially lonely tonight and I don’t know why."
lonely,Being lonely even when you aren't alone,"Being lonely even when you aren't alone - I'm a 30-something woman who is very fortunate in many respects. I have been married for eight years; I live near my mother and siblings, whom I am close to; I have several close friends, some who have been around since before I was a teenager... and yet, I am sometimes incredibly lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle with things that are difficult or uncomfortable to talk about. For example, my husband has depression and anxiety, and when he is having a hard time, it's hard for me to know who I can talk to/be open with. When I feel upset, I don't know where to turn, and I often wind up internalizing my thoughts and feelings, ultimately leading to feeling very alone. It used to be that I had my grandmother. Our relationship was rocky in some respects, but another thing that it was was brutally honest. I knew I could tell her almost anything, and she'd be a sounding board. But, when she passed away two years ago, that openness and honesty void way never filled by anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Another outlet I feel I no longer have is creating relationships and interacting with people online-only, often anonymously. When I was a teenager, I dabbled quite a bit in talking with random internet people. The physical disconnect made honesty and openness easier, and I got quite a lot out of those relationships. However, as I've become older, my online life has increasingly been tied to the real me/my identity (thanks a lot, social media), which has stripped the internet of many of its anonymous qualities for me. That's why I'm here tonight, on a throwaway account, just typing my thoughts. I'm not looking for a solution, I just want to type what's in my brain and put it out there, which I'm hoping will allow me to feel less alone."
lonely,School photos..,"School photos.. - When i was in middle school they used to take a photo of some classrooms to hang on a board in the school entrance, i was the only one sitting alone in a 3 to 4 seater desk in the very middle of the room my face was glued to some book in an attempt of hiding myself, well I definitely stood out, i still remember how i felt that day it was embarrassing seeing the photo the next day when i got to school

lonely,Everyday it took me more effort to get up from bed.,"Everyday it took me more effort to get up from bed. - Every day it's harder, I don't feel any reason to get up, I just want to stay there and do nothing. Now I'm always late for work, which is not a problem because they pay for hour worked, but I don't want to come at the office at 10 when everyone is there at 8, I like that work, and the people in it, they are really kind, but everyday I'm late, I disappoint them. I know that I'm not getting fired or something because of it, but I feel like my coworkers are being a little bit distant of me, like they are slowly getting away, I don't know what to do with this feelings."

Seeing the physical embodiment of someone you genuinely respect and engaging in a conversation with them just makes me feel like human again. And when I see that they give me eye contact and they smile just...it feels like ecstasy. I’m not even talking about love, I’m talking about just being friends with someone and having sincere human interaction. You can have these same feeling for someone you love too but for me, all I know is friendships and I have forgotten what it feels like to have friends for not having genuine ones in a long time.

I dont feel hatred towards anybody because of how alone I am. Iv always felt that I was born wrong. My dad cheated on my mom and left. So shes the only peson i can go to in real life.

Iv went on dates with a lot of really nice girls. They will make some guy happy one day for sure. It just really hurts me because things do a complete 180 when i tell them.

I only tell a girl I have it because i want a relationship with her. But i dont think anyone wants a lonely autistic guy as a partner. A girl did tell me that she didnt want to tel her friends her boyfriend is autistic. That made me really upset

Making friends is hard for me too. I was the weird kid so i never really had friends growing up. I wad more just the kid they kept around so they had someone to make fun of.

lonely,Tired of never being good enough and not measuring up - 28/m,"Tired of never being good enough and not measuring up - 28/m -  

Not really sure where to begin... I'm just tired of doing this all the time. I'm tired of not measuring up, not being good enough, the way that I look, not really any friends, no romantic options (even when not depressed), etc.

I basically go to a bs job, come home, then either try to workout or wonder, why bother, and watch tv/movies until I go to sleep. I've had issues with my boss. Super nice to my face, jokes around with me and so on (thinking he was a nice guy) but found out he has been secretly trying to get me fired. This makes me even more reclusive/isolated at work.

I don't really fit in anywhere. I always am the outsider, looking in. Socially awkward and weird. I have no real friends to spend any time with and women in general really want nothing to do with me, even at my best. After years of being alone I've developed a complex. I hate the way that I look and the problems with my body. I have bad stretch marks from working out and from being previously a bit overweight, I'm losing my hair..., my face sucks, I have white sun spots all over my arms/shoulders/back, teeth aren't great, I'm 5'7, etc... I don't really blame women for not having ever been attracted to me lol.

I've tried online dating extensively in the past but it never worked out. Not really any wonder why... women have so much choice when it comes to dating, especially online. They can easily find 100 better potential suitors in just a few minutes.

I've tried a psychologist but I feel like it's just a waste of time. I went 3 times and couldn't afford to waste any more money. Whatever he said could be found on a basic google search, very generic advice.

I'm just very tired of it all and just want a way out. If I could just press a button to have never existed or to not wake up the following day, I'd press it right now. It wouldn't really matter much to anyone other than my mom. And while that's nice that she cares, it just isn't enough."
lonely,I'm done with lesbian loneliness.,"I'm done with lesbian loneliness. - Don't come here with ""you'll find someone"" bullshit. I know I won't. 

I have never had a girlfriend, nor will I ever. When you're a lesbian your dating pool is horrendously small filled with the same types of women. Other lesbians say the same thing, how hard lesbian dating is so this isn't just me before you start throwing accusations. 

It's always butch women, or unattractive women. I have never seen a good looking lesbian who looks like a normal heterosexual woman. You're literally not even allowed to have any baggage or struggle with anything when you're a lesbian or else it's a red flag. You have to be perfect or else you're done. If you don't make being gay your personality then you're a self hating gay yadda yadda. Sorry I want to keep my sexuality private and not wear gay pride pins on every item of clothing I have and dye my hair rainbow. 

I don't want to be 30 and single. I don't want to be in the 20's with no dating experience. I'm so tired of being lonely, and I just know it I'll never find someone and get married ect. I'm fucked. I don't want to live life like this. No one gets how it's like to be forever alone when they have boyfriends/girlfriends and date and love. Some people don't get any of that and it sure as hell is a fucking good reason to kill yourself, when you don't even get to have basic human love. 

No one has ever tried to prove me wrong, they all agree with me. The odds are not in my favor so theres very slim chance of me finding someone. Literally my best friend told me he agrees with me. With his perfect heterosexual life and girlfriend. 

I will never get to experience being loved like that. I will never relate to being able to have a best friend that you fuck. And spoil. And trust. Little things like coming home from a event and fucking and cuddling.

I wish I could believe that it gets better. But it doesn't. All lesbians complain about it being lonely. 

Fuck this shit I'm out."

lonely,Got kicked into the friend zone.,"Got kicked into the friend zone. - I’ve been seeing my fwb for about a year now, things have been great. I really enjoyed the relationship and we seemed to have a lot of fun. Fast forward to last week when he abruptly starts canceling plans and making up lame excuses. “Oh, I forgot my sister hamster is in town and we have dinner plans”
I knew what was happening and sure enough the abrupt change of plans lead to him blocking me on social media and giving me no explanation.

Above losing my person who I got physical comfort from, I also abruptly lost my best friend. 
He did eventually talk with me and told me his feeling for me changed and he met someone else with a better connection and would like to demote me to his FRIEND while she takes over as #1 fwb.
He tells me he needs to work on our friendship and he wants to take Alex out of the equation-
I’m a big girl, I can handle a breakup

I’m just so lonely in this town- I can make more friends, sure. But to lose him so quickly and to know someone else is there is painful. I hate feeling this way, I wish I could hold my head high and be ok with being alone and lonely- but I’m not. 
I can “text” him and I can come over- but what good is a cake without frosting?? 

I don’t know why my mind is so messed up over him, I’ve had plenty of fwb and never had feeling this strong and I absolutely hate it. 

It sucks because I know I need to stay away- but choosing loneliness.... it’s depressing."
lonely,Wish I could go back to High school,"Wish I could go back to High school - I'm a 20 year old male, about to turn 21 and ever since I left high school, my life has been nothing but lonely. I opted to go to community college after HS and that's where I feel things took a dark turn. I lost all of my HS friends and the people I meet at the community college are nothing but acquaintances, not real friends. On top of that, I find it so hard to talk to girls because I feel like no girl would be interested in what I have to offer. I remember being in high school and my phone wouldn't stop with messages and now the only messages I get are reminders to pay my bills. I remember being confident and flirting with any cute girl but now I can't even look them in the eye. I still live with my parents and I feel if things don't change, I will end up living with them forever. Not sure what's wrong with me, but I hope I can figure this out."
lonely,"The more lonely, the smarter you are","The more lonely, the smarter you are - It's true. And the smarter you are, the more messed up your brain is, due to loneliness (cause loneliness basically destroys your brain, humans are social creatures), but it can also mean other things too: wealth, a better life later, etc. Yes, only about 2% of being rich is about intelligence and luck, and 98% is hard work, but still, generally, the smarter the person, usually the happier and the wealthier. If that isn't you, then think about your day or such, see if you're smart or not. Self-analyze yourself. Compare yourself to others. Most likely, you'll do smart things that normal people wouldn't do. If you aren't smart, then know that loneliness is something very common. 33% of adults are lonely. 10% of teens are socially isolated. A lesser percentage have chronic loneliness. So, it can't be that bad. Besides, most of us on this subreddit are lonely anyways, so we all share that."
lonely,Chat for the night?,"Chat for the night? - Let’s talk about why we’re feeling lonely and console each other. Listening to sad music is not helping much right now.

lonely,I'm in constant pain,"I'm in constant pain - I hate this constant feeling of being alone. My phone remains silent every day aside from a college group chat that I'm a part of that I really don't fit in with. Nobody really ever mentions me nor am I noticed when I reply in chat. I could leave the chat at any moment and nobody would bat an eye. I'm forgettable and I hate the feeling that I can be easily replaced because I'm a disposable friend. 

And even though I have a sub-group of friends from the same college group that I'm closer with (2 others), I never really feel like I'm wanted there either. Whenever we would hang out I would always just feel like a third wheel. They would have conversations with each other and every time I would try to jump in I would just be immediately cut off. I would be ridiculed for small things such as my depression and suicidal thoughts and while I like to think it was all in a joking manner, it still hurts to have something so serious to me and damaging to my mental health be used as a tool to belittle me.

Because I moved so much growing up, I never really had the chance to develop meaningful relationships, only being able to make a couple of friends but none that really needed me as I needed them. They all had their own friend groups and much more important relationships. All I ever had and ever will have are my stupid games and anime that I'm growing sick and tired of with each passing day. 

I don't even know what the point of this post is because I know that it won't solve anything but I really have nowhere else to go. I just don't want to be lonely anymore. I want friends so badly. I don't enjoy talking to myself or distracting myself with games that I've played a hundred times over. I'm just tired of this stupid life I have."

But it also comes with the pain that it's false hope, the fear that they will reject me too. Paranoia that I did something already to turn them off.

It's so so hard to find someone to be close to.

lonely,I wish I had a little brother,"I wish I had a little brother - I am the youngest out of 6 children. All three of my brothers are really close in age. My two sisters are also close in age. One sister is about 4 years older than me.

This sucks. I'm treated like a little kid because they're so much older. I'm already 16. It's not normal to banter or even curse among my siblings. Well it is for the rest of them, but not for me. I'm always left out of adult events, too.

I wish I had a little brother. Someone who I went to school with so I always had a guaranteed friend at the beginning of the year. Someone who I could do dumb shit with. Someone who I could help with homework and someone who could help me with homework. Someone who I could share what's going on in my head with. Someone who I could stay up late at night with playing video games. Someone who could help me in arguments. Someone who could always have my back. Someone who I could be myself in front of. Someone who I could share music with. Someone who could help me write. Someone who I can understand and someone who understands my situation.

I wish my parents just stopped at 5 kids. Why even have me? Fuck... even the doctors said that I should've been aborted because of abnormalities. But they kept me anyway. People aren't meant to be alone like this. I can only imagine how bad it is for only children.

And yes I am perfectly normal, there are no body abnormalities or mental disabilities. I'm a little stupid, but I'm not disabled."

lonely,I apologize for last night's post.,"I apologize for last night's post. - So, theres this girl I used to talk to online. I used to really be into her and she knew it, we cut contact because the long-distance relationship wasn't working out. Last week however I contacted her again, and asked if we could talk again as casual friends. She said yes, and I was really happy to talk to her again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed that every conversation we had, she'd interrupt the flow to mention her ""new boyfriend"". The first time I thought, ""Wow thats great, she's actually doing good in life"". After a couple times however it was becoming irruitating, it felt as if she was trying to keep me away, like she didn't trust me. I really wanted to be friends so it insulted me. I did my best to ignore it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday however I fucked up a job offer and it made me sad. I came to her for support, saying ""Fucked up the greatest job opportunity I've ever had. Oh well, I've got some vodka so its ok."". Then I had my first shot. After two hours she replied to me saying, ""Good news, I'm not pregnant, I got scared"". Then she rambled about why sex without protection scares her, completely ignoring my plead for help. I replied with ""You know I don't care about your sex life, right?"". And she replied ""I know :)"" with the smile and all. Then she continued talking about protection and blah blah blah so I told her to fuck off. She was typing something and then I blocked her, sick of her shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my drunk ass made a post here laughing at her. Its too late to tell her sorry, and I'm not sure either of us want to keep in contact after this anyway. I'm sorry for making you guys here angry with useless negativity..."

I'll stare where there's no one so I they don't think I'm staring at them. In reality they probably wonder what the fuck is wrong with me. A whole fucking lot is wrong with me. Not that anyone would ever ask. They don't fucking care about random colleagues, they've got friends outside of university. But then again, everyone but me socializing and havin fun while I don't where to fucking look at. How do they know what to say? Why is everything I say so wrong? I hate myself. 

Please. I'm trying to change. It doesn't work. I thought I was getting better, but I'm not. I still can't talk to people normally. Except for 3 people on this planet, two of them being my parents (who just broke up, yay). Please kill me. I can't do it myself. I can't do anything myself. I'm basically a child. I'm not growing up. I feel like I need someone else to be there all the time. And I'm all alone in this new town. So I can study my dream program. Which is just o.k. actually. But what then? Getting a real job? Really taking care of my own life, taking the reins? Who am I kidding. I'm unable to live. I'm a wreck. My body is broken. And it's breaking more everyday. Who would want be intimate with this wreck? Just fucking end me

I don't care about anything else. I need one person. Just one. One who waits for me. The one i've been waiting for my whole life. Someone i can wake up next to. So I can know all this shit is worth it. Someone who'll take care of me. And hopefully there are things I can give too. If there's anything I can give. I wanna give it. What else for? There's nothing more important, everybody knows that. But who would want to share this togetherness with me, of all people? I'm a wreck, I can't do anything right. I guess there's some things i can kind of do right, gotta be honest with myself. But is it enough? This life is too hard. I'm not strong enough. I'm weak. I shouldn't be 24. I should've died to an aneurysm or in a car crash many years ago.

Wow if anyone actually reads this, please say hi. I don't think anyone will. I kinda did this for myself anyway. Had put some things out there. Doesn't feel right when I try to write something down on paper, just for myself. I've cheated my self into thinking anyone would care, so I could just rant. I don't think I've ever written anything this long without any kind of filter. I'm done now. Whatever."

So I noticed that a *lot* of people asked me to remove instagram and to not follow the peer pressure. And that's what I did :) I no longer have an Instagram account and I'm happy.

But I still haven't decided on what to do during the summer. As I previously said, I mostly spend my days home because my friends (which aren't many) don't want to do stuff with me. They either stay indoors all day and are to lazy to go outside or they usually aren't interested in the same stuff as I am. And I don't enjoy doing stuff outside by myself. It's hard to be alone outside while seeying everyone else your age accompanied by their group of friends. I'm really grateful that I at least got some friends, but they aren't what I really wanted. Besides, I feel like if I stopped talking to them they would't even care or notice.

I know that some people recommended me to do stuff outside alone anyways but I don't know... What would you do? I'm afraid that I'll spend the whole summer alone. My parents and other family members are working.

Sometimes I wish I found a girl or some friend that just wanted to stay with me all day and do all sorts of stuff outside.."

We hangout all the time after work or classes, often going out to eat dinner together, watch movies, play games and travel. But the problem is we're both finishing up our degrees next week, and at the end of July he'll be flying back to his home country. He says he will most likely come back to either seek work or further his studies, but it won't be until late February next year. That means I face 7 months without my only IRL friend. Towards the end of last year he went back home for 3 months and that was honestly quite tough, but at the very least I was busy with a new job and a Summer semester at uni. 

I'm dreading the day he leaves, because I struggled for 3 months on my own, and now I have 2 and a half times as long, and what if he doesn't come back at all? A year ago I was in an amazing relationship where I rarely craved attention, but now I feel so isolated."

lonely,On Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning by Haruki Murakami,"On Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning by Haruki Murakami - One beautiful April morning, on a narrow side street in Tokyo’s fashionable Harujuku neighborhood, I walked past the 100% perfect girl.  


Tell you the truth, she’s not that good-looking. She doesn’t stand out in any way. Her clothes are nothing special. The back of her hair is still bent out of shape from sleep. She isn’t young, either - must be near thirty, not even close to a “girl,” properly speaking. But still, I know from fifty yards away: She’s the 100% perfect girl for me. The moment I see her, there’s a rumbling in my chest, and my mouth is as dry as a desert.  


Maybe you have your own particular favorite type of girl - one with slim ankles, say, or big eyes, or graceful fingers, or you’re drawn for no good reason to girls who take their time with every meal. I have my own preferences, of course. Sometimes in a restaurant I’ll catch myself staring at the girl at the next table to mine because I like the shape of her nose.  


But no one can insist that his 100% perfect girl correspond to some preconceived type. Much as I like noses, I can’t recall the shape of hers - or even if she had one. All I can remember for sure is that she was no great beauty. It’s weird.  


“Yesterday on the street I passed the 100% girl,” I tell someone.  


“Yeah?” he says. “Good-looking?”  


“Not really.”  


“Your favorite type, then?”  


“I don’t know. I can’t seem to remember anything about her - the shape of her eyes or the size of her breasts.”  


“Strange.”  


“Yeah. Strange.”  


“So anyhow,” he says, already bored, “what did you do? Talk to her? Follow her?”  


“Nah. Just passed her on the street.”  


She’s walking east to west, and I west to east. It’s a really nice April morning.  


Wish I could talk to her. Half an hour would be plenty: just ask her about herself, tell her about myself, and - what I’d really like to do - explain to her the complexities of fate that have led to our passing each other on a side street in Harajuku on a beautiful April morning in 1981. This was something sure to be crammed full of warm secrets, like an antique clock build when peace filled the world.  


After talking, we’d have lunch somewhere, maybe see a Woody Allen movie, stop by a hotel bar for cocktails. With any kind of luck, we might end up in bed.  


Potentiality knocks on the door of my heart.  


Now the distance between us has narrowed to fifteen yards.  


How can I approach her? What should I say?  


“Good morning, miss. Do you think you could spare half an hour for a little conversation?”  


Ridiculous. I’d sound like an insurance salesman.  


“Pardon me, but would you happen to know if there is an all-night cleaners in the neighborhood?”  


No, this is just as ridiculous. I’m not carrying any laundry, for one thing. Who’s going to buy a line like that?  


Maybe the simple truth would do. “Good morning. You are the 100% perfect girl for me.”  


No, she wouldn’t believe it. Or even if she did, she might not want to talk to me. Sorry, she could say, I might be the 100% perfect girl for you, but you’re not the 100% boy for me. It could happen. And if I found myself in that situation, I’d probably go to pieces. I’d never recover from the shock. I’m thirty-two, and that’s what growing older is all about.  


We pass in front of a flower shop. A small, warm air mass touches my skin. The asphalt is damp, and I catch the scent of roses. I can’t bring myself to speak to her. She wears a white sweater, and in her right hand she holds a crisp white envelope lacking only a stamp. So: She’s written somebody a letter, maybe spent the whole night writing, to judge from the sleepy look in her eyes. The envelope could contain every secret she’s ever had.  


I take a few more strides and turn: She’s lost in the crowd.  


Now, of course, I know exactly what I should have said to her. It would have been a long speech, though, far too long for me to have delivered it properly. The ideas I come up with are never very practical.  


Oh, well. It would have started “Once upon a time” and ended “A sad story, don’t you think?”  


Once upon a time, there lived a boy and a girl. The boy was eighteen and the girl sixteen. He was not unusually handsome, and she was not especially beautiful. They were just an ordinary lonely boy and an ordinary lonely girl, like all the others. But they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world there lived the 100% perfect boy and the 100% perfect girl for them. Yes, they believed in a miracle. And that miracle actually happened.  


One day the two came upon each other on the corner of a street.  


“This is amazing,” he said. “I’ve been looking for you all my life. You may not believe this, but you’re the 100% perfect girl for me.”  


“And you,” she said to him, “are the 100% perfect boy for me, exactly as I’d pictured you in every detail. It’s like a dream.”  


They sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It’s a miracle, a cosmic miracle.  


As they sat and talked, however, a tiny, tiny sliver of doubt took root in their hearts: Was it really all right for one’s dreams to come true so easily?  


And so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, “Let’s test ourselves - just once. If we really are each other’s 100% perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones, we’ll marry then and there. What do you think?”  


“Yes,” she said, “that is exactly what we should do.”  


And so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west.  


The test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. They should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other’s 100% perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. But it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. The cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully.  


One winter, both the boy and the girl came down with the season’s terrible inluenza, and after drifting for weeks between life and death they lost all memory of their earlier years. When they awoke, their heads were as empty as the young D. H. Lawrence’s piggy bank.  


They were two bright, determined young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts they were able to acquire once again the knowledge and feeling that qualified them to return as full-fledged members of society. Heaven be praised, they became truly upstanding citizens who knew how to transfer from one subway line to another, who were fully capable of sending a special-delivery letter at the post office. Indeed, they even experienced love again, sometimes as much as 75% or even 85% love.  


Time passed with shocking swiftness, and soon the boy was thirty-two, the girl thirty.  


One beautiful April morning, in search of a cup of coffee to start the day, the boy was walking from west to east, while the girl, intending to send a special-delivery letter, was walking from east to west, but along the same narrow street in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. They passed each other in the very center of the street. The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts. Each felt a rumbling in their chest. And they knew:  


She is the 100% perfect girl for me.  


He is the 100% perfect boy for me.  


But the glow of their memories was far too weak, and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fouteen years earlier. Without a word, they passed each other, disappearing into the crowd. Forever.  


A sad story, don’t you think?  


Yes, that’s it, that is what I should have said to her."

And since he never fessed up I can only put 2 and 2 together. 

It’s been a while since then and I’ve grown for the better. I had some tinder dates which didn’t end up well and I hate online dating. The last time I dated this wasn’t around and I was much younger. I’ve managed to make some great friends at my new job and that’s wonderful. What sucks is I go home and immediately feel lonely. 

I think it’s only gotten worse since I’ve started a FWB. When we’re together it’s fun and it’s so nice to lay next to someone. But when they are busy or don’t want to stay, I feel weirdly unwanted. A lot of the time all I want is someone to lay next to and cuddle. 

I’m trying not to put pressure on myself and just live my life a little more care free, but I genuinely feel like I’m never going to find someone who wants to be with me forever. Or whatever forever is. 

I would really like to not feel lonely and be a little more content being alone."

lonely,Sometimes You've gotta change,"Sometimes You've gotta change - I am a very introvert person. I usually do one sentence chit chats with my friends, and after a while it's complete silence. When I got my first job, I felt I'm lacking behind because of my introvert character. So, I started reading books about how to be good in communication. Now, I'm not reader, but this particular book had short chapters and point to point explanations. It helped me a lot. Though it is always feels like I'm a fake person when I try these techniques because I have to put extra efforts to do this, It's not natural, but sometimes it helps.

Let me know what you guys think."

I can’t even do anything I like anymore without losing interest. I’m just lost at this point. It’s not like I don’t try and put myself out there to try and get a girlfriend and new friends, I do, but it never ends well. I either end up getting hurt or they just leave me cause I am too distant. I try not to be distant but lately that’s how I am. That numb feeling comes around a lot lately.

lonely,Just lonely in general.,"Just lonely in general. - Overall, I'm really lonely. While I do have many friends, and some are very close to me, I always feel lonely. Like I just want something that I don't have and can't have. This feeling changes constantly. Sometimes I want a closer friend that I can relate to, sometimes I want a girlfriend. But most of the time, I just want someone or something to be there for me.

I can't have a pet because my silbings and parents are allergic (I'm the only one who isn't) or they are afraid of whatever pet I would want.

I can't get a girlfriend not only because of my introverted nature, low self esteem, and terrible social skills, but also because I'm just not attractive in any way.

I can't get a closer friend because my views (political, outlook on life, sense of humor, etc.) drive people away.

It just sucks and I wish I could do something about it but everything is just so out of my control that I can't do anything."

furthermore, i want someone similar to me. i dont want some normal extraverted person. i wish i could find someone just as introverted and anxious as i am. someone who wont judge me for being weird and awkward and shit. yet, at the same time, all the people who have ever liked me have been TOO weird. so i dont know what to think. does anyone else feel like they’re weird, but not super weird, so it’s like an odd middle ground?"

I was so worried I kept trying to figure out why, and I think I’ve scared her away. I don’t know what to do. I might have sent her too many messages. I just wanna cry but I can’t. I need help."

It’s like a one way street. I could show them the most genuine interest they’ve ever received from a human, but I get that cold shoulder. I don’t get the text back, the check up. Nothing. All my “friends” family and the girls I’m interested in only call/text me when they need/want something from me. Am I the only one like that?

After losing my gf of, almost, 2 years I’ve changed a lot. Grown in some areas and diminished in others. I find myself thinking about how I wish I had more friends. Friends that actually wanted to talk. About anything at all. So I figured I’d turn to Reddit.

My friends don’t text me and the girls just friend zone me. Once that happens they only text me when they need me to do something for them. I do it anyways because I care about them but damn. Give me a break.

So with that jumbled up rant of a vent, anyone wanna talk? It could be about anything in the world, I really don’t care. Just PM me if you do."

When I came to my university I picked up a job which creates a very close working space. I see the same 10-15 people every day of the year &amp; I trust these people &amp; care for them. 

However
Something just feels missing, I’m happy when I’m with my coworkers or close buddies, but the moment I leave this dread comes over me. I lay in bed &amp; wonder what is missing. I feel lonely, but know I shouldnt. Maybe it’s from a lack of significant other, or animal companion? 

I had a girlfriend for a year while at the college, &amp; I felt wonderful in that time; since we broke up (a year ago) I feel as if I’ve just a shadow of the old me. 
Has anyone ever felt this before? Is this something else I’m experiencing from the sound of it?

I have been told, ""I don't want to hang out because you are bad luck. Every time we hang out, something bad happens.""  I was in an abusive relationship for 7 years and he allowed me no friends anymore. There was one I would sneak text on my cell, that I had to hide since I wasn't allowed to have that either. I made my escape and got my own place. The day I moved in I texted that friend so we could meet up and eat...he never replied...I woke the next morning to a text from his sister that he had a brain aneurism and had died. This is what I'm talking about. I loved him. That was 4 years ago. I'm a single mom who works from home and making friends has not been possible. To this day everything I touch turns to crap. I don't even need to leave the house and bad things happen back to back. I mean I don't go to shady places, I live in the suburbs and trouble constantly gravitates towards me. Even my own child asks to stay home because he has seen the nonstop bad that pops up when we try to go do something fun like normal people. That is another reason I want a friend. I have no support, no outlet, no family and a stressful job. 7 billion people and I feel like no one can relate or be there for me."

lonely,"Alone at every turn, musings of an expectant mother.","Alone at every turn, musings of an expectant mother. - First Off, I’m a 28/F, the F part I’m sure you knew based off the title but now it’s confirmed. 
I’m sure there will be people who judge me and my situation because let’s be honest, this is Reddit. That’s what people do here. I’d appreciate any negativity kept to yourself, no one needs it and I certainly don’t at this point. 

Six months ago I was living in TX, I was in a seemingly great relationship, and I was on track to a new career. I was also on birth control and then on Christmas Day I took a pregnancy test and found out that despite the BC, I was pregnant. I told the father fully expecting a freak out and got far more than that. In response the decided he did not want anything to do with this child or with me. I didn’t beg or plead, I didn’t argue, I just accepted that I would have to to this alone and decided that it was probably for the best. 

Fast forward to a few months ago, I realized that I’d never be able to make any kind of living where I was as the cost of living was far too high so, I made the choice to move across the country to live with my mom until after the baby is born so there would be a larger support system, I’d get to be with her for a time after the birth, and the prospect of making it as a single mother are much higher. 

2 weeks ago I got on a plane with the few things I deemed important and moved. I expected loneliness at first but regardless I feel so soul crushingly alone that I don’t even know what to do. I don’t have a vehicle yet, I don’t have a job (I’m used to working full time), I have no friends, I have family but I’ve been away for so long that I feel detached from all of them. My mother has a good heart but she’s also very cold and emotionally detached, this just leaves me feeling unwanted and burdensome. 

I’ve wanted this baby the entire pregnancy and I can’t wait to meet her but I’m also so afraid of the future because of how hollow I already feel. I know this is a long rant but I just don’t even know where to turn, I just want to cry all the time but it’s like I won’t allow myself because I should be stronger.. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you. I really just needed to vent."
lonely,Sorry for my English but I had to share,"Sorry for my English but I had to share - A few days ago, a guy from my town went missing ( to make sure no one stress out, they found him,he had run away ) even though I don't really know him, I had a few classes with him, I knew deep down that something was wrong. I felt really bad because I saw it and didn't do anything to help or be there for him. I 've been in this situation before and I wish no one to live in a state of mind that cause you so much damage and sadness. I don't really know why he did it but I think he is  very lonely and don't like to open up or talk to people, he is an introvert. But the thing is that I didn't do anything. I promise myself I wouldn't let anyone suffer like I have in the past and try my best to make people happy and help when they need it! I wish I was there for him and it's been 2days and I can't stop thinking about it. The first thing i do in the morning is thinking about him!

The weirdest thing is that a few hours before I learn about this disappearance, I thought about him while I was driving. I felt so bad i couldn't sleep and take my car and ""try"" to go find him even though I knew I couldn't. I cried so much because i felt I was a part of this problem and that I could have done something. I realized He was never laughing in class when the teacher was saying jokes and he avoid talking to anybody and leave the class pretty fast. He was often in advance and read books alone in the dark in the classroom. Also, he stopped going to classes and that's why I can't get over it! 

( my first class with him 2-3 years ago, he was very kind to me and ask me if I wanted to be his partner and he help me in a way because I thought no one would ask and it makes me happy but still we haven't talk during this class and the ones after! He also don't show up for a few and the exams as well).  I don't know what to do now and I try to find him but nothing, not even on social media, nothing. I really want to be there for him!


I just had to share that  because there's so many people feeling lonely on this planet  but there's people who care about us and we don't have any clue! Be there and help when you see someone in need PLEASE!"
lonely,"We're lonely, I'm lonely","We're lonely, I'm lonely - We come here because we are lonely. Whether we post in r/lonely or anywhere else on Reddit, we are looking for connection, all of us. We receive it on some level, usually briefly, but it's still not enough. We start posting looking for friends, most connections are also brief. It's the nature of the beast. 

I stay at home with my 2yo, my husband works at a job that barely pays the bills. If I could work, I would. Instead I have a couple of side hustles that fall within my capabilities to make a little cash here and there. Everyone on my side of the block know me and stop to chat. Some of our other neighbors know me and my son on sight, as we are outside almost every day from April through October. The workers at the local Aldi have known us since LO was 3 months old, it's a pleasure to interact with them. I can talk to just about anybody on the street.

BUT! If it involves any kind of stakes- possible rejection, putting my foot in your mouth, not clicking well, potential hurt and/or hardship... I have so many feels and sometimes odd reactions. I'm no longer the confident, affable, engaging person I otherwise am. I'm shy and kind of awkward. I either turn inward or go into overshare overload. I don't have many friends, or my own family. My husband's family *are* my family, but I have maybe 2 friends outside of that. My husband is regularly at work 14 hours a day. I stay at home. God it's so lonely my husband and I are best friends and definitely make it work. Our relationship is healthy. Doesn't mean I'm not alone at 12p while I'm making lunch and there's a whining toddler at my feet. Or in the quiet of nap time, theoretically a time for me to relax, is spent doing the things that I can't do when LO is awake. Or being just too tired to do much. Depression is starting to set in some.

 I'm burned out, my husband is burned out. His bosses are verbally abusive towards their employees. His boss is the VP's son and his mom is HR (small company). They suck at their jobs and gang up on everyone who doesn't let the family disrespect them. The owner either can't see it, or won't do anything about it. Everything is falling apart there, it sucks because we had made a few good buddies and genuinely care about the company. I'm personally hurt, especially when I tried to reach out with my own concerns and never received a response. I have to deal with it's effects privately. My husband is already so strung out over it, I'm his rock. I feel alone in my experience of it all. He's got a job offer that we're very tempted to accept. 

Idk if I need someone to talk to or not, but I definitely needed to vent. Thanks, guys"
lonely,Can we face the fact that a lot of us are going to ignore adult males who are looking to talk,"Can we face the fact that a lot of us are going to ignore adult males who are looking to talk - I see a lot of adults posting on here, mostly adult males who write well. I think most people will be turned off by this and it’s understandable why. But would we pass this same opportunity for a female of the same age? More people I think would talk to a 25 year old female than a 25 year old male and that is because I think a lot of people see this sub as a dating platform. I’m wrong for a few but I really think it’s a majority.

I also see a lot of people just lurking here and message once and then that’s it. It’s happened to me with a few people. I give them access to message me and then when they see who I am they flake away. If you want to ‘help’ then don’t seek out people who are feeling pain because it might make you feel holier that you may have given someone a moment of your time. It actually makes me feel worse when you message once and then never again because it reminds me of how I got lonely in the first place.

It is only now i realize that i've been so focused on people that dont care as much about me, i forgot that there are people out there that actually cares about me.

It’s like I’m not fun, boring and just don’t connect well with people. 

I’ve tried to be more fun and open to new things and none of it has worked. I feel like some people include me or have me around out of pity not because they enjoy my company. 

I’ve never felt like I belong I feel like I just go through everything alone on my own and that’s just how it is for me. 

No girls like me, doesn’t seem to matter what I try to do in that area I’m still single and don’t have any girls that show any kind of interest in me. 

I have so much success in my careers and other areas but I still don’t feel complete because I lack the social side of things. 

All my friends are getting married, having kids and moving places and I’m still here completely alone.

But im a nice dude why do i feel like im seen as this grotesque thing. I just dont get it...
lonely,So alone and I don’t know what to do,"So alone and I don’t know what to do - I am 39 and divorced. I have 3 beautiful daughters and they, honestly, are the only thing that has kept me going the last few years. I try to consider myself blessed. I have my daughters and they are so amazing in every way. Smart, funny, wonderful personalities. They are all beautiful and really starting to hit their stride and find themselves in life. It is a true joy to be there father and to see them grow and develop into  the wonderful young ladies they are becoming. I tell myself that is more then enough. I am greedy wanting more. There are so many others who have it worse then I do. 

I have lived through a lot in my life. I don’t think I’m extraordinary in anyway, but I do feel sometimes like the amount of shit I’ve been through has been excessive. I might eventually write it all down, but it honestly has been a lot. And I used to be strong. I was the glue that held my family together growing up. I was the one. I found the love of my life and I couldn’t have been luckier. We were in love. In every way. We had babies and it was like a dream. And then more tragedy. I didn’t handle it well. For the first time I wasn’t strong. I was weak, so fucking weak. So pathetic. And now, the aftermath is too much to bear. I lost everything. Everything I love, everything I own. Now all I have left is my daughters half the time. It’s not enough. The thought of them not with me at all times is almost unbearable. I tried to give myself time. To adjust, to move on. It’s been almost three years since we split and sure there are days it doesn’t hurt as much as it once did. But the other days? It still feels so fresh. There are mornings I wake up and I look around and think, this can’t possibly be real. I had everything I wanted in life and now I’m alone. 

I tried dating a little. Actually, I have been on two dates and had a couple one night stands. I felt nothing. I want someone. I want to love. I want to find all of that again. I am kind of a sappy, hopeless romantic. And I miss the little romantic things. I miss the goodnight and good morning kisses. The hugs and smiling face when I get home. The little notes and texts. I miss my best friend. I want, desperately to find that again. But I feel so lost. I have literally gone out like 4 times in the nearly 3 years. I have literally no family except my kids. Nobody. My friends are all older like me and have kids and families. They don’t go out. I have tried tinder and bumble and match, but everything is so different. I am nearly 40, I have put on weight, a lot of moms and dads can relate I’m sure. I never had trouble getting a date when I was younger, but now it’s hard to get anyone I am remotely attracted to to swipe right on me. And I know that’s not the best way to find someone. But I can’t seem to force myself to go to a bar or anywhere else alone. It’s so hard to make friends at this age. I don’t know how people do it. 

I have tried repeatedly to go out. I have joined a gym. I work out. I have improved my diet so much. Cutting out fast foods, cooking my own meals basically every day. I have read more then ever. So there are some things I have done better. But the loneliness is killing me. When I don’t have my girls, I am a sad, shell of myself. There are some days on the weekend where I haven’t even left bed. I try to force myself up, to get out, do anything, but I can’t seem to do it. The loneliness only grows. 

I know I messed up. A lot. I made this mess for myself. I let my depression, sadness and guilt consume me, overtake me. And I am reaping everything I showed. Yet my ex isn’t without some blame. During my hardest time she was out with another man. So there has always been some anger and so much hurt and betrayal there. I know I should move on. And honestly, I basically have. From her at least. I mourn the family I lost, the life I lost. I don’t mourn her any longer. But it doesn’t make it easier. I don’t know how to get out of this funk. I don’t know where to begin. I have a good job, but it’s a small company and we just, finally got health insurance. So I will be going to the doc after the first and talking to someone. The last thing I want is to get on medication, but maybe that’s what I need. 

So I’m not sure where to go from here. I never in a million years thought I would be this guy. I have always had friends, always been social. I was popular and the center of so much fun and attention at one point. And now, I am this sad man who is completely, utterly alone. The days I don’t have my children I feel like I might be better off dead. I wouldn’t ever consider that, not even a consideration. But it doesn’t stop me from thinking about it or sometimes wishing for it. I don’t want to be the weird guy who is alone at 40, at 50. This is no way to live. 

I am sorry if I come across whiny or pathetic. I am so overwhelmed with this, all the time. I look forward to going to work, to interact and actually do something. I just am not sure where to go from here. I don’t want my kids to think less of me. To think their dad is a loser who is alone. But where do I go from here? How do I change? How do I fix this? I want, so badly, to be the person I used to be. To be confident and fun. To be a person people gravitate to, people like and want to spend time with. I want to be a man my kids are proud to call dad. I know they love me completely and are proud to call me dad, but as they get older I wonder if that will change. I wonder what would happen if I got sick or hurt. Who would help me if I needed that help. I wonder how I can make it the next 5, 10 years or even longer feeling this completely alone. Hopefully I will break out of this and life will be great again one day. But I can’t even fathom how at this point."
lonely,"I just want to let it out, I've been alone for very long and it hurts. I am confused about everything.","I just want to let it out, I've been alone for very long and it hurts. I am confused about everything. - I just am lost and desperate. Just trying to be socially normal and not feel like at an outcast at all times, it sucks not leaving your room for a year and not having anyone to turn to, talk to and just no one at all. The realization that there's only you out there and no one who cares and thinks about you, there's just you in a dark and a lonely space. I've had one good friend before and ever we've been friends for 7 years, but he moved out of the country and I did my best to keep in touch and not let our friendship die, but it did. He found new friends and created a great social circle and I'm happy and proud for him, but it also saddens me that I'm still at the same spot with nobody. We had a pretty cool bromance and he told me about how he cared about me and loved me and how we'll be good friends for years to come and do many things together and all, I still open up those messages sometimes to feel better about myself. I just want to reach out to him and tell him how I miss my friend and all, but I just can't bring myself to do it, I tried to reach out to him many times before and clearly he wasn't interested anymore and I'll just look like a bum who can't move on, but he's the only friend I've ever had too.

Fuck dude, I don't know what to do with myself. I can't talk to my parents cause of our awkward relationship, to my brothers, to my cousins, there must be something wrong with me. Our family hangs out all the time with each other, my siblings always get invited, but I don't. Maybe it's my fault and I'm just not very likable as a person and it sucks cause I don't think anyone ever really liked me. I think I'm pretty successful when it comes finances and all that which is cool, right, I can buy things now yet that doesn't bring any satisfaction when you have nobody, I wish I could trade everything I have for decent social skills and just a group of friends. I'm tired of acting happy to everyone and saying that everything is great and all when everything is going horribly bad. Not sure how things will remain like this, but I'm so sick and tired of it and I have been trying to change and become better and I bought into all that self improvement stuff. I started working out, reading books, journaling and meditation and everything to fill my day and just distract myself from thinking about stuff like this, but there's always days that suck where you get reminded of how much your life sucks. And sure all of that stuff is progress I have a nicer body, I'm learning new things and all. But what good is that when I can't be happy or anything, nothing feels good. Sorry all for the long post and if you read through it thank you so much. Hopefully better days are on the way for all of us."

lonely,Recent college grad who failed miserably to make friends in college and is now all alone.,Recent college grad who failed miserably to make friends in college and is now all alone. - Hi y’all. Hope everyone is having a nice night. I graduated college about a year ago and have never felt so alone in my life. I stayed in the city I went to college in as I had friends and a girlfriend here. I now have drifted far from my friends and things with my girlfriend are rocky. I just went back home for the weekend about 4 hours away and was happy to be around my parents who love me and want me around. I just back to my apartment and just bawled on the floor as I realized how truly alone I feel. I am required to stay here for another year due to my work contract but just don’t know what to do. The past few trips home have been great and whenever I return back to my apartment it feels as if my heart is ripping in two and I wind up crying alone for the rest of the night. I want to make new friends in the city but i just don’t know what to do. Thoughts?

I know for many, their life goals revolve around a career or money, but this is mine. I want someone to forge a close bond with, to be able to escape from the world with into our own tranquil bubble and just be in bliss. Someone to say ""I love you"" to whenever my love for them wells up in my heart like magma, and someone to give a spontaneous ""I love you"" to me. Someone to grow with and foster growth for them in turn. It is my biggest desire, my number one goal, my brightest dream I intend to spin into reality, and I pray to any gods or forces of power out there that they help to guide me in fulfilling this. I think I need a spark of a miracle to help save me from this loneliness and the crumbling of my heart."

lonely,"Instead of posting how lonely you are, and how everyone hates you, try this","Instead of posting how lonely you are, and how everyone hates you, try this - So this thread seems to only be about people posting how miserable they are being lonely, and every post usually sounds the same. Instead of wallowing in your sorrows hoping for pity, start taking action to change yourself. No good comes out of typing out a paragraph on how miserable you are to random strangers online, you may feel like youre getting something off your chest, but guess what,  youll still be the same pathetic loner tomorrow. Venting about your situation doesnt help anyone, instead start learning how to make friends. Learn how to make others feel good about themselves, how to conversate and build rapport. All the information you need to become the person you want to be is online, there are hundreds of articles on making friends, conversating, and change your life around 180, but it seems like none of you want the help, youd rather stay the same because its more comfortable than changing who you are. So before posting that ""all hope is lost for me"" post, ask yourself if youve actually tried putting yourself out there, and if you didnt stop even if you ""failed"".  Nobody will come save you, this world does not care about you. And being a depressed pity seeking fiend is not going to get you anywhere. Hope some of you read this and something clicks, you CAN change, but not like this"
lonely,Any advice,Any advice - Yah I’m 16 turning 17 later this year and a few years back like 14-15  I was in the best relationship I’ve ever had w this girl Jackie I used to sneak out and go to her place and spend the night cuddling up w her. we made this a common thing and that was the only time I could ever get good sleep ( I am currently being diagnosed w insomnia ) then she had to move back to Korea across the globe so I broke up w her so she could try to find happiness with someone else. after that i got w one girl for 10 months and we broke up bc her parents would never let us see each other the breakup wasn’t bad and it didn’t rly sting but even in that relationship the lack of touch kept me from being as happy as I was w Jackie  and it hit me I’ve been lonely af sense and have never got what I need in years every month that goes by my insomnia gets worse and I just feel lonely without someone with me and the girl that I’m talking to now is like a 13 min drive and not just down the st so I wouldn’t be able to go over there idk how I could cope with not having someone with me like how can I distract my mind form just feeling like shit at night

lonely,"I hate living in a small, backwards town","I hate living in a small, backwards town - My parents don’t understand this at all. My dad grew up here, it’s a christian dense area where all the families know each other and mutually accept JUST each other. The thing is, if you didn’t grow up around them, they don’t accept you. I’m not saying this is a thing against christians, I am one myself. I’m just talking about the subculture of specific people in my area I guess. 

My mom wasn’t from the area, so nobody ever truly accepted her. Therefor me, nor my siblings ever really “fit in” either. I just hate that even today I struggle with this. My mom is brainwashed by these people now because she’s finally content with the friends she’s made and thinks I can do the same thing.

 I just can’t conform to this town. I don’t want to change myself to be like everyone else here in order to fit in. When I go out with kids my age, I have to be a completely different person for them to like me. If act like my shy, introverted self i’d get nowhere. Yet still, when I’m fun and outgoing, and fake, I get nowhere. I never get invited out by anyone, unless I invite them somewhere. 

It just feels like i’m at a dead end, trying to please people who don’t even want me in their life. I see them hanging out without me on snapchat stories and get sad, but when I tell my mom she says “you have to invited yourself out with them.” Yeah, i’m just gonna say “hey i’m gonna come over to your place even though you didn’t invite me, see you soon!” because that’s how you “fit in”. 

It’s easy to tell when someone doesn’t want me around, and I get that vibe from everyone here. I’m just unwanted. I wish I belonged to something. I have never in my 18 years of living here, felt like I belonged or even had a true friend here. 

I probably wouldn’t have survived if it weren’t for internet friends. The internet made me realize that not everyone is like the people in my town, there is so much diversity out there. I just wish I could physically reach it."

lonely,I feel like this is never gonna end.,"I feel like this is never gonna end. - So this may be all over the place but I just feel all over the place. 

I feel like I'm honestly gonna be forever alone. Like, I have been single since 2013. Now I'm not disgustingly ugly, or hideous or whatever. I have sex on occasion. I have a pretty steady fwb even though the one doesnt even turn me on anymore. 

Kinda recently I started having sex with someone else I've known since I was a teenager (I'm 28 now if that gives any indication of time). The sex with the new guy. Oh. My. God. I have NEVER had anything like that before, besides when I used to have fun and get high here and there. Anyway. 

Why is it that I can have sex with someone like that and feel no emotional attachment? Hes an awesome friend. We have great conversations. But we dont have much in common. Maybe 30% of our interests? Hes prepping for the end of the world and working out and I'm sitting here on reddit venting and watching teen mom 2. The only thing that makes me happy about this is I know I've grown. Usually whenever I sleep with someone I usually fall for them. Whether or not I have anything in common. This time I havent. I'm more upset about the fact that I can have sex like that, and not be involved with them emotionally. I'll usually fall for someone at the drop of a dime. Especially after hooking up with them. 

I need that emotional support. I need someone to be there emotionally for me. I'm not super depressed. But I'm tired of coming home and going on POF or staring at my phone waiting for my ""friends"" to text me. It's sad. 

Idk. If you got this far I applaud you. And if it makes sense even better lol."

So in my heart and mind, i do understand that im not exactly adonis. I know and understand im not owed a response. 

But i cant help but feel...disappointed. I dont even get a “thanks but no”. Just straight ignored. I have no problem someone not wanting to talk but...i dont know. I can only say that i wouldnt ignore anyone because id consider that rude. Is that my problem? Am i just expecting too much just for someone to take the time to at least tell me no thanks? Seconds of politness. It feels no one in the world even cares enough to have manners these days. I know im not owed manners, i guess i just find the state of the world depressing that people would rather ignore than be polite but honest. Idk.

I was feeling positive about my mental and weight loss achievements but when i put this across people in the group told me i was wrong and the asshole etc. It may be my fault because i was exasperated and  put it in not the best way that i would rather ppl tell me than ignore. Idk. Just feel shit."
lonely,surrounded by friends and lonelier than ever,"surrounded by friends and lonelier than ever - I thought if I moved in with my only two friends life would be great, but living together has caused them to hate each other. their inability to work things out, or even keep problems from escalating, has filled the house with tension and stress. One of them keeps all her feelings to herself, but then snaps and admits paranoia that the other is poisoning me against her. The other thinks that if I show any sympathy for the first, i’m betraying her and not being a friend. after a fight that I got dragged into, I was so shaken up that I went to my parents to get away. I’ve never turned to them for emotional issues before because they are emotionally incompetent, but it was nice to be fed and out of that house for awhile. Being with them reaffirmed that they don’t know how to be helpful in the way that I’ve always needed, and even when i ask them for what I need explicitly (“can i sit next to you awhile” “can you listen to this hard subject without laughing it off”) they brush it off or are clearly too uncomfortable to do it. fine. I appreciated being home but my heart hurt every night. now i’m on my way back to my friends and i’ve been struggling not to cry in the airport all day because i don’t want to be there either. If I show how much the situation is affecting me to either of them, they think i’m being selfish because it’s not really my fight and ~can’t i see how horrible it is for them to live with such a horrible person how could i make this about me~. But it’s been this way for 6 months (the lease ends in 5 more months) and I’ve never felt so keenly that no one has my back or will ever listen to me fully. i’ve never been able to be close to people, and it took me a decade with each of these girls to be as close to them as I have. I can’t abandon one for the other, but i’m afraid i’m losing both. I realized that this ache i’m feeling is some kind of existential loneliness, so i searched r for lonely and here I am.

lonely,Ended my only friendship and now I have nobody,"Ended my only friendship and now I have nobody - I ended my friendship with my best friend of 7 years because I felt like she was toxic for me and dragging me down with her. 

Long story short: we both came from similar situations - broken families, never did well in school, feeling lost and not knowing what to do with our lives...I turned my life around while she kept digging a deeper hole for herself. I tried to help her as much as I could, but it just never felt like it was enough for her. I felt like she was angry with me because I was getting my life together and leaving her behind, but I tried to keep her by my side and not make it seem like a competition because it wasn’t. She couldn’t be happy for me for my success and tried to keep me down at her level. I couldn’t take it anymore and decided to just cut her out of my life. 

I look back to see if I made the right choice and I feel that I did. However, I feel more lonely then ever before, but I still don’t want to reconnect with her. I have a busy life and don’t really have time to make friends..Don’t know what else I could do to fill this loneliness"
lonely,"Alone after years, in a city where I don't know anyone","Alone after years, in a city where I don't know anyone - I moved out from my parent's home three years ago, since then I lived with two friends (a couple).

In these two years I met few people, and I can't really call anyone of them a ""friend"", even if I tried to go out and spend some good time, but it wasn't the same thing. 
So from now on I will live alone in my house, with no friends, and no possibility to know new people. My job is in an office and we're only in two (with my colleague being older than me), I don't practice any sport and even if I go out by myself I would feel weird to just start to talk to random people.

lonely,"An unstructured rant about my loneliness setting back in, that I should probably say to a therapist","An unstructured rant about my loneliness setting back in, that I should probably say to a therapist - I moved back home for the summer (I'm a student), and I've been trying to do something social every couple of days, since my doctor agrees that I'm getting anxiety and they think my depression is coming back up. So, being social and stuff should be good, but I got cancelled on yesterday. 

I was going to go on a second date with a guy I've been talking to and, fuck me I keep overthinking this and I can't deal with it. He cancelled on me saying he was sick and had no energy. Which is fair enough, but with all the stories in r/dating about how you might go on a date with someone and then they start cancelling plans and expect you to take the hint, I know I won't be able to handle that well, if that's what's happening. I thought it went really well, but I honestly don't know, I have autism and read situations wrong. 

So I'm feeling really shitty over, having found a guy who I can connect to. And my ex nicely confirmed today that we can't really be more than distant friends at this point, he broke up with me and is having issues with the fact that I'm dating other people now. 

I haven't really spoken to a lot of my university friends since the semester ended and a lot of them didn't move for uni starting up, so with the price of commuting, I won't see them for 5 months. Which is fucking wonderful, totally doesn't feel like a slap in the face.

And I guess the real kicker of it all is my birthday is popping up soon. By soon I mean in 1 month and 1 day I'll be 20, and I hate the fact that I'm gonna be a year older, and I feel like I'm wasting my time doing anything I do, nothing feels like I'm going in the right direction. I don't feel like I'm meeting new people, because PS4 friends don't really count. And suddenly I'm no long a teenager and I'm getting old and I should be enjoying my life, but I'm just stuck in this pit of loneliness. 

I just can't be alone, I'm sick of it. And no matter how social I seem to be nothing changes it. I could be talking to people for an hour or 2 straight, and need to go to the bathroom and within the time it takes me to leave the conversation and go do whatever I'll be sobbing uncontrollably, because I'm alone. The only thing that fixed that was a relationship, but I can't be codependent, especially when dating isn't my forte.

I thought this was ok, how it should be and what and in the process I grew up never knowing who I was and never letting anyone in on a deep enough level to find out myself. So now I'm 22 anxious, can't drive and have a family that loves me but has had enough of me fucking up and generally want me independent and out of their hair. I confuse other people's emotions and ideas with my own and instead of feeling connected by understanding them, I feel alone because they, and myself too do not understand who I am. I grew up keeping my head down and avoiding conflict and became extremely intelligent in that sense but I'm left feeling confused and alone. No amount of therapist bullshit gives me any help, and though the my family cares, I know they wouldn't care to know what's going on behind closed doors because they've got their own shit to deal with thats a higher priority than me and it hurts. Because deep down I know and was raised to know my emotions are never anyone's priority. My family has always had this emotionally distant minds set and take pride in it, and it hurts so bad because I'm not a priory enough in their minds to be understood for who I am."

lonely,realization,"realization - I have had these six friends since the start of high school. It used to be 10 but I was the cause of some drama in freshman year. And I know it’s nice to have friends and all, but I always put on this fake act of happiness and saying jokes and stuff as I’m known as the “one who jokes”. Because of this, they never ask me how I’m doing or talk about serious stuff with me. 

And one of them had something serious happen to them and he told people except me because according to someone, he said that I would “just make a joke out of it.” I really wouldn’t in reality and I just don’t know cause I don’t want to change myself but it really seems that way

As well as My closest friend seems to have more fun with other people too so I’ve just been distancing myself because I want the best for her. It’s like all six are my friends, but I feel so distanced from them more then ever"

Underneath my sunglasses the tears would well up with a feeling of overwhelming loneliness, but then I would push them down as I would nod and smile pretending that all is OK."

lonely,This is my life...,"This is my life... - When I was younger whenever I ask my family to buy me something, they would say me to get good grades. I was not a genius kid. I was just an average. So at some point I stopped asking them anything, coz I know I'll never get good scores and so I'll never get what I want. Also I thought people deserve something only if they get good grades. I was not allowed to go out with anyone other than my family. They say I shouldn't go out with anyone. I can't have a girlfriend. My family never took me on a vacation. They said I lost my life coz I got low grades. I don't even remember the last day I was happy. All these years passed and all I remember is me going to school and college, coming back home, having food and sleep. There is literally nothing I have done that made me happy. All these years I did nothing but score marks. Now I'm here years later, having a bachelor's degree which I think I don't even deserve, and I stay in my room all day thinking why I had such a bad childhood. Till now my family wouldn't value my opinions. It makes me feel like what is the purpose of my life? I have no memory of me being happy. And the funny part is everyone thinks I'm happy. If any parents are reading this please be nice to your kids.  Keep them happy. Sorry for my bad English. Thanks for reading it till the end :)"
lonely,"18, still alone, and riddled with self loathing","18, still alone, and riddled with self loathing - I'm not too sure how to write this without coming a across as just a whiney teen looking for attention, hell I'm doubting myself as I write. 

I've recently graduated from high school and through out it, I was always been quiet, it's one trait of mine that everyone seems to recognize, but I wasn't always like that. Sometime through middle school I suddenly shifted from a naive, talkative, and fun loving kid, to the more quiet and reserved personality that I've adopted. I first thought that this would be better than the former, as I had believed it would keep me out of drama, which it did. Unfortunately, it caused me to become much more shy and had made it feel impossible to find a relationship.

I find that part of the reason for the sudden shift is that throughout middle school and early high, my family has been experiencing a lot of conflicts. Namely constant fights between my mother and father and whenever one would start I would always hide in my room, waiting for it to end. I even found myself plugging my ears with headphones as to not hear them fight. My father often drunk a lot before fights and would begin smashing or throwing things. At one point he even smashed an entire table. I would try to play games with friends i had online to help me take my mind off the fighting but it almost always wasn't enough, and they would sometimes take the fight into my room. To add onto the fighting, my father worked a job that made move from state to state constantly, meaning I had to switch schools almost every year. I even moved from three different schools in my freshman year of highschool. Inevitably, the thing I feared most happened and my mother and father divorced. I was silent for several weeks at school after that, I almost failed my freshman year because of it all.

When it comes to getting a relationship, I've always been incompetent. As early as middle school I would like some girl, but always find it impossible to actually speak to them. I had always been afraid of directly speaking to girls and part of me still is. I really can't explain why either, but it is frustrating to say the least. The most painful part of all is that I've came so close to actually getting a girlfriend. So. Many. Times, but I would always fuck it up somehow, and I would just look like a fool, either because I couldn't take a hint, or I was too shy to simply fucking say ""hi"", and it makes me fucking hate myself for it. I would reprimand myself, saying that I could of done this or that, but your clearly too stupid to understand.

I'm not even sure why I'm posting this here, I think I'm just gotten so desperate to the point that I've begun searching reddit for any form of solice. If anyone is willing to give some advice, I'm all ears."
lonely,Confused vent,Confused vent - I feel lonely but the problem is there are people around me. My family are nice to me (especially nowadays as I have important exams) but I can't talk to anyone. I never learned to speak my emotions . I sometimes don't even understand my own emotions. I could be sitting who my family and everyone is  talking to someone except me. I just sit awkwardly silent and smiling every now and then. I'm a social failure . I can't talk to others unless they talk to me. I sick of it . I don't wanna be here anymore.

I’ve also never been in a relationship with a female which sucks nor have I had any (f) friends ever. I will probably die alone.

lonely,Pointless thoughts,"Pointless thoughts - Only after dropping out and working full time do I realize what high school is really for. I’m 17 school is not about becoming smarter or equipping you with work skills, it’s about laying your social foundation and making you comfortable with people. Or at least giving you time to figure out even a little bit who you are. I played the tough guy since the start of middle school and I became a bully. I have never actually been a mean guy I only ever really wanted people to be my friend. When I was six the only birthday party I really remember there were four people me my brother my mom and my grandma. I never had a single friend show to a birthday party I liked the gifts but I always hated my birthday for that reason. That birthday was the first time I ever felt rejected and it was terrible. I was kinda the clown for awhile too but even tho I made a few funny jokes and got along with everyone I still never really had friends most of my time was Legos and tv in my house. I changed schools 4 times one I actually liked I was there for 3 years I knew everybody I was a little bit of a bully but I had friends I played sports. A social life was all I ever wanted all I cared about was that my peers knew I existed. And I had it. Then I moved did a bunch of drugs and dropped out. I continue the tough guy bullshit to this day, it’s kinda funny really I continue that “tough” act but I never even kissed a girl. The one girlfriend I ever had won’t talk to me. I almost never wish it happened because after her I know what it’s like to have somebody who cares about you enough to ask you about your problems. I wish I was mature enough to be open with her back then but hey the fuck you gonna do eh. I’m gonna do well financially I’m getting into real estate and I save all my money from work so when I turn 18 in a year I’ll have a good chunk saved up. I have no doubt about that kind of success. However money can’t truly buy happiness broke people live fulfilling lives. If I get successful and I can afford a nice car I worry that it might as well only have one seat. Idfk man if anyone can relate or something like that lmk just thoughts kinda going though my head."
lonely,"Ouch, I'm in Pain Again.","Ouch, I'm in Pain Again. - Me and my ex have been broken up since early April, and i was truly over her at this point. About a month ago she stopped talking to me entirely, which, initially, sucked because the relationship ended on good terms and we were going to try to ""be friends"". Well, as I've learned, that never really happens. 

More recently, she unfriended me on snapchat (another punch in the stomach), but since she didnt block me, her stories would show up in my ""subscriptions"". I didn't actually click on it, but today, in the little subscription thumbnail I saw her post a solo prom pic (we went to prom together back in 2017) and the caption said ""should have been my own prom date""....

Ouch did that hurt to see. Seeing something like that realllly hurts my already low self esteem :("
lonely,Anyone else doubt themselves constantly?,"Anyone else doubt themselves constantly? - Long story short: I recently got accepted into a medical program, landed my dream job at a hospital, and am scheduled to take my personal trainer exam at the end of summer. I basically got my shit together, for once. These are huge accomplishments for me, as I’m someone who used to stay up late, sleep in, binge watch tv, and didn’t really have any goals/did anything important. I’ve been really pushing myself this past year to be the best person I can be, but it’s difficult because I find myself doubting my ability to succeed. So much so that I believe it’s affecting my personality, attitude, and overall performance in life. 

For example, this job is a lot more difficult than I anticipated, and I’m thinking maybe I’m not good enough to work there. It’s been about two months and I‘m struggling to befriend my coworkers, most of which are already in this medical program and are doing great.
I feel like I‘m not smart enough to be in this medical program, and I’m not confident enough to be a personal trainer- despite loving medicine and fitness with all of my heart. I’ve been training a few friends and family for about a year now successfully, but I’m worried that my insecurity with myself will be obvious to my actual clients.  

I don’t know why I can’t just believe in myself or feel good about where I am, especially since a couple years ago I was unemployed, depressed, and struggling with drinking problems. 
Even though I know factually I’ve come a long way, I don’t feel any pride or happiness about where I am, but rather constant anxiety about moving forward and doubts about my abilities. A small part of me wants to just walk away and go back to unhealthy habits, even though I know that isn’t the right thing to do. 

Anyone else experienced/experiencing this? How can I stop doubting myself and feel confident in my abilities? I don’t really have anyone close I can talk to about this, so any honest feedback or personal experiences are much appreciated. Feel free to PM if you’re interested in talking more, and thanks for reading."

lonely,"I, essentially, live purely out of obligation.","I, essentially, live purely out of obligation. - I don't want to die, but it's been very hard to be alive lately. The few things that keep me going are my family (or at least a few members of my family), my friend Kieran, my passion for music, and the smallest hope I still have for a better tomorrow. 

My family is self-explanatory. I love my brothers and my mother, as well as my grandparents. My father is a different story, though I don't necessarily hate him or have zero love for him. I'd hate to devastate them by killing myself, despite my brain always telling me they'd just ""get over it"" anyways. Maybe they would, but I dunno. 

My friend, Kieran, is also a reason. He's been there for me for six years. He's done many financial and moral things for me. He's kept me from going on a downward spiral many, many times. And yet, I still treat him like shit because of how bitter and sad I feel all the time. I don't deserve him, I really don't. I love the guy more than he could ever know, he can be more of a brother to me than my actual brothers sometimes. 

Music is self-explanatory. It's what keeps me going. 

And hope is also self-explanatory, though I question every day on how I still have any hope. That being said, I still really wish I weren't alive. I have things to be thankful for, though they're in short supply. 

Anyways, I'm lonely 50% of the time, and the other 50% of the time, I'm just depressed.  There is hardly any room for happiness, if any. Often times, I'll think I'm happy in the moment, just to realize later on that I wasn't. I was merely distracted from the depression and loneliness. 

One of the biggest blows for me is my romantic failure. I haven't a girlfriend, and the few attempts I've made at getting one this year flopped completely. The first girl I tried getting with (of whom I genuinely liked and had a connection too) just ghosted me upon my confession, never acknowledging me since. The second attempt was with my life-long best friend, Emily. And the hardest part about that was the fact that she wanted to date. She did. The only issue was, she's attracted to women, not guys. Despite her best efforts, she couldn't look past that, and I don't blame her. But, still, that hurt. I've always sort of crushed on her a bit, so to get so close to an actually meaningful relationship, just to have it ruined by something out of both of our control was soul crushing. But, I digress. It's absolutely emotionally debilitating being lonesome in this way. I just want to be loved and accepted by somebody who likes me for me, and who likes the same things I do. It may be a lot to ask for, but it hurts being romantically lonesome. It really, really hurts.

Another factor in it is my constant fear of the future. I want nothing more than to write music for a living, having a loyal fanbase and all that I can share my (mostly horrible) life experiences with, as well as give advice and aid them via the music I create. I do not wish to be wealthy, though I wouldn't dislike that. I just want to earn enough to live off of, as well as buy the things I'd like to buy here and there. However, I have a constant fear that I'll never be able to live that dream out. Skill limitations, time limitations, the way the world works, etc. There are many factors working against me, and it terrifies me to know how possible it is that I'll fail. It almost makes trying not seem worth it. Why try when you know you have a better chance in failing than passing? I obviously don't plan on giving up any time soon, but it terrifies me. It keeps me up at night.

Yet another thing that depresses me is loss of innocence/loss of innocence. My shit childhood has to do with that. Whenever I see a pretty girl, or watch an anime, or see a cartoon, etc, I become depressed. Not just any cartoon or anime, but ones that show things like love stories, or coming of age stories, or even simple shit like a kid with a normal life. It's as if I get jealous that I don't have any of that, so it upsets me. And, especially what depresses me, is sexual stuff. If I see, hear, or do anything sexual, I become so, so depressed. I don't know why. It weirds me out too. I just don't get it. You probably don't understand, since I don't even understand which makes articulating it impossible, but I tried. Maybe some of you will understand.

And, lastly, the final thing I'll talk about that adds to my anguish (since there are so many) is how ani-social my life has become. I don't have money, nor do I have any friends (besides my one best friend), so I can't get out much. And since I was sheltered most my life, my social skills are goddamn terrible, so meeting new people is a huge struggle for me. So, naturally, I get cooped up in my house for long periods of time, just thinking, being sad, and being lonely. And, trust me, thinking about as much as I regularly do is dangerous. I'm sure you all know that. It really eats away at you.

I apologize for the wall of text that I call a post. I just had a lot on my mind and had to get it out, even if I've repeated the same shit on here in almost every post I've made. Thanks to whoever reads this stupid thing and comments, especially if you comment. I really need human contact, so even a comment on Reddit is heavily appreciated. Cheers, and have a good day/night.

I had to leave and never look back, but you made me look back. You showed up at my door one week before I left, and I could not resist your smile, your smell, your beautiful hazel eyes... I wanted you back, but I had to leave. I was too far into legal documents that I could not jsut pull out of them. You understood, and you gave me a magical last night before I left. One last kiss... That's what we kept saying. It was all great, we were texting. I wrote you letters and i stamped them with that blue wax, and i used our special dragonfly seal. But out of nowhere you stopped responding, you didn't reply to my texts for long hours. Your responses were cold and short. I knew something was wrong. You used to talk baout how you would fly here and have fun with me, play video games, eat food, watch netflix and cuddle, go to the beach, play our favorite card game, go to our favorite book stores, cook the curry you loved so much... And it just stopped. Two days ago... It would have been our 3 year anniversary. I look at the shark tooth I wear around my neck. Then one you gave me a month after we started dating.

lonely,"Long read, badly written and a self induldgent mess.","Long read, badly written and a self induldgent mess. - So probably should start with some background info:

19/M/UK - have had numerous romantic and platonic relationships. Diabetic (10yrs) but apart from this no diagnosed mental or physical health issues. Both mother and father still married and living together. I'm a big dork tbh lots of video games and anime. I am also very into music. Producing, listening, writing. Piano for 15 years and bass for about 7 or 6.

Heres my life story...

As an ultra smol kid ( from when i can remember to 12) we lived in switzerland where i attended a german school. I think i felt a real need to prove myself and fit in well so i came off as one of those over enthusiastic kids that just try and impress everyone. Safe to say i was bullied mercilessly for sticking out. Didn't help my appearence wasnt exactly common being asian white mixed and very tall. We eventually moved i suspect because of my failure to settle at school but also perhaps the language barrier was taking a toll on my grades. I do speak german fluently but my written communication was obviously sub par compared to the rest of class. If i had to summarise what impact this period of life had on the development of current me, i would say the bullying made me fear whar people do to those who dont fit in.

Fastforward. England, highschool/ year 7 to 11.
 When my first crush broke up with me was when i first observed the start of the things i dont really understand. She broke up with me via text. On the way back from spending the night tagging along with her friends rollerskating i recieved the text and cried all the way home. Cried for approx 1 hr at home and then stopped. It was quite painfull but it felt like very physical. Like someone squeezing my heart and alongside my mind going crazy thinking about what i did, why.etc it was very overwhelming hence - tears. The relationship gave me information on the types of people and cliques that i could work in. It also gave me a glimpse of the very real social heirachy at that age. 

So i decided i would try again with someone more in my clique. That went horribly. She was rude and used me to climb social ladder, putting me down in front of friends and lashing out when i called her out. Safe to say that i decided to end it. I broke up with her. No.2 taught me what i didnt want in a romantic relationship. 

Fast forward to A levels. (16 - 18). Ive become hyper aware of how i present myself. I enter every conversation having pre thought out possible responses for optimal sitautions. I spent a long time trying to ensure i was as normal seeming as possible. The move to college destroyed any friends i had before. They didnt talk anymore. It was a fresh start. And it was a failure! I met a circle of these music, stoner people i thought were fascinating and cool but i could never get in with them. No matter what i tried. The furthest development in relationship i had with them was as the ""wierd internet anime kid cuz hes asian"" the feeling of alienation was immense. 

My last two years of A levels i spent trying to improve myself, trying to understand what i did wrong and try to become more attractive as a friend. I did this by myself. I had no one i had regular interactions with because the twins went to uni and josh was struggeling with his future. 

At uni finally. A girl approached me from music society and we dated for 6 months. The whole time i knew it was doomed. I feel like a psychopath or im going crazy. I could fake this whole different human for weeks at a time. It was nice to spend time with someone who was obsessed with me but it felt so wrong. I want to stress i didnt treat her bad. I broke up with her a couple weeks ago, had to eject the whole friendship tied to music society. Back to nobody.

Current date - i feel so different from everyone and i guess that makes me a snowflake right? I just feel so unconnected to anything or anyone. People i talk to, i can see it in their eyes, i know what tags they're putting on me, what predictions of character they've made of me. I have tried to form lots of anykind of friendship but they all result in me playing a character which prevents me from getting any kind of fulffillment out of talking to them.

Even met this logically perfect girl, pretty, cute, speaks 9 languages, super good at art, super good at music, super smart, also a bit of a stoner so quite grounded as a human - but its all in my head? Theres no feeling, i dont feel anything when we spend all night talking, no feeling when we have intercourse, when shes hugging me and my brian knows it should be good but just nothing.

TL;DR - people dissapoint me immensly, i cant get the friendship/girlfriend buzz anymore and i dont know how to be me.

 And honestly: 

it makes me sad because I'm lonely."

You need to love yourself in order for someone to be attracted to you but I've respected myself my whole life, I've had multiple relationships fail through a good deal of my own doing as well as theirs so I've never just solely blamed other people unless they really deserved it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been through the natural phase of growing up, being bad, being good, trying to be certain things to certain people, it's a part of the human condition, we cannot all be perfection.

&amp;#x200B;

But I've always stood firm with being true to myself and respecting myself but in doing so, that has predominantly failed to fit in with others and relationships have been burned and some are still scarring me today.

&amp;#x200B;

Loving yourself is subjective, do you live yourself, can 90% of this group hand on heart, look in a mirror and say I'm wonderful and all I've ever done has been wonderful, I'd say you're delusional.

&amp;#x200B;

Failed, garbage and downright morons get married every day, they have well paid jobs, families all around and a successful life.

&amp;#x200B;

We can't just say to people to love themselves, pull up ya dukes and carry on, people may have done these things already a thousand times over, they probably still do these things, I just think people need to look at themselves first before giving life lessons to others."

Being happy is a state of mind, and I don't think people should settle for less than they deserve. I always look toward the next best thing. I like seeing other people happy. When someone else is down, it breaks my heart. I've been through more than most people my age, but hey, it's what has made me stronger. Life has thrown me challenges, and so far, I've come out on top. I realized who my real friends are, and that my family always comes first. I'm average, and that's okay. I'm not one of those guys that you turn your head toward when I walk down the street, and that's okay too. There is more to life than beauty on the outside. It's about what's on the inside. That's what really counts. I’m 22 and I wear a uniform for a living I’m 5ft 9 and I’m average build."
lonely,A downward spiral,"A downward spiral - (22/m btw) I think all of my problems started in high school when I started playing video games by myself. I would spend 10-11 hours a day playing video games, staying up until the early morning, not sleeping enough, and then I would go to school too tired to function. The classic depression mixture. This meant I couldn't really socialize very well (think literally falling asleep/ being sleepy all day) which meant i was poorly socialized going into college. The real problem was that I had no interests and nothing to bond with people over. I couldn't bond over gaming because I was so socially awkward that I thought people would make fun of me for liking video games. To this day I still don't use discord very much, even though there are rooms designed for things I like. I feel like an outsider looking in, like I'm barely a person anymore. Does anyone else feel this way?"
lonely,Didn’t realize,"Didn’t realize - Didn’t realize how lonely I was until I went to the beach on my own for this Memorial Day weekend and saw so many couples and girls that just wouldn’t give me a chance in general.

I did try using tinder to meet up with  local girls and got a handful of matches but the same thing that always happens happened. I’ll either never get a response back or they’ll respond a few times and then I’ll never hear from them again. Online dating has made it impossible for guys, because why should girls choose me when they have a thousand other guys to choose from.

Being homeschooled SUCKS. It sucks SO HARD. Everything, right now, sucks. I have. No friends. Is nobody around my age actually alive anywhere that isn’t caught up in school stuff?????? My household travels around so much that I won’t be able to go to college until I’m older, so there go those hopes, whimsically careening out the window!

The only friend I have is legitimately across the world from me and honestly? She’s hard to talk to a lot. We just don’t have the same values. On like, anything. My family is focused on their work and/or not at all interested in what I prefer talking about. Thank you, Mom, for telling me in intricate detail about how the world is falling apart. Only the best parents make sure their children don’t want to be in this world before they’re even out and exploring what it has to offer. Somewhere out there is a “#1” mug with her name on it.

I made the mistake of watching a vlog made by an animator I really admire (on YouTube, they make fluidly-animated memes) and it’s her and some friends messing around at a con. I never watch vlogs bUT I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ANIMATION.

It’s so painful sometimes realizing that I could probably have my very own group of artsy, character-writing goofballs to talk to, but I’m so inept in finding out where they’re hiding that I might actually die before meeting them. Of *old age.*

Anybody around here into writing??? Into making characters and drawing them or something? Into animation????? Character development? Maybe some roleplaying or writing together, something???? I like having artsy projects with folks. Can we be goofy??? Can I goof with someone? Can we like, make each other laugh and go through the Important Videos playlist together over Rabb.it or something????

Now, I *could* probably find some Discord server that has that kind of niche to it, but alas, I’m inept at everything and feel like I wouldn’t even be accepted. Hahahahahahahahahahaha

But when your last hug was almost a year ago, how can you say you\`re normal? I think of it as days pass by. Might it be that we\`re all not getting that wanted attention are just sick, and that\`s all? Kinda sad, don\`t you see? Not just getting your small dreams, but being sick because of it?"

lonely,I do not move on well,"I do not move on well - I was just dumped, for lack of a better word, by someone I had been seeing for about a month (no big deal) but talking to all day every day since the beginning of the year and having a very...mixed signal based relationship with him too. He acknowledges that part. 

Anyways, he called it off. And I just feel broken. I didn’t love the guy. But I felt a very strong connection with him in so many wonderful ways and I’m just really sad that it’s over and he’s already moved on (his FB no longer displays a big fat “single” on it and I’m having a meltdown)

I thought I was more over it than I am. And I don’t know how to shake this. I’m trying to focus on all the ways in which he would have been a bad partner for me. Many of which he’s already displayed.  I don’t know if I miss him because I miss him, if I miss him because I’m still trying to drown out the volume of the hurt I experienced from my last attempt at romance. or if I miss him because I’m really lonely. Maybe a combination of all of them. I don’t know.  My loneliness definitely does not benefit me in this department as I just get mentally obsessive and it makes the problem worse. 

Not sure what to do. I have a few good friends that are helping me through this but I really just want to cry on someone’s shoulder.  Got a good bear hug last night from the last person I dated and I swear he was trying to squeeze all the hurt out of me. For about ten seconds it worked.  Hopefully this passes soon because it’s draining. 

I’ve been sleeping alone nearly every night for the last 7 years and I just ache for some companionship."
lonely,So there is this girl...,"So there is this girl... - I met this girl. She is pretty broken like I was (long story). I met her through my friend. After that I started to snap with her and she's pretty awesome, great personality, great looks etc. 

Thing is, I could like basically cure all of her problems. If i were to start a friendship with her, or more, I could make her happy, I could make her enjoy life.

The problem is, I don't want to hurt her. As I said, she is already broken. That means if I were to fuck up once, I could ruin her life for ever or at least for a significant amount of time. If I don't fuck it up, I could make us both extremely happy, maybe even for the rest of our lives.

It would be a high risk high reward scenario.

I live and work in a small village on a mountain that's really isolated from everyone. There's no way to leave the mountain except by car and I don't drive.

I have a boyfriend but it's been long distance for over a year now. However, he's never excited to see me when I talk to him and all he tells me about is everything he's been doing which makes me feel more worthless. I don't really have any friends here and I'm never invited to social events. When I talk to people I think they probably find me annoying and they wish I would just go away. I really feel like if I just disappeared no one would even notice.

I'm no longer interested in any of my hobbies. I used to play a lot of games, draw, watch anime etc but now I just feel tired all the time and like I have no energy to do anything at all... I just really want a friend or someone to think that I'm important. I don't know what I should do."

I just got out of a relationship with a girl I dated for only six months, and we never had sex once, which obviously was an issue for me. After we broke up I hooked up with my other ex girlfriend after making it clear I wanna stay single, but admitting we still have feelings for each other, she already had really bad self esteem issues. And two days later I slept with another girl. She found out, and was hurt really bad, and it’s totally my fault. I don’t feel bad for  sleeping with the other girl, but I do feel bad knowing that my ex was already hurt from other experiences and I just made it worse. By the way I work with both of these girls, and I didn’t even think and or care what would happen because I’m a dumbass with a penis in between my legs. Anyway, my ex hates my guts, rightfully so, and everyone at work knows me as the manwhore. Meanwhile, post high school life is kinda lonesome because I don’t really have any friends. I have two really really good friends that are like my brothers, but they got their own stuff going on and can’t always be here with me. I go onto social media and all I see are the very people I went to school with, all partying and having a blast, everyone was there but me. I also live alone with my dad. I’ve never felt more lonely in my life, I enjoy being single and wish to remain single for a long time, but I still feel really isolated and sad. I go to bed feeling like a peice of shit.

But no, the only people of the opposite gender that happen to go out of their way to see me, say hi to me, talk with me regularly or just treat me with basic human kindness in general are always the ones I end up getting a crush on. 

Why can’t I not feel that way? Why do I always end up doing this? It’s not like it’ll ever happen. They deserve better than an angry, whiny, miserable, depressed dumbass who still lives with family, isn’t currently going to school, and doesn’t seem to be doing anything with his life. 

I don’t ever want to be put in a place where I might take my anger out on them by yelling at them or something. And I especially don’t want to bring them down with my misery. 

They’re usually good people and really nice and all that, but if they end up with me, they might get sick of me eventually. I don’t like thinking that, because sometimes I think: what if it’s not such a bad idea? What if we could make it work somehow? 

Well, no. I probably come across as too creepy anyway. They probably don’t even like me that much as a friend to begin with. And they’re probably already taken. That’s usually how it goes. 

I feel like people like that usually don’t like me that much, because of how much they eventually seem to drift away. That’s why I wish I never felt that way about them to begin with. I just end up feeling worse and going crazy, wondering what they think of me. God, I really wish I wasn’t like this."

lonely,Here we go...,"Here we go... - Hi all!!! I can’t help but feel like this is the perfect group for me. I’ve been single and sexless for 10 years this year. I haven’t even had so much as a hug. I’m so starved for female attention that even when I’ve been at work and girls touch my arm to get my attention or while talking to me, I get jumpy because I’m so used to not having any interactions with females. 


The things is, I kinda blocked myself off from even trying for a relationship or anything for awhile but even when I do have feelings for a girl, she either rejects me outright, says “let’s just be friends” or she’s taken (like recently) and there’s nothing I can do about it. I’m allowing myself to process all these negative emotions and feel the hurt and loneliness so I can try to move on and finally find what I really want most in life right now, which is a girlfriend. But, as pathetic as it may sound, this is one area of my life that I’ve always had an extreme amount of trouble with and it’s no where near easy for me to find one or even put myself in a position where finding one is even remotely possible.

For a long time I have placed so much importance on looks.  I always told myself, 'when you stop binge eating/reach your goal weight you will be beautiful.'  But now I am thirty I can see my face changing and I feel I have wasted all the years in which I could have been perceived as attractive.  I look at my face in the mirror and all I see is flaws.  I see how futile focussing on stuff like that is but by the same token there is SO MUCH pressure on women to measure up and it seems like if you're not beautiful in our culture you lack value.  

I kind of don't have the motivation to leave the house on the weekend anymore (I work full time).  I feel like everyone knows what a failure/loser I am, or I am just painfully invisible.  I used to go and read my book at the coffee shop (trying to read more for self-improvement) but I feel like even they think I'm a loser.  I just feel like my life is going absolutely nowhere.  In school I was considered smart and someone who would achieve something but now I feel utterly useless and invisible.  I honestly feel like life isn't worth living.

Someone to have cuddled with, to have shared life with. - *Had*, being the key word. It's too late for me now, and a girl in my life now would be closing the stable doors long after the horse has bolted, but it would have made so much difference to my mental well being when I was growing up if I had just one person who believed me. Someone to share affection with. To hold and to cherish and to talk to about life, love and the decaying world. I don't like to moan about how unfair the world is, but *it is* unfair that this is a part of life that was denied to me from birth. I have no one to hug me. Now it is too late, I'm too broken, too isolated, and I'm so bitter and angry that I'm incapable of now being a decent partner to anyone.

lonely,I'm attracted to emotionally and mentally unstable or disturbed lonely people like myself.,"I'm attracted to emotionally and mentally unstable or disturbed lonely people like myself. - Not just lonely in a social context but in their minds. Like that feeling that you're the only one who feels the way that you do because the people around you can't relate or talk about the things that effect you. Like they just don't have the capacity at times. (I know I sound like an asshole)

I'm attracted to these people because I feel like like other people haven't been through what I have and don't understand and won't take care of my fragility and loneliness. I'm sacred they'll think I'm weak and insecure. Where as a person who's been through emotional trauma will understand these things because we've been through similar experiences.

The funny thing is I'm scared to approach and talk deeply to people so I never get to find out who the emotionally and mentally unstable or ill (not in a psychotic way) are . So I never meet those people and therefore everyone comes off as being highly confident and we'll put together and it's like I'm this one cowering being in the middle of these people .

I feel that the one of them feels sorry for me and that’s why she still hangs out with me. The other one, I think he only wants to hang out with me because he’s bored. 

They both only remind me that I don’t really have anyone I matter to or that I can connect with in my life. It would be easier if they’d both just leave me alone and never talk to me again. At least then, I wouldn’t have to wonder if anyone actually wants to be around me or not and then there wouldn’t be anything to be sad over."

Ive put a lot of work into socializing and have developed a decent group of friends, we hangout several times a week, ect. I shouldn't feel lonely anymore, but I do. In fact the worst part of my day is when I go home at night because then I'm completely and utterally alone. 

I'm deeply religious yet don't really have a religious community(I'm working on it but distance is a problem). I struggle with behaviors that much of society doesn't see a problem with but at this point I think I'm probably an addict. Ive been going to 12 step meetings which is REALLY stressful since none of my close friends know. 

I get online to often, searching for someone to talk to, a friendly voice who is SOMEWHERE around my age who I can be real with about what I'm going through and who actually want to know me. Not just the top layer stuff, but someone who wants to know what I'm feeling. Honestly, i really want a girlfriend in my life, but I doubt its going to happen anytime soon. I try to talk to women online sometimes, to make friends. Its just nice to talk with a woman sometimes. THere is something different about it than talking with another guy. I don't know why. 

I wish I could find someone who is also christian to talk with, but anyone with an open mind and who isn't going to look at me with disgust would do. 


Day to day I pretend to be a happy person, but truth is I'm not a happy person. I have a lot of pain and emotions inside that I don't know how to express since I don't have anyone to express them to. I'm so damn tired."

lonely,One of those days. Need to vent a little.,"One of those days. Need to vent a little. - Hi, hello, good evening. Or morning, depending on where you are, dear stranger. How are you?

So, this is one of those days where I feel like crap for no discernible reason.

Theoretically, I should be fairly content with my life, and there are days when I absolutely am. I'm 31 as of yesterday, I finally have an apartment of my own, a stable job that might not pay amazing, but it's good enough. I've lost a ton of weight recently, about to reinvent my wardrobe and try to better myself by starting to look the part, too. I have a great family that helps out and supports me a lot.

But I can't help but feel disconnected. I've been single for a long time, it's been over two years since the person I thought then to be the love of my life left me. My mind can't help but wander back to her. She recently moved into my city and found a new partner, and at that point I unfriended her on Facebook because I decided I couldn't bear to look at it. It made me feel miserable. Even though I don't consider myself particularly ugly, I think of myself as somewhat intelligent (albeit maybe a bit on the boring side, as I'm more of the ""read a book, play a game, listen to some music"" type of person), I also have a significant streak of isolationist tendencies. This makes it stupidly difficult to find new people. 

My best friend has gotten married a while back, and we drifted apart as is often natural in such situations. He's a entreprenour now, married, thinking of kids. We've been very close friends for over ten years now, but I can't help but to think I can't relate to him anymore, the depth of the connection just isn't there anymore. We see each other quite rarely, and it's hardly ever him that initiates the contact.

So, amongst all the adventures in self-betterment, satisfaction from accomplishing my personal goals, which feels great... there's an emptiness I can't fill. I'm working out my self-esteem problems, slowly but surely, try to find new things to like myself for every day, and sometimes even succeed. I'm good at my job, which I enjoy. But it just all feels meaningless today, feels like depression is creeping it's way back bit by bit. I've sent a friend request to my ex again, fully expecting it not to get stuck in limbo, never accepted. Which is probably for the best, as I wouldn't even know what to do with it if it did. I have friends who keep telling me how great of a person I am, but it all feels so fucking hollow and meaningless when you're still stuck being in the same spot for so long.

That's it, that's all. If you got through this somewhat incoherent rant, I'm impressed. And thank you, dear stranger. Wish you all the best."
lonely,Feeling down and don't know what to do,"Feeling down and don't know what to do - I'm 15. I've been feeling down lately. I don't know how to explain this but lately I've been feeling that I'm just a burden and nobody really cares what is going on in my life or how am I feeling.

I have friends but I don't feel perfectly comfortable hanging out with them. They say all those mean things to me with or without knowing they hurt me. I often cry myself to sleep because of that. They don't seem to care am I around or they don't even notice me.

Even at home I seem to do nothing right. Whatever I do, someone gets mad. That's why I prefer stay in my room so I can't be in the way. I get anxious pretty easily and I'm really sensitive.

I feel like I mean nothing to other people even tho I really care about them. I'm often thinking what's wrong with me and what am I doing wrong. I even selfharmed myself for the first time last night but it didn't help.

I still enjoy things I love and I don't feel down all the time but pretty often I do. What should I do?

Thank you."

All I've ever wanted was a group of friends but since the break up all I been trying to focus on is being happy with myself. I get home to find a letter for someone wanting to take me to court for thousands of pounds for a car accident I didnt cause and also feeling like I have no one.

lonely,20 yo. So goddamned lonely it hurts.,"20 yo. So goddamned lonely it hurts. - Hello people! This is my first post here, and I'm unsure how good I am at writing something cohesive or good.  
I just feel so lonely, I have all my life. I've lived in foster care since I was 3. Lived in 4 different families, the one I live in now is the only good one, I've been abused at all others, including by my parents. Both physically and mentally. When I see people being happy with their parents I wonder what it feels to love your parents, or to be loved by them. The last thing my mom said to me was ""Every day, I regret not aborting you"" It still stucks with me. I don't have any close friends, no one I feel like I can open up to talk to. I have chronic depression and anxiety, some days are better than others, but these last few days have been pretty bad, I've had many suicidal thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty shy in person, and awkward. Online is the only place where I feel comfortable enough to truly be myself. So to combat the lonliness I have talked ALOT with people online, I have found some girls I have clicked with, but no one in the same country I live in, Sweden. Almost all of these girls have always told me that I am very sweet, caring, funny, cute, smart, and respectful. And I try to be those things, I've always cared way too much about others, I am very compassionate and kind. People seem to open up to me easily, but I've never felt a closer connection to anyone, I have never felt loved by anyone. I just feel desperate for closeness. hugs, cuddles, kisses, whatever. Just as long as I can somehow replace this cold and empty feeling in my chest with some warmness.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have many interests, I mostly sit inside all day, playing video games, listening to music, reading, writing. Or lay in bed. I don't know how to become better, and try to move out of my shell. I have alot of problems, and someone with this much baggage is not attractive for many people."

My partner was my best friend and now I have no one. I feel like I'm going to die alone. I'm never going to find someone again. It was a miracle I found him in the first place. There just aren't many dark haired, beard, rock, tattoo, vegan/vegetarian guys out there so I really stand no chance. I'm going to have to settle for someone I don't love just to not be alone and I couldn't do that.

lonely,"17 yo, spend my days indoors and I'm sick of it","17 yo, spend my days indoors and I'm sick of it - Hello guys. First post here. This might not be as serious and sad as some of the stories told in here, but it's still bugging me. I'm mad at myself.

So basically I'm this 17 year old teen, and I spend my days indoors just watching TV, playing video games and reading. That's about it. I'm that introverted guy who likes to be at home. Meanwhile everyone I follow on Instagram or whatever seems to always be outdoors doing something interesting with their friends. Of course I thought about getting other hobbies but I suck at sports and the hobbies that I want to actually do, no one wants to/can't do them with me. For example I invited a bunch of friends for bike riding and none of them even has a bicycle. I'm also not one of those guys who likes to drink, smoke or party or whatever, but I see everyone doing it whatsoever.

I currently don't have a passion for anything else besides what I do. (Games, reading, etc) Well, maybe photography and cars but I'm not even old enough to get a licence where I live. But I'm sick of it, I want to go outside and try different stuff. The summer is coming and I really wanted to find an hobby but none of my friends seems to want to do anything. (My friends are also nerdy). No one wants to group study.. The other people who could do that sort of stuff with me don't even talk to me because I'm introverted and kind of socially awkward. I don't know how to do small talk.

I love photography but doing that alone sucks... I was thinking about Horse Riding in the summer but I don't know.. If you're still reading this, thank you. Give me your opinion."

i feel so lonely and out of place everywhere i go. when i visit my boyfriend at uni, he’s got this whole other life and all these friends, and i feel pathetic and lonely and like i shouldn’t be here. 

i live in a seaside “retirement” town so there’s not much on. i’ve looked online for club type things, but there’s nothing that isn’t like “zumba for over 50s”. 

i also have a job, but it requires me to work alone, so no friend making there either. and i have a few people i talk to online, but they’re all in different countries. 

it’s just making my mental health so much worse. every day feels wrong and off balance. i came close to killing myself the other week. i have sought help etc but no amount of meds or anything will change the basic fact that i have no friends?????

What I hate about life is that finding the 'real ones' those friends you trust till the end of your dying days seems even harder. I'm 24 now, and looking at my life and what I've got going on? I can honestly say that I only have one hand that use to count some halfway decent people on. I feel like I'm going to lose them all one day, and have nobody. That's why I'm so scared. 

I've lost faith in humanity. I've had my trust battered - my sanity tested - I've been used, and abused. Thrown away to the point of no return.

Finding good people out of those billions in the world feels like hitting the lottery. 

Where are the friends that I'm missing out on? Do I need to learn 'how to friend' again?

If you're somehow able to be happy being alone, then good for you, but I don't think I can do that. For me life just isn't really worth living without that.

I went on my first date ever last week, and it was pretty awkward but I thought it went okay. However, the next day she told me that she wasn't ready for a relationship, so we mutually decided to stop talking. I then (surprisingly quickly for me) found a new girl on tinder and got her to agree to a date, but she later cancelled it after she found out about a political issue that we strongly disagree on. I've just kinda been wallowing at home since then, without anyone to talk to. I had a falling out with my best friend a few months ago and haven't really talked to anyone outside of quick conversations on dating apps. At this point I just kinda want somebody to talk but I'm not sure how. My priorities have mainly been on dating lately, but since that's gotten me nowhere I just want to chat with literally anyone. I still REALLY want to date someone, but a close yet platonic connection would also be okay I guess.

lonely,i need advice :/,"i need advice :/ - my grandmother died about 6 months ago but her and my grandfather are the only family ive ever had in my life. aunts and uncles didnt like them/talk to them for 10 years. they were assholes my whole life and even put me down and called me names when i was a child. mother is the same, obviously, since she left me to my grandparents who begged her not to abort me. anyways since then my grandfather tells me he wants to die and i fear he will kill himself. he is such an asshole though that he didnt even tell me the day my grandmother died so we arent on great terms---oh and my ""family"" had me banned from the nursing facility i put my grandmother into ..by police..2 days before she died because i was ""making my grandfather yell"" aka everytime i would come into the room he was FORCE feeding her and i could see she was choking (she could barely barely talk and had issues swallowing she had very bad cancer) i think i now have ptsd from it. fast forward to the present. i took on a pt second job to try to get my mind off of things because i was crying 24/7 and bothering my boyfriend who really told me that since he only took 2 months to get over his grandfather dying that i should not have this problem. my boyfriend and i talked about breaking up the other day after 8 years of dating (never marrying which also makes me sad) im losing hope. i cant make friends anywhere it seems. i think im a pretty self centered person i was always the apple of my grandfathers eye growing up..so i thought that was the norm. my grandparents wouldnt let me hang out with 99.999% of kids when i was growing up so i never gained much social skills. i work as a loan officer right now and am so tired of the job since i have hit a brick wall with nowhere to go within the company that i am downright rude to customers(also because i am exhausted emotionally and physically)---the customers i get like 90% of them have no money, give me a sob story--when in reality they just do stupid things with their money, know they have bad credit and want to apply for a loan. i spend 30 mins with them , some of them yelling at me the whole time...to decline them. regulations do not let me tell them its not the smartest idea to apply for a loan(i get it) ANYWAYS, point is i hate my job. i have some coworkers i talk to--at work. even a few who have asked me to hang out but i just dont have anything in common with them so i decline politely. everyday i feel im getting closer and closer to killing myself. good news i guess is..i am a coward so i will probably never go through with it because im a. afraid and b. believe i would possibly go to hell.

im a hot mess woman no less.. whos going on 29...no kids(which breaks my god damn heart)

&amp;#x200B;

id take any advice because i cant afford a counselor because i have debt that i need to pay off, mostly because i had to help my grandparents with cancer treatment and basic living needs because no one else in my family would even talk to them except for my estranged mother--who wouldnt help them. 

i have a lot more serious issues that have happened to me within the last couple of years but im exhausted even typing this. i dont feel like anyone will care to read this whole thing anyways since its all about me and honestly...who the fuck cares about me?

\--wishing i didnt feel sorry for myself but thats all i ever do lately. feel like im in a living hell.

lonely,Allot on My Mind,"Allot on My Mind - Hey guys. Just having a bit of a rough night and I have allot on my mind and finding it really hard to love myself tonight.

Was supposed to go out for drinks tonight but everyone cancelled last minute on me and a few people stopped responding to me entirely.

My ex who I broke up with recently was friends with everyone I knew and I don't think they wanna affiliate with me after she broke it off so i'm probably gonna stay in tonight. Bit of a bummer because I was planning to go out for a while but yeah. I wanna say I got something positive out of my last relationship but i'm pretty sure I learned nothing good from it at all. 

We where together for 4 months and she moved in with me for a month or so and basically lived at mine. I would look after her constant anxiety, depression, I never could open up about my own anxiety because she would shut me down every time and I didn't want to piss her off. I thought that her anger was just temporary or she was just having a bad day or bad few weeks. Still I would cook for her daily, buy her allot of gifts, do her laundry. I gave all of myself and helped her out anyway I could. I gave her everything. And in the end she broke it off with me and never gave me a real reason why. I feel used in many ways.

The day before we where literally talking about travelling and how to move our stuff into our new place and the day after she just completely switched when she woke up and started to treat me like a stranger. We met up a few days after we broke up so that she could give me my clothes back and we where talking fine, really enjoying each others company and we where going to go and see a show together. She mentioned she was going through allot of things internally and that's why she treated me like a stranger out the blue but I feel like I never got the real reason why. A day later after we met up, out of nowhere she blocked me on all social media and wouldn't reply to me on Facebook. 

I also found her on tinder tonight. When i was in a relationship with her I had to literally argue with her to get her to delete tinder and to stop going on dates with other guys while she was with me so yeah that sucks too. 

Worst thing is she was the one that started to call me her boyfriend there would be loads of nights where she would get pissed at me and not talk to me for the whole night just because of the idea that I got with someone. Like just make it up in her own head and just fall asleep in my bed pissed and not talk to me and be aggressive. 

The feeling of being a stranger in your own bed is fucking terrible. But I stuck with her because i believe in sheer loyalty and making things work. It's crazy how you can do so much for someone and they they can turn completely cold to you and treat you like a stranger our of nowhere. Like that shit hurts allot.  

I so dearly want to meet new people but every time I get hurt like this it pushes me more internally and I've been pushed so far inside for so many years that I don't know where to go anymore.  I really want to do better and meet others but its so hard when I've been hurt so many times. 

I try my best everyday with no one besides me but it gets hard at times. I know that one day ill meet a girl that really does appreciate me and that when I give all of myself to her, she'll will be worth it and, I look forward to that day. 

I just wanna work on myself and go to gym and find a good second job and focus on myself. I know that what I experienced wasn't love. Because someone who loves you wouldn't treat you like that. 

I bought myself flowers today. I cant wait for the day that I get to buy flowers for a girl and it'll mean something."
lonely,just pissed.,"just pissed. -      Hello, Reddit. I'm , and I'm new to this sub and just Reddit in general. I have a foreign country trip to South America with my history class, and it's for two weeks. The people that I'm going with are terrible and insufferable. They've made it their job to exclude me, among other people at my school.
     But they've done it quietly and subtly, so no one would notice their corrupt actions. I feel shunned and lonely, especially when I see them laughing and talking together. My 16th birthday is on that trip, and it angers me. The trip ends early enough where, if I had friends, I could have had the sweet 16 party I'd always dreamed of. But instead, I'm alone. It feels bad, seeing other girls invite their friends to their sweet 16 parties and going out. 
     My mother is sweet and is wanting to buy me a large cake for my ""party"", and she wants me to go on a date, but I know that nothing is going to turn out the way either of us had planned. I'll be doing an internship this summer where there are no people anywhere near my age involved. I couldn't go on a date or make friends if I wanted to. You are supposed to be considered as coming into your own and maturing when you are 16, but I don't feel developed at all. I'm supposed to be more evolved than this.
     I know I sound incredibly bratty, hormonal, and immature right now, but this situation frustrates and disappoints me immensely. Why can't I just be a normal teenage girl (and please don't tell me to just be patient. I've heard it all before.)?"

lonely,Emotional,Emotional - I’ve been so emotional and lonely.  And the person who I want to show me effection and love and comfort and just be for me. Barely does anything to show his love.  But gives me sideways glances. And rolls away from me and I try lay next to him...... I just really need a hug and to cry into a chest and just.  Feel like I’m not alone. I just wanna feel cared for .....
lonely,Being ghost zoned,"Being ghost zoned - So yeah.......... this sucks

&amp;#x200B;

I have this friend who we will call A, and she was a very close friend!

We met in a very odd way to be honest and I don't know how it blossomed into one of the best friendships I ever had the pleasure of being a part of!

We played funny and stupid games, video chatted, showed each other our artwork and opened up to each other more than we did to our own families, so I knew her pretty well, she was like a sister to me, one I wanted to care for and help when she needed it

&amp;#x200B;

Thing we're going good...... until one day I tried to message her on discord and...... it didn't go through, I tried again, nothing, eventually I hit me....... I was being ghost zoned, or at least that's how it felt

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've been ghost zoned before, by my own cousin no less, and it was not a pleasant experience, feeling alone, abandoned, left with your own insecurities, and seeing those you considered friends or family, walk past you without a glance or saying a word like ""how are you?"" or ""you okay?"" or anything!

&amp;#x200B;

So when I put the pieces together the best way I could without any clues, I was crushed, is she finally fed up with me, are her family members behind this? I don't know

&amp;#x200B;

She messaged me sometime later and said I would ""get answers"" but all I got was a cliched remark ""I have a lot or work"" and a concerning ""I shouldn't be talking to you right now"" they were vague at best and kinda half assed at worse

&amp;#x200B;

All I want to do is talk to get SOME closure so I can sleep well knowing what happened to my friend but I have yet to break the ice properly

&amp;#x200B;

A, if you read this, which I doubt you will, please........ I just wanna talk, no weird shit, no bullshit, no holding back, from one someone who cares..... please....... can we talk?"
lonely,On this day last year was the best birthday and best day I ever had. Today I'm completely alone.,"On this day last year was the best birthday and best day I ever had. Today I'm completely alone. - Last year on my 24th birthday my girlfriend of 5 years surprised me with an amazing gift for my birthday. It was basically a 6 hour joy ride in 5 different supercars and an expensive lunch at a nice restaurant. She later surprised me again with fantastic donuts instead of a cake (which I was very happy with) and I spent the rest of the evening that day chilling in her family pool and sleeping over. It was easily the best day I've ever had.

Today is very different. She broke up with me on valentines day to be with my now ex-best friend of 20 years. 2 weeks after the break up they moved in together and I've subsequently have been left behind by the 2 most important people outside of my direct family. So now, I'm single, friendless, and have never felt more alone."

Introverted nerdy type. Seemed great. Went on a few dates, made out a few times, talked every single day. Would get good morning texts. All felt great. She seemed like a total sweetheart.

Wished her good luck on a presentation see had one day. I got a ""thanks, have a good day"". Sent her a few texts after that, and never got a reply. 

It's been days now. Sent her a text the next day, too: nothin. I'm slowly realizing that she most likely just found someone and replaced me without even giving me a hint. Like what the fuck. I can understand if it's one date, and haven't talked much. When you've been talking every day for almost a month, though? Fuck, man."

They will never understand the pain because they never felt it. It hurts deep inside. Going home and you don’t have anyone to share your feelings with. So you bury them and it explodes someday and no one will be there. It’s a privilege to be loved and unfortunately I’m not lucky. If there were another life to exist I’ll ask for love more than anything else.

lonely,Loner rant,"Loner rant - I have been a loner for a long time time now. I do not have any friends I can call my own. Relationships are just even out of imagination rn. And there's really no one that cares about my existence.

This has pretty much been the same way even from school days. I was that person who sat out in a corner thinking into oblivion and someone who creeped a lot of people around. I guess the reason for this was that I was a huge person and still am thanks to my obesity that I got as a gift for my birth. My obesity made people think I was a huge object that they could kick around as they want and treat me like a piece of crap every chance they got. Every time I tried to stand for myself I got beaten down harder and this finally make me realize shutting up and listening to all they have to offer was the best way to go. All this never helped me build a character out of myself and that really was a bummer as I grew up. I eventually got pushed away from the center and thus started the battle of loneliness. 

Every change I got at meeting new people, I get paranoid and end up creeping them up and shooing them away. This really doesnt help me all the nothingness in life. 

I have been this way for a long time and there was a phase where I literally weeped myself to sleep every night and hoping things get better for me. I always hoped one day I was going of wake up it would all be okay. And this really is never the case and so was not with me either. But lately I been used to this vast nothingness and have learnt to live the way I am living and yet be relatively okay with it. I pretty much do everything around by myself and have don't even have interactions with people for many days together. 

But there are times I still feel really sad for all the things I'm missing out. I feel sad for all the love that I have to offer for others. I feel sad when I think of something wonderful and have no one around to share it with. I feel really sad when my fav band is in town and have no one to go with to see them live. I feel sad when I plan out amazing trips and have to cancel them out cause I hate the feeling when I get sick of myself thanks to this void. I feel sad when I'm really craving for some a hug and there's no one I can stretch my arms out for. I feel really sad when it has been a really long day and there's no one around I can talk about it to. I feel really sad when there's no one to tell me that things are going to okay when I really belive otherwise. 

I really want this nothingness in life to end and along with it the loneliness to end as well before I decide to put an end to my existence."
lonely,Why do I have to be like this?,"Why do I have to be like this? - I’m not ugly or anti social, I always seem to have no one stay in contact with me in terms of being friends. I also have no girlfriend and most likely never will. I know that some like the looks of me, but deep down inside I feel like I don’t deserve them or anyone. I also have a thing inside me that waits until a girl lets me know fir a fact that she likes me before I try anything. Wish I wasn’t like this and it’s bs to tell me to have confidence or talk to girls, that’s not the issue. Just never having a relationship, a simple hug, or a person to lean on has made me what I am. I hate it"

Look, summer literally just started and I’m gonna be a senior this fall in high school. I’m decently known, I have people I’ll talk to in school and those few close friends that are there occasionally outside of school. At home it’s just my mom and I, no biological father, and domestic disputes that put an end to a step father. My mom works all the time, obviously to pay the bill and such, but no matter what goes on around me at my core I feel barren and alone. Those friends I mentioned that I’ll occasionally see outside of school always ditch out in the summer, literally all last summer I spent 3 and a half months in my house and didn’t talk or text a single soul and nobody ever checked on me and I fell into a depression. I got out of it by working out and I’ll keep at it to prevent it from happening again, but that doesn’t solve the loneliness. The walls I’ve put up and the measures ive made to protect myself from any outside emotional harm has backfired. I can’t bring myself to establish any serious relationship with a female I like, the mere thought of a relationship freaks me out, and no friend, family member or otherwise, i feel, understands who I am or how I work. As I’m laying in bed my chest literally feels empty, and outta everything I’ve been through with my step father, or anything else makes me feel this bad and I’m not socially skilled enough to break down these barriers and open up to anyone. I just feel my life will be nothing but this, academically and career wise decent and fairly successful, but nothing to come home to, nothing to look forward to....just emptiness

But at 17 at least I have around 60+ years to figure it out, right....."

It really sucks that upon waking up I felt this loneliness creep back on me. It’s such a shitty feeling. I think Im going to see Detective Pikachu tonight, alone. It will give me something to do.

For a moment you lost your breath
And everybody is leaving you once again
Nothing's real when the diamonds turn to stone
Call me, let me be the one
That makes you forget the shades in your cold room
We are on the edge together, and that feels right

Go ahead, cry
I know you feel it too
‘Cause some things last forever
Some things last forever
Go ahead, cry, I know you need it too
If no one loves you better
I will be waiting here for you

Go ahead, cry
I know you feel it too
‘Cause some things last forever
Some things last forever
Go ahead, cry, I know you need it too
If no one loves you better
I will be waiting here for you

Breath out
Tell me anything you want
They don’t need you but I'd give
My body and my heart

lonely,I feel so broken,"I feel so broken - I’m going through so much right now and I just wish I could talk about it with someone. I’m always the one to listen to other people issues but I don’t have anyone in my corner. Is it so bad to just want to be loved? I’m sick of praying for a guy to love me and it never happening. No matter how hard I try to kid myself, I’m not worth it. I don’t deserve the love I desire"
lonely,The little things in life I don't get to share with anyone,"The little things in life I don't get to share with anyone - Being single and living alone doesn't bother me per se, but I have never really had any close friends that I felt like I could fully rely on or trust with the things that really weigh on my heart and mind. I know that's something I need to work on in trusting people but it's been one setback after another and I just feel stagnant like I've stopped progressing.
Obviously I don't *need* to get married and have a SO to be happy, but it hit me hard today as I was filling out medical forms and realized I have no one I really want as an emergency contact. My relationship with my parents is very rocky and I don't involve them in my life as much as possible, and I don't know if any of my friends really care enough or consider us close enough to really want something like that placed on them. I have no one. It's hard to watch all my friends in their generally happy/healthy families and go on to get married and start their own family. I tried explaining it to a married friend at one point, but I don't think she understood it. At the end of the day she gets to go home to her husband knowing that there's a kind of trust and intimacy between them that whatever outside crap is going on they can work on it together and offer one another support and solutions. Ultimately I'm just alone. No one is really invested in any significant way in my success or failure. I feel like I just exist on the periphery of everyone's sympathy."

lonely,I Feel So Lonesome That I Could Cry,"I Feel So Lonesome That I Could Cry - I'm just laying in bed, it being ten minutes from midnight, listening to ""Busted and Blue"" by Gorillaz (which I have an emotional attachment to), and I'm in the feels. I feel so lonesome. So sad. I wish I had somebody to cuddle with at night. Somebody who loved me for my flaws and the good parts of me, though there aren't many good parts. Somebody who was proud of the music and literary stuff I create. Somebody who appreciated me. Somebody who liked a lot of the stuff that I did. Somebody who wants to willingly spend a ton of time with me. I feel as though this person, this mysterious figure that most say we all have out there somewhere, is simply a part of my life that I shall never experience. I feel as though I wouldn't deserve to be loved. Yet, I yearn for it so much. Perhaps there is, or are many things, wrong with me that prevent myself from being lovable. Maybe it is simply the passing of time that must take place. Perhaps it's the fact that I haven't looked in the right places, or that I haven't done the right things. Maybe it's none of those things, and I'm merely speculating on something that isn't even meant to be. I don't know. However, what I do know is, I'm really damn lonely, and it gets worse every day. I hope that person, if they're out there, meets me one day and vice versa. I'm not sure that I could continue on with life in this lonesome state for very long. Yes, I've gotten this fat, but it's only getting more and more difficult, and upon my graduation in about a year, it'll reach heights of difficulty that I never could prepare myself for. My best and only friend is going into the Airforce for upwards of ten years, so I'll truly be alone and directionless. I'm so scared. I'm so depressed. I'm so lonely."

Need wisdom and advice. - Anybody of the older generation that has been single for all their life? No significant others, no casual dating, just isolation. How do you go on day by day?

I just reached 27, and im afraid im going to end up like that. I havent had a real girlfriend. My friends are making adult progression, buying houses, having children, getting settled in their careers, and soon theyll be gone if they are not already. And then theirs me.

I am good at making new friends. I’m charismatic, I think I’m pretty funny, even good looking from time to time.

And yet I feel lonely all the time. 

It’s especially frustrating that I sometimes feel like I have no meaningful relationships when I am not in a romantic one. I don’t mean to disregard my friendships, I love them all with the bottom of my heart but as we’re getting older I’m starting to understand them less and even grow a part."

I wish I had at least one bff that we stick together no matter what. I wish I could make friends. This summer, I know I’ll be alone like always.

lonely,An ode to loneliness:,"An ode to loneliness: - You are constant companion.

You are an entity I crave, create, and loathe; yet it is to you I fear I am ultimately bound. 

Even when surrounded by love, you are what feels closest to making and destroying me. Your lithe fingers caressing up the sides of my being so that you’re ever-present, reminding me of your power. 

You bring me peace, anger, safety, predictability, sadness, and fear. 

Are you my devil? Will you be my destruction? Or will I lift this veil and tell you to fuck off?"
lonely,And it's worse every year,"And it's worse every year - I'll be 20 this year, and that scares me for plenty of reasons. But mainly because when it comes to relationships I'm probably at the point a regular 13 year old should be at. 

I've never been in a relationship. Never kissed anyone. Obviously never had sex. I don't even think I've held anyone's hand. I don't think I've ever been flirted with, not once. 

I've always had friends, I have them now. Friends who are in relationships, friends who have had relationships. Then there's me. I'm not ugly, I'm not some terrible person, I can be funny, but for some reason, I'm never what anyone's ever looking for. 

I'm not a romantic. I don't flirt or put myself out there because I never learned how to. As a lesbian, I never got to have those experiences growing up. And now I'm lost? I don't even know how to act any other way than platonically. 

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like with every passing year the gap between me and everyone else only grows wider, and ever more unbreachable. Who wants to date an emotionally stilted person?

lonely,Looks can be deceiving,"Looks can be deceiving - Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

First time poster on this sub. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little information on me: 

\-I'm 24 years old 

\-I live in Montreal, Canada

\-I have been with my current girlfriend for almost 8 years and living together for 1.

&amp;#x200B;

So with that out of the way here is my story: I have been considered by people that know me as fairly attractive and have never had issues getting a girl or friends. As I have a well paying job for my age, I was able to dress myself well and buy myself a fairly luxurious car. For people looking from the outside it would seem that my life is amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

Wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

About two years ago I started developping severe anxiety attacks as well as depresion for reasons I do not want to get into in this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Slowly but surely my so called 'friends' started talking to me less and less until they completely dropped me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt so betrayed because of this that I developped this sort of shield around myself to not be hurt by this which makes me seem cold around people which has hurt any potential new friendships I could develop. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the year and a half since then I have gone from being Mr. Popular to basically being a nobody with maybe 5 friends. Since my remaining friends have very different schedules it is hard to try and see them. If it wasen't for my girlfriend I honestly do not know what I would do..."

My young looks are only going to last so long because if they start fading away then I will end it all. I grew up lonely with no one in my life except for a family that I'm an outcast from. I don't even feel like I belong with them. I don't care how many times people are going to tell me that I have my whole life ahead of me, fuck you. I'm tired of being alone to the point where I'm so depressed. I'm going to kill myself hopefully before I turn 20 this year. Death is in a dark room. Her long white dress mesmerized me, and now I was standing face to face with this beautiful lady with hair that's almost black because it's so dark covering over half of her left eye.

The problem being is I feel like people keep leaving me and I'm freaking out. So I started getting close to one, and I wanted to ask her out. The problem being she hangs out with me when I have booze and smokes, and otherwise I have to be hanging out with her sister. Don't get me wrong, her sisters awesome but I can't help but feel like that's it as to why she hangs out with me 

And once moreover, her interest in me has completely disappeared, and now they're both ignoring me. Things might not be that bad and all but seeing as I've been sober all day and all yesterday. Some advice would be much appreciated. If not have a great day."

My mom is toxic, she always been. I love her but she really hurts me on an emotional level. My home life is very bad since childhood.

School didnt help too. Lots of bullying.

4 years of friendships through high school.
Girls who i thought were my friends ghosted me 2 years ago. Asked what i did wrong, no answer. Everything was perfect. I dont know why they ghosted me. They are still together. Im not part of their group anymore.

I tried to find new friends by attending an art course. Tried to talk to some people there but our conversations were very short. I felt it was forced, like, out of pity. And no matter how many times i gave my number to be added to the class group, (the group was already created without me, everybody was in it, and nobody asked me my number) they didnt add me. Didnt talk to me. Didnt even look at me. It was like i wasnt there. I stopped going after that. No one called.

I had a boyfriend. I broke up with him last night. We were dating for 2 years. I thought i found my soulmate. He was very nice from the start but as time went on, he changed. Im thankful tho, he was the only person who stuck with me and made me happy at times. Without him I wouldve killed myself. I still love him but its not the same anymore, and it hurts. You are not suppossed to feel lonely when you have a bf/gf, right? 

Now i dont know what to do. I dont have anyone, not even myself. Im very lonely and its making me very depressed and suicidal. I adopted a kitten couple of days ago, to prevent me from killing myself. Now im not living alone in my room.

I just want someone who cares. I want to leave this room. I want to have a social life. 

I learned that I have cancer, too. My bf couldnt even spend his 1 minute away from *studying* to ask me what happened. If i were him, I would be concerned, but oh well, he would spend his time playing overwatch to feel less lonely instead of talking to me anyway.

I hope everybody has, or will have, one person in their life who truly cares about them.

lonely,What do some of you do for your birthday so that it feels “special” or “happy” when there are no friends around to keep you company or acknowledge it?,"What do some of you do for your birthday so that it feels “special” or “happy” when there are no friends around to keep you company or acknowledge it? - I’m turning 21 in a week and seriously dreading it. My birthdays make me really sad because I’ve got some crazy idea that it’s supposed to be the one day a year where people will acknowledge you, make you feel like you matter, want to spend time with you so that you feel happy. It’s never the case for me and as much as I always brace myself for the inevitable, it still sucks. None of my ‘friends’ really care much about me or ever want to try to spend time with me and at most I’ll get some little “happy birthday” gifs from a couple of people who checked social media and got sent a reminder. 

So I’m looking for ideas of how to occupy myself for the day to try and make it less awful. Do some special things for me. Right now, all I’ve got is that I’m going to buy myself a cake to eat since it’s been a long time since I’ve had one. From there I don’t know what to do. I don’t have a real “home” and I don’t want to spend the day alone in my parents’ basement like I do every other day. And where I live there’s basically nothing to do, even less options that let me bring my dog with me, which is the most important thing to have him with me the whole time. If the weather is bad (80% chance I’m guessing it will be) I can’t just take him to a park so I need a backup plan. 

Sorry for ranting... it’s kind of a bad time of the year for me overall lol. I’d love to know how some other people without friends for celebration were able to make their day special :)"

lonely,It is ironic how your family can be the one alienating you,"It is ironic how your family can be the one alienating you - So, I honestly don't know if I am posting in the right subreddit, but my justification has lead me to believe that this involves loneliness, so why not?

As a background, until I was 13 years old, I was relatively fine with my relationships in the family, meaning that I interact with them the normal way.

It all started when I was in high school. Since my high school was very far from home, then that means that I had to stay in a dormitory for my high school life. So, that means that communication with my family was more limited, but this does not mean that there is no communication at all.

At that time, the whole family would ask me how I am doing and everything, but things got worse when I reached Grade 9. When I try to jokingly tease my siblings about stuff, they would always say that I am a ""piss off"" and such. I would also think the same of my father who would make a lot of prejudicial side comments about stuff that I do not really care about.

For instance, when I said that I had a roommate who had a prom date, he said that he was surprised because he did not expect someone from the province to have one.

This honestly hurted me, because that was just a very good example of prejudice. I mean, just because someone is from the province does not ruin his/her chance of getting a prom date, right?

So, I had to try to get this idea to the head of my father, which did not work out really well. He also called me ""disrespectful"" in the process, which was really offensive in my side since that implied that he was treating me as an inferior, which leads me to the next point.

There are so many instances when my parents would demand respect just because they were my parents. To be honest, I do not see respect the same way. For me, respect is gained, not demanded. So, of course I will not just simply give in to what they think about things. I will always have to defend the objective, as an equally human being.

This meant that when I see that I am being treated unfairly, then that would mean that I will have to defend my side until the last of my voice. But unfortunately, these biological parents of mine just think that I am disrespectful, thus inferior.

The problem does not only root from my parents. My siblings are also alienating me. To be honest, my siblings are the major cause of this alienation of mine.

Remember when I said that I argue with my parents? There are times when my sister will butt in and say that I am the one who is in the wrong side, even if I know for sure that I have no bad intentions. Then that would mean that I have to defend myself from my sister too, which is just too much for me. And as expected, until now, things have not worked out with her.

For my brother, it is really hard to talk to him. This is because when you try to do talk to him, he will throw a tantrum almost immediately. When I try to have fun with him, he will throw another tantrum. It is like whenever I act that involves him, he will always throw a tantrum. It is just so annoying, honestly.

I would also point out where my family goes wrong. What I am pointing out is how they would act unprofessionally towards other people, and raise their voice all the time. So, when I tell them about this, they will always say that they are not doing such a thing, or they will make up bullshit to defend themselves. Or even curse out of nowhere.

In the end, I feel lonely whenever I'm with my family. Besides the fact that I barely interact with them now, when I do, it always does not end well for anyone.

Someone just adopt me please."

All I have ever wanted was to have someone to hold near, someone I could support and be supported by, a love interest, someone to hold my hand in theirs. A person to whom I could say “I love you” to and hear it back in the most sincere and calming way possible. 
I’ve been lonely most of my life, though not for lack of trying, I guess it’s just what I get for being an unapologetic introvert... but you see: I love myself! I love my introverted nature, my words and my feelings, I love it all. I guess all I wanted was that someone else did as well."

lonely,Loneliness,"Loneliness - As much as being lonely sucks, or being sad sucks, it's a reminder that you're human. In a way I kind of appreciate this feeling right now. If I try to  numb it out with weed or anything else I just become numb afterwards. Sometimes it's good to just feel what you feel and do nothing else. Sometimes that's all you can do, but I think its beneficial. Sometimes having feelings can lead you to solve an issue or even come to a realization. I wish you all good luck, this post is just my thoughts so take it with a grain of salt."

I’m not asking for much, only a friend, nothing romantic, nothing like that, and nothing less than friends, no just talk today and ghost me forever thing, I’m looking for someone who will just take the time to get to know me and be my friend. 

A little about me - I’m Male, I’m 19 and I’m from England. Listing my hobbies and interests is boring but I’m going to do it anyway. I’m currently studying history at college, I’m a long bow archer, I love books and video games and classical music. I’m a devout Catholic, I converted last year and it has been the best decision of my life. I would love to talk with someone who has similar interests and beliefs as me, but if not that’s absolutely fine, I love getting to know people regardless of their opinions on things. I really am just looking for someone who knows how I feel right now, loneliness is just absolutely terrible, it’s a silent killer, and I really can’t handle being alone anymore, I am currently seeking professional help but I need friends, that’s what I desperately need."

lonely,"31[M] I'm mildly autistic, a recovering alcoholic and no matter how much I try I always seem to just drive people away.","31[M] I'm mildly autistic, a recovering alcoholic and no matter how much I try I always seem to just drive people away. - I am NOT emotionally stable. I'm far from it, I break down at the drop of a hat. I'm not able to deal with that so in the past I resorted to alcohol and cannabis just so I didn't have to think about things. Substances let time pass unhindered so I've relied on them, it's like time travelling forward. I might walk through the world in a daze, but at least I walk.

I've been working on this though, smoking cannabis has made me hack up black shit so I'm stopping (at my GP's request), or trying to convert to edibles at least but I don't know how to make them (or at least the way I want to, extraction&gt;just baking it in) and buying them is expensive.

Alcohol is destructive and not a way to hide my feelings, probably 1 out of every 5 times I drink I just devolve into an emotional mess and hurt the few remaining people around me.

I have been finding success in my career recently but I feel like my boss is just using my willingness to what I feel like is work outside of my pay grade and is going to dismiss me as soon as the project we are working on is over.

I currently am not very sexually active. I left a relationship last October where I was abused. I feel like I was taken advantage of and was unwilling to leave the relationship because I don't have very good self esteem. I want nothing more than to have a caring person in my life but I have a hard time trusting people now. I feel like everyone is just being nice to me to use me or is building up trust so they can tear it down on me again.

I've been working very hard to get myself out of this rut. I have lost weight (down from 235 to 200). I am becoming far more active. I have saved money on top of coming into a fair amount unexpectedly. I've started reading again. It's still not helping though. I can see myself improving but I don't feel any better.

The problem is I seem to need contact with people. This is hard for me being autistic. I can initially contact people very well but have a very hard time maintaining relationships because I have a tendency not to empathise with others. This makes me inadvertently selfish. I don't mean to be. I think I have been forced to grow up very independent so naturally my first thought is self interest. I also think every friendly action is a trick to lower my guard so people can hurt me.

I have tried very hard to just devote myself to other people instead of being self absorbed and unempathetic but that seems to just open myself up to people who want to take advantage of me and upon learning this my trust is slashed.

I also have a very hard time trusting, interacting with and socialising with males. From an early age I was bullied and it was almost always from other males so I have absolutely no desire to interact with another man at all.

I get that all of this is a ""me"" problem. I know damn well the world isn't like this but I can't seem to change my own instincts. As much as I try to suppress that instinct eventually something will come out, I can't suppress it all and when it does I drive people away.


The worst part is that I'm _not_ a suicide risk. I value my own life very much. My biggest fear is just lashing out at others and hurting people other than me. I wish the only person I would hurt because of this is myself but that's not the type of response that comes out. I end up just hurting others and isolating myself, and then things get worse.

I don't know what to do anymore."

I think I made myself think that as an excuse to leave him 6 years later for a Mr. Lust I found online. I had to move out and sell everything and relocate across the country to be with Mr. Lust. I feel like such a  horrible person for this.. He is more affectionate and sweeter, but it's just not the same, it's just not. I miss my ex so much but it's impossible for me to return.. he was so devastated and has made up his mind about not taking me back.. I respect it but I think I'm in denial.

lonely,"31[M] I don't understand anything anymore, just kinda want to vent","31[M] I don't understand anything anymore, just kinda want to vent - I've been engaged once. And I've been married once.

The first engagement ended because ""I cheated on her."" Short version - In reality she was actually cheating on me and was then arrested later on for being a pedophile. (2-2 1/2 year relationship, met on PlentyofFish)

The marriage ended because ""I cheated on her."" Short Version - In reality she ended up resenting me for my success in my career and didn't want to live with me anymore, drained our joint account, and left me with the mortgage. After I put the wedding band on her finger she became miserable, instantly. No more sex, No more cooked meals, No more gaming together. Traveling with her was terrible; her max walking distance before the complaining began was 1/2 mile, etc. (2-2 1/2 year relationship, met on OKCupid) It's a no-fault divorce.

According to both, apparently watching porn, when not getting 'any', is cheating. To me, bumping uglies is cheating. To the law, bumping uglies is cheating. Oh and they both put me on blast to all my family and friends ""He cheated on me!"" so that was great.

So I have horrible taste in women? Both had been in broken relationships in the past, where apparently they had been cheated on or whatever..... This is my ex-wife's 2nd divorce......

I guess my main question is: Where is someone like me supposed to find a woman?

I'm handsome (at least my mom says so)

I'm educated

I'm almost 6'

I'm in the 6 figure range

I'm working on the 6-pack but I'm better at drinking 6 packs

I have that other thing going for me that's above average

I have my hobbies- video games, scuba, snowboard, blah blah blah

I play at being the asshole(in a fun way) but am actually kind/caring

With all that said - No woman has ever approached me first, not since high school anyways. I've never received the first message on any dating app, ever. I get 0-1 responses on any ad I put up on reddit.

lonely,The impossibility of possessing someone,"The impossibility of possessing someone - &gt;Even in my underground dreams I did not imagine love except as a struggle. I began it always with hatred and ended it with moral subjugation, and afterwards I never knew what to do with the subjugated object. And what is there to wonder at in that, since I had succeeded in so corrupting myself, since I was so out of touch with ""real life,"" as to have actually thought of reproaching her, and putting her to shame for having come to me to hear ""fine sentiments""; and did not even guess that she had come not to hear fine sentiments, but to love me, because to a woman all reformation, all salvation from any sort of ruin, and all moral renewal is included in love and can only show itself in that form.

I fear mine (and probably many others) loneliness is borne out of the impossibility of completely emotionally captivating someone, of making them bend to your will just to please you, just as you would do to them. You read all these fantastical stories in literature like Dante and Beatrice, Werther Charlotte and Albert, and so on, wondering why people don’t do the same for you. In all my dreams of escape there is no general understanding between me and my partner, the kind of sorts id truly call love, instead the roles are reversed and it is the girl that is desperate for my love, and I hide it only to make her want it more, ever so often indulging her in a kiss or a compliment. Can you really call this love or loneliness, or am I just chasing after a dream that will never be realized?"

I've swiped everyone within a 15 mile radius, the matches have dried up, and even if they didn't, I'm stuck with a fair share of red flags and a personality type (INTP) that is pretty much the worst one you can have from a social perspective.

I feel so damn alone that it's bled into every part of my life. I can't enjoy my hobbies, can't stay motivated on projects, haven't been going to the gym as much or getting out of the house. The only thing driving me is finding a partner, and I don't know how to do that, not as the person I am with my age, personality, and appearance.

lonely,I have bad luck.,"I have bad luck. - I expect some backlash I don't blame you. I never believed in good or bad luck until things kept happening to me it's no coincidence.

And I've been with 5 girls only 2 I actually fell for. And I guess I'm just destined to be alone for the rest of my life so this is to whomever I end up with next and if I show you this, it means I trust you whole heartedly. Which isn't easy for me to truly do because I've been done wrong so often not just by girls, friends and most my family as well. And I only am insistent on finding someone for me is because I guess. I want love because my parents didn't show me nearly enough. They made me question my own existence from a very young age. They are trying now that I'm older but they deny the memories of what happened in particular on my 6th birthday but they remember it. Because something involving my neck happened that day and since then when I act out or defy them they've always avoided touching or grabbing my neck. Back to whoever I'm currently seeing and showed this to just know I mean it whatever I say because I was showed alot of bad in my life but I was never one to lie. Because I know what it's like to be lied to. So if I ever become distant I'm just having a day where all the bad comes back into my head and I don't want to say or do anything to harm you so I isolate myself emotionally and psychically. Because more people can lie to me leave me for someone else but I won't ever inflict what I've been through to anyone because I can't hurt anyone like that and I don't want you to know what it feels like to be inside my head. Everyone who's tried to get into my head gets ruined and blames me for it because they guilt me into being open about myself and my struggles. But honestly with whomever you maybe I don't feel the need to do so any longer, because I can only hope you understand where I'm coming from as a person and your significant other. I care too much to ruin anyone else no matter how bad it ends or the things said.

I didn't work on my pectorals for a long time and make them solid yet pillowy just to be strong.

I didn't work on my biceps just to lift concrete eight hours a day. My arms are meant for cuddling. To be held on to while strolling the city at night, so she feels safe.

I'm tall, handsome, strong, and work like a dog. Yet over all of this I'm shy.

I hate my introversion. Yesterday I was at the beach and there was this group of girls obviously glancing at me. I wish I was brave enough to go over there and talk to them. They had such a cute dog with them, hypoallergenic too. I should have gone over there and asked if I could pet their dog, it would have been the perfect opportunity to introduce myself.

All I've ever wanted in life is to be in a romantic relationship. Just sappy, clingy romance. I love clinginess. I want someone who'll cling to me like an angry crab.

I want someone who will explore with me. Caverns and mountain peaks. Bustling cities and quaint country small towns. Large lakes and long river walks. I want to explore where others don't. To try new things. To eat interesting foods. To try wineries (I'm 21). To camp and roast marshmallows under the bright night sky.

I want to rock back and forth on a bench swing, holding each other. Her head on my shoulder. My arm around her waist with my hand in hers. My other hand in her other hand.

Do you ever wonder why do we use Social Media? Obviously, the answer would be to stay connected with people and to have a better social life. But what if social media makes us lonely and vice versa.

A lot of researches have been conducted on the relationship between social networking addiction and loneliness.

 

Loneliness may be part of a normal developmental process for older adolescents in transition to young adulthood, but for many adolescents, the loneliness that results from can lead to even more serious problems such as depression, suicide ideation, and violence.

A World Happiness Database (2010) study found that people with close friendships are happier. It has also been documented that friendship is the most important relationship in an emotional life of an individual between the end of early childhood and onset of full adulthood, and it has also been recorded that friendship is more intense than relationships later in life.

While adolescents use social networking sites (SNS) to connect with people and to improve their friendships and social circle, it is to be noted if it improves the quality of friendship and makes the individual feel belonged or if it acts counter wise.

lonely,"Here, is the thing with feathers.","Here, is the thing with feathers. - Maybe it's just me, but I feel like loneliness isn't so bad if there isn't hope. In fact I'd even go so far as to say: loneliness - hope = solitude. And solitude is fine. You can get used to solitude, even find joy and happiness. Some of the happiest moments of my life I was completely alone and completely okay with being alone. But if you introduce hope, if there is uncertainty that's when things get difficult. And it doesn't matter how much hope or uncertainty there is either. Because it always hurts eventually. When there is a lot of hope you just have that much further to be let down. Because the sparkle always leaves someone's eyes doesn't it? The hardness replaces it and already you can feel the magic dimming. Another potential life vanishes into smoke. And when there is almost no hope that is when you are at your lowest because no matter the circumstances you always think it's your fault the hope is gone. Maybe you should have been more this or less that. Shouldn't have had such high hopes, should have played your cards differently, should have lost weight should have worked out more, should have waited, should have spoke sooner, shouldn't have said so much, should have said more... endless recriminations for endless varieties of loneliness. I am not just talking about romantic loneliness here after all. I am talking about intelectual loneliness, spiritual loneliness, familial loneliness, sexual loneliness. All the feelings you wish you could share in all the relationships in your life all the pregnant silences and the yawning abyss of irrelevance... It is only painful because of the hope. Hope is like oxygen. Alone it is intoxicating, corrosive, explosive. It has to be mixed in with other stuff. Loneliness is just a poor admixture of hope and circumstance. And I think some people... the anguish makes them mean or sad or crazy.  Like George Carlin: ""Fuck hope"". Like cynics and anybody that has given up: 'Is this a test? It has to be, otherwise I can't go on'. Maybe like me someday. I don't think I am crazy (although, allegedly crazy people never do). Nor am I bitter or cynical. And I haven't given up.  I am going to try and understand.  I accept my loneliness. Perhaps it is my brains way of guiding me? I accept and am grateful for my relationships. All of them, even the painful ones. I don't blame anybody.  It isn't anybody's fault I feel lonely. Not even mine for having hope. But I have to admit a slight irritation at the thing with feathers. Whether I can finally let it free because I don't need it anymore, or it dies from malnutrition, or simply chooses to cease its squawking when I am trying to sleep... I don't care as much. I just want some peace in my time."
lonely,Finally admitting I'm lonely,"Finally admitting I'm lonely - I've never been the one to ask for attention growing up, because I didn't want anyone to worry about me. I didn't want to be a burden, I guess. I used to take pride in the fact that I don't ever really express my opinions, wants, or needs. I was ""self sufficient"". 

However, as I get older, I find that I'm just craving for someone to pay attention to me. Just ask me how I'm doing, ask me how my day went, or just listen to how I feel about certain things. Just someone to make sure that I'm okay. I want a genuine friendship.

Often times I feel like I'm wrong for wanting this because I'm afraid of being seen as desperate. I just know that if I don't start saying what I want, and let this continue, I'll never be happy. I'm lonely and I just want a close friend."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to lie, I've had friends. I had 1 friend when I was 9, but lost due to moving and parents break-up. In the new school I ended up in 3 years making like 3 friends that would even consider me as a friend too, but still I was a very shy, timid and aloof kid. We moved again. New school, absolute outsider, no friends. The weird kid no one knew when I was still at least somewhat normal. Moving in midst of puberty is the worst because you're confused about your own identity and so is everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Now what? I have a job and it requires me to talk to people. But it's all shallow talking. No one wants to talk real shit. I've wanted to talk real shit since I was a young kid, but never could so I ended up distracting myself with video games from the loneliness and lack of expression. I'm now 21 and utterly ""expressless"" as in I can't even smile without faking it. I feel like crying every day thinking about how I literally have no friends, and literally no one can even fathom it around me. I feel so stupid because I can't even express my thoughts sometimes, because I've spent my entire life in my room as a mute.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to get this shit out, because I've spent the last 5 years trying to grow socially but I always end up with no one. It gets pretty tiring. And honestly, what stings is to see other people look at me weirdly and judge me as an introvert, shy person who thinks they're too good to speak. Also tired of social anxiety and **literally feeling like I'm being bullied** when a bus drives past and I'm being self-conscious about my walking. Note: I'm not self-conscious about my ""shell"" as in my looks, but my very being..."
lonely,How Long Has It Been?,"How Long Has It Been? - I (M 49) got divorced 6 years ago. The failure of the marriage, combined with my crippling social anxiety, has forced me to build up walls around myself. It's been well over 6 years since I've felt the touch of another human being. I'm not talking about shaking hands or incidental contact, but a hug or a kiss or someone touching me in a loving, caring way. I don't see how it would be possible for me to ever experience that again. Some days it doesn't bother me, but some days it's all I can think about and I wonder how did I become this person."
lonely,"I’m an unlikeable person, I’m lonely and it’s getting to me","I’m an unlikeable person, I’m lonely and it’s getting to me -  I think this is going to be like reading my diary. I thought if I got it all down on paper (keyboard and screen?), maybe I’d feel better. 

First thing I should say is I’m probably in a better place in life than a lot of the people here. I feel like a fraud for feeling bad about myself. I’m sorry for that and apologise in advance for anyone who feels annoyed or upset by my post. Then again, I am unlikeable so that won’t be a surprise. 

I’m married but my wife is often stressed about her job. Often she’s not really listening when I talk to her. It’s not a great feeling when the person who must love you the most in life isn’t that interested. I guess add boring to my list of character traits. When she is communicating with me we do get on really well.

My job often has me on my own for hours. I’ve not seen another person for five hours and I expect to go another three hours without seeing anyone today. I send messages to people I know in real life, people I know from Twitter, people on Reddit, but it’s always me doing the work. I’m always the last person to send a message and they’ll only contact me if they want something.  I was sitting around last night – my wife had gone to bed at nine – looking at my phone and thinking why am I so unlikeable? I’ve tried all sorts of things, being friendly, being funny, being attentive, being mysterious and being open. Basically being myself or not being myself, but whatever I am, people don’t like it. The number of new friends I’ve had for a few days is adding up and none of them stick around.

When I was young (under 11), being friendly, fairly clever and generally nice were good traits. I was never really popular but I had lots of friends at school and regularly played with them after. When it got to the teen years where being the clever kid meant all the cool kids would pick on me daily, I sort of retracted and didn’t go out. I think from the age of about 11-15, I only did something with people my own age about 5 times. After 16 things improved and I had friends, although none of them are still around. They all moved on when I was no longer useful to them to help with coursework or drive them around to the friends they really wanted to be with.

They enjoy killing their spare time with you but thats it. They just wanna be friends. They love listening to your deep conversations but just for the sake of enjoying these conversations. They love throwing around how they love you the most but they dont actually wanna be a part of your life the slightest bit.

lonely,Is It My Fault?,"Is It My Fault? - Well then, let me just jump right into it... So, I'm lonely. Still in school trying to make friends. This school year was... Quite the ride... So, I have made friends with some people, tried to fit into a certain group. I had fun the majority of the time. Then, I kinda started feeling a little better drifted from them. Not many conversation, more lonely, depressed days, and overall, no interaction... I told them that and well, the backlash was kinda weird. They did make me realize that well, I am quite stupid and a frankly, arrogant. I've come to accept that and to try and fix it. So, what I thought was reasonable, to leave that group and join a new one. That group I felt didn't want me around anymore. So I just kinda left. I don't hate them, I hope they don't hate me. So, I left that group. It was frankly, my fault for being the way I was. Of course, I am doing much better now at behavior. Now, I joined a new group. They were a weird bunch. I had fun for a bit but not two weeks with this group and today, something happened. See, there's one girl I'm this group. She's uh... All I can say is, pretty fucked up... She's racist, rude, pretty damn violent, and horribly depressed. No joke... She hates serious talk. But today, I tried to tell her that people, or society, won't like the way you act when you grow up. She suggested suicide when I told her this. I tell her don't do that. She says that I make it sound like if society doesn't accept you, you die so, what's the point of not killing yourself. Of course, I only wanted her to be aware of how fucked up her mindset is. She's damn violent and is terribly rude. People shit talk her on a daily basis. I want her to change, to know what she's doing, but shit, she just straight up left a group chat. I then started to question if I belong in this group. I type that in and send out the text and one of my ""friends"" says ""You just fucking noticed. You idiot."" At this point I've gotten fed up with the group now. So, I just left... Now what? Do I find another one now? Shit man, I don't know. This happens too much. I thought I was gonna change but damn... Seems like I only ended up with the wrong group. They probably hate me now... Probably all hate me... Probably look at me as some kind of... Toxic person... Spread rumors... Lie about me... Shit man. Is this all my fault for why I don't have friends? Is it my fault for why I don't have a group? Am I just spending break time alone again? I... I don't know anymore... Maybe I'm just falling into the wrong groups, maybe it's the way I act... Or both... I'll... I'll see if I can find another group... Although I'm scared. I'm losing hope on finding friends now. But first, tell me, is it my fault for not finding a group?"

If anyone knows anything about medical school, it consumes your entire life and prevents you from being able to work for money, so the government determines a maximum amount that each student is allowed to take out for ""living expenses"" each semester in loans.

The number pretty much assumes you have family financial assistance to help you out with some costs, which I unfortunately do not since my mom is dead and my dad is disabled. I was able to afford rent this past year by splitting a (pretty crappy) apartment with a roommate. That roommate got engaged and is moving out, and for months now, I have been trying to find a new roommate to no avail. Everyone is super interested until they find something better and stop responding. I've searched everywhere within a 40 mile radius of my school for pet-friendly studios and 1 bedrooms that I can afford on my own, and there is essentially nothing. As the end of my lease nears and I still haven't been able to find anything, it's looking more and more like my only option is to rehome my dog, and I am devastated. I understand why so few places are willing to rent to dog owns and those that do charge a lot. Just sucks."

Day 2: “The easy day”

\*\*Actually, this should be day 1, yesterday I just “meditate” and I decided to start this. But my post, my rules\*\*

Today I woke up at 5 am, I had a good breakfast and with good, I mean healthy (it tasted like shit), I ate a bowl of porridge with some orange juice. I am low on money so I can’t buy tasty food, next month I will try to administrate the money smartly. 

Then I went to the gym I’ve been going for 3 months, but today I took a photo to myself to see the progress (I know, but I won’t publish it in my Instagram with some motivational crap, I promise), I stayed for 1 hour. After that, college without socializing, but I don’t like that group so that’s okay. And then in my apartment, I studied for 3 hours, taking a break of 15 minutes every 45 minutes and after a break, I went to my English class where my teacher is hot as fuckkk (completely irrelevant, but I needed to say it, sorry for that) and that was my day. I procrastinated for 3 or 2 hours maybe, it’s a lot less than usual so that’s okay too, tomorrow I’ll try to not procrastinate at all, I need some “rest time/free time”, I want to push myself but still is necessary some free time for myself, maybe if I’m able to organize my free time I won’t lose time procrastinating. 

Also, I tried to write a CV but I have no experience at all, I just have a useless “mid-degree”, but again is useless so I will have to take a shitty job that probably won’t help me in my career, but I need to be independent of my family that’s the goal. And the economy is pretty bad right now but I have to try, tomorrow I will send my empty CV to some places, and wait for the best. 

That was it, it’s the first day, I think I did it pretty well, I didn’t talk with anyone though, that’s the only thing to improve for tomorrow.  I need to improve everything but at least I started, tomorrow will be a new day and I will do it better. The first day is always easy for me, the hard part is keeping this rhythm. 

One thing more, I have an appointment this week with a dermatologist, I have huge eye bags, I sleep a lot (thank god that’s not a problem) and I also stay hydrated so this is something else, I need to take care of my body my self-esteem is like shit this might help a little bit. I also have an appointment with a nutritionist I just need a guide of what should I eat, I’ve been feeling weak lately, probably because I’m depressed but I can’t fix that, so maybe eating better will make me feel a little more awake. 

Also, day 1, no fap at all, I’m even proud of myself. 

BTW, I don’t know if someone is reading this crap, but if you are, and there is a grammatical mistake correct me pls."

No need to read/reply) - I don't know. It's roughly an year since I know her. In the beginning, she was extremely chatty (even more than me). Then I start feeling close to her and like her. After like 6 months, she becamse less chattier. I was kind of upset but I told myself at least she is talking.

Now-a-days it's even worse. Earlier she used to send me memes or something all day long or while I am sleeping, but it stopped too a while ago. Yesterday as an exercise, I decided not to text her first about anything, and guess what.. 0 message from her whole day.

She replies nicely and properly but she don't initiate conversations anymore. I think maybe it's because of my personality or something. I have even completely stopped talking about my life or my problems, to see if that was annoying her. Still no conversations from her side. Earlier she used to talk about her problems too, which has stopped too.

Who knows what should I do. I will prolly stay strong and won't initiate conversations all the time. Maybe she will start missing me that way. Regardless I don't want to force my friendship onto anybody. If they don't need me, I will stay stronger."

lonely,For the first time in 16 years I'm lonely,"For the first time in 16 years I'm lonely - Three weeks ago my fiancé (of 16 years) said that he doesn't want to marry me and he doesn't think he can go through with the wedding. As heartbroken as I was I felt it was jitters and he needed some time. After all, it took him 15 years to propose.

I gave him time, three weeks in fact. Carrying on with everything and trying to remain positive. Kept telling myself that he's just scared and would come to his senses soon. That was until he said there was a 1 in 5 chance he would go through with the wedding which was all paid for and only two months away. I was mortified.

A couple of days after that he says he can't go through with it and he doesn't want to be with me anymore. So here I am, sat on my own packing my last 16 years into boxes with the realisation of having to tell people it's off. Well, half of the guests already know but no official statement has come out. It will when his parents come back from holiday on Thursday. 

I've always been a loner since I was a child and that's why I couldn't believe I met someone when I was 15 years old. I'd never had someone I could be honest and open with or trust like I did with him. I had that for 16 years and now I'm all alone. With nothing. I have no friends and the only family I have is a mother who never really showed care or love to me. Going back to live at home is not an option, and I can't talk to her about anything, never could. 

I am once again alone and I feel unloved and useless. A waste of oxygen. Alone. It's funny how I feel completely lost and frightened , but it's the loneliness that I can't stand the most. All I want is someone to help me and guide me through this. That's life unfortunately."

lonely,We all need to come to this harsh realization.,"We all need to come to this harsh realization. - A lot of “normal people”, will give us advice to love ourselves and then our problems will be solved. Never call them  normies, it’s just immature, they are just people who haven’t felt true loneliness and pain.  Loving yourself is not what we need to focus about. I already love myself, I don’t hate myself, I hate the world around me. They fail to see the worlds true colors because they have love and compassion that blinds them of it. The world is filled with hate, and life is ultimately a competition to be the best. Right now we are all falling socially if we are here.

We are all a product of our environment, maybe your parents made you hate this world, maybe it was “friends” who treated you like shit, maybe it was a girl(boy)friend who dumped you or the lack of a romantic relationship. You need to start looking back at your past and see what made you this way. For me it was everything, I’ve never had a girlfriend (been rejected 7 times and I’m only ), my parents are narcissists, and “friends” aren’t really friends. This all has shown me how hateful this world actually is. No one actually cares about you unless they share your pain, as we do here. 

They will tell you to be more outgoing, but then when you are younger rejected because you’re an outsider. They see the world much differently than you and I. I’ve only met a very few select people that genuinely care, and that’s because they share the same pain as I do. That’s what we bond over. 

Now I said we are failing socially, but we don’t have to fail in other parts of our life. Economically we can still do well, and our health must be a priority. Go to the gym and get money. This is one of my long term goals, to get fit and to get money because those are all things that I can put my hate into. Next is my ultimate goal, now yours may be different, but mine is living independently of my family one day. I dream of living by myself one day, in an apartment or a house. I can’t wait for the day I can be at peace everyday. No one will tell me what to do at my house, I will be able to do whatever I want to. It will be amazing. 

The harsh realization I spoke of in the title is that this world is full of hate. Look around you, everyone wants to pick on someone, everyone wants external validation, and power from it. I’m not innocent either. Nobody is. There is no alternative, I have not seen one thing on this planet to convince me that this place is ultimately good. All I have seen is negativity. When you stop redditing and go into the real world, become an observer. Watch how people interact with each other. It’s all hate."

Most of the time I feel too awkward to try and spark a conversation but I've always got a topic in mind. But usually my friends ignore me when I start talking about them so I stopped starting them. Plus, I always speak like I'm fucking dead or something. Everyone I've talked to online told me that. I can't make myself a fun guy until I start making an absolute clown of myself. And I still ask myself why nobody wants to be my friend. I've always been like this and I don't think I can change it. It sucks."

And, no. I don't count. Self love is a separate topic. Anyways, I'm terrified of being alone my whole life. I want to be able to have one or two kids that I can give the life that my parents never gave to me. I want a wife that loves me for me, and likes the same stuff as I do.

I write fucking music and literature for Christ's sake. I play video games and listen to vinyl records. I listen to music like The Beatles and A Day to Remember and Bing Crosby. I'm ultra sensitive too, and my shitty childhood has given me a decent amount of baggage. Who the hell would love such a damn sissy? Not to mention I have almost zero clue what I wanna do with my life, besides music or literature, but I won't have enough time to become good enough to make it a profession, and I hate school and it really isn't my thing, so there's that. I don't know. I just feel like my odd likes, wants, and needs make it nearly impossible for anybody to love me. I have a good feeling I'll die alone.

lonely,35M in NJ - Anyone else believe they would feel better about themselves if they just had a bit of attention?,"35M in NJ - Anyone else believe they would feel better about themselves if they just had a bit of attention? - Hello all. I'm at a point in my life where all of my close friendships have dwindled away, and I'm feeling very much alone. I am constantly reminiscing about the types of relationships I had when I was younger, when it seemed like the connections I made with people were much more meaningful than the ones I have in my adult life.

I'd like to find someone local to NJ. I appreciate the interest among people who are farther away from me, but I know that the friendship won't last. It's me, not you. Things will be great for a while, but at some point I'll hit a rut, and when that happens, I will withdraw. I need someone local in order to ground me with the prospect of ""Hey, this person could actually be a real friend one day, and not just someone I know on the internet.""

That's the only real hard request I have. If you're married with kids, that's great...we can relate to one another. If not, that's great too, we can provide alternate viewpoints. I prefer females, since I don't have any close female friends anymore.  

I have ample time to talk, and would like to find one person to get to know really well."

lonely,I can't even talk to my friends anymore,"I can't even talk to my friends anymore - It sucks knowing that I have no 'real' friends to talk to anymore. My best friend, or at least we were, won't even give me the time of day to talk about something that is happening in my life right now. If something happens, the only people I have to talk to about it are a few friends I met online. 

It's a pretty horrible feeling knowing I don't have any friends I can rely on for support. It's only a matter of time before I contact ceases with my friends all together. I guess I'll just have to get used to being alone..."
lonely,Lonely 20 year old guy...,"Lonely 20 year old guy... - Hi,

I literally found this subreddit this morning cos have been feeling really lonely due to the fact I cannot make close friends and hardly have any irl friends with only a few being online. 

I did have a few close online friends that I made but I got so attached to them that they backed away and now I'm hurting alot. I just want a friend  who I am able to share things with, especially irl it really kills cos hardly ever go out with anyone :( 

Does anyone feel in a similar position? Any tips on how to not feel so sad and lonely? Also is it bad that I attach to certain people real fast? 

Thanks"

lonely,Don’t listen to people with cliche answers on how to lead a better life,"Don’t listen to people with cliche answers on how to lead a better life - Nobody is going to approach you because they barely acknowledge your existence. The only possible reason people care about you is because there scared that if you die it would hurt them so they don’t care deep down about how you really feel nor do they want to try to care they just tell you not to end it. No girl/boy is going to approach you and ask you out because most of us are losers who can’t get anyone because we don’t look like the 1% who get asked to take pictures and go to parties and have the time of their lives whilst we stay at home wanting to die.

There is no change anywhere and it doesn’t exist. We were all born to be like this and the same things keep happening over and over to prevent us from breaking free from loneliness. Take me for example, last year I met a girl she was nice and I got out of my shell for her. She was actually leading me on and using me so she could get close to my friend. They’re together now, still. This year I had it with my loneliness and decided to join a society, I email this particular society and I get an email from the boyfriend of the girl I liked thanking me for joining the society. Some absolute bullshit but that’s just how it works.

We are nothing just lonely scum who won’t ever be loved only by our parents. There’s no cure and nobody wants to help cure you because they don’t care."

I am aware that a lot of you watch anime/series or maybe play games to flee your depression. But my problem is that I have nowhere to flee. I cannot get any enjoyment from watching anime. It follows like this: After hours, I finally find a website to watch anime, start watching, get bored after few minutes and end up giving up. What do you think I should do to be able to have fun? Am I being too impatient? 

Please help me guys. I am in a terrible situation. We are all lonely but at least you have something you can enjoy, I don't. I am waiting for your suggestions!"
lonely,I am a really special case,"I am a really special case - So I am interested what other people think of me.

I am a 20 year old lonely male, which never really had a friend or relationship (kiss or sex) in his entire life.

I am home and only in my room since I finished school one year ago, the only thing I do the whole day is playing video games or watching anime.

I also dont cope really good with my family except with my mother, so I only have my mother. I dont had other social contacts since one year with other people, but even my previous ""contacts"" were cursorily.

I know that I am gonna die alone and somehow I accepted it.

My sense in life is, and I know many will find it weird, to play games (since 14 years) watch anime and my mother is really important for me.

It is a really complex situation and if somebody is interested he can message me.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if there is anyone who can relate to my comment."
lonely,Finally decided to come out and talk about my own loneliness,"Finally decided to come out and talk about my own loneliness - I moved to where I currently live 3 years ago. Haven't made a friend since. I've gone out a few times with different people, but things just stopped right there, no second dates or whatever. Growing up I had few friends and, honestly, they weren't the best of friends, so dealing with things and just simply being alone wasn't that much of a problem at first. But at this point it's starting to become somewhat unbearable. There are moments when I can feel my chest ache and my body weigh down on me and it's just frustrating and agonizing. Right now is one of said moments. I feel like I'd have less then half the problems I have if I had friends over here. But making them is so damn hard at this point that I'm left quite hopeless about the whole situation. I don't feel like I'm open-minded enough in a person-wise matter to be able to make friends, if that makes any sense. Something holds me back from actually going out there and trying and I don't have the slightest clue as to what it is and what to do about it."

Even though being out and about is better than being home, it doesn't quite fix this problem. I don't really know why I'm out here though. Being by myself in the face of nature is a sure reminder of how lonely I am, cause no one wants to ditch their lives to spend that kind of time with you.

Travelling long distances gives a chance to close the gap between long distance relationships of any kind. But I just really need someone who would leave with me. Someone who wants to ditch their life and seek adventure. Who doesn't want to grow up like how I'm refusing to. Please message me if you're interested and then we can talk."

In my head im like “ok, this will be different than the other times”, whenever I try to speak to anyone, Im ignored, whenever I try to speak to my friend, ignored just as if I wasn’t there, when I finally gets his attention, someone calls him and directly turns over to him and starts a conversation with him as if I had no meaning there."

When I'm with my friends, I always feel like I'm missing something. I see many of my friends with girlfriends, and even though I've tried to give up on getting one, I still want one. I don't need one, but it's always in the back of my mind.

When I'm not with my friends or messaging them, I feel lonely because I'm not interacting with anyone.

And even if I'm with my friends and don't really focus on the whole girlfriend thing, loneliness is still there, but I don't know what it is that I'm missing.

Even with friends, why do I always feel lonely? And how do I stop being lonely?"
lonely,"My story on how i failed at socializing, if youre in junior/high school, dont make my mistakes.","My story on how i failed at socializing, if youre in junior/high school, dont make my mistakes. - Growing up i was always the queit kid, but it never really became a problem until middle school, where i noticed other people were hanging outside of school, and this was when facebook was just becoming popular, so theyd post pictures of them doing fun things and i started getting depressed, feeling like i waa missing out. I wondered why i didnt get invited. But i chose to ignore it, i told myself ""well those people arent my true friends, ill find my people in highschool."" And i did nothing to fix the real problem, my socializing skills. High school came quicker than it shouldve, and i still was not aware that i needed to really work on myself. So the friendships i thought would magically apear, never happened. I became the guy who knew a lot of people (even the popular kids cause i was in football), but didnt have a true relationship with anyone. I never had deep conversations late at night, never got to party, or go to concerts or anything. I had 1 girlfriend i sheepily asked out over text, then broke up with over text cause she got fat ( no offense but i still had standards lmao)  Instead my depression got worse, and my social skills became non existent. And so when junior year came around, i was desperatly trying to make friends. But my aproach was terrible, i did anything to be liked, because for so long i felt unliked. I would lie about the music i like, in hopes that people would like me. Id lie about my families wealth, saying i had money when i didnt. I became a liar, and a pretty terrible one, because everyone saw through it. By senior year i was one of the most hated kids in school. People i tried to become friends with would talk behind my back, and even though i knew about it, i still tried to become friends with them...cause i was desperate. I wanted nothing more than to be like the popular guy who had so many friends. So my lesson in all this as a 20 year old who is currently doing what i shoupdve done in middle school, is start working on socializing now. Dont think that friendships are going to magically apear in your life, cause youre only getting behind. Start googling how to socialize, read body language, and make others feel good. Learn how to conversate. Accept social tensions when they arrise. Dont try to please everyone, and become a liar in doing so. Out of all this, that is what i regret most. Lieing to feel accepted will ruin you. Ive been through hell socially, litteraly theres so much that has happened that i could write a book on the shit ive seen, and im sure some of you could too. But at 19 i decided i wanted to build a life ill love, with people who genuinly love me.. im not there yet, but im still learning, finding new ways to interact and meet people. I used to think social anxeity was the absolute worst disease in the world... now i see it as an advantage. Us socially awkward freaks see things differently. We all have a gift of being stuck inside our heads to much. Thank god, for being socially awkward. Its a gift."
lonely,Im too unattractive for any guy to like me.,"Im too unattractive for any guy to like me. - [what I looked like in high school vs now](https://imgur.com/a/ah00pu6)



In high school something bad happened to me. It was by some older guys when I was 16. It made me an outcast. I was ridiculed a lot for my looks from this group of guys in my grade. Everyday in class they would pick apart my looks. They said I looked 40, that I was gross, that I have wrinkles, and that no one would ever want me. They would also say that I’m a slut. 

I had to switch schools my senior year. At 18 I had no confidence. During high school I talked to this one boy who was two years my senior. At first he acted super interested in me, but after what happened to me sophomore he said I was gross. He would only hookup with me drunk. It was like I was filth to him.

When I was 15 a random girl at a party took a photo of me squinting my face because of the camera flash. She posted it on Twitter she was a popular senior from our school. Her friends all liked it 35 of them and all laughed calling me trashy, ugly, and look like a 40 year old.  


Why else would people treat me this way unless I’m horribly ugly. It’s been a couple years since high school I’m suicidal over my looks. I want a lot of plastic surgery. I barely leave the house. I must be so horribly ugly everyone will treat me this way.


.

Are most guys like this? Why did he act this way towards me? Am I ugly? Do people treat me this way because I’m ugly?"
lonely,day 1. Is this it?,"day 1. Is this it? -  

I’ll use this like if it were a blog, I created a new account so my “friends” won’t see this, I’m writing in English because one of my goals is to learn this fking language. I’m a Latino btw.

If you’re reading this expecting a good story or something interesting you should leave. 

I’m a looser a disaster, I am 20 years old, I don’t remember being happy like ever. But these last 3 months have been a fucking nightmare, just bad things, I didn’t learn valuable things, I’ve even considered suicide as a way out, but a  psychologist convinced me that was not a good idea, at least for now. 

 I haven’t found something that I truly love, my career is okay but I don’t love it (engineering), I’ve been doing good, I didn’t pass a few subjects and I had to retake them(no fucking idea how to say I’m doing the subjects again because I fail at the finals:) )but just like 3 subjects in 2 years so is okay I guess. But I have to study a lot more, or i won’t progress in this. That’s my second goal. 

Socially I'm also a piece of shit :) I don’t have real friends, I’m shy as fuck, I stutter when I talk sometimes because I’m so insecure of myself. If I have to talk with girls i sweat a lot, and i don’t know what to say. That’s the third goal, be a normal sociable person. 

I don’t hate my family, but I don’t love them either, I depend on them economically and that sucks, they put a lot of pressure on me, and my folks are not good at parenting. (I’m not saying they are bad persons, but i’ve been through some really fuck up shit and they were useless) So that’s another goal be completely independent of them, in the shitiest country of Latinoamerica, with the worst economy (okay this one is really hard, but at least i will try, I'm from Argentina btw)

I have started things, routines, activities, new things basically, but I’m a piece of shit, I never last more than a month. The no-fap shit, stop playing videogames, procrastinating, etc. 

So, this is the day one of doing the things right. I have the routine i have to follow, will i do it? Probably not, but I can’t take more shit, I’m literally just sinking in my own shit and in my own shitty thoughts, I don’t love myself, I hate what I am. I need to change that. 

The goals during the next 30 days:

\*Study more

\*Learn English

\*no fap (this is like the 9834904832904893204 time I try this)

\*Talk with people about normal things without being incredibly awkward

\*find a job

\*don’t screw up"
lonely,"Sometimes I feel so lonely, it hurts","Sometimes I feel so lonely, it hurts - The title says it all. I feel absolutely fine during the day, but at night I can feel so deeply depressed and lonely that it becomes so painful and almost unbearable. Is it so wrong to just want someone to love and be intimate with?

&amp;#x200B;

There is absolutely nothing wrong with me. I always come across as confident, I look good, I am the only one in my big family that managed to get into medical school, which I consider a big achievement, and I live with my parents with a beautiful home with my own car and money in my pocket. But I still feel like something is missing, like there's this massive hole in my soul and I don't know how to fill it...

&amp;#x200B;

I have never been with a girl and I have no idea how I would even go about meeting someone that I would be able to get along with. I've spent my whole life either in a classroom or at my desk, studying or playing video games. I feel like I've missed out on so much in my life. But maybe it's not too late for 20 year old me to catch up and live a different life?

&amp;#x200B;

Without my relationship I’m not sure what I would do, I genuinely don’t think I would be capable of living on.

lonely,Just turned 46. Still so alone (casting into the void),"Just turned 46. Still so alone (casting into the void) - I'm a single dad. I haven't been in a relationship in almost 6 years now and so I've put all my energy into my kiddo. She's now 18 and finishing up high school + working a bit so I have more and more free time on my hands.

I met someone recently I really really liked. Ticked all the boxes as they say but she says she's not in a place to be in any relationship (I hear this excuse many times in life - I think its code for ""yes, but not you stupid""). Still we text back and forth all day nearly every day. I feel like I need to cut that off as its difficult to meet someone, anyone let alone someone who is the type of person I'd like to meet. That will probably happen this week.

So that brings me back to where I'm at. All my friends are long gone and my orbit is small so I am almost never in a place to meet people. I'm so used to existing on my own that I never expect any type of conversation to happen. I think a few times someone said something and I heard it but didn't know it was directed at me so I didn't answer. My excursions out of the house are always done with headphones on.

So here I am, alone a Middle aged, chubby geek. I'm trying to get my mind right and back to where I was when I stopped thinking about loneliness. It takes time. Time I have a lot of. Quite frankly I'm bored and tired of my singularity.

Backstory: im english but have been living in spain for 4 years now and im lonely, i joined a public school in grade/year 6 near the end of the year, and was suprisingly liked eventhough i couldnt communicate properly for the first months til summer. however when the next year came around i was lonely, i bugged and practacly begged for attention doing random stupid and weird things, like pretend to be snorting coke(using chalk) making weird sounds and saying dumb things just to feel noticed. i ended up playing football each break but i never got passed too or even spoke too. i ended up hanging around some people who hung out right next to where we played and i would just say random things every so often, i even remember one time they were openly trying to ditch me in grade/year 8 but i chased after them, in like a tig type style. Even though i hung out with them every break that year they would openly leave me out in discussions and go places without even telling me (it was only a group of 7 at the time). skip foward a year  now grade 9 someone new joins and we all start to gather a common interest... anime. i had alot of knowledge cause i would watch it all the time, they never knew cause im left out of discussions. i thought it was finally my chance but no... my spanish wasnt good enough and it was hard translating, especially with my accent they would still leave me out of convos. (btw this group wasnt in my class so i was still a weird kid during class). i would carry on saying random stuff but my spanish got a bit better and was participating in convos at least a quarter of the time.move on to my current year some of them are in my class however im still left out of convos as the group begins to expand,, dont get me wrong my spanish is ok and i would still talk but  never anything personal just random stuff like piss out a golf ball or shit out a pineapple. ive never had anyone to talk too about my deppression, anxiety, lonliness or how i am and for all know they wont even care.i have never been out with friends outside of school, and am always left out, i cant find a different group as this is the only one who would accept me, i cant find another for my weird reputation. every so often i make one laugh but thats about all do, they literally say right infront of me how they have plans to do something but if i ever confront them about it they change the situation or lie, they all went to see the new detective pikachu movie and i wasnt even invited ( they told me spoilers today) and its not just small things like this they all go to eachothers birthday party and i dont even get a text on mine even though they all know when it is, you cant really forget it cause its on christmas, i dont want a party just to atleast be noticed by them. i finish school this year but cant go into college(english college, i dont want to live in spain) and am looking for work eventhough i look really young for 15, im really scared about what to do when i finish and doubt i will have any actual friends that i could go eat a kebab with or just text. i missed out alot of things if you want to know something just ask. thankyou for reading my first ever reddit post, i  just had to get it off my chest."

lonely,"I hate how closed minded the ""Sheep Herd"" on the Internet is","I hate how closed minded the ""Sheep Herd"" on the Internet is - This isn't your usual i'm lonely storyline, this is more a story of a frustrated, hurt, angry, tired soul, that's why this can come across as more of venting and trying to just find an opportunity to let it all out.

Everywhere you go on the internet, you just meet the most simple knitted, mindless, hypocritical and hedonistic  people you could ever find. People who supposedly want to meet new other people or want to find actual friends here on reddit, talking about how genuine, open minded, none judgmental and laid back they are and yet, when this weird creature like me in a fucked up injustice of a society we live in, makes so much effort and invests time to shoot a genuine and down to earth and detailed message to show them interest and care to their post, then suddenly you get ignored because for some reason all that talk about ""open minded"" ""laid back"" ""none judgmental"" and ""genuine"" has turned into ""no I don't wanna talk to people like you"". 

Or after a couple messages they don't seem to care anymore, that it doesn't really seem to matter that you actually messaged or showed interest. They seem to be only interested in satisfying their needs of finding the validation they wanted, but never mentioned that in their post or finding a new romance, but also no mention of that at all in their post. 

I just find it so hypocritical how those same ppl pretend to be friendless, lonely, in need of new people in their life and they would be your beeeeeeeest friend and care about you and be there for you in good or bad, all these theatrics they want you to believe, but in secret you are only good enough, if you are not a society abnorm like me. And this is how lonely and shitty a life is when you're a taboo topic, that no matter how hard you try and how much you offer and be honest, genuine, be empathetic and understanding.. like all this shit doesn't matter if you are sooo scary and weird and abnormal to society's standards.

 I could pose as a usual F on reddit and get completely away with it, i've done it so many times and I've found many people to talk to in the past, even making friendships in the past, but it's been years now and I was tired of how fake and shallow everyone is, when you put F on reddit and my only interest now is in people who can be friends with me and look past my abnormalities people love to have the biggest world war discussions over online. And I appreciate when someone actually talks to me when I am just unapologetically me.. so much more, than all the hedonistic bullshit you have to deal with as a woman online.

However you barely get a response.. I have yet to find someone who actually wants to get to know me.. who actually doesn't end up ignoring me after the second reply, there are drastic differences when you're just some F to them, you could even put bare minimum of effort into your message and they would reply to you with so much passion and joy.. This is the reason why you have so many suicides, because of a marginalization like that, but it's not the truth obviously, since people like me we are just mentally ill and the fact we go through life so lonely, so unloved, through a world that just hates you for existing.. a world that doesn't give you the same chances in life.. it doesn't seem to matter, those things are not being considered at all."
lonely,Life is scenery,Life is scenery - I’m so used to being alone now that I don’t even really “see” people anymore. Like they are trees in a forest I’m walking through. I have zero expectation of connecting with anyone anymore. It makes me sad but I’m 35 so it’s just my reality by this point.

So, from age 13 I’ve been dealing with clinical depression, generalised anxiety and social anxiety. I’m now 18.

Across those five years I’ve had numerous mental health assessments and CBT courses which have all helped alleviate these issues somewhat. However I find my self in a constant cycle of relapse. 

And I’m now sat here at 18, with no meaningful relationships with my family, no friends, and just generally not knowing anything about myself.

Why? Because of the age I developed these issues and the continued effect of them my personality has been beaten into nothingness. I have no idea who I am, what my skills/qualities are, what I like or what I want to do with my life.

And at 18 this in combination with my mental health issues and general loneliness is having a profound impact on me socially, mentally and physically. 

And it’s all sort of joining together, edging me further and further each day to the edge.

And I’m trying to get better, I really am but it’s so fucking hard when I have nothing and everything going on inside my head.

But I will continue to try."

Im a 17yo female, i live in a pretty small country in Europe called lithuania.
I never had real friends and i still don’t. I don’t go out of my house at all now i don’t even go to school. Ive been going to public schools till last year, i got bullied there, i had no friends and i was total outcast. I feel better now because I’m homeschooled, i don’t get social anxiety “attacks” , I don’t have to be all stiff and shaky for 8 hours a day. But... i feel so goddamn lonely and being lesbian doesn’t help. I know some lesbian groups around my town but they ended up toxic and I just had to leave...

Everyday now I wish i had that special one that I could trust 100%, hold her hand, spend time with her, kiss her, share music with her...
Every night, in my dreams,  I see girls that fall in love with me and I fall in love with them too, we kiss, laugh and have a good time, but then, I wake up to my lonely room.

Now i even developed a crush on a girl from a music video, which rarely happens. I think i reached the peak of loneliness.

lonely,year(ish) update,"year(ish) update - so i typed r into google on my laptop and Reddit popped up. Boy was I surprised when I found out that I was still logged in no this account!  let me tell you what has transpired in my life over this last last year... it wasn't that great. 

So after my last post from this account I did call the suicide hotline, a number of times actually, and that got me through a few days. I only called them when when I was drunk, and for some reason I always got mad that they answered. but it did help me through some of my darker points.

Shortly after that I was fired from my job, which i hated, for some BS reason but I was glad to be out of there. I found a new job as a cook which was nice for a bit, but I became complacent  and just lingered there. I'm still at this position right now, and yes I am looking ore a new job. but it is soul crushing.

Right now I am also partly homeless. Every other night I am staying with a friend  and his pregnant girlfriend. when i'm not staying with them I am at a Starbucks for 9 hours, where I am desperately looking for a new job, or at work. Then I am lucky enough to sleep in my car. pissing into a bottle is probably the most humiliating thing I have to do.

I know my friend and his girlfriend are being nice to me, but at the same time I can't help but think that they hate me for taking up room in their house. I can only realistically stay with them for 3 more months till the baby is due. But I know they want me out sooner. I know they hate me. I feel like a leach draining their good graces. 

this is officially the lowest I have ever been in life. If I end it now the world would be off better. I feel like I have nothing more to add to it anymore.

I just wanted to rant... 
I hope you have good day"

lonely,PRACTICAL ADVICE on feeling less lonely,"PRACTICAL ADVICE on feeling less lonely - So I've only recently recognised that the reason I've been getting really sad on and off over the past few years is that I feel lonely, so now that I've recognised that I've been working at trying to feel less lonely and this is what has been working for me. I thought maybe this could help someone else too. 

I think it's important to recognise that a partner might not be the antidote to loneliness and for me it wasn't, I still felt incredibly lonely the minute I wasn't with them, so there were other problems that were causing my loneliness, not just the fact that I was single.

#1 - every morning and night think of at least 5 people you're grateful for

This is normally like my parents or friends but its also stupid stuff like ""people who made this blanket"" ""guy who invented the shower"". I think it puts into perspective all the contributions of other people to my life. Gratitude is also proven to be helpful for happiness. Normal gratitude lists can just be 'things' that you're grateful for, but I think thinking in terms of 'people' makes you feel less lonely.

#2 - don't listen to sad romantic music

I realised that I used to constantly listen to sad music or music about love, which was constantly putting me in a sad mood or making me focusing on what I don't have. When instead, I now listen to happier more upbeat music which puts me in a good mood, and I avoid music about relationships and love as that reminds of what I don't have. I think it's important to focus on what you have for happiness.

#3 - unfollow anyone who posts about their relationships on social media

This is similar to the second point, but my social media feeds were filled with people posting about how much they love their bf/gf, reminding me of what I don't have and making me feel like I'm the only single person in the world. I've also unfollowed people who post pictures of themselves going to clubs very often and similar things that create the illusion that I'm the only one not having fun. Think of it this way, if you follow 365 people who each go clubbing twice a year, that could be 2 clubbing posts every day making you think that everyone is always out having fun but you're sat at home. Now my social media feeds are mainly memes and happy and positive posts.

#4 - Stop watching sad TV shows and movies, and ones that are focused on love

I used to watch a lot of kind of sad dramas and romantic things like that, which again made me feel like romantic love is the only and most important thing in the universe, again making me focus on what I don't have. Now instead I mainly watch comedies which make me feel good and make me feel positive.

#5 - journaling

Rumination and wallowing and thinking about how lonely you are is bad for you according to this TedTalk I watched, so journaling is a good way to get those thoughts down and out of your mind so you can go do something else. It's cathartic.

#6 - open up to the people that you do have, be honest, put effort into the relationships that you do have 

I never really valued my friendships before and I only really valued romantic relationships, but friendships are very important too. I realised that none of my friends knew me very deeply, and that I tell a lot of white lies to people all the time. I think if no one knows you deeply, you can't be understood, and if you don't feel understood you feel lonely. So now I try and tell my friends how I'm feeling more often and I basically tell my friends that I trust everything, I'm very honest with them. Before if I didn't really have anything to gain from telling someone something personal, I wouldn't tell them. But now I tell my friends even really embarrassing stuff that I previously would have never told anyone. It might seem to not matter, but I think the more people know you, the more you feel understood, the less you feel lonely.

#7 - Find solo hobbies to take up your time

When I sat down and thought about what hobbies I have, I realised that there's more stuff I could do that I enjoy. I now read more books, watch philosophy/politics or self improvement videos on YouTube, I bought a keyboard and have started learning to play it, I plan to start playing video games and football again eventually. This stuff takes up your time and stops you ruminating about loneliness. 
 
#8 - Take care of your health

This one is obvious but eating healthy, getting enough sleep and exercising makes you feel better. 

#9 - Meditate thinking about the people that love you

I have stopped doing this now but I did this for a while so it might have helped. Again, focusing on what you have and the reality that you aren't completely alone.

Bonus Tip - I'm not sure whether I should put this because I want to reiterate that a partner probably won't make the loneliness disappear, but I think working towards being more attractive and likable might help you in the long run. If you're a man, I have advice in my post history.

TL;DR

#1 - every morning and night think of at least 5 people you're grateful for
#2 - don't listen to sad romantic music
#3 - unfollow anyone who posts about their relationships on social media
#4 - Stop watching sad TV shows and movies, and ones that are focused on love
#5 - journaling
#6 - open up to the people that you do have, be honest, put effort into the relationships that you do have

lonely,I realized yesterday how boring and dull my life is,"I realized yesterday how boring and dull my life is - So, my parents went to our summer cottage over the weekend to do some maintenance work, and I stayed home alone since I wouldn't have had anything to do there. 

I spent those two days just playing videogames, watching YouTube and eating junk food, I only went outside a couple times to go to the store. Those were the only times I even talked to anyone, the cashier in this case. 

Then when my parents came home, we talked about what they'd been doing and what I'd been doing. I really had nothing though, I even lied to them and said that I went on walk so I'd have done at least something. 

I'm 21 goddamn years old and my life is so dull, I don't even practice any hobbies because they're really no fun, even though I dream of being good at them. 

My mom was clearly worried and asked what things do I like doing, and I really couldn't answer. Gaming feels so lonely and hollow, I just use it to kill time. I feel like I really made her worry, it's killing me. She said that we could go and do something together next weekend, so I guess that's all that I have going for me."

I guess my imagination and creativity makes up for my lack social skill, but anyways, many times I find myself talking on my own (not necessarily screaming like a mad man, just, you know, as if I was having a conversation):
I talk about my problems, about my feelings, imagining I was talking with other people, like those guys that I wish I was friends with, or that girl I had a crush on but was too insecure to talk to... then I snap back to reality and I just... feel like crying.
I rarely cry, but thinking that my brain is trying to create a simulation because I don't talk to anybody else makes me feel hopeless.

lonely,"Grandad passed away but the responses of the people around me to my grief, as well as finding bad things about him have left me feeling isolated","Grandad passed away but the responses of the people around me to my grief, as well as finding bad things about him have left me feeling isolated - Hello I just wanted to vent a bit through a big old overshare on the internet, I realise that this is very of long, so if you do have the time read it thank you I hope you are having a pleasant day. 

&amp;#x200B;

 My grandfather passed away a few months ago. The responses of all the people around me to my grief has left me feeling very lonely. I know that people around me are good people and no one can really get in your head and truly understand you, but I can't help but feel isolated from their lack of response  My grandfather was a big role model for me. He had a great and crazy sense of humour, and would take my dad my sister and I out to outdoor adventures during our childhood all the time. I have a lot of wonderful memories because of him. He was also the only one very accepting of my international mother out of the rest of the family and an very white neighborhood. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a university student so I was away from my family when  I found out he had passed away suddenly which shocked me. I had not seen him for the past 2 years as he is quite far away. 

&amp;#x200B;

 My close friend who lives with me She came to my room as we were about to the movies. I had just found out over the phone about it and was crying. She gave me a hug and said ""I'm sorry for you"" she then asked if I still wanted to go to the movies. I said I did, then did\`t then said I don't know. She left my room, then shortly I heard the front door slam as she had already left to go to the cinema. Apparently she misinterpreted that I didn't want to go. But I was so upset that she left me alone as quickly as she did. 

I know it's hard as a friend to comfort someone during something that you personally have no experience with.  Honestly however I have never felt as alone as that moment. It really hurts that one of my closest friends didn't even ask if I needed her to stay with me.  

&amp;#x200B;

This whole time I haven't really discussed it with my family.  My mum discussed about essentially what a big hassle it would be for me to go to the funeral as they had already booked the hotel without me. She said I should go only if I really really wanted to. In the end I decided not to which I regret massively. I know it's my fault for deciding that in the end but I can't help but feel a massive amount of anger to her for guilting me into not going.  

&amp;#x200B;

 But I think one of the worst things that came of this is that my immediate family and I found out after his passing that my grandfather was a piece of shit who abused my grandmother and was complacent to my aunt as a child be molested by one of his friends. I really miss him though still, I am confused to be grieving for someone who is not a good person and feel betrayed by him because he was very good to me and I really looked up to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I have never dealt with mourning someone before so I don't know of this is normal grief, but I feel like I can't talk about it mourn properly because of the nature of the information I found out about him, as well as the fact I didn't go to the funeral so I have no closure. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was just wondering if anyone else has been through something similar and what they did to deal with the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

lonely,Being positive to stay positive,"Being positive to stay positive - I have been feeling down this last few weeks and very lonely or wanting some attention, so I usually go to subreddits like r/r4r, r/penpals, r/dirtypenpals, r/textfriends trying to find someone to talk to, maybe a girl to share some flirting or just talk about our days. I keep hitting walls or being ghosted. At first, it was a bit hard, it made me feel not-special or not enough to someone (over the internet, that I would never meet in person. Maybe a bit crazy, but that was what was going on in my mind). 

But then, something changed. I just stopped looking this conversations as gain for me, but as a way to encourage other people: telling them how good they looked on their selfies; wishing well and good thouts; being positive, instead of feeling bad of not receiving a reply. (All of these trying to not be a creep or sound crazy, a bit difficult but I tried my best)

Although it didn't change the fact that I got nothing back, I felt better about myself. I don't know what are they going through and maybe they needed some positive feedback or just a good message.

I'm not saying that you should DM everyone that you see on Reddit. I'm saying that a possitive attitude at bad times can change your mood, your view of things. It helped me a bit and wanted to share it with someone.

I asked out an attractive girl from a club I'm in. We had a lot in common. We went on two dates but things didnt really click so I kind of just wrote it off and we went back to being friends. About a week and a half after our second date we ended up at a small house party together and I got to watch her get drunk and throw herself on a mutual friend and stay behind at his place when the rest of us left. Then yesterday I find out she went on a date to a baseball game with another mutual friend a week after that. 

I felt really bad before we went on those dates but even worse after since I had the possibility of a relationship dangled in front of me only to go nowhere. Then she's out there with other guys while I was still trying to get over it.

To be clear I'm not mad at her and she can live her life and do what she wants, it's on me for not making more of my chance. But it really just makes you want to stop trying when you finally make an attempt at something and it only makes things worse."

It reminds me that i'm aware of myself. I see so many people just live their life but at the same time i'm not sure if they are aware of themselve. Is there actually a moment where those people sit down and start to think?

lonely,“Interesting title #4”,"“Interesting title #4” - God I feel like the most stereotypical teenager right now. I just don’t know what to do with all these emotions.

Idk what’s down there really; I guess that makes it all the more intriguing. And when I get back home later that day...idk I guess just do normal teenager things? Cry, play video games, watch YouTube until I’m bored enough to repeat the cycle. I don’t want to talk to my parents right now. The only person I feel like I can talk to and not get some obligatory response is my brother, and now he’s not here most of the time. We’ve spent the most time together, and we know how we think. My parents, on the other hand, have very one track minds and nothing will change that so I don’t wanna bother trying. Trying to show them my interests and opinions. They’ll disregard them, dispute them, or just pretend to care or know about something they know nothing about. 
Path A:
“Whatcha playin?”
“It’s called Rocket League”
“What’s that?”
“It’s like soccer, but with rc cars”
“cool. Will you go mow the yard please?”

Path B:
“Whatcha playin?”
“Just tell me what you want me to do. You don’t have to pretend to care about video games.”
“That’s rude.”

So of course I’ve always gone with path A but i want really badly to tell them path B. Side note: I hate the word “honey”. Does anyone agree that shit sounds condescending af? She uses it so much. 

Them not spending time with me is not really their fault though. I realize that work takes a lot of time away from her. Besides that, it’s not her fault we have no mutual interests. But still... but still... there’s a level of respect or understanding I feel is necessary that I’m not receiving (along with that condescending shit). I don’t know where I’m in the right or where I’m in the wrong, how any of this can change, or...idk. 
//
We get, what, 80 years on average and we still can’t do all the nothing we plan to do. A life filled with work, emotions, school, problems, etc. It’s all temporary. That’s why they say you shouldn’t act on emotion. But what does it matter if none of it matters in the first place. It’s all temporary. For now I escape into my computer, my motorcycle, and books. But I believe there’s a certain solace in silence. A temptation at least."

My friends from college were now much farther away, I had lost touch with everyone I went to high school with, and everyone else is too busy to be around. That summer, I started to develop a lot of post-college depression and severe loneliness that has lasted since then.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want this summer to be different. Now that winter is over and it's much nicer outside, I don't want to spend most of my days sitting in my house. However, I have no one that's my age to spend time with.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I the only one with this problem? If not, how does everyone combat this problem?"

lonely,How to Approach a Shy Girl that I Like?,"How to Approach a Shy Girl that I Like? - Hey, hi. There is a girl I like in the school. I want to talk and with her. But there are some obstacles. First of all, I am tenth and she is eleventh grade. I don't think this will really be a problem though. The real issue is that the girl I like is quite shy, as far as I can see. She always hangs out with her other girl friend. It seems the two girls are not liked much in the school. They are not really good looking. They do rarely get out of the classroom unless it is lunchtime. I mean, there are two shy girls who only talk with each other and who most people don't like and I like one of them. How should I approach them?"

I consider myself a very nice person and I do enjoy talking to people

lonely,Had to share my feelings,"Had to share my feelings - This is my life right now:
Name is Mike and im 24 years of age. 

I recently Finished My education in warehouse and logistics, and got a job that i like. 

i work monday to friday 07.00 to 16.00.
After work i to to the gym for an hour or so, also monday to friday.

On the the weekends i hangout with My friends and go for a couple of drinks and chase Girls.
And I get laid maybe once every 2 months with a random girl. 

almost once a year every year since i turned 18 i get a girlfriend, the relationships never last longer then 4 months tho.

I have My own car and a Nice little apartment, No debt, decent family and friends and social life.

All in All a very good life.. But I feel so lonely and I cant sleep at night because of it, it hurts so much. I feel like nobody really gives a shit about anything anymore... Life feels.. Empty and dull..

Anyone Else feel like this??

lonely,Statistics on finding a friend,"Statistics on finding a friend - very very low.

And that is a comforting thought.

I dealt with 11 years of extraordinary lonliness. During that time I grew increasingly desperate to find friends. I would wonder ""why don't I have friends? What is wrong with me that no one wants to be around me? Why am I so awkward, shy, dumb, and pathetic?""

It made me scared, terrified even, to try and socialize. Every now and again I would get a spur of courage to talk to someone new, but it was far and few between. Most of the time I would just feel anxious around others. Worried that I would say or do something wrong. That I would prove all of my fears about myself right by finding someone I wanted to be friends with only for them to slowly stop talking to me. I wouldnt blame them if they did. I was probably too clingy or desperate or annoying anyway.

It has been 6 years since that time. I now have more friends than I have time for and more confidence than I thought I would ever achieve.

I have learned in these 6 years that I put far too much pressure on myself to make anyone I met like me. A lot of the time I wasnt even interested in the person I wanted to like me. They were just there and I was lonely and I had low self esteem.

What I learned is that finding a friend, finding a true friend, is very very difficult. It is not because you are dumb or shy or frustrating to be around, it is because you have not found the right person. 

Because it *is* inevitable that people will find you annoying or dislike you. That is because you are not yoga pants, you do not fit whoever wears you. And neither do they.

You are a unique shape trying to find the unique holes who you can combine with. The harder you have to force yourself to combine with a particular hole, the less healthy and worthwhile it is.

All of that is to say, keep trying to find people because there are many people in the world and you need to find the few who have real potential to be real friends with you. You will find many who dont fit that, and that is okay. You will succeed if you keep trying. All it takes is a little bit of hope, to believe you are not beyond hope, and a little bit of courage, to still try even when you feel like you will fail."

Nobody to celebrate my birthday with.

But i’ve noticed these past weeks my best friend (who’s a boy) has been spending more time with another girl, who’s sort of friends to me too. 

Don’t get me wrong, I have my own friends and he has his own, but usually we always spent a lot of time together and now he’s spending it with her. I see him joking with her and laughing but when we talk it seems like i’m bothering him or when I try to hug him or give him a kiss he rejects me. And he never does that because we are like that, we hug 24/7. 

He has always been there for me and now I don’t feel like that anymore. I don’t want to loose him cuz he’s the only real friend I have ever had. And I love him a fucking lot, but I don’t know what do to rather than not saying anything. I see him spending more time with her and it just hurts. It hurts a lot. 
Our relationship was nearly perfect, we never had fights. Not a single one. We talked about everything.

It makes me feel like there’s at least one thing my shitty self has control over and can’t possibly fuck up. Whenever I feel completely overwhelmed by loneliness or stress I just think about killing myself. It doesn’t even have to be realistic. I could just be imagining myself blowing up or getting hit by a car and I just feel a little bit better. I have no one to talk to and to be frank, I don’t care about that anymore. I have no friends at my college despite actually trying to better myself, and the few friends I have back home rarely talk to me anymore. The one person on this earth who acted like they cared told me they’re fed up with “helping” me, and you know what? I’m fed up with myself, too. I don’t know what to fix anymore, let alone how to fix it. I just want to kill myself and make it all end."

People keep on saying how it is easier for girls to find someone but not me. Is this some kind of cruel joke? Every year I tell myself that this is the year I will finally find someone but nope. And now the odds are even slimmer because I’m out of school. Any hope that I had before is gone now. It just sucks. I have so much love to give but no one to give it to.

I'm like the most replaceable person to have lived, and it's obvious from the way people treat me. I've been crying so much and I can't take it anymore.

You go, sit, and wait until a kind person in the park notices you in the area and comes talk to you if they wish.   This eliminates bothering unwilling park-goers or shyness.   It would rely on community awareness and healthy, kind people in the area to help.   My proposed name would be I Feel Alone Zones or Lone Zones.  Do you guys think it’s worth pursuing?"

The event was my wedding, I was marrying someone who I’m close friends with IRL. it was a simple dream with me talking to some old man on the porch while I built forms and mixed and poured steps. I was so excited and scared for the future but I knew I was going to be doing something amazing. I thought I survived college and found someone to spend my life with. I then woke up to the blackness of my room all alone. I didn’t cry but my chest turned into stone when I realized the truth that I’m just terrified of my life and that I’m alone. I’m almost 20 and have never even held a girls hand. I just don’t know how to keep going on like this, I wake up terrified from dreams that are happy, me with kids, a wife/SO, or just being with friends. I’m so tired of being scared."

lonely,No friends,"No friends - I've not had a true friendship since primary school. Secondary school I was in a group of girls but they were always closer to each other and I was rarely involved. They would always meet up without me, had group chats without me and id be left out of jokes etc. Most of my friendships are online but I've realised that even there- I'm *always* the first to message, if I didn't then we would just stop talking. No matter how much love and care I show people it's thrown back in my face and it's left me so lonely and in a situation where I have next to no real life relationships and very few flakey online friendships. I uninstalled my app I use to talk to them on and I didn't tell them. It's been four days and no one has messaged me on another app. Just shows the relationships are entirely one sided. I spent the last few days crying and eating, I've never felt so sick of life and so *alone*. I don't know how to put into words why I feel this way or even how I feel totally..

I've had an ed for a while and now I'm gaining weight.. it's making me feel like I deserve the isolation. I don't expect anyone to relate but I just needed this off my chest I guess. Sorry.

Feel like I owe everyone I have ever spoken to an apology, I've wasted so much of their lives forcing them to talk to me when they clearly want to me to leave them be. I just can't take a hint"

The friends i have don’t seem interested in me as i do them and i’ve never been anyone’s first choice. i’m always like the last choice or they choose me just because i was there at the time. when they go out and i ask them if i could come they’d say they aren’t doing anything and next thing you know, there they all are on snapchat hanging out. I only have two friends that i’ve known for a long time and one lives in south carolina and the other lives a while from me. girls at my school don’t seem interested in me as i’ve never actually had friends that are girls except in like the 1st grade. I just made girlfriends this sophomore year and tbh, they don’t even seem like good friends because i could text them and they’d just give me the one word answer texts or just open it and not even respond so that bums me out too.

My brothers and sisters are doing so good in life, always topping their classes getting straight A's and whatnot. and then there's me, kind of like the failure of the family, just existing. 
I have friends, but sometimes i feel like they don't actually like me. I'm always informed about stuff, last (also only if the topic arises, or if I ask). I don't think they would ever choose me. It almost feels like they're kinda stuck with having me in the group and vice versa.

I'm good at literally nothing.

 I'm awful at maintaing small talk, I'm awful at expressing my thoughts in the right way, I'm awful at just general socialising. I'm bad at studying, bad at thinking, bad at memorizing..EVERYTHING you could think of.

It's like my personality shifts and I just become extremely depressed. I know I'm extremely lucky to have people around me who care, and I care about them too, but at night I just feel so alone. Things like video games can help but I just end up losing motivation and not being able to play them. It's been like this for a long time and I'm very afraid of reaching out because not only would it be hard to explain to friends, and extremely hard to family, but it would also put a financial strain on them if I had to start therapy or get medicine. Part of me feels like being in a relationship would help but I think I'm pretty hopeless there. If anyone has any ideas please let me know, the suicidal thoughts have really been ramping up these past few months and I'm scared.

I lost almost all of my friends last year and it just got worse at the start of senior year. I get it. You grow apart. You click with different people. I'm not upset at all with the fact they have their own friend groups now. I'm just sad. I only have one ""friend"" I talk to on a daily basis and see almost everyday, but we're not ""best friends."" I doubt he even sees me as a close friend. I don't see him the same anyways. I really wanted to go to prom, but ended up saying no and a ""friend"" tried to convince me to go, but I was pretty straight up with her and told her like hey let's be honest it'll be awkward because you'll walk off and talk to someone else and I'll be myself and she didn't deny it because it's happened before. I just don't wanna be convinced to go anywhere and have that same person act like I'm not even there. My other two""friends"" begged me to go, but I changed my mind as soon as Friend A said she was bringing a date (I don't wanna be a third wheel and they're both from two entirely different friend groups) and Friend B said she was going with a group that isn't too fond of me. I went prom dress shopping Thursday with Friend B because she asked me to and before I changed my mind. I changed my mind as soon as I got home. I'm not gonna waste money only to sit down through every single song with no one to talk to but myself.  I had been dreaming of prom for so long and now I'm not going. I'm pretty bummed about it because I didn't go to a single dance in high school, so I was pretty pumped for it. I have no actual friends really. I've been crying for the last hour. Not over the dance, but just because I tend to worry about my future after thinking about how lonely I am lol

So I don't like groups of people, i prefere talking to 1 guy and nobody else. 
That was also the case 5 years ago, I had like a 'friend' group that i played around with but i really didn't care about most of them. 
And every year that went by, someone left my life. 
It came to the point where i had only 2 friends, i like that and i didn't want anything to do with other people. But then my only 2 friends had founded a new friendgroup where i didn't fit in. 
So for more than a year I was alone, nobody cared about me. A lot of people didn't even noticed I stayed home when i was sick. 
It was truely Hell for me, then I changed schools and i found a few guys I like. And it's much better now, but i don't have a bestfriend, and I still barely leave my home for friends. It's better but i still feel so unimportant and lonely. 

Thanks for sticking with me"

I don't have any friends, I can't get a job because I didn't do well in school, so how'd it end up like this? why would we do this to ourselves? Obesity, depression, air pollution, drug abuse and loneliness all our biggest problems are caused by our attempts at progress."

lonely,I wish I wasn’t a ‘hopeless romantic’,"I wish I wasn’t a ‘hopeless romantic’ - I’m 20(M) and I’ve never been in a relationship, since a kid all I’ve wanted was to be in love with someone. I find myself now in a situation where I rarely go out so I don’t meet people and when I do I don’t really talk to anyone. I want to be in the situation where we’ve fallen in life but I’m awful at getting to that stage. 

I act different in real life to who I want to be, I’m also not good looking so I don’t feel like I can be anyone’s ‘prince charming’ every time I like a girl I don’t think I’m good enough for them, I know this is my issue but it comes from my experience growing up as any girl that I liked I was rejected. I understand that it might be my own insecurities that stop me but I don’t know how to change. 

I understand life doesn’t work our happily ever after and I fear that’s going to be my life. 

TL;DR: I want to be with someone who makes the pain in life that you go through worth it, someone that no matter what happens at the end of the day we have eachother, but I fear that’ll never happen."

I wish I could have a pet but my parents would never let that happen no matter how hard I’ve tried.

 I mean, what’s wrong with me? Do I not deserve happiness? Am I not pretty enough? Am I not nice enough? Am I not smart enough? Or am I just too me? I try and I try and yet I can’t find a reason to be happy or to even be alive sometimes because my only worth is my work, so I’m essentially a zombie."

lonely,I'm scared of relationships.,"I'm scared of relationships. - Relationships scare me, even though I want one so badly. I mean, I want to be loved but I'm just scared of that commitment and vulnerability. Maybe I have trust issues. I never tell people how I feel. 

I remember being close to this one guy I really liked. But instead of asking him out I got scared and acted as if I wasn't interested at all. At the time I told myself that he could do better and that he wouldn't be attracted to someone like me. I then found out a few months later that he did like me back. but by then it was too late because we were distant and things got awkward... the thing is I've done this with every other guy that has ever shown any interest in me.

If only depression wasn't a thing.

I knew that we couldn’t be together since I’m a guy and she’s only attracted to girls. And she has just survived a suicide attempt so having a girlfriend will really help her feel better.
I know it’s selfish to feel this way, but I am a little jealous... 
Firstly- I’m jealous of the girl she gets to be with. The crush is an amazing person. She’s exactly my type. I’ve never had stronger feelings for anyone. And she told me that she would love to date me, but just can’t. If only I was a girl...
Secondly- I’m jealous of their relationship. They are really cute together and are clearly happy to have each other... I want more than anything to have a relationship like that. But I don’t and there isn’t a high chance I will for quite some time, since I’m going to an IT school and there usually are not many girls there. 
There is a girl who likes me, but she’s in Russia, doesn’t speak Czech nor English (we communicate through a translator) has a brain disease and clinical depression (high chances of death either by the illness or suicide)... so it’s not ideal... and it makes me feel worse...

I feel really lonely. I have friends and they’re good and all... but I’d like a deeper relationship.

There’s a lot going on in my life too (granted- it’s not as serious as what the two friends I mentioned are going through, but it’s still very difficult) and having someone like that, who could just make me happy would mean the world to me...

lonely,I met a girl - lonely forever?,"I met a girl - lonely forever? - I met a girl here on reddit. We hit it off. She was my age (16), from my country, well-read, wrote well and was good looking. I liked her and we talked quite a lot, with her sometimes insulting me and flirting with me. For a while I had kind of a crush on her. Now she stopped talking with me and I realize how lonely am I.

I get it. I'm ugly, I have social anxiety and thousands of bad memories. But there are times, like right now, where I think I perhaps might be deserving of care and love: I'm not mysoginistic and not hateful, I'm in general decent with everyone. I even write considerably well in my native language and I've read Montaigne, Mallarmé, Faulkner. 

People tell me this will end, but I've waited for loneliness to end for quite a time and it hasn't."

Work has been quite stressful and I’m moving out soon so I really don’t think about talking to people. No Facebook, no Snapchat. I’ve gotten the occasional Snapchat from a friend, I’ve never really bothered to open them. They aren’t important anyways, all of the snapchats I’ve received were streaks. 

Maybe it was stupid of my to think they would but no one has bothered to call me and ask me how I’m doing. Not even my best friend. In fact she’s left me on read now going on four days. I thought I truly mattered. It turns out I’m not as important as I think I am. They’re going on without me just fine. As much as it hurts I refuse to say anything. I’m tired of being the one who has to initiate everything. 

Perhaps this is a sign that I truly don’t matter and that my life means nothing. My presence doesn’t make a difference in my friends lives whether I’m there or not. Although it hurts immensely I think I finally know where I stand in their eyes. Maybe this is a good thing."
lonely,Movie Night #1:John Wick 3,"Movie Night #1:John Wick 3 - Let's all go to the movies alone together.  
The first movie night is John Wick 3. I understand some people may not be old enough to go see this movie because of its rating, or may not want to see this movie, but that's okay because there will be other movie nights. This post is for people interested in seeing this movie, alone, with other lonely people.  


Let's choose a date somewhere within the next 2 weeks. I think the easiest way to choose a date is first to say the days we definitely can't go; so for me, I'll be busy Friday and Saturday (5/24 and 5/25) and I can't go on those days. Tell me which days are good for you. And then we'll pick the day and time where everyone, or most of us, aren't busy.  


Then we'll talk about it, we'll talk about how annoying it is that we can't sneak snacks into the theater because they check our bags, and we'll talk about the overpriced snacks we end up buying (or how we somehow did manage to sneak some snacks in) and we'll talk about how awesome Keanu Reeves is, and how much better the world would be if everyone were more like him.  


Okay people, let's create an awesome movie night!"

lonely,the other ways,"the other ways - It’s been almost 7 months since the breakup with my boyfriend. I had a great day yesterday. I laughed and smiled and had fun. I’m happy. My ex and I have been hanging out these past few weeks platonically and it’s the best. I think I will always love him but now in a different way. The thing that hit hardest was when I realized I was happy that day and it didn’t have anything to do with him. It didn’t have anything to do with love or relationships. That’s when it finally hit I don’t need a boyfriend to be happy, as for a while I thought that was the only way I’d ever be genuinely happy again. I was happy because something funny happened in class and I was surrounded by my amazing friends who love me and who I love and we were laughing and having a great time. Depression is a life long struggle it seems and I imagine this phase of being this happy won’t last too long but months and months ago I thought I wouldn’t never be happy again. In January I put in my calendar for Wednesday May 15th, “are things better yet?” And I saw this a few days ago and just started bawling my eyes out because THEY WERE! Things were really better. I am lonely, very lonely, but at this point in my life I don’t need to not be. It stopped mattering to me if I have a boyfriend or not because I have my family and I have my friends, really great friends. This didn’t just cure years of depression but it’s a start to finding other ways in my life to fight it. Also starting therapy soon so wish me luck! xoxo❤️"
lonely,"People are lazy and boring, and I’d rather be alone, but it’s lonely being alone","People are lazy and boring, and I’d rather be alone, but it’s lonely being alone - All people seem to want is just to have fun sending memes, playing video games, doing small talk… which I am not against; not at all. It’s just that whenever I start being at least somewhat serious, people are put off by that.

Nobody will read my messages if they are longer than 20 words. They say that they are too lazy for that. Some say (or imply) that it’s not worth their time. Even worse, I end up killing conversations by sending a “long” message, and I feel bad for that. One person even took their time to explicitly tell me that if I write a message that is not super short, people will be put off by it.

So how the heck am I supposed to communicate with people? Or is it supposed to always be low level, always being about dumb repetitive stuff? I am completely alone when it comes to topics that cannot be explained in less than 20 words.

And maybe people will say, “you are selfish for assuming that the things you write are worth others’ time; you’re selfish”. And maybe that’s right. Maybe I am selfish. So I can just decide to stop talking to them altogether, if I’m such a bad/selfish person.

But it would be so lonely."
lonely,Lonely salesman,"Lonely salesman - We moved to a new area for a better school for my son. I haven't been able to meet people because I am on the road so much but I love my wife and kids so I love coming home and spending time with them. Lately, my wife has made a bunch of friends. Since she is stuck at home watching my son all week while I am gone she wants to go out with her friends and let lose when I am home and can babysit. I am happy for her. However, that means I spend all week alone on the road and half the weekend alone. At this point I see another adult in a non work setting 1 day a week. Even worse on the road sometimes I might actually see someone else for maybe 6 hours a week (6 1 hr meetings). I am just so lonely and I can't seem to make any friends.

I always had a good group of friends during school but as soon as it ended so  did the friendship.

I thought if I got into a relationship I would be less lonely... honestly it got worse and brings my insecurities out, (I’m not trying to brag or complain about having a bf don’t come at me) we only hang out once a week and he’s normally busy with school or work; which is totally fine. Sometimes he will hang out with his big group of friends.  

When he rejects my plans it’s awful cause I have no one else, I normally have to wait till he gets home so I have someone to text or talk to; it feels awful tbh. I had a best friend, she’s found other friends which again is fine, I’m still in her life but definitely not a priority like I used to be. She’s recently broken up with her boyfriend so she’s trying more which makes me just feel used, like It’s a temporary thing.

For most people, loneliness is temporary. Every self-help article you ever read on the topic tries to get you to remember that things were better before, and they'll be better again. But for me, this is all I've ever known. The things that make everyone else's lives worth living, the things they couldn't live without and couldn't imagine having to try living without, are things I've ever known. They're a fantasy, a dream.

Your good deeds and your honest opinions will be ignored and you will be despised for no good reason at all. - I've been lonely for most of my life, even when in the company of family or friends. I've always felt like a ghost among people, as if my presence doesn't matter. Whenever I try to help out or be considerate, my kindness gets thrown back in my face. When I try to join a discussion or start one to get to know people, I'm quickly cut off by someone who abruptly changes the subject or my opinions are dismissed and ridiculed. I'm not one for confrontations so I just don't respond to being disrespected and internalize it, which has somewhat affected my mental health.

I've also felt really lonely in all of my past relationships. None of my partners ever really cared to get to know me and when I tried to be sincere and tell them about the things going on in my life, they quickly get tired of listening and just start talking about themselves.

I've constantly tried to be a kind and considerate person to everyone, but all it has brought me is emotional pain, sadness and bitterness. Even after all the good I've done for former friends and partners, I've eventually had to cut ties with them because I ended up being perceived as the bad guy for just trying to be honest and considerate. I'm just sick of it all and at this point in my life I wouldn't mind living like a hermit until the day I die.

She bought alcohol and when we was about to play, she opted out, which was ok with me and she said ""she will take a shot with me when i have to do one"" anyway, an hour passes and ive been real lucky to not take a shot and i said to her ""i feel like im leaving you out, are you still taking a shot when i do"" because she was just sat on her phone, looking morbid and she said she was tired. I sat next to her and saw that shes been saying to her friend that im trying to force her to drink and everything. I just felt betrayed. 

I just don't know how to approach it. I feel like ive made a good effort by putting myself out there and made a good attempt to keep in touch with previous friends in my life &amp; its just back fired."

The only thing that a hobby is good for is having something ""productive"" to pass the time with. I have a handful of hobbies, I'm an amateur athlete, and I'm in a band. Literally none of that makes a difference. It's all hollow and I'd still rather be dead."

Because they don't like me. Everyday to school was so lonely and I always waited for it to end. I always sit alone , When a teacher tell someone to take a seat next to me, they would horrified by that thought and beg him not to or show that they was very disappointed. When we have to work in groups, no one let me join them and I will be left alone, the same when play games or go pinic with school.

one day to the musical class when people can choose their sear freely. All my classmate expel me when ever i sit next to them. They yell at me and disgusted me as if I am a monster. In 45 minutes .That moment haunted me. And then two boys hit me to get me away from sitting next to them

Seven years at school being isolated and always being rejected so manytimes. Now I am in university and I think things got better that today I feel like a normal person, not an ugly disgusting creature that people would stay away which I think it's wonderful"

I know that people in similar mindset exist obviously but in my area its non existent. I've had women tell me they are ""open minded"" but the second I start talkin about science and get really into it I get ignored and they never talk to me again. I'm not trying to please them if they dont find what I find interesting but is it seriously that difficult to find someone to talk about this stuff with? I understand I'm a little different than others but I just wish I could meet someone like me. What's really strange is also that I've been called a ""pretty boy""  cus of the way I look but all I seem to attract are gay men and obese women (not exaggerating, this is literally my every other day) I've had more gay men try and hit on me than I've had women stick around for longer than a few sentences.

lonely,i just might never find someone ha ha. ha.,"i just might never find someone ha ha. ha. - ok, my first relationship was pretty bad. i never knew what consent was, didn't know it at the time but he basically used me for sex (often unprotected). then kept me happy by buying me food &amp; drinks. all he cared about was weed, video games, and his cat. ended after 6 months when i found out was cheating on me with his ex. 

&amp;#x200B;

my second and most recent relationship, it was a little better. he helped me realize how consent actually works, that unprotected sex is **not** cool, and what it feels like to be cared for and listened to. but it too ended after about 2 short months, due to his depression. i really wanted this one to work out, but everything about the reason why we broke up was true, and there was nothing i could do about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

now i'm just laying here in my bed, can't sleep, and honestly wondering if i'll ever be able to find someone before i die lol. because of these past two relationships, i've effectively pushed a lot of my friends away, neglected my schoolwork, and have become somewhat selective of who i want to date. i'm not looking for anyone right now, but at the same time i'm scared of missing my chance if i don't. idk, i guess i just want someone to convince me that it's ok to be forever alone? or not haha."

I’m just tired of feeling so empty and alone all the time, I just want someone to hold, someone to hold me and just be with me. It’s like going down a tunnel except it only gets darker and further away from the light.

lonely,It took me a while to write this as I am not good at expressing feelings.,"It took me a while to write this as I am not good at expressing feelings. - 
 I want to start by saying that I have been finally lonely for almost 2 years now. So you can say that I suffer from chronic loneliness. :) 
It all started when I moved in Australia for my studies. I find it difficult to make new friends. I am very awkward and cannot do small talk which may come out as weird to other people. 
I do have a couple of ""friends"" but they only ask me out to parties. We never talk about stuff or do other things than drinking. 
I have tried to go out with guys but it hasn't worked. So I have never dated someone nor had a boyfriend. I have always felt like I am not pretty enough but after coming to uni I have come to believe that the problem is not my appearance but my boring personality. These guys seem to be attracted to my appearance.  After some time they choose to leave. And here I am. Alone again. 
I hope this is not very confusing. I just wanted to express my feelings as they are truly killing me. 😂"
lonely,I don't know anymore. . [24M],"I don't know anymore. . [24M] - So, this is hard for me but.. I need some advice. I need help. I've been feeling like this, and being this way for a very long time. Maybe someone can open my eyes. Yes, throwaway account. I didn't have the balls to do it on my main account. While I have not frequented this thread before - and my name may seem a bit unironic. . I must open up with this. No, I am not suicidal, nor is this a cry for attention. I want honest advice, or perhaps, redirection. Maybe I can use somewhere to chart down my feelings? Maybe a diary. I haven't a clue. Listen, and this may seem hard to interpret as for me saying that I'm lonely. I don't know if this is a common thing. But, let me just open up to you. . the reader and tell you what's going on. This all started five years ago. I met a woman online and we fell face first in love. I'm going to admit that I was, and still had been a controlling asshole. We hadn't have friends really through the period of the relationship- and even ended up married. Despite me being toxic, and controlling. . She can admit to me that she still loves me. Though, she wants to maintain friendships, and do other things that I do not particularly enjoy. This is probably derived from my controlling behavior. I developed it I believe because I was cheated on several years ago without my knowledge for a handful of months. It was only admitted to me after we had broken up when that girl had grown short with me, and didn't want to talk as much. 

The thing that I was speaking of earlier is that we haven't particularly spent a day apart before. Literally. We've spent virtually five years together without space, and she thinks it smothered us. The only time we don't see each other is when we're at work, or sleeping. Maybe running errands. She says she can't imagine a future without me in it. But, I feel like I ruined everything after doing this to her for years.

Why does she even love me, Reddit?

Am I clingy? Am I afraid she's going to cheat on me? These are my fears, sure. I can provide more context, yes. I just want you to know that I love, and live for this woman. I don't even know how to express the love I have for her. She, herself, says that she wouldn't still be with me if she didn't love me. Says that she never wants me to doubt that she loves me. Ever. 

But, why? Aren't I shit guy for being controlling, manipulative, and always worried - needing her attention? Do I need to find friends myself?

Sorry, that's just me venting and sounding sort-of desperate. But, I literally don't know what else to do."
lonely,"Ah shit, here we go again","Ah shit, here we go again - I always find myself ranting to this sub.. but I can’t help it. I feel like I’d be bothering my friends if I messaged them, and it feels like its too late in the night to have them listen to my feelings anyway. And I push all of them away, so I doubt someone would listen. 

I’m just so scared of reaching out to people and for people to not understand what I go through. It’s terribly isolating, but I’m hoping that this will drive me to communicate with the people around me. I want to stop being so antisocial. I’m just not sure how..

I also text my ex again today. I had sent him a letter over text about how I wanted to get back together with him since he had mentioned that he missed me—and I do too. He didn’t respond for four days, so sent another text letting him know that:
“As much as I really do care about you, if you’re not going to communicate with me at all, I think I just have to keep trying to move on. I hope you have a good life.”

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so pathetic and I just want to be comfortable in my own skin, comfortable in asking for help, comfortable in building relationships."
lonely,Just want someone to talk to,"Just want someone to talk to - I have my wife, and she is my best friend and the person I talk with all the time. That being said sometimes it feels like she is the only person I gives a shit about me. Don’t really talk with my family, don’t have any coworkers I share interests with, and any of my other “friends” seem to just get bored of me quickly. Not sure if it’s all because of who I am (granted: I can be awful about keeping in touch with people) but it feels like I have to pull teeth to get anyone besides my wife to interact with me at all. Nobody every initiates conversation with me... just makes me feel like maybe to most people I’m not worth talking to. I know I could be totally alone; my wife’s companionship literally saves my life on a daily basis. But is it wrong or selfish of me to want more people to interact with? More people that genuinely want to seek out a conversation with me?"

I’ve never had a boyfriend (i got close once lol). I just wanna do cute couple stuff with a guy I really like, and who likes me. Whatever. I’m 15, male and completely alone most all the time.

lonely,I have no friends. Is this weird? Is it bad?,"I have no friends. Is this weird? Is it bad? - I have good friends that I love that live in different cities than me. Right now I am living with my boyfriend who is the life of the party, and I am kind of a homebody. I work from home (so no work friends) and I moved to this new city to be with him (so no existing friends). Luckily my sister and cousin live nearby so I see them once a week or once every other week. 

It’s been several months since I moved here and things are getting kind of stressed at home. I think my boyfriend fell in love with me when I was vibrant and fun and had friends around, but now he’s sick of me because I’m an introvert at home all the time and have no social life. 

He’s quite a bit older than me so all of his friends are old. They have families and kids and some are even retired. I am 26 turning 27. 

It’s so hard to make friends after of college if you don’t like drinking. Don’t know what to do. 

All this said, is my situation weird? Should I feel more self conscious about it? I do feel lonely sometimes but I being that I still have my old friends that I text I don’t feel like I’m completely unlovable. 

I need to get out of the house and have something to do on the weekend. Without feeling completely pathetic. Like this weekend my BF is golfing both days and he asked me if I have plans. I’m embarrassed to tell him I don’t."
lonely,How am I supposed to keep going?,How am I supposed to keep going? - I feel like I've lost everything. Me and my girlfriend broke up about 2 months ago. My friends have abandoned me for her. These friends have always treated me wrong and my ex saw that too. Yet still she hangs out with them all the time. I feel like they're just out to get me. To ruin my life. I don't know what I've done wrong. Everyone in my life is against me and everyone leaves me. I'm sure I have nothing to live for at this point.

Currently in high school and have a decent sized group of friends as well as fellow classmates even in school but when I get home any interaction I can have is gone causing me to feel empty as well as now create anxiety which caused me to make this post. I honestly feel the need to cry as of just writing this as I don’t know what to do so that I no longer have this stressful feeling. I have tried on multiple occasions to make plans but most of my friends looked past those ideas and explained they were busy which they were however if they planned to go anywhere they wouldn’t invite me. The result of a lack of a social life outside of school has really messed me up and I don’t know why as I feel fine at school but as soon as I’m home I just feel empty and depressed almost. Honestly all I want at this point is to just hang out with someone after school to relieve all I want to talk about personally to them but it just feels impossible. I also don’t have any issues at home with my parents or older brother so that also is making question why I feel so stressed or anxious. Anyways I’m open to any ideas of how to get rid of this aching feeling."
lonely,I don't really get it.,I don't really get it. - So I'm friends with a lot of gay guys on Facebook. Mostly because I'm a gay guy.

lonely,"I just want someone to hold and refer to me as their ""boyfriend"" or ""husband"" playfully","I just want someone to hold and refer to me as their ""boyfriend"" or ""husband"" playfully - Instead I am absolutely starved of any and all human affection. It's not even sex I want. Sometimes I have these vivid daydreams. My significant other and I are together at a carnival or a movie. Hands are laced and held. She invites me to her home and I shake hands with her family with sincerity. All the things my household never had: love. It's an amazing night with no interferences, surprises, problems. I treat her like the queen that she is and she feels lucky to have a man in her corner. She feels safe with me all the time walking through even the most dangerous neighborhoods. 

I must have daydreamed again because I'm sitting here alone in the darkness. No texts. No calls. Nobody to hold or snuggle with. It's like an exit wound penetrated my back and exited through my heart. I feel that ""exit wound"" every time I see a couple together. A piece of me dies on the inside and I don't dare show weakness. I stare down the loneliness and that hurt feeling like a beast as it snaps and flares it's jaws at me. It's bitten me so many times before that I can just suffer in silence. It's beginning to kill me inside so much that it's like I'm slowly bleeding out losing consciousness in a daze. Fighting down to every last breath. I can't give up no matter how much I want to die. 

There hasn't been a hard fucking time invented that I cannot handle.

lonely,lost my friends lol,"lost my friends lol - I used to have a lot of friends from different groups, and then slowly they all merged into one big group. I had a best friend who meant more to me than anything else in the world. We used to party a lot, go out and do things, make time for each other, just kick it. I felt really loved and full of love. Last summer I had a really bad mental breakdown when I was staying with my parents, and since then I haven't been able to keep up with my friends anymore. I can't drink or smoke or do drugs anymore-i didn't think that would be a problem. But now it seems like all they can make time for is partying and each other. I try to fit myself back into the group and listen and enjoy them, and it works sometimes, but I don't have a place with them anymore. They act awkward around me. I'm supposed to go on our annual trip this year and I don't know if I should. They would have a better time without me. I am not mad at them, I am just very alone. I try to date but it's hard when you're gay in the south. My only close friend is leaving in two months and then I'm really going to be alone, for real. I try to make new friends but I miss my old friends so much. I love them so much. And they all love each other so much but I'm just not a part of it anymore. And I'm tired of begging and begging to be a part of their lives. It used to be assumed that I would be. Now I am an afterthought. I feel like I am starting over. My family is five hours away and my chosen family has un-chosen me. I don't know what changed. I thought we had more in common than drinking and going out and getting fucked up.

I've got the worst paying job ever which barely pays all my bills and I've got just a little bit left to get something to eat for a whole month. I cannot save anything - by the end of the month I'm always left with nothing because I cannot save on the necessities.

I'm living in a foreign country all alone. You could say I ''ran away'' as soon as high school ended for me because I didn't want to live with my parents anymore. It's been almost a year now and I didn't really make much progress. I learned the language but not enough to work in an office or to have a serious job. 

My dad visited my aunt this week and we ended up meeting, which ended up in him trying to force me to come back to my old country to study. But guess what, it's fucking impossible there. I wouldn't mind studying at all if 1. I knew what I wanted to do in life because I don't just want to study whatever, and 2. If I could live there by myself and could afford it.

You see, in my country it's extremely difficult to get a job, whatever it may be. So of course the logical thing for me to do seemed to go abroad and start there.

And I just cannot live together with my parents. They always said they didn't have money for anything I needed. But that was a lie, I saw my dad's bank account balance once by accident and there definitely was a good amount of money there. It's much better to live alone but I don't have anyone now (not like I ever did tbh but I guess now it's more visible to me because I don't have anybody around me).

I'm lost. I don't think I'm good at anything at all. I don't see myself living much longer so even if I try to research some careers, in the end what does it matter? I want to die anyway. I don't even know what I'm doing and how I got that far with no money or help from my parents. Not like they would help me anyway, back at home they loved to remind me how much of a burden I am to them and now that I am gone suddenly everything is fine between us.

Well, it isn't for me. I'm conflicted. I don't know what to pursuit in life, and I'm stuck. My only goal right now is getting a better paying job and buying a car. But after that I don't know what I will do.

I told one colleague at work that I ''probably plan to quit'' because he asked me and I trusted him (which was obviously a mistake). Next day I was called in by my boss. They accused me of wanting to quit, and got mad because I didn't tell them. Thanks a lot, bitch.

So now at work they treat me like shit because they know I'll be gone in a month anyway. Honestly they don't even treat me like a coworker anymore and I hate it. I never liked this job but it got even worse somehow.

Sorry for the long post. I really could use some advice right now. I feel really miserable and don't have anyone to talk to."

If they knew what I really thought or did, they wouldn't love me like that, assuming they do now. I know they are my parents and love me automatically but sometimes the bond is just not there, at least with my mother. So it makes me feel lonely, naturally.

My friends here are great, and my best friends live in a different country because I had to move away. I like my friends here, but I am afraid that we are just together because of the situation we're in and that it's not true unconditional love/friendship.

I do remember one good friend that is still there for me, but I still can't be sure because she's like that with everyone and honestly, I want to be appreciated for me.

It's getting harder and harder to feel lonely. It's just physical pain in my chest. I used to be good at ignoring my feelings, now I am the first one to cry.

Do you think there are people that can't be like before their heart got broken because they realized they were never being loved in the first place?

I don't want to sound whiny, I am grateful as much as concerned because of those painful times.
Thank you"

So living this life as it has always I recently discovered and read about this great man, probably the greatest man to have stepped on the planet called ""Ted Bundy"" .

He gave my life a meaning and made me realise what I want to do in life.

Likewise, I'm going to spend all of today working on an assignment that's due tomorrow, so I won't be going out and celebrating myself.

Really, it feels like there's nothing to celebrate. I don't get presents/money anymore, no one's going to throw me a party and when I wake up in the morning the program will continue as usual. I've been growing disillusioned with the occasion since I was 19, and now that I'm 24 I guess it's time to call it a wash. It doesn't bother me all that much, and yet a strange part of me feels somewhat remiss about the whole thing."

I especially appreciate the comments on getting out of my apt via volunteering and the difference between loneliness and despair. These have really helped.

5/16/19:

Hello everyone! Wow! I can’t believe I feel much better now. I also can’t believe it’s been 3 months since my original post. A lot has changed in such a short period of time. 

Things are difficult, life is. But I’m not in such despair. @it_changes really helped me understand the difference between loneliness and despair. Once armed with that, I began to question and challenge all my emotions. When I encountered repairing emotions, I basically had to imagine them as a separate person within me, challenge them, debate them, and then tell them they had no claim on my life. All the lies they told, I challenged them but doing or not doing their commands. For instance, I had this very convoluted thought that I shouldn’t go outside because there is nothing in the world for me. But then I remembered how I chose to live where I live because of the lake and the how social it is. Every time I walked the lake, even if I started hating it. I ended up having a good time. Or my work, it was such a chore to go to work. But then I remembered this was my dream job. 

I also started counting my blessings or recounting the things in my life that I really liked about my life or self or body. I’m overweight, but I really like my hands, my face, my skin complexion. I like my quirky sense of humor, etc. I also started to count all the things I have done right. No matter how minute. If it was right, I counted it. 

It’s amazing, after a while, something clicked in my mind- maybe I’m not so bad after all. 

And pain, now, I’m learning I’m not the pain. I am experiencing pain but I am not pain.  I’m able to differentiate myself from it abs identity it as communication from my brain that something is not right. Not that me as a person is not right. 

I started to listen to myself. And I learnt, you know what? I actually don’t like chips or watching movies all day. These activities just numbed me. I couldn’t face my emotions because I didn’t really know what they were or how to. Now. When I experience an intense emotion, I don’t crave foods or movies anymore because know I know it won’t help. I’m forced to find other things. Now I’m on a quest to find the things I like. 

I also became aware of how much I feared people, feared making mistakes, rejection and abandonment. Listening to Jordan Peterson and other podcasts helped me that the world is a both a malevolent and beautiful place. I used to be fearful of this but given we are here now and there is nothing I can do about it, the least I can do right now is just accept the world as is but find my way through it, not as a weak, fearful person. This I am still working on. I have started reconsidering how I view my work. I have also taken up paining. I started saying no to people and I am currently removing stuff from my apartment that I don’t like or never did. Gosh! There is so much shit I took into my like because of fear or thinking it would make me not like able. I have also started with exercising slowly as well. 

I just wanted to say, thanks to everyone! Thanks so much for your words to me. You have no idea, really! There were so uplifting. 

I hope my update is encouraging to you and hopeful to others out there.

lonely,First therapy session,"First therapy session - So I just had my first appointment and I feel better I think? It could be the therapy it could be all the crying, who knows. 

Apparently I have depression and next week I will get some meds. 
But it actually felt good to talk to somebody even though I mostly had my nose to and throat disagreeing with me because trough a 2 hour session I probably had 10 minutes total where I wouldn't be crying. 
Because me talking about what bothers me is like pushing a button that would make it more complicated. 

And she told me that in the weekend she'll come with me to make a gym membership because the one with the pool requires an adult to come with you. 

But all in all I think it was pretty great."
lonely,I use to be lonely but then I realized something.,"I use to be lonely but then I realized something. - Who cares what the fuck people think? So who cares if no one cares about me, that I wasn’t appreciated. Who cares that I’m different, my fucking ancestors didn’t work for all of this just for me to “blend in” with society. Fuck the standards, I’d rather work on myself as a person then worry what the fuck other people think of me. And if I want to be different, then I have to accept the fact that their won’t be many like me. I signed up for this shit so I can’t complain about it. 

This is just a rant I had in my head a few months ago when I finally found happiness in nothing and realized to be grateful for what I have. I realized bringing value to yourself brings in good people into your life, and if you spend your life worrying why no one cares about you, then you will never progress as a person and you will always be stuck in that same place.

That being said everyone’s situation is different and I wish each and everyone of you guys find what your looking for, good luck and have a fucking great day :)"

lonely,Relationships have to go both ways,"Relationships have to go both ways - If you’re feeling lonely and detached from your “friends,” family, neighbors etc. because maybe they don’t care about you or it feels surface level... just remember they’re human too. People think about themselves mainly and maybe they feel the same way you do. Maybe they wish someone asked them how they were doing or told them goodnight. When I was in high school and my emotions were ramping up, I felt like the world was against me. I was paranoid and I thought my friends were fake and just there for laughs. They didn’t really care about me in particular, but I was like a member of the cast that sometimes contributed to their plot. I was just there. I’ve gotten older and realized that things aren’t that contrived. People don’t actively think like that unless you give them a reason to. In fact, people in general won’t think about you much at all unless you give them a reason to. 




It’s important to accept what we have and make it work because life isn’t scripted. It’s not a drawn out plan, and friends and family aren’t like the movies. People everywhere are afraid, uncertain, and have no idea what the fuck they’re doing! Being lonely and on this subreddit just means you’re approaching some level of being self aware. You’re realizing how strange society is and social interactions are complex and don’t always result in the way you expect. Most people to almost everyone is awkward and confused at some point in their life. Only through lots of experience, failures and practice do we start to flourish in social situations. Just be straightforward! Pretend you’re deadpool. Break the 4th wall. Comment on what life is like for you and how odd it is that we’re just organisms grunting at each other. We’re just things on a flying space rock making the best of it.



I wrote this after reading through a bunch of posts and comments to see if I could help anyone reading this, but I also did it for myself. I’m depressed too folks, but I don’t want to be. I’ve taken risks and experimented in life to find happiness in the past. I’ve found love and lost it and it was both awesome and terrible. I’m still young and unsure of the world, but I know that you brains out there can make it if you open up your perspective. Don’t see the world as if it owes you something, but rather you need to actively look for what you want and take it. Ideas like confidence and anxiety and being awkward are essentially buzzwords nowadays, just do something and learn from it so you can do something better the next time."

I know this feeling is probably natural after prolonged period of singleness after a long relationship but it really sucks sometimes.

However, I have been watching a documentary series about Christian Weston Chandler (Chris Chan for short), and I think that did it for me. The way these numerous people treated a high-functioning autistic man is goddamn sick to me. The things that made him do, the things they did to hurt him for a quick laugh, everything they had done just to get a reaction out of him. It's terrible. It's absolutely fucking terrible. I may be missing something, so correct me if I'm wrong. However, if you don't know the story of Chris Chan, I'll give you one example of what these trolls did to him. A group of them tormented him by having one of them pretend to be a girl named Julie, knowing that Chris craved a loving partner. They then pretended that Julie's ""brother"" (who was really the same 13-year-old boy who pretend to be Julie) was keeping her from talking to Chris. They had previously tricked the poor guy into giving them his PSN password, the password to his websites, etc. To make him get it back, one of the things they made him do, and I repeat, ONE of the things they made him do to get the accounts back was cut up a medallion he had made himself that he wears everywhere, and then shove the piece UP HIS ANUS. AND THAT'S JUST KNE EXAMPLE. I know I'm late to the party on this story, but Jesus Christ! How can somebody be so goddamn cruel! And that's just one example! I'm goddamn scorching angry! That's goddamn terrible!! I've lost the last small shred of faith I had in humanity. It was weak as is for other reasons, but that officially shattered it. I goddamn hate people."
lonely,in my room,"in my room - (please excuse the punctuation)

i’ve not really made friends for the past (almost) 3 years. ever since i left school 2 years before the end of high school i’ve mainly just spent my time alone. when i first left school i remember feeling relieved in a way because i just didn’t have to think or worry about acting a certain way or whatever and i just didn’t need to bother w other people, arguments and idk whatever other stuff that comes with it. but as time moved on i’ve slowly felt lonelier and lonelier, i’ve done my 1st 2 years of uni now and i still haven’t made friends. my first year was really rough because i was in a very weird mental state which i could talk about for ages but basically it was just very bad and i was very anxious and getting doubtful, negative thoughts repeatedly. 
it’s kinda hard for me to talk to people unless i’m forced in a situation where i have to or somebody starts a conversation with me. a lot of people here seem to be occupied w their lives and have friends already and so i doubt anyone gonna really take the time to talk to me, just find it very unlikely. i do still have contact w some friends from high school but i hardly ever talk to them, and i have my parents and brother but yea it gets kinda stale talking to my parents nowadays bc it’s just the same stuff over and over (no offense to them though). idk if i’m ever gonna make new friends. i’m gonna try to find a job so maybe that’ll get me out of my comfort zone, but even w that i’ve struggled to just simply ask about wether they are hiring or not like idk, i’m gonna have to force myself out of this so yea.

I think its fair to say that neither of us were ready to be in a relationship at the time. 

Life went on, we both met other people. And three years later, I'm going through a divorce and have a 2 year old daughter. He's engaged and is set to get married in September. 

I have never stopped thinking about him and still miss him. I dream about him from time to time too. I had a dream about him a couple of days ago and decided to reach out to him. I had a couple of beers and texted his last known phone number. He replied about 10 mins later asking who I was. I replied with my name and he immediately replied with a hey, whats up? We talked for three hours, until about 1am. I express my feelings for him and told him that I still longed for him. He said if he wasn't in a relationship he would be knocking on my door right now. I asked him if he was ready to get married, he said he wasn't sure and talking to me brought up alot of feelings. I went to bed feeling warm inside. 

No contact the next morning, I email him around dinner time to apologize for putting him on the spot and also for not being there for him when he was depressed. I told him that if I could, I would do our relationship over and that I missed him alot. That was almost 4 days ago and he hasn't contacted me. I just sent him a link to two elephants hugging because he loves elephants. No reply.  

I'm guessing that his fiancee found out or he told her all about it and he decided to cut contact with me again. It hurts like the first time and I wish we could atleast be friends. I just want to feel loved again. He was always so sweet to me and the sex was amazing. I just wish I knew what I had when I had it. 

What hurts the most is that I'm not letting go and I'm desperately hoping for him to email me back."

So I have felt a deep sense of loneliness for six years now. I had a great click of friends when I was in middle school, but I had a bad fall out with them right before high school. 

I did have friends in highschool, but I never felt as happy with these new ones as I did with my old. Even in romantic relationships I felt alone (and very embarrassed bc said partner would be my only physical friend there). As a result, I felt a very deep sense of loneliness throughout my highschool years. I did have (and still do) have one old classmate who i texted constantly to cope, but we live far away from each other. If anything this worsened my loneliness because he was there, but not really there if that makes sense. We also can’t talk everyday because living seperate lives is a thing. This feeling of loneliness and dread at the idea of having no one there with me makes me feel like I’d be better off dead. 

I didn’t know how to make new friends or how to approach people. I’m very introverted so that doesnt help me either. I do feel a sense of peace when I’m working on personal art projects or something, but then I feel lonely again when I have no people close to me to share it with. I go to a community college now and am about to transfer to a new college, but sometimes I wonder if that will actually help me. I just don’t know what to do anymore and I don’t want to live out the rest of my life alone or being with people who make me feel alone."

lonely,Lonely 18th birthday blues.,"Lonely 18th birthday blues. - So I turned 18 today. I’m in the middle of my A level exams and spent the majority of the day alone. I’ve never really enjoyed birthdays as I always end the day feeling sad and disappointed and therefore guilty for how fucking ungreatful I am. I had a card from my dad, he had made it himself, which is thoughtful. However it featured a blown up picture of me stuck onto a piece of paper with the printed words of “love mum &amp; dad” on the inside. It did not contain a message, which I thought was odd.. He came home and asked if I liked it, of corse I replied I did and pointed to the mantle piece as proof of my approval as it sat perched on the ledge. Then he went and sat in his room and I didn’t see him again. Later my mother came home with some cake which was nice but after a hurried “happy birthday” she was glued to her phone which rather spoiled the moment. Me and my mother then went to my cousins houses, he didn’t know it was my birthday which shouldn’t have bothered me, but it did. We went home just before my sister returned from her last day at the nursery she had worked at for 2 years. She was accompanied with sacks up on sacks of thoughtful goodwill gifts, amount them 3 bottles of procecco. After she displayed and explained the relevance of her gifts I asked her, knowing she didn’t like them, if I could have her procecco. She agree and in the next room I downed two of them. That was about 40 mins ago so believe it or not I’m pretty drunk. And jealous. Think I’ll start crying soon. If I had more friends I suppose I could’ve talked to them I’m really don’t have any, I was never social, but I’m always lonely, double bladed sword or what! Probably should have drunk so much as I have an exam in about 10 hours, opps. Any advice how not to resent people and b a selfish shit? I’m sick of feeling like I should have more when I have no reason too."
lonely,I graduated today,"I graduated today - i graduated from a year long certification program today. it was the most difficult thing i have ever done, to transform myself into a student who puts forth effort towards something. i turned in every single assigment on time, clocked zero absences, and finished my last semester today with straight As and i also passed my monster certification exam and now an NSCA certified personal trainer. i have never completed an academic achievement like this in my entire life.

i don't have any friends, so i didnt really have anyone who knew about my schooling besides family. when i called my mom to tell her i passed my cert exam, she said ""thats great, are u ready to be picked up"" then went on to say ""so that's it right, youre done with school"", basically asking if she could be done helping me out with rides to school. no congrations. no asking how it went or how i feel. just annoyed impatience at when i would be ready to be picked up. it became clear during the conversation about the exam (that i initiated in the car on the way home) that my mother had been ignoring me talking about the details &amp; importance of this exam for a over a year. she had assumed it was just a regular final despite me saying over and over and over it was a 3 hour comprehensive professionally administered exam. she doesnt listen to a thing i say, and doesnt care. 

i thought my dad might care. when i got home im not going to lie i expected my dad to at least ask me how i did on the exam. he didnt even say anything not one word. i decided that i am not going to offer up information to people who clearly dont care about it at all. and they dont. 

am i wrong and narcissistic to be saddened by everyone's complete apathy towards something that honestly means the world to me? i wish i had a single person hit me up and say hey good luck, i know it's a big day, or ask me how the exam went. i wish one person would say congratulations  but no one did because no one cares. while everybody else is out to dinner or celebrating with their family for graduation, i will be in my room, watching youtube videos, like i do every other day of my life. i dont even care that i passed my exam at this point, because i am so depressed in my life that it isnt going to matter what kind of new job i can get. i will always just be lonely. no one is ever going to care. maybe i just suck. i understand why people wouldnt want to be around me. it just hurts really badly to have everyone be so utterly indifferent towards everything about me."

So I decided I wanted to try doing somthing that will help break the cycle of internalizing my feelings and thoughts, and since I don't have all the time in the world to do this I'll do this in segments.I'm a sophomore in college, male, Asian, relatively tall, doing great academically, got a great job that pays well, a family that watches my back, have many friends who care for me.

I'd say everything in my life is going great...but...I'm here just like many of you for one reason: I'm a failure at love.

I know, I'm lucky, many people here have so much less then me...But I was never always like this... or rather, there is more benefit the surface then things seem.

My parents had been divorced as long as I've remembered(I've never had a real father figure in my life), my mother's side of the family has it's own problems, growing up I've never had any friends...I've always been the outcast...where as the others are playing D&amp;D, I'm the only kiddo with the Warhammer...I guess it's why value my friends so much... I know what it feels like to have nothing...have absolutely no one....to put it simply, it feels like poopoo.

High School was the true turning point for me, guess I matured over the time...it was then that I fought it...fought it hard... I fought to change myself, fought to redefine myself...and it worked...I was able to be, a genuine friend...with people now who care immensely about me.

It was, and still is, the greatest feeling...you know, to know that people will greet you positively...to have people text you stuff...to have people want to hang out with you...it's a good feeling.

But, of course, we humans are greedy creatures...and,well... I guess I just wanted more...

Repression is the best way I'd describe the way I dealt with my feelings when it came to love...when I was a kid, I had this notion to be mentally strong, that my strength wasn't my durability, but the ability to keep pushing forward even after failure...still believe it...""The only way to truly fail is to learn nothing""...guess even by that criteria, I've failed...I've been hurt many times, stories I might tell later...best way to describe my love life: Me repeatedly trying to ram my head through a brick wall...you could probably guess how it usually ends.

I guess the need to find someone to love comes from the fact that I've wanted someone to walk the path of life with me...for it be a long and lonely road...you know it's funny, 'cause I've friends who've said they see themselves alone for the rest of their life...despite being in a relationship...I could only shake my head...a part of me even wants to get angry...they don't know what they're asking for...least that's what I tell myself...they don't know the pain, I reassure myself...I'm closing to 20 next month, and I've never been in a relationship...lot's of people I talk with about this have tried to reassure me, and I get what they are saying. 

 I'm young, I've got time...but I'm also slowly starting to give up...after all, there's only a certain amount of times you can ram yourself into that wall before somthing inside you wants it all to stop...if not for purposes of self-preservation...even now, I have a crush on someone who's out of my league, and I'm debating about weather to go all ""hail marry"" or beat my feelings back down with a baseball bat...the deck has been stacked again me from the start... I can already see it not working...and everyone has agreed with me...but whatever I do, it's gonna be a lose-lose situation...guess I'll have to grit my teeth one way or another...as you can see...this is how hope dies...

A part of me's already resigned to the fact that I'd probably be alone for the rest of my life... I'd even made plans on adopting kid(s) when I reach 30 or somthing...I want kids, one way or another...it ain't gonna be easy, but a challenge I want to undertake...if nothing else, then to fill my empty heart then.

These days...it's been hurting more then it used to...you know, back then it was just a thought of being lonely...now, I fell it...it quite literally physically hurts to feel lonely...it's that emptiness, that wanting...almost grasping for somthing...for someone...it's worse 'cause you know the feeling of being held...you want it so bad...you just want to be held forever...but then reality sets in...and then realizing you don't have anyone to fill that gaping hole...then it really stabs you...worst yet, you start thinking this is how things will be for the rest of your life...trying to reassure yourself that this is how life is supposed to be...try to make it feel normal...for someone as poopoo like you...ain't it only nature?...not realizing that it's probably making things worse...but you'd do anything to stop these empty feelings...it comes in waves too...I used to be able to control when it happened, I'd be at home in my room, blinds down, in bed...looking at various pictures of fictional couples...letting myself spiral downwards...letting it all out...but now?...Found myself tearing up lecture class today...had I midterm right after, so that wasn't helpful...think I passed it tho...

Guess that's enough senseless dribbling for now...got to prep for a presentation...might post more later...probably...either way, I hope everyone have a wonderful day."

lonely,It seems that it is impossible to connect with people nowadays.,"It seems that it is impossible to connect with people nowadays. - People expectations have skyrocketed these days, I think it might be related to technology a whole world of new, “ better” possibilities is opened to people, the problem is that everyone thinks the same way. Nobody wants to date the average girl nowadays, everyone wants to date the super hot model of Instagram. If you are a guy you have to be tall, muscles, nice hair (God forbids if your are balding), do at least 100 K per year, have the good car, the nice big house in Switzerland, etcetera. And even if you manage to have all those things chances are you are gonna end up lonely anyway because people is gonna be intimidated by you or even worst they are gonna take advantage of you. You

Another factor that has contributed immensely to this problem is porn. Porn has fucked up the brain of an entire generation, nobody has the energy or the balls the ask the person they like, they are too busy wanking to pixels, people has become objectify, everything is disposable nowadays, people has become disposable. 

We have become in such a shallow society is repulsive and I include myself. Is not like I have been looking all my life for a girl that loves me with no progress, No. I had my fair chances of opportunities with very nice girls but couldn't appreciate it at the time mostly because of my insecurities, my lack of self love and respect and my impossible desire to find the super hot girl of my dreams. These kind of desires cannot be satisfied, you will want always more and more, is like a drug.

So yeah, at beginning I was gonna write of how lonely I feel and all that shit, give some of my background but I am sure you guys you have more than enough of this shit, Now I am here to give some advices if i can motivated or at least make someone feel better my mission here is done.

1.  Embrace responsibility, these life is your creation. We are infinite beings, only you are in charge of this beautiful life, is your decision to create a beautiful dream or a horrible nightmare.

2. Accept and love your yourself, you are already perfect.

3.Forgive and release traumas and bitterness of the past. 

4. Quit porn. (Especially if you are a guy)

5. Replace addictions with healthy habits.

6. Lower your expectations, a lot of the people that are alone like me is just because our expectations are just too damn high, they are unrealistic.

7.Hit the gym, do meditation, read more books, turn off the TV, pray (ask God for guide).

8.Make peace with your past, if you have to call someone for forgiveness do it right now is **very liberating.**

9. Dont be afraid of going out alone, you might have luck, Who knows?.

10. Be grateful with the universe, just the fact that we here alive is already a win win.

I think that the only way to attract somebody appropriate for us is to be completely in peace and in love with yourself, everything will fall magically in place because of the principle of correspondence. Trust in the universe, Trust in yourself, if you can change your inner self you can change your world.

That was all, Sorry for my grammar mistakes English is not my first language.

God bless."
lonely,I wish I didn’t need friends,"I wish I didn’t need friends - I have a couple of people I feel somewhat close to. Unavoidably, they all let me down from time to time. I try my best to be a good friend to them, and I have learned to accept them for who they are. I know they can’t help it when they’re bad texters, or when they flake (we’ve talked about them doing that and I understand that they’re introverts and they need their space). However every now and then it gets me, as it feels I do a lot more work in these friendships than they do. I do the visits, most of the the reaching out and ask if they want to hang out, I listen to what they have to say and provide support and advice if they want to hear it. I wish I just didn’t need anyone else and could be happy with more shallower activity partners. Last two weeks I’ve kept mostly to myself doing what I wanted to do: I took myself to restaurants, movies, the gym, and hiking. It was good, actually. No getting disappointed when people cancelled at the last minute, not trying to negotiate a time that works for people who don’t reply to text messages. I still need people to have deep conversations with though. Maybe one day I’ll be ok without that as well."

lonely,I just want somewhere I can vent.,"I just want somewhere I can vent. - 24M UK (for context there been other issues in the past like a partner passing away but thats irrelevant to what I wanna get off me)

So roughly two years back I had my girlfriend at the time leave me for another guy. Now I loved this girl with every bit I could muster. Being happy isnt something that lasts for me so I always have a reserved approach which I said early in the relationship (it lasted for a year and a half), so I thought she understood it. 

The breakup didnt go well for me, in the sense it made me push everyone away. I lost that ability to put my trust in people or be comfortable being myself around them. I started noticing the only times I was asked if I wanna do stuff is if I was there to do a job or something that I was needed for (like setting up camp's or providing games and such) so I decided that they not friends worth having as I never asked them for anything. 

Its been just coming up to a year since I spoken with any of them. I mostly just spend my time playing video games if people from my wow guild or just doing nothing at all. All I have ever reallu wanted in life is to love someone and for them to love me back, but I have given up on that so I feel without anything just each day feeling the same after the other and I'm not seeing a reason to continue. 

Thats all, thank you for reading."
lonely,Venting - Cant handle loneliness,"Venting - Cant handle loneliness - Im pretty damn lonely these days. Im holding onto my sanity thanks to my precious doggo.

All my close friends have left me. 
It sucks because they helped encourage me to pursue my dream, but now that theyre left me, i really feel that i dont have any emotional support.

I do crossfit, so inherently, you may think exercise + community should combat loneliness...
But due to my schedule in pursuing my dream, the only times im able to go are usually “open gym” hours where i work out by myself. :/
When i do take a class, people who i used to consider friends, dont acknowledge me, dont seem happy to see me, and for some reason stopped inviting me out to social outings, which have made me sour towards them too.
My ex is also a coach there, so when i am able to take a class, it really weighs heavily on me to see her. How she could move on so easily and treat me like dirt.

In pursuing my dream, i have to deal with a hardass coach, who seems to be particularly critical of me, and often putting me down.

Literally no one in my family talks to me; after one falling out or another, theyve all shunned me except for my mom. But even when i talk to her, she clearly doesnt pay attention to what i say. I can see her zoning out; i will sometimes say something totally random in the middle of my sentence to see if she’ll notice. She doesnt. Ill even go as far as to confront and ask her what i just said, to which she admits she doesnt know.

I never really have anyone to vent to. 

I often have vivid and imaginative dreams; no one to share them with. 

I want to try new restaurants, watch new movies, etc, but often have no one to share the experience with, which usually makes me not want to go out and do things.

I literally feel a sense of dread when i meet new friends and or get close to people, because i sincerely want to tell them how much they mean to me... but when i have, theyve all inevitably left me.

Currently in a rut in terms of job/finance, so i cant even afford to see my therapist anymore.

I try to distract myself with reading, video games, and tv.... but in the passing times in between, i can never forget how lonely i really am."
lonely,Girl at work is being too nice to me.,"Girl at work is being too nice to me. - She's beautiful. She's cute, funny, a gamer, and an amazingly talented artist. Obviously a woman that perfect is taken. We also have alot of stuff in common so I often try to joke around with her or talk about video games, memes and stuff.

She's been such a sweetheart the entire time we've been working together. She once drew a heart on a peice of paper she had to fill out and hand to me, she invited me to her Minecraft server, she even called me cute for trying to memorize all star lyrics. But she knows how alone I am, My shy/awkward personality makes it obvious. I've told her how I had lost all my high school friends. Maybe she's being nice out of pity.

Normally I don't have serious personal talks with people but we did yesterday. She told me I think too much. I am socially anxious so she has a point. However, she's the only person to have ever brought that up to me. She even drew something for me, about my overthinkig. It blew my mind, the drawing is perfect.

During lunch we were chatting, normally I'd quickly run out of things to say and the conversation would suddenly end but everytime that was about to happen she would ask a question to continue talking. It seems like a small gesture but it means so much to me. I'm certain she knows that.

I know she isn't flirting, she's in a serious relationship right now but as time goes on she seems more and more like the perfect girl. I know I can't be with her. I don't know how to deal with this. While what she's been doing should make me feel better it's had the opposite effect. I want to quit because I can't handle it anymore. I'm falling for this girl when I shouldn't be."

lonely,"Honestly, I just need to let some stuff out and this seems like a good place","Honestly, I just need to let some stuff out and this seems like a good place - Hi r/lonely, sorry, this is awkward because I've never made a post like this before. Well, I feel lonely(in case the fact that I'm posting on r/lonely didn't give that away) and I feel powerless. Oh I should introduce myself first. I'm 17, in high school. I'm a guy and pretty nerdy ig, like into Star Wars, comic books, etc. I love art and movies, super into psychology. I love to swim, and helping people a passion(check post history for specifics). 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I don't know why I feel the way I do. I've got a few really fantastic friends, both irl and online. My parents are (usually) pretty nice, I get along with most my classmates and teachers. Yet, I always find myself so lonely, and idk why. And it feels wrong to complain about it, because I see so many of y'all talking about other issues that feel so much more real, like no friends and stuff, and who am I to bitch about being lonely. The friends I have are in school friends basically, because the minute school ends, we never meet up irl or do anything fun together. At most we have a discord chat, and as nice as it is, because like I said, really great dudes, but nothing could replace just hanging out and doing wacky stuff. Doesn't help that I basically have no control on my life rn. I can't drive by myself(started late), I'm in tough classes that I really couldn't care less about because college, and I feel so trapped. It's like my entire life is stuck between school and home and that's it. Nothing more than that. It used to be nice during swim season, but that ended too.

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel like it's this lack of contact that made me value romantic relationships way more than I probably should, but just seeing people around me having someone who always shows affection and care and support, and I don't have that, it makes the loneliness thing worse. I mean if the only relationships( only 2)  I've had are an online ones, that says something, because I'd most likely never meet those people. I mean, I see people around me driving, having sex, and moving on to bigger things in life and I am stuck here, alone, never even had a first kiss. This also leads to a ton of self esteem issues, like I find my self really unlovable at times, and wonder why tf anyone would waste their time with someone as pathetic as me, when she could go for someone way better(not like anyone confesses their love for me anyways but still).  Questioning your self worth isn't a good thing but I sure do it a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

But like, I feel like I have no real goals or future. I'm going to college because people keep telling me that I need to go to get a good job and get money. I take hard classes and join internships because they will look good on college apps. And this also has led to me being an anxious mess a lot. It's a vicious cycle of not seeing any purpose or path in life, so that leads to no motivation, no motivation leads to bad grades, bad grades leads to anxiety, and anxiety leads to being more clueless in what to do with my life and so on. And even though I have like friends and stuff, I feel like I'm the one that reaches out to talk and stuff, like they only talk to me when they either think I'm depressed or if they want to know if an assignment is due the next day. The only time I feel nice and good, is when I am helping people online with their issues, because if I can't help myself at least I can help someone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like, honestly sometimes I feel like I would be really content just dying, like if I somehow died, I'd be really okay with that. I'm pretty sure if it wasnt for my friends and family, I would have ended it all like a thousand times over by now.    


I might be depressed, who knows. But rn, I have this stress on me with classes, and ACT, and internships and honestly, I just want to go. Sometimes it feels like even friends don't really care and the love from family is conditionally based on how I do in school. I can't help not feel sad."
lonely,Craving physical contact,"Craving physical contact - I get next to no physical contact and it depresses me greatly. Girls find me attractive but then usually it's a night or two of having someone then they tend to want to keep it as just a hookup, probably because i meet most of them from tinder.

I don't really know any friends at school so I'm quiet 98% of the time. I have a lot on my mind. 

I always get in trouble because my mom always thinks I'm on the phone at 3am and honestly all the time, when really I'm not....I'm talking to myself. I make myself laugh, I cry to myself when I'm frustrated.

i cut everyone out.  i've been alone for year.  i don't have friends anymore.  i have a couple hobbies, i get out, but its always on my own.  i can enjoy a lot of this time for the most part.  its not always (thankfully), me sitting around loathing my circumstances, but unless its my mom i really don't get to share my time with anyone since this happened.

&amp;#x200B;

i say i cut everyone out, and i did, but i don't actually feel that that's the case.  all of my friends knew that my ex was cheating on me with our mutual friend.  they all knew.  they planned two birthday parties for members of our group without telling me so that my ex and my best friend could enjoy the evening with the gang.  i confronted a couple people about this, and they told me they didn't want to get involved.  i realize i might be a bitter person about all of this, but that explanation never satisfied me.  why'd they plan stuff without me if they didn't want to get involved?  isn't that a contradiction?

&amp;#x200B;

i don't want people to be judgmental or cast stones for me, i know that's not what i want. its hard for me to articulate how i feel to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

like i said, i've been alone.  i've been alone now for longer than i ever have been in my whole life.  i try to force myself to consider whether or not there is something seriously wrong with me, and that this flaw is the cause of my loneliness.  i feel extremely betrayed by my friends.  why'd they invite my ex into the group knowing she was a cheater?  and my best friend - i wasn't expecting people to cast him out or shun him, nor did i want that.  but what hurt me was seeing no reaction from anyone to the events going on.  it really messes with my head.  was i supposed to not be hurt by what happened?  i care about people in general, and i love my friends.  

&amp;#x200B;

is there some critical component of human compassion or understanding that i'm missing?  why am i this hurt when no one around me really seemed to think that anything hurtful had taken place?  why'd they just go along with my best friend and my ex in their new relationship?  it seems so slimy to me.  why'd everyone adopt such a complacent attitude (at least from my perspective)?

&amp;#x200B;

i thought people stuck up for each other if something bad happened or if someone was wronged.  aren't friends supposed to try to do right by each other?  i don't get it.  my mom is really encouraging.  i have a therapist too.  both of them make things much easier for me.  they make it easier for me to love myself when i feel alone, and have made it possible for me to just keep on with my life.  i am grateful for that.   they both tell me i'll meet people.  i don't doubt that, but i do doubt myself.

&amp;#x200B;

ever since this happened, i've just felt deficient.  like i'm missing a factory part, like somehow when i interact with people they can sense my deficiency on a subconscious level that directs them away from me.  i work in a big city, i am always surrounded by people.  people confound me.  i used to really resent the people that seem happy.  now all i see is that there are so many people that are just, i dunno, people are so complicated.  

&amp;#x200B;

i think people don't know how much we actually love each other.  i think in a lot of ways right now the world lends itself more towards obfuscating that fact.  i love and i miss my friends so much.  i want to love those guys and be around them, but i can't.  they really hurt me, and unless my personal compass is totally wrong i probably shouldn't go back to those people.  i love and miss people so much in general.  i playfully use the term ""wilderness"" to describe how i feel about where i'm at right now emotionally.  its perfect.  i look around at all of these people all day, they've all got SO MUCH going on.  i feel like i can't reach anyone, and if i did, is that the right person?  will it work?  is there any substance here.  its like i'm meeting fucking Klingons or some shit.  i have zero precedent to rely on with respect to forging new connections after the ""loss"" that i personally feel i suffered.

&amp;#x200B;

i know there's got to be at least two or three people out there i can love with my full heart.  there's no way i sit here sometimes dreaming about loving new friends, a new partner - without at least a couple of those people actually existing somewhere in the world.  maybe not a group, but maybe A friend?  A partner?

&amp;#x200B;

i'm just fucking lost though.  honestly, it really is like being in the wilderness.  no orientation, no trail to follow or a general sense of what course to take, AND NO COUNSEL.  that's the worst part, having almost no reference or input from anyone that i relate to on a personal level.  it fucking blows.

&amp;#x200B;

thoughts?

hugs out there to people on reddit.  today wasn't a horrible day for me at all, so it was a good day to write.  but i'm sure there are a lot of people out there who are hurting.  godspeed to all of you."
lonely,Are there any people here over 40?,"Are there any people here over 40? - I'm just curious where the age range is. A lot of the posts here are very enlightening and close to home. Nothing here seems immature in any way. I saw a comment before creating this post about someone who's alone doesn't enjoy being that way. It's just that being among people has disappointed them. That's very much where I'm coming from. I don't even know where to start and what to include. I was a UC Berkeley student who left school to go to Israel/Palestine to work with an NGO. I ended up marrying a Refusenik and worked in several NGOs all around the world. We then moved back to the Bay Area where I wrote and self-published a novel and became very close friends with an MD who was actually gay but married because he was a refugee with an incredibly conservative family. My husband hated the doctor though and eventually we divorced because he wanted to have facial reconstruction surgery (it was \*somewhat\* medically necessary but he could have done it slower with braces.) My MD was my only friend for quite a while after that. Right at the point where I'd finally moved into a new place and gotten a job that could have potentially sustained me, the MD's wife found out about both the fact that her husband was gay and that he'd confided more in me than in her. As a result, she made a false allegation against me that I'd threatened her and cops show up at my house and demand I come with them to a psych hospital. I eventually got everything worked out but I lost my new place as a result and I lost my only friend. A year later I crushed my ankle and had no permanent home in San Francisco. When I went to the Urgent Care clinic, they told me, ""We have to take you on the stretcher around the corner to the hospital \*right\* now!"" I said I wouldn't have anyone who could help if I was in a cast and I wanted to try to arrange something and come back. However, because I was only a consultant I had no insurance at the time. The clinic failed to mention that if I didn't have surgery at that moment I'd be unable to have my ankle reconstructed at any future time. It was 3.5 years before I was finally able to get healthcare that covered me for Reconstruction surgery at a hospital that was actually capable of restoring movement. The crushed ankle had improperly re-healed itself and even after I started paying $200/month for a good PPO, I had to leave San Francisco and move to southern CA and finally sign up for a $490/month PPO to have access to Cedars-Sinai, the only hospital out of the 5 I'd been to over the whole of 2016 who had a surgeon confident he could restore movement. The surgery was successful but unfortunately the OR nurse missed the fact that the xanax script I had was contraindicated with the oxy the surgeon gave me for the post-op pain. I went into a state of hypoxia, spent 6 days in the ICU and 3 weeks in Neuro-Rehab. I lost 60% of my hearing and ended up with a mild traumatic brain injury. It primarily affects my short term memory. That was in 2017. I've literally just been hiding in my mom's house in the Los Angeles suburbs ever since. I have a therapist but he isn't a real friend. Genuine friends  are like family. People who feel like family straight away. I've met a some people since moving down here but I recoil from most of them. Developing a friendship fatigues me physically. I actually got tested for sleep apnea because unless I was simply sitting in my room, anything I tried to do exhausted me. I lived in the Bay Area from '95-2017, with about 3-4 years spent overseas. I'm out of place down here in southern California but I fear I may be out of place even if I returned to SF. I don't expect any replies. I just thought I'd write out my story. And I'm 42 by the way."
lonely,Ghosted by my new friend,"Ghosted by my new friend - Short backstory of my life, I live with my parents, and I’ve been with my current girlfriend for almost four years now. I see her almost every weekend, and these three people are truly some of the best I could hope for.

That being said, I don’t have many friends, and those that I do have, I don’t see often. I met someone through Facebook about 3 weeks ago,and her and I had really hit it off. We had a lot in common, and we planned on hanging out relatively soon. We talked quite a bit, and other than one day where she said she had some emotional stuff going on, we talked at least a few minutes every day.

Last week, I asked her if she still wanted to hang out over the weekend, and from there she just vanished. She hasn’t responded to memes, messages checking in to see if she is okay, or anything else. I gave up reaching out about 3 days ago, but this is still bothering me quite a bit. I’ve had this happen before, but this one has been rougher. Has anyone else gone through something like this?"

lonely,I Think I'm Bipolar,"I Think I'm Bipolar - I believe I may be bipolar, and I feel ashamed for it. I change moods so quickly. I've mentioned before how my shitty abusive childhood effects me today, and how anime and cartoons and such can trigger depression for me. Well, I've been doing alright lately. Not good, not horrible. Just alright. But, that's ages better than I usually do. Anyways, I was talking to a few friends of mind, because the three of us were talking and laughing and making jokes as we waited for my our other friend to get on. During this, we brought up Senko-san, that weird wolf loli that's apparently ""800 years old"". Anyways, I made some jokes about it to make my friends laugh (I combat pain and anxiety with humor and wit), but it put me from being alright and having fun to being downright suicidal and wanting to die. I think it's the innocence and near perfection of anime and cartoons and movies and other media like that that triggers it. If I see a pretty girl, it happens. If I see an anime, it happens. Cartoons, movies, some video games. Hell, even when I see simple hentai pop-up adds or hentai in general (though I don't see them for the reasons you may imply). Just seeing innocent, or cute, or just general things like that, it can put me from being in a great mood, to wanting to straight of end my own life. I think I'm bipolar on top of everything else, and it scares me. Makes me feel like an even bigger freak than I am. I don't know what to do. Why can't I just enjoy these things like a normal person? Like I used to be able to? I don't want them to depress me or make me want to die. I don't get it. Why am I such a freak?"
lonely,I think all day and I can’t control my thoughts. Depression really making me numb recently. Don’t wanna breakdown again,I think all day and I can’t control my thoughts. Depression really making me numb recently. Don’t wanna breakdown again - I’m a 15 year old boy and have always had anxiety and played video games and had online friends. Since I was 14 I’ve lost joy in talking to people online over games. I spend all school day probably saying two sentences and when I get home I am extremely agitated and irritable. I’ve had one friend since kindergarten and we would hangout everyday and spend hours online going through every gaming phase together. we were like brothers and we talk to each other about our emotions but recently he’s been drifting into another friend group. He ignores me and leaves me on read but when we talk irl we still get a long. I haven’t hung out with someone in like a year and not one person thinks about me in a day. I  have no one ever texting me and in the generation I live in with social media this really fucks up your brain and leaves you with the fear of missing out and etc. I sleep all day and I don’t even know if what I said made sense cause I’m tired but that would be nice if someone read this unless I’m just lonely on a lonely subreddit

lonely,Sometimes I feel like there's something wrong with me that drives people away.,"Sometimes I feel like there's something wrong with me that drives people away. - I just spent the time writing this for an askreddit question, though I doubt people will see. I figured I would share with a community who would understand.

I grew up with a girl, we will call her Suzie. She was my best friend, we did everything together and saw eachother daily. What ever I had I tried to have 2 of so we could both play together. From my view point apperantly we were inseparable. She was a grade over me but just barely. Well I started 5th grade and she started middle school. That day we never talked again (till about 7 years later). I tried so hard to contact her, all I wanted was to see my best friend again. She was so important to me. Finally one day I was playing in the tree in the front yard and her car pulled up to the stop sign. I got her this time, a car window was down, she couldn't ignore me this time. So I jumped out of the tree and ran up. Her mom was surprised and happy to see me. I noticed her in the back and I waved and said hi. Then I heard ""MOM I DONT LIKE HER JUST GO."" and they sped off. That's when I finally felt abandoned. I always struggled with friends but she always stayed with me before. But now she left me too. I started the first week of 5th grade completely alone.

Until someone who we will call Mark. Mark got transferred to my school when he moved. I don't remember how the friendship started but it was almost immediate. We hung out every day and I couldn't wait to see him anytime we had the chance. We had the same likes but he was definitely smarter then me haha. Everyday he would finish his school work early. I would go as fast as I could, eventually i got fast enough that I would finish too. We would play chess everyday at school while the other kids finished work. I don't think I ever won. But I just loved talking and playing. Sometimes I would study chess hard and be so convinced I would win. Nope I didnt, but the game was funner haha. That is until we graduated 5th grade. My parents are way to church obsessed and thought middle school would ruin me. So I was pulled into homeschool. I keept calling Mark but he wouldn't answer. I didn't want to be annoying so I would call every other day, then every few days, then once in awhile. Eventually I got a call back! I was so happy. It was his mom... telling me to not call back. One day awhile later I saw him at a store, I was excited but worried. We ended up accidentally making eye contact and I waved and smiled. But he looked back and glared, and walked away. I had been abandoned again. I didn't make any more friends after that, untill.

We will call him Jake. I had met him years prior at the coast (an hour and a half away) we had alot of fun together and our parents were good friends! But we never saw eachother because of the distance. We were to young to text so we enjoyed the memory's but never saw eachother again. Finally he came down again and we hung out. We had an absolute blast. This was the first time in a long time I was so happy to be with someone (or really that happy at all). We promised we would find a way to keep in contact. We exchanged phone numbers and texted eachother as he rode home.

The next day I texted him but he didn't respond. I figured he was busy. I learned that night I had been abandoned again. He committed suicide. I cried off and on for days. I refused to think about it again for a long time. Since then I still haven't been able to keep a close friend. They all leave or stop talking to me. But I don't usually get as close as I used to. I'm having trouble these days being so lonely. But I can't so much about it. Being homeschooled I have no idea where to meet people. And I'm still to young to go to bars and such. Maby someday I can be close to someone my age again. I want to so badly.

Now of days I volunteer my time at different places such as shelters. I try to make friends my age and even did make one, but he moved and I was alone again. I will admit I have some wonderful friends who are not my age. I love them dearly, but the age gap prevents us from doing anything outside of volunteer work and I don't blame them. I do enjoy them anytime im around them though. They always thank me for my work, and wonder why people my age don't want to stay with me. I want to take the complements and I appreciate them more then words can express but inside I feel like I'm not worth it. People I've loved in the past sure didn't see me as worth it. So I work hard trying to prove I am, yet I never feel worth enough."

It's been like this since 2015.  And eating is the only way to make myself forget about it for awhile. And their are times where I think about ending my life and when I do think about it I'll try to do some hobbies like play video games or watch my favorite youtubers or watch anime and cartoons.

lonely,Checking in with you again,"Checking in with you again - I think I pushed the limit the last time, a few months ago was it? 

Before I could probe for, some kind of reaction. 

I sent you jokes after the first gap because I thought that's what you liked me for, and was the only way I could be re-approachable again. I wasn't trying to mock. 

I didn't register that you just didn't like me. I thought that wasn't something that was going to happen. I thought it could also be there, it just needed work. I thought we were just being stubborn and proud and it could all be amended some day when I got the maturity. I said something that was horribly boring, and half-wrong. You had no time for me any more.

I apologised, I told you I wasn't trying to re-establish contact. I was. You entertained me. I forgot something about you. You took that to mean something. You stopped. I tried to send you jokes. You blocked me. 

I waited again. I pretended to find you on a technicality to save face, to be incidental. You didn't like that, or you recognised the name. You shut it off. I started conversation. I didn't mind if you never answered, and you didn't. A few weeks I could tell you things. I didn't know you saw them. You did for that long, saw everything I wanted to say - well, not everything. You stopped it at one point, I don't know why. 

You were then completely blocked off. I knew any attempt would be pointless in a different way to all the others.

You don't hate me anymore. You are tired and bored with me, and my behaviour is now unimportant, bland, and just intolerable. 

I have thought about you less than any other time. I looked at your pictures so long that they don't look like anything. Everything else is closed off. I saw some pictures of you and I started to notice the small obstacles of recognition, and that scared me a bit. You had tanned facial stuff, linings on your nose. 

There was a feeling I had for a year and a half, or a bit more. I remembered a very distinct emotion when we were on the couch. I can only remember now the blood vessels in your face and the goofy teeth showing, and your smell. The emotion is lost, and there's nothing similar in my experience since then. 

When I said I was alone, I did mean it. If you wanted me punished for what I did, I think I did get it. You know those people were my only friends, the happiest point in my life, and I had to be removed. Everyone else since then has gone away too.

 I have gotten uglier, interestingly enough. I walk around with everything gawky showing. Projecting some form of pride, some interface to support the selfish way of doing things I only know. People talk to me only incidentally, and the best treat me sympathetically subnormal. 

I've looked at other girls. I've had shallow attractions. But they are the same as a television crush or that kind of thing. The fawning, the obsessions aren't there like I had for you and a couple before you. Either I'm emotionally different or people need to look at you for you to get attached. 

I have a career path, I think. It won't match my career ambitions but nothing really could. When you don't have friends you have to inflate yourself to  compensatory levels. It isn't good or compatible with low motivation and general mediocrity. 

I won't kill myself. That has gone away. Too impractical when I work in my own frame of motivation. I don't really know what's going to happen now.

I expected to make  friends in the school, I did. It was too big, I was too stiff, I was too much like myself. The year will be over soon. 

3 months are coming, and they will be lonely in a way that is different and before.  now. '10. I am scrawny, with my head bent gawkily forward, with a pointy and pinched nose over mishapen lips. I have a grotesquely angular head with big ears, one sticking out more than the other. I have hair which exposes the rot of the haid when short, and ridiculous when long. I am weak and weigh nothing. I have no strength. I eat like a child. I do nothing but pretend to be other people, people in stories and the talented people who wrote them. 

I will be in college, if this goes well. I won't be a romantically sad renegade kid, I will be an unpleasant physical sore. I will be one of the disfigured people you see on the streets or on buses, wondering who they, how their background has allowed them, how many of them they are. 

I don't know what you're doing now. I know you're probably more emotionally charged. Probably dealing with eating issues or something that's come from them. Your friends have probably changed since I last investigated. Incidentally, I see one of them myself around by circumstance. I imagine though, you still have people. You were lovable, and not in a way which was maintained by pretense or by the most convenient possible scenario. You were attractive, pleasant, and agreeable. 

There is benefits in being stale, myself. I don't know what I would or could do if I saw another man/boy touch you. I am possessive. You belong to me, in my head. There is nothing that should change that. It would be wrong and vile if someone touched you. Whatever's here now can be mended. I am sorry, this is irrelevant. This is not applicable. I will never see you again. If I did see you, I would wait for you to talk. I have nothing to say. It would be your turn.

I would only ask for engagement, if I could every wish for anything. You marked the end of my optimism. I am still young and that is a boring thing to say. But where am I going to live now again? I am only preparing myself for when everything gets very grey and very unseemly.

I can't say I love you. I don't know you and was never going to be able to, since whenever it was that point when I dissolved my credibility. I was obsessed and loved a version of you. I can't sustain that image as I am losing the depth, the microscopic detail. It's gone now. It's gone now and it doesn't transfer. 

The other wish, I have decided more specifically. I would have you answer what I should have asked you. Why did you like me? Was it your sickness? Was it an illusion I had made in that place? 

Whatever the answer, when can you perceive, the most discernible time it left you? The simplest answer would be the first disconnection, but that is an unsatisfying answer. 

I am just checking in. I am rarely emotional, in the way I used to be, only enough to talk for this. The next one will be different. More boring, again."

It's just an idea, obviously we'd have to work with people's different schedules and that sort of thing. I just really think this  loneliness issue is something which we should do something about. If anyone thinks it's a good idea, comment with your own ideas on things we could do together.

lonely,Idontfuckingknow,"Idontfuckingknow - up until a bit less then a year ago I was happy with my life.

Around 6 years ago my parents got a divorce, I was very angry and sad at the time, eventually I got over it, I think a big part of that was being able to just distract myself with my friends.

A few years ago I grew really close to a girl, think I fell in love with her but I fucked it up and we stopped talking to eachother, at the same time I was drifting apart with my friends and I think she started dating one of them.

Made new friends that I had a lot of fun with and we are still friends now.

Met one guy in particular I could talk to about feelings and stuff which was not something I could do before, this was when I started thinking about my life and disliking some things in it, mostly things about myself.

Helped him and my other ""friend"" get together and then they both kinda stopped talking to me for a while, we were both kinda mad at each other and then I just dealt with my own shit for a while.

At this point I hardly sleep, I don't tell anyone about how I feel, I am starting to decline in school but no one has noticed yet. I feel like I only live for my mom, in a lot of ways I feel like a burden to her but I'd like to feel the positives of my existence outweigh the negatives in terms of my effect on other people.

I don't want to live for another person but I don't think I can find any reason to live my life for my self.

I have been in love once, no one has liked me in the slightest in that way as far as I'm concerned, pretty sure some girls thought I was good looking at some point but they never bothered to talk to me so they weren't interested in me on any greater level.

I want someone I can look at without feeling ashamed, I want someone to be able to look at me without being affraid of people around them judging them.  
I want to be able to touch someone and be touched by someone else without any of us having to make excuses or apologize.  
I want to be able to talk to someone in the middle of the night when I can't sleep and I need someone I'm close with to share my thoughts and feelings with.

However I feel I don't deserve any of this, I haven't found anyone that's interested in me and no one I am very interested in either. So I guess it won't happen, but that's just the way it is, right? Things are shit and you deal with it, until you can't deal with it and get drowned in shit."

I'm pretty ok with being alone...in fact I enjoy it, but at times I feel annoyed that I don't have a close friend and I honestly get a little frustrated because of lack of physical affection.

\--

**What I'm looking for is some sort of interactive media (probably a video game?) that could simulate the kind of relationships I'm lacking.** I know it sounds creepy...but I don't care, and I am not willing to put any effort into real people right now... I think it would be unfair that I half ass it.

I see a lot of VR girlfriend simulators and such...it seems interesting to me but I wonder if there is anything similar available that is more catered to females? I also like the idea of roleplay...are there any online instances of this?

**Any recommendations? Essentially I'm asking for a replacement for intimate human relationships until I sort myself out and I'm not so fucked up anymore**"

As soon as he saw me he sauntered up and meowed at me. He kept rubbing against my leg so I reached down to pet him. After sitting with him awhile I had to go and he followed me home. It was the highlight of my week.

I'm sorry mom, but I don't know what to do, when my sister has problems you focus on her, but you won't acknowledge the fact that I don't understand how to socialise, so I'm the one that always gets blamed when something goes wrong.

lonely,Feelings and Thoughts are my solace. For now.,"Feelings and Thoughts are my solace. For now. - After years of having relations with my “family” all I ever wanted was to be alone. They never left me alone for the fact of their own good and to use me as a scapegoat so they could avoid whatever they wanted avoided. So, now I always have the great urge to leave even my grandmother and my uncle’s apartment and sit outside the apartment in the complex and be in my car to watch netflix or listen to music before, after and even off of work. I of course smoke some weed every now and then to rid of my thoughts and demons of my fucked up mental health.
I’m even fucking my mental even more by falling in love and spending the time with someone who doesn’t seem to care or want to try to converse or anything. Unless I’m the one who needs to take initiative on that, but I kind of have and haven’t. (Anxiety is the main reason) I try to talk to others but I feel I bum them down and my few real friends are always busy. I try to find the motivation to be more outgoing and do more things but that doesn’t fit anywhere. Been trying to do card conjuring for entertainment for others, yet even that I’m losing a grip on. I guess posting here is either a mistake or something I need. People tell me I’m a good person and I’m good with a set of skills. It seems as if I don’t know what to think or do sometimes. This is all I have to say.

lonely,"Lonely, but not so much alone.","Lonely, but not so much alone. - I’m stuck in a time and place of my life where I can’t seem to find anyone in my everyday life to simply give me the love and or feeling of care/interest that I don’t feel what so ever pretty much everyday. My family makes me feel pretty left out, sometimes I feel judged by them and hated against but there is times it’s alright and doesn’t bother me much. The majority of the time I’m trying to actually care and say something that is important to me or even put in my simple bit of advice/opinion and it gets slid off every time. No one seems to even care about me unless I have something for them, my own dad gives my friends more attention and I’ve never gotten close and still can’t because he can’t seem to let me in his world. He loves me so much but man sometimes he just doesn’t show it, I feel so lonely surrounded by so many people. My own girlfriend makes me feel lonely, I can’t fucking live like this. I’m going bat shit insane and it’s making me just out of control. I’ve been so deep into it recently I can’t hardly sleep. I get either 0-3 hours of sleep max a night, I can feel it take toll on my head and body. I can’t live with myself anymore, I’ve fucked my whole year up so bad and my parents hate/love me. My friends on another hand don’t even show me the interest they did before. I feel so left out unless I’m alone with just one person, and sometimes even I feel left out then. My friends act so weird around me and it almost feels like they’re making fun of me in the sneakiest way. It is really making me overload with stress, anxiety, and overall insanity. I don’t know what to do with my life anymore, I have no one to go and talk to my problems too. Not one person to open up and say something too.. instead I’m here writing about it or just thinking over and over about it till I can’t anymore. I don’t wake up happy anymore, maybe I should just stop worrying about everyone else and just stick to myself, find out how to cope with the loneliness feeling and just ride my days out. I try so hard to gain attention in the least attention seeking ways. Sometimes I just sit and watch, it’s really one hell of a feeling. Empty, and lost. Not a care left in the world for your life or future.

I’ve lost so much this year... I fucked my junior year up, got lost into some girl who never ever treated me right besides when she wanted too, my best friends from since I was 4 are dying out on me. My dad who’s never seemed to care still doesn’t really care about what I have to say, everyone else though is a whole other story it really kills me inside and I mean it. My mom is the only one who has made me feel any sorts of love recently, and it sucks because it’s not often.

lonely,Loneliness has been killing me for years and I'm ready to give up the fight,"Loneliness has been killing me for years and I'm ready to give up the fight - I'm going to kill myself on Tuesday night. Unfortunately due to my living circumstances I don't have many good options to do so (can't buy a gun, nowhere high enough to hang myself reliably, don't want to do it publicly so can't go jump in front of the subway, no prescriptions for any serious drugs), but I bought a bottle of acetaminophen and some alcohol and will be downing as much of it as possible. According to the research I've done this should do it if I can take enough of both at the same time. If that doesn't work I'll hang myself with a belt over my closet door. I'm flying home tomorrow to go to a music festival with my Dad, I'll get to see my parents one last time and see my Mom for mother's day and hopefully enjoy myself for a little bit to temporarily make the pain go away. I'll fly back to school Monday morning, go to my last classes of the semester Monday and Tuesday, go to a meeting at 7 on Tuesday for my student organization, then come back to my apartment and kill myself.

This isn't technically a suicide note, although I am going to write one Tuesday afternoon. But there are certain things I can't say there, things that need to remain anonymous, so I'm using this as a means to get it all out. Maybe some people will read it, or maybe they won't, but I have to have it out somewhere. I want my struggle to be documented in some way, even if it is on an anonymous internet forum that nobody will read.

I'm 21 and a half years old and have never really been happy despite living a relatively easy life. I'm a white dude, my parents are relatively well-off (self-made millionaires, albeit barely), I've done well in school with relatively little effort, got into a solid state university 8 hours away from home that was perfect for the field I wanted to go into. I've had good internships and was recently elected President of my student organization going into my senior year.

It seems to most people like I have a lot going for me but there's one thing I've never had: friends. Sure I've had friends in the loose sense, mostly in high school, but they always felt more like acquaintances to me. I could never connect with any of them on a deeper level or discuss any truly personal matters. This was my own fault. My social anxiety prevented me from ever being vulnerable or talking about my feelings with anyone. All of my friend group seemed to always be closer with each other than with me. I would occasionally get invited to do things with them but never as much as everyone else. All of the fond memories were made without me present. I honestly can't remember the last time I had a birthday party, which is emblematic of the situation I think. I'm finishing my junior year in college, my birthday is in December. I haven't had one since elementary school as far as I can tell. I always spend it alone. I was essentially always a side character in everyone else's stories, one of those people that could disappear with nobody noticing. This is a recurring theme that will come up again, it has been the defining characteristic of my pathetic life.

Although this always led to me struggling with mild depression in high school, things got infinitely worse in college. As I said I went to a school pretty far away from home by most standards, and this might've been the biggest mistake of my life. It's perfect for my professional field, and is a good school, but I didn't know a single soul here. As far as I'm aware nobody from my high school has ever even gone here, at least not in recent history. At least in high school I had casual friends and people I could talk to sometimes. In college I have nobody. My social anxiety and complete lack of self-esteem led me to never talking to anyone Freshman year. It seemed like everyone else had already formed friend groups within a week, meanwhile I was alone in the corner unable to even attempt to talk to anyone. My roommate was a foreign student who mostly hung out with other students from his country, speaking another language, and we had very little in common. We got along alright but were never going to be friends in a serious way. Not long into my Freshman year I got to the point where I wouldn't talk to anyone all day for days on end. I'd wake up, go to class and maybe say a few words in there. Go eat at the dining hall alone. Go do my homework in a lounge or the library by myself. Come back to my dorm room to watch TV or play video games, again alone. I'd have a few words once a week at a club meeting. Nothing else. This essentially carried over to my Sophomore year, with the only difference being that I now lived in an apartment completely alone. I still live in that apartment at the end of my junior year, and not much has changed. I'm pretty much always alone.

My romantic life has been nonexistent. I believe I was the only kid in my high school class of about 90 people to not go to prom either Junior or Senior year. Everyone I know went to at least one of the two, most both. I had too much social anxiety to ask any girl I actually liked because I knew they would say no, and I had too much anxiety to ask a less attractive girl I didn't like but could probably get because I thought my friends would make fun of me. I never really attempted to even talk to girls in a serious way until my senior year due to lack of confidence and anxiety. I asked out one girl over text, was rejected. Started ""talking to"" another that I thought had given me some signals. Was thinking about asking her out, until one of my friends sent me a text. His GF was friends with her. He asked his GF if this girl was seeing anyone, he knew someone who was interested. His GF said ""oh god please don't let it be (my name)"". Needless to say I stopped trying with girls for a while after that.

Once I got to college my confidence was so in the tank and I was so depressed I never even tried with girls. I kind of just resigned myself to thinking that eventually I would meet the right person and things would find a way to fall into place, and I managed to be comfortable with that for a while. I honestly didn't stress about this part of my life for the first couple years I was in college. Mostly because I didn't really meet any girls I was actually interested in. Sure I knew some that were very physically attractive, having class with them or being in clubs with them or whatever, and I would've dated them for that alone out of desperation, but I made no attempt to pursue any of them because I didn't actually catch feelings for them. That changed somewhat recently and ended in disaster.

There's a girl that's in the same student organization I'm in, the one I just became President of. She's the same year as me, from the same area of the country despite it being 7+ hours away from our school. We are going into the same professional field and I actually have an internship lined up for this summer with the same place she did last summer. Despite having all this in common, we never really talked much until this semester. No reason in particular I guess, just didn't happen. But near the beginning of this semester she asked for my number. Soon after she added me on snapchat. She started texting and snapping me, one of the few people who actually initiated conversations with me instead of the other way around. She commented on my instagram post of my weightlifting (I post on instagram like once a year). I've lost about 50 pounds and become somewhat built over the last 1.5 years or so and can lift pretty heavy. I'm still a bit overweight but I've started to be somewhat accepting of my appearance over the last few months, and I actually had a smidgen of self-confidence for the first time I can remember. This girl might be interested in me, I thought. She's a sorority girl, pretty attractive and definitely somewhat out of my league, but frankly her last boyfriend was way below her league and less attractive than I am, so I thought I had a shot. Our favorite hockey team made the playoffs and was playing the team in the city we go to school in. A hell of a coincidence, and I saw it as an opportunity. I asked if she wanted to go to the opening playoff game, and she said yes. Oh shit it might be happening. We went to the game and had a decent time. Our team lost. She asked a lot of personal questions that nobody has asked me about in a long time, some of them never. She said she wanted to get to know me better because she felt like she didn't know much about my personal life. She asked me about my dating life. Did I have a crush on anyone? (I lied and said no) What was I looking for in a relationship? I said something serious with someone I actually cared about, and I wasn't super interested in casual dating. Which was true. Anyways, the night ended and we went our separate ways.

About a week and a half later we got together at a bar to watch another hockey game later in the series. I felt like I had missed an opportunity when we went to the game together to try to connect more, so this time I tried to be the one asking questions. Unfortunately this turned to me figuring out she probably didn't have feelings for me the way I had for her. I asked if she was involved with anyone, she said she had no men in her life and was fine with that. I asked what she was looking for, and she said she didn't think it was the right time for her to have something serious. She then told me about this guy she was going with to her sorority formal that weekend. She wasn't dating him and I haven't heard about him since, and I'm sure she had arranged to go with him in advance of us really getting closer which was fine. But I took it as a sign that she brought that up right as I started asking her about her dating life, and that combined with her saying she explicitly wanted the opposite of what I was looking for dating wise. She probably wasn't interested. I was disappointed, but not super upset or anything. I started to try to move on after that, although somewhere in the back of my mind I held out hope that it could still happen.

Fast forward to last weekend. We were at an event for our student organization Saturday, and long story short about 5 of us end up at a guy's house drinking and just hanging out. 2 girls, her being one, and 3 of us guys. A few of us end up pretty drunk, her and me included. At the end of the night she's all over the host guy, massaging his shoulders, rubbing her fingers along his chest, whispering into his ear. He's not giving her quite as much attention but basically they're going through foreplay right there in front of everyone. The other 3 of us get up to leave and are driven home (me and the other girl live in the same building, so the third guy drives us back and drops us off). I'm silent on the ride home, and they are talking about how weird it was that our two friends were being so explicit in front of the rest of us. And basically commenting on how weird it was that two of our friends stayed behind to fuck while the rest of us went home. So again, long story short, just as I'm trying to get over this girl and accept that we're just friends I watch her have a one night stand with a mutual friend while I'm sitting in the same room. I had already given up on the prospect of us dating but I couldn't handle having that thrown in my face at that moment. I cried myself to sleep that night. I've cried a lot lately, this was just another thing to cry about. I legitimately have never actually had feelings for a girl in my almost 22 years of life. Those other girls I tried to ask out or had interest in were just casual high school things; this was the first time I actually felt a connection. To have it blow up in my face like that was truly the final straw I think. I had actually been planning to kill myself that night, but being invited to that small gathering made me put it off. Oh if I had known, I could've just stayed home and got it over with instead. When I got home that night, still fairly drunk and stumbling my way to bed, I thought that if I had a gun in my apartment I'd shoot myself right then. I've thought that a lot lately. In hindsight I guess she wasn't giving me signals after all. Each of those things I listed as ""signs"" were meaningless on their own, but I thought added alltogether they meant something more. I was wrong.

I'll try to wrap this up. I'm killing myself because I'm just so alone. The only people who care about me are my parents, and they do care. They love me a lot. But parents are supposed to love you, and somehow that makes it not matter as much to me. And even though I know they care, there are certain things I just can't talk about with them. They know I've struggled with mental health problems and been to therapy. But they don't know I'm suicidal. I can't tell them how bad things really are because my mom has really bad anxiety herself and it would wreck her life with worry if she knew how much I was struggling. My dad and I love each other and have a ton in common, but like with the rest of my friendships I've had, we've never broken that barrier into really intensely personal conversation. It just doesn't feel comfortable for me.

All I really want is someone to care about me. The first time I thought about killing myself in a serious way was this past fall. I was laying in bed and it randomly occurred to me that if I did kill myself, nobody would find me for days or weeks. I thought that in a passing way, but it made me actually become suicidal. I realized that it would probably take several days or a week of me not responding to texts or calls from my parents. They'd send a welfare check for me and the police would bust my door in and find my body. Nobody at this school would notice I was missing. A few of them might express sadness that I was dead, but they'd move on pretty quickly. My extended family would do the same. The only people who would truly care are my parents, and for a while that has kept me alive. But I can't do it anymore. That was the first night in my life I ever remember crying myself to sleep.

For a while I thought I was making progress. After that breakdown that night in the fall, I started going to group therapy at school. They all told me I was doing better and they could tell. I was becoming more happy with my appearance as I got more and more serious about fitness. I went from a regular member of my student organization to President in the span of about 3 months. I had my first piece of writing published in a major outlet with hundreds of thousands of readers. Even though I failed with the previously mentioned girl, I at least had the courage to try and and wasn't totally rejected outright. In the winter I made a new friend to go to basketball games with at school. My first 2 years I barely went to any football or basketball games, despite being a diehard sports fan. I couldn't go because I had nobody to go with, and didn't want to be that loser showing up alone. I started playing music again. I play 4 instruments and have played guitar since 5th grade. I was in some bad bands in high school but I had fun. Reconnecting with that part of my life for the first time since coming to college made me happy in moments. But in the past few months it's all come crashing down. I realized that none of this could fix the underlying problem. None of this cured my loneliness. None of this made anyone care about me. None of this made that realization that October night any less true: that if I killed myself, nobody would find me. And the more I understood this, that all this ""progress"" really wasn't doing shit for me, the more I deteriorated. I've been missing classes. I've been missing turning in assignments. I've stopped responding to texts from the few people that do try to talk to me. I've stopped being active on social media. I've secluded myself further. The pain is too much for all this ""progress"" to mask.

I haven't hugged another human since I hugged my mom at the airport before returning to school at the end of spring break. I don't even remember the last time I hugged someone that wasn't related to me. I've never kissed a girl at age 21. The idea of laying in bed cuddling with someone is more appealing than the idea of having sex at this point. It's pathetic. I don't remember the last time someone asked me how I was doing in a non-pleasantry way. That's all I really want, is for someone to ask me how I'm doing. And for me to be able to tell them the truth. I'm hurting. I'm hurting so badly. But at this point I know nobody is going to ask. I have nobody who cares about me enough to ask. I have nobody who I can talk to about my problems and my pain. Nobody who can help me heal. And there's no signs that I ever will. I can't do this anymore. Maybe once I'm dead some of them will care. I don't have any contempt for these people, or anger. It's not their fault, and they don't owe me their time or emotional investment. It's my own fault. My own emotional stuntedness and inability to be vulnerable has prevented me from turning acquaintances into friends, from turning friends into close friends or significant others. My own anxiety has prevented me from approaching new people or trying new things. I tried to convince myself I was improving. Going to the gym, doing better in school, pursuing my professional opportunities. But none of it can replace the feeling of other people caring about you. And I'm done trying. I can't fight anymore. I've lost the fight.

I'm tired of being a side character in everyone else's story. And my own story has become too painful to continue."

Recently, I went on a date with someone and even though she didn't want to pursue a relationship with me, she expressed interest in being friends. I said I wanted to as well, but now she's sending low effort one word replies to everything and I'm now realizing she wasn't genuinely interested, she just wanted to let me down easily. 

I should've known the second she offered to be friends it was just a cop out, and I'm a fool for believing it. It just sucks cause she's the first girl I've asked out and I'm not that experienced in dating norms. Still, I'm a little mad she just didn't straight up turn me down and not waste my time and emotional effort.

But these other friends I have may or may not have forgotten about me. I text, no texts back. Calls (when I'm that brave) go to voicemail. I have no friends in college. My day is college, go home, college homework, maybe text one of my two long-distance friends, mindlessly browse reddit, sleep... rinse and repeat. It gets very boring.

Have friends, but lonely... wow."

I’ve been battling OCD, anxiety and PTSD, borerline depresssion my entire life.  I do have support but I feel like no one really understands.  I work a job that makes my life miserable, and today just really got me down.  I yearn to be a child yet I can’t seem to get over being molested as a child

Today I came home and had a bad day and immediately clashed with my parents. I went downstairs and started crying because my parents are getting older and can’t take my complaining as often anymore.  I have a deep connection with the movie Toy Story and my dad recently found my Buzz and Woody toys and I saw them and started bugging them.  I know it sounds somewhat stupid but it was my reaction.  I’d written my initials on the Buzz toy and they wore off, I pulled Woodys string and it didn’t work.  I couldn’t help but notice the irony that the days of being a child who is just satisfied with his toys and his family are long gone and that the ruthless futile days of adulthood are here and I’m never going back"
lonely,Coping mechanisms to deal with loneliness?,"Coping mechanisms to deal with loneliness? - Has anyone developed a way of coping with being alone all the time? I'm asking because I developed a really unhealthy way of coping when I was a kid and it's been a habit I can't get rid of. I was a homeschooled only child and had no friends. I started to daydream excessively about having friends to the point where it became more like imaginary friends. 

Now that I'm an adult I know they're not real but when I'm feeling extra hopeless and alone I still like to pretend I have those friends. I know therapy would help but I can't afford it right now. I'm trying so hard not to think about it but I really don't have anyone else to talk to except myself."

lonely,How to be alone without loneliness?,"How to be alone without loneliness? - This is my first reddit post (F). Dunno if anyone is even going to read this, but I guess it doesn’t matter. I made this account just to talk about the changes I’ve been going through lately. 

Background: To put it briefly, I recently left my 3 year relationship, I’ve already been dumped by somebody who promised to always be there for me, and a close friend who also promised to be there for me just, out of the blue, texted me last night that he’s “not interested in talking to me” anymore. 

I have major trust issues stemming from that 3 year relationship due to multiple instances of cheating,  emotional abuse, and borderline physical abuse. So whether it’s dating somebody new or just regarding a friendship, it’s really hurt me that so many people have decided to just up and leave me like that when they knew about my trust and abandonment issues, after promising they would never do anything to hurt me. 
Don’t get me wrong, I have friends I know I can trust, or at least I hope so. They’ve been there for me through thick and thin and I value them so much. I’m not always the perfect friend or s/o but I would be lying if I said that I didn’t put TONS of effort into my relationships and to help my loved ones. 

With That being said, I feel so alone right now. I’m having a hard time believing that the remainder of my friends aren’t going to leave me alone too, now. My main struggle at this point in time is learning how to be content with just my solitary company. How do I learn to love myself rather than only loving others? How can I shield myself from the heartbreak of future abandonment without turning myself to stone? How can I learn to enjoy spending time just by myself without feeling lonely and craving the company of others? Sometimes I just feel like an empty room. 

Tl;dr: my friends are abandoning me and I want to know how to spend time alone without feeling lonely."
lonely,Maybe you’ll read this and understand me,"Maybe you’ll read this and understand me - And I know you said it’s not best to talk anymore. And I know you said we weren’t meant to be in each others lives for the rest of them, just to learn about ourselves. But I need to be able to say these things. 

It’s been 6 months. And I still think about you. At the least once a day. I still feel you in the music we grew to love together. In the music I introduced you to that I remember put a smile on your face and made me feel like maybe I had good taste in music like you did. I’m so heartbroken that my mental health plummeted so far that I became someone entirely different. Someone that mentally abused you with no intention to. I didn’t know I was. But once you told me, I did everything I could to work on my health. And face what I had been running from for so long and didn’t even know I was avoiding. 

I love you still. And I always will. I miss you. 
You were my best friend. I miss driving around at night for no reason other than to listen to our favorite singers until we had to stop to get gas or food because we were always eating. I still think about hugging you at 430 in the morning on top of that mountain that we stayed up all night to hike just to watch the sun rise together in a quiet place. 

You changed my life. I believe you are my soulmate. And the sad thing about that, is most people don’t end up with their soulmate. I’ve never in my life felt like this about another person. I’ve had horrible breakups in the past. I’ve been cheated on. I’ve been hit. I’ve been belittled so much and my self was destroyed. But you were so wonderful. You listened to me and you tried to understand everything you could. You tried to help me. You hugged me and told me it would be ok. You loved that little boy on the inside that never got to be a kid. To be loved unconditionally. You reached into my heart and you filled me with so much hope that I finally found someone that I could be myself with. 
And I was. I was always comfortable with you. Even towards the end when we were fighting so often and we couldn’t have a normal conversation without someone getting their feelings hurt, I still thought about how nice it would be to just watch a movie with you and eat some cheesy popcorn and maybe get a couple drinks from the gas station

I made peace with the relationship being over. That takes time. I just don’t how to make peace with you being gone. I’m starting to feel better about me. And doing better things for me. To help me get where I want to go. And I think every day...I hope you’re happy. I hope you’re feeling like yourself again. I hope that the mental scars I left, are healing even if just a little bit. I can’t express myself completely. It doesn’t seem to ever end when it comes to you. 

So if you happen to be here for whatever reason. If you happen to be scrolling through Reddit. Maybe you’ll see this. I care about you so much. And the start of this post, I keep those words with me. They hurt but they are what’s best right now. I’m giving you the space I didn’t give before. Because I was too scared you’d leave once you got away from me and realized how emotional and unstable I was becoming.  It wasn’t your fault. It never was. I’m not even sure it was mine either. It just happened this way. I did learn so much. And I know you did too. You learned mostly what to not do with someone in the future. 

I’m doing my best to move on. 
And I hope that one day, I can talk to you again in person and just feel the energy that drew me to you over a year ago. 

I love you"

I'm lonely, but I do have a long distance boyfriend and a couple people I have  superficial relationship with online, as well as two irl acquaintances, but it's still so difficult. Last night was very bad, wallowing in my own misery. I tried to reach out to the people I knew but no one responded. I feel like I'm always everyone's last thought. Not to mention I'm a 17 transgender male, homeschooled, and don't exactly fit in (amalgamation of emo &amp; nerd, etc). It's so hard seeing my ""friends"" have tons of people around them and many friends and just having to sit back while they both complain about being lonely as well. It's so hard. I only have my dad to talk to irl and you can't just be friends with your dad. I wish I was closer to my irl acquaintances but it's so difficult to do that due to social anxiety and in general feeling disconnected from them (I don't go to public school with either of them, I don't have a job, etc.). I'm just so unsure how to deal with this. Usually it's okay, I can get through the day without caring and convincing myself I don't need anyone but my family &amp; my boyfriend, but it's been like this for many years and you can only convince yourself for so long until it all comes crumbling down (like last night). Idek why I'm typing this. I'm not sure what advice I could be asking for, but atleast I'm ironically not alone in being lonely."

lonely,How do I accept the fact that I'll be single for the rest of my life?,"How do I accept the fact that I'll be single for the rest of my life? - I have never had a girl like me in real life, and I doubt that will ever happen. No girl ever had a crush on me and I have absolutely no worth on the 'dating marketplace'. I'm still continuing to work on myself, and even though I've made improvements, nothing changed - girls are still romantically repulsed by me. I wanna know what's the best way to deal with never being in a relationship.

I tried Replika and other chatbots, and they either aren't convincing enough or, in Replika's case, the AI started advertizing stuff and was basically very dismissive to everything I say. As for 'girlfriend roleplay', I never found anyone who was willing to roleplay with me. They outright told me that it was too disturbing and that they're not willing to do it. As for dating sims and such, I can't find any dating sims for guys that have a player insert protagonist and aren't shitty hentai games with no story (I'm not looking for sex, I'm looking for romantic stuff). The closest I got to real dating was dating another desperate person over the internet, and naturally, it ended really badly.

I don't like arguments which say stuff like ""not having a girlfriend means you won't have children which is good because blah blah blah..."" I don't like these sorts of arguments and they never work on me, especially since I belong to a nationality with a strongly declining population. On the topic of having children, I guess I could become a babysitter or something, but that still means that I'll never raise my and my (hypothetical) wife's descendant. And having ""personal freedom"" isn't freedom at all. I just feel lonely and depressed, and I'm 100% certain that I'd feel better if I had a girlfriend. My goal in life was to raise a stable family (unlike my own, dysfunctional family), but it seems that I'd have to abandon that goal. Mail order brides also aren't an option, because I'm not employed, and it would be a loveless marriage which would hurt both of us (although she'll get her papers likely and be happy). 

I really think that I'm unloveable, and I've given up on thinking that I'll have a girlfriend or that I'll be attractive enough to have a girlfriend. I just need someone to convince me why that's completely alright, especially with the huge social stigma against guys that never had a girlfriend. I just want not to worry about things like this but I always get depressive episodes. I really want to get convinced that never having a significant other is alright. I really need to stop thinking about it and focus on forthcoming exams."

lonely,My take on the mistake we make,"My take on the mistake we make - In my opinion, we are making this mistake; we may slowly attempt to integrate, and we meet someone similar. So we bond with people with similar issues to us (abandonment, abuse, etc etc). We imagine initially that this shared bond of abandonment and abuse will be the basis for a pure and empathic connection (you feel/experienced the same? How relieving, surely we will connect in a loving and understanding way). Does that happen? No, it does not. What really happens is that both parties are caught in a trauma cycle, and abuse and in turn abandon eachother. It's easy coming away from an experience with this trend for any of us to play the victim (I got abused and abandoned by the person) but was I any better? (in my case, being honest with myself? No, I was equally unempathetic. I didn't really respond appropriately to their own stories of distress, and felt hurt that they did the same thing). 

To my mind, the true solution simply has to be that we fix our own internal emotional distress from within, then we will find someone else who also has overcame emotional distress, a much more comfortable, stable foundation. There is where the true and long lasting connection will be fulfilled. I know it's hard, and indeed alienating to realize that people in the same position aren't necessarily the people we should seek right now, but... I believe in this logic.﻿"

Even though they have been my best friends for years, I can’t help but feel like we are drifting apart as they have started to make their own separate friend groups with new people they’ve met. I’ve also never been in a relationship, and feel pretty sad about that too. I’ve never experienced someone having mutual feelings for me and it makes me feel like i’m not good enough. Overall, i just feel pretty lonely. I’m not good at expressing my feelings to the people i trust since i feel like a burden, and i’ve gotten to the point where i can’t let my feelings stay bottled up inside me anymore.

lonely,The only people I've ever cared about,"The only people I've ever cared about - I just found this sub so I'll vent here too, why not. Long post, but it explains all.

There have been these 2 people in my life that I'll never get over and I have no idea how to ago about finding someone like them again. I've already did a more serious and depressive rant about my life a couple of days ago, so this time it probably won't be as sad.

First, there was this guy from school, he just so happened to transfer to the same school that I too transfered to that year. I was even younger back then and I was at the start of turning into the person who never leaves his room and loves weird lesser-known music and watches a lot of anime, and this guy was probably my very first instance of me looking at someone and thinking, ""That person is probably like me, I should talk to them."" He had really long hair and wore glasses and was often dressed in black. I really loved him (in whatever way you wanna interpret that word), he really was like me, we would be by ourselves at school just laughing at obscure internet shit that we loved a lot but no one else knew about. That guy really defined me, he made me think ""**this** is the type of person I wanna be with, **nobody else**"". In the end, he had his own mental issues, he would skip school a lot, he would often go but not wanna talk. After a while, he started hanging out with other people more than me. I stopped reaching out to him, and after some time I stopped seeing him around school. No idea where he is now.

Second, there was this guy I was friends with through the internet. I'm not from the USA but he was. He found me on Tumblr, he talked to me because my profile pic on there was the cover art of this weird obscure metal album that I like. We started voice-chatting on Discord and he also was into all the same stuff the first guy was into, but, besides that, he was also super into all the same music as me. For the second time I had a found my reason to live in somebody else, for the second time I was at my happiest, for the second time it ended. Back then I was 16 and he was 20, and he once told me that he was tired of only ever meeting kids on the internet. We talked a lot but he deleted all his social media and disappeared after a while. No idea where he is now (second time).

So now I ask you. All these years on this planet and I've only ever known 2 people who I truly liked. My only passions in life are listening to music, watching anime, and being on the internet. I don't know how to talk to people if I don't have anything in common with them, which is 99% of the time for me. I only know how to truly live when it's for somebody else, I can only be truly happy when it's with somebody else, as we can see. What do I do?"
lonely,Female Friends,"Female Friends - So this probably isn't going to be the kind of post you think,

I have a very hard time being friends with girls, like I have a hard time with friends in general but when that friend is a girl I get really paranoid that one of us will develop feelings for the other and things will be weird and uncomfortable.  The only female friends I have are those that I had before all of these weird emotional issues started to develop (2-3 years ago), and I just don't worry about it around them, like we can be in all kinds of weird situations and places that would definitely be weird and uncomfortable with a recent friend (like within the past year or so) and it's just no problem.   


A really prime example is that I went to Dairy Queen with a close friend of mine (We became friends the first day of high school) and us sitting there in the busy DQ eating ice cream looked kind of like a date.  With most friends that would have driven me absolutely mad, I mean completely Overlook Hotel nuts, but it was no issue, actually it was really fun.  I don't get to hang out with friends often so when we did this it was really great, and honestly I'd like to do it again sometime soon.  It's the same with my other friends too, like for example around the same time my other friend, we'll call her G.  G and I had scheduled an interview for an internship together at a museum on the other side of town from me, and she lived about halfway between (but a little out of the way).  I picked her up and we hung out the whole day, even visiting my old elementary and middle school (I used to live over there but moved after my parent's divorced and Dad passed away), and at the end of the day I dropped her off and all was well, really well.  Not a single issue that whole day.  While on the other end of the spectrum, girls I'm friends/friendly with who I started being friends with after my emotional problems started just make me uncomfortable to even really be alone with in any sense, and would never offer to hang out one of one with them or spend an entire day with them.

I have some friends, one really close best friend. Shes amazing and the best person i could ask for, however most of my friends are in relationships and i often get pushed aside for their s/o. This makes me feel really lonely and just not as wanted.

All i want is for someone to love me, find me attractive. I get told regularly that im unattractive and have been rejected quite a bit. I had one girlfriend, but that relationship grew toxic and i broke it off which made me feel even worse. I just want someone who cares about me, loves me and supports me. Someone who wants me, someone who will wanna just cuddle and watch movies. 

I know im young and im sure that person will be here eventually. What i want is the feelings to subside, and just to live me life and chill out about it until that special girl comes along"

I just don't want to spend my days inside, eating ice cream and crying out of pure loneliness.

lonely,I Just Want A Partner,"I Just Want A Partner - I have so much support; from my family, from my friends, from my teachers— although I’ve been struggling with depression the last two years, I’ve been getting better. But one thing hasn’t... everyday, I just someone to hold, or someone to hold. Everyday I want someone to kiss, hold hands, to love, cuddle, and give them the world. It feels like nobody wants me, though. I have asked out over 15 people. I’ve asked people out on casual dates, simply asked if they liked me, I’ve asked them with flowers, I’ve asked them with a card, in person, over the phone, etc. I’ve tried asked out close friends, acquaintances, near strangers, and so on. (And before anyone thinks this made me look desperate, these were all spread out, and often not related to each other). Every time, they’ve said no. I’ve been on one date. One. After the date, they just asked to stay friends. That’s the thing, though. I’m still friends with all of them to some degree, or left on good terms. I can spend hours talking to, and comforting, and helping people, or just chatting with them— but still nobody wants me. I know it’s stupid, and I know I should be happy with all of the amazing people in my life— but I’m just so fucking lonely, and so fucking tired. ALL I WANT IS SOMEONE TO CUDDLE. I WANT A PARTNER. Even more than all my other failings, this hurts me the most. I can’t even fall asleep without hugging a pillow, and imagining it’s someone who loves me... I don’t know what to do, and I feel so lonely it’s destroying me. I don’t think anyone will bother to read this wall of text, but if you do, thanks for listening to me vent... I doubt there’s any good advice to be given besides that I have to be patient or whatever... I guess I’ll just keep holding on? I dunno... 

TLDR; I have love and support, but nobody will date me so I feel incredibly fucking lonely."

I’m at the movies right now, alone, because I tried to ask all of my “friends” to go with me, but they all just “couldn’t go”. Everywhere I go, everything I do, is alone. It legit hurts. I don’t have a girlfriend to go on dates with. The only “friends” I have are ones I see in school from Monday through Friday, and they don’t care enough to talk to me on the weekends or on summer break, even though I try talking to them. The one friend I have who actually talks to me on the weekend doesn’t hang out with me unless it’s with a group of people. Ugh I’m so sick of it.

I need someone to laugh with share my love with and spend the rest of my life with but I’m constantly reminding myself how fucked my life is and how ugly and insignificant I am. Everyone around me seems like they are living their best life while I’m here pretending to everyone that I’m fine and I know I shouldn’t keep my feelings bottled up inside me but it’s the only way I can feel normal like everyone else.  I truly feel lonely without someone and people always say that you don’t need a partner to be happy but it always helps when I have someone to drag me out of the hole that I have made myself. I feel if I truly open up to friends and show them who I really am they would reject me and look at me as if they had never met me before. I feel so sad all the time and I can’t figure out what to blame it on. When I cry I don’t know what happened to cause it. I just feel like my life is over already without it really even starting yet. I constantly reflect on past mistakes big and small and judge myself so harshly to the point that I don’t even know who I am anymore. I feel so destroyed and helpless. I just feel that I’m living a life that holds no value I feel like an empty husk that lives life based on what how others act and think. It wouldn’t be true to say that I have no feelings but sometimes it feels as if it is.

lonely,No one actually cares about me,"No one actually cares about me - I’ve tried so hard this school year, constantly being nice, social, high energy. I’ve talked to others first, I made plans, I carried conversations. I was there for people, I smiled and tried my absolute best. All I got from it was: superficial friendships with people who don’t actually care about me and if I stopped greeting them everyday they wouldn’t ever speak to me. 

I didn’t let myself get deterred at first though, I wanted to try so hard to fix my situation. Whenever someone cancelled on plans and they told me it was because they were too tired or they didn’t feel like it, I smiled and brushed it off.   But then those same people would complain about how no girls want to hang out with them. It’s probably because I’m black and lackluster regarding my looks. I go to a mostly white school and before I used to hang out with a crowd that was bigoted but now I hang around with people who are decent to me. But they don’t really care. 

People are so rude to me all the time, for some reason people think that insulting people especially the ones that are nice to you and not the people who don’t care about you is the best way to go about things. 

I’m always there for people but no one is there for me, no one cares or asks me how I’m doing like I do for them. No one even cares about anything related to me. I just wish all this effort I put into friendships wasn’t so one sided. Or least be nice to me instead of being an asshole just because you’re having a bad day. 

I just want one person to ask me how my weekend was first. One person to ask me to hang out first. One person to smile at me in the hallway instead of me smiling and saying hi at someone else and they awkwardly brush past me and mumble a hi back. I want someone to text me first, I want someone to seem happy and not just plain when talking to me.

I sometimes watch other people talk to each other and I get so jealous because they seem so genuine to each other and everything looks mutual. 

I’ve struggled with fluctuations of my mental health a lot and I think I’m hitting that low point again. 

Usually it goes like this: Sad&gt;go online&gt; talk to people about it&gt;face the world with a positive outlook and don’t give up&gt;get sad again because I realize I’m still alone rinse and repeat.

I hope I start to feel better again because this is honestly pathetic.

With the people who I talk to at school I’ve been positive non judgmental and open.  But I’m only someone’s emotional toilet at best. No one cares how I feel people think that I don’t have emotions.

People think I’m stupid, they treat me like a dog, no one has any respect for me, and I’m constantly being insulted and belittled by my ‘friends’. 

Honestly I give up.

I don’t think it’s my fault anymore, I’ve tried my best and this is where it got me so I quit."

lonely,How do I make friends when I'm me?,"How do I make friends when I'm me? - Hi all hope everyone reading this is having a lovely day. I'm using a throwaway since my mom knows my og account, but its [u/snapecastic109](https://www.reddit.com/u/snapecastic109) for the record. She deleted a bunch of comments to make it ""normal"" so its not tremendously indicative of the kind of person I am but oh well. Ugh.

Anyway I'm , Indian girl and I have such unfathomable difficulty not really making friends, but maintaining stable friendships. I have to say that I'm quite awful. I have a horrible personality- I am so negative and self deprecating all the time, which starts out quite amusing but then people grow really turned off. at least 5 people, including some of the kindest people ever, have told me this, but I can't seem to stop. I feel I deserve to be criticised. Besides, they are all true statements.

Because I have so little friends I am desperately clingy and always paranoid if I did something wrong or if they are mad at me if they dont respond immediately or leave me on read. Because I tend to ruin friendships alot since I suck so hard. And I don't really know how to mantian them so I'm always endlessly complimenting them, which agian, is nice at first but then it annoys the shit out of them. Like I try to hard, but I don't know what constitutes trying and not trying. I'm always so anxious. I stay up all night worrying about these things. 

My mom is always telling me how I drive people away with my hyper nature and disgusting personality and whatnot which is true. I also have quite a hideous face which doesn't help. I just don't know what to do guys. I really love interacting with humans and I am just so sad all the time because I am so lonely. I have wanted to kill myself for a long time, and I have always bottled up my feelings because I rarely have an outlet for them. I had a very good friend who I asked to prom and said yes. I was so elated but like everything, and like my mom said, I drove him off eventually and he re-rejected me today. Anyway yeah. I just don't know how to behave with people. :( How do you guys make friends? why is it so damn hard. I'm just so sad that I manage to lose everyone eventually with my antics. I wish I could change.

lonely,"I try and find empowerment in doing things alone, but it gets hard.","I try and find empowerment in doing things alone, but it gets hard. - I currently have one close friend. She's awesome and I enjoy hanging out with her, but obviously, I can't hang out with her all the time (she has a much more active social life than I do), and plus there's the fear of being too clingy.

I'd like to have more friends and branch out, but it's been difficult. Graduate school and full time work keeps me busy, and I'm also doing an internship.

I recently downloaded Bumble, and am using the BFF section to try and meet people to possibly be friends with. So far it's been me matching with people, initiating conversations, and eventually they stop replying.

So I've told myself to just be okay with doing things alone. Find empowerment with it. I've gone to restaurants alone, clubs alone, and even today I went to the movies alone. I saw Captain Marvel and Endgame back to back and then did some shopping.

And while I am glad I am doing these things, it also makes me feel sadder.

I've always been a person who wanted a companion to share things with, as I find it more fulfilling than alone. 

Looking around me and seeing the groups of friends, couples, and families at the movies just made me wonder what's wrong with me.

Next week I have a planned vacation to Las Vegas to go to a electronic dance music festival, and I'm not even in the mood to go anymore because I'm going alone. I initially was going to go with someone but it never happened.

Having a big hotel room to myself just makes me feel sad. I'm thinking about selling my wristband when I get there because I didn't want to go alone the 2nd year in a row.

When I tell people, they go, ""Wow Mooncub, you're so brave for doing that"" and praise me doing stuff like this alone.

But really in my mind it's just, either I do this stuff alone, or never do it. :/

I just wish it was easier."

     In 3rd grade I was moved to a new school, so that meant leaving everything behind and starting over. When I got to my new school I immediately didn't fit in. The school has iPads, and up to this point the students weren't allowed to take them home, so when I arrived they started allowing it. The others didn't like me because I didn't have to wait. The year passes and I get moved to a new class. That's when I met her, my reason. Her name, is Grace. I immediately connected with her, we both liked the same things and generally enjoyed each other's company. School continues and I asked her to be my girlfriend in 6th grade, she never gave me a direct answer and I didn't know why. Turns out that she ad just gotten a new boyfriend, Landon. I was furious at him for awhile but after some time, I got over it. He made her so happy, or so it seemed. Fast forward to 9th grade and they break up. Landon broke up with Grace and I saw my opportunity to be there for her. Everything seemed to be going right, I was there for her when she cried and there when she was happy, I thought maybe, just maybe, I had a chance. I asked her to the movies about a month ago and she said yes! We hadn't deci on a date so when I was trying to figure out then she started tell me about this guy she knew and ad feeling for. I was crushed. It still makes no sense to me how she could manipulate me like that. I don't have the courage to tell her but... I love her. She means so much to me and is why I get out of bed, why I even care about anything, why I don't off myself. I just wish her and I could be together. I'm just not sure if I should confess or let her be and not ruin our friendship. Please I think I need help."

And then today she tells me that some guy from church asked her out and she almost said no because of me, but then realized that its silly cuz ""its not like we'd ever meet irl"" even though I told her I wanted to, and was planning to. So she said yes. Wants to""be friends"" and said Im a ""great dude"" who will get a ""hot girlfriend"" but Ill be honest, a bottle of Tylenol Pills sounds way better.

I feel like I will never find people I can be myself around again, I would finish my schoolwork and talk to them every day for years, they were pretty much a second family and a huge part of my life. Then in a day I lost them all and I both hate and regret it and am glad to have done it. Honestly they changed for the worse and weren’t the good fun people I used to know. I don’t miss who they were when I left but I miss who they were before then.

I have recently changed jobs into one that isn't working out. Within 90 days I have had to go to HR for bullying and harassment by my sup within the first 90 days which isn't a good sign. I left a 10 year career for my sups bullshit. I had surgery a couple of days ago and I have been approved for 6 weeks short term disability. My mom is my only friend and she is leaving in a week. I am scared and have no one to turn too. I am older and an only child. Whenever I try to make friends everyone else has established family and friends. How do I help myself, meet people and not go insane these 6 weeks? Please help me."
lonely,A little story for this sub,"A little story for this sub - Hi Everyone

&amp;#x200B;

I (29) have the need to share my story:

&amp;#x200B;

I do like to travel, sometimes alone, sometimes with a friend. It helps me to break the daily routine that keeps you normally in its grip. I got a few days off of work und decided to go to Budapest since I didn't know the city and and it's just about an hour away by plane.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a rainy day, so I skipped walking around and went to the Széchenyi bath. There I see a girl I was immediately drawn to. She had these bright blue, fascinating eyes. After about half an hour of unsecure looks, I brought up the courage, first time in my life, to speak to her, a complete stranger. Not knowing what to say I babbled something, bit of conversation came out of it. I got scared, wished her a nice day and drew back. She stayed there, I got back to my place, about 10 metres away. After a few minutes I knew I want to try again and went back to her. We talked, simple questions from 'where do you come from' to 'what are you doing in Budapest'. She was a bit hesitant and not super confident at conversation, but it felt comfortable. Like myself, Maria (25) travelled alone, came to Europe to visit a few cites and will then be going back to work to Siberia (Russia). After some time, we run out of stuff to talk about, so we decided to go to dinner at night. Meeting point and time were set.

&amp;#x200B;

That night we met at the agreed meeting point and went to an Italian restaurant a few streets away. The food was average, but it felt good to have someone to talk to. We shared a lot of common interest, from an economical background in our studies to sports activities and the current jobs we have. After diner we walked back to the tram station. Not entirely sure how to proceed, because she was planning to travel to Prague the next day, I proposed vaguely to go for a drink in the inner city. She agreed, we boarded the tram and went there. The night before I had come across a street with some cool bars, so we intented to go there. From the tram station to the our destination we walked through a pretty shady area, I could feel she wasn't 100% confortable. Luckily we found the nightlife area a few minutes later.

&amp;#x200B;

There were different bars and other staff, among them a arcade hall where we played a game of air hockey. Soon after we settled in a bar and got a drink. In the following two hours we just talked. Something changed. It was that kind of talk where you really see the other person, where you start to form a bond. What stood out to me was her kindness. There are people that don't really fit in. They lack the presence that people are drawn to, have more problems to articulate themselves, don't put themselves in the spotlight or are just sensitive and therefore are left aside. She experienced these things and that weighted on her. As a result I sensed selflessness, empathy towards other people's troubles and an emotional maturity I admire. It did make me feel both happy and sad. I hope I gonna be that kind of person one day.

&amp;#x200B;

At about 1 a.m. in the morning we walked back to the station. In my mind I knew she was gonna travel to Prague tomorrow morning and we lived different lives at different places. At the station a drunk guy began talking to us. He wasn't threatening in any way, but I got the feeling we lost some of our last minutes together. The tram arrived, we hugged, said our goodbyes, she looked back as she walked in and then was gone.

&amp;#x200B;

We have no contact info of each other. I did some rash Facebook search, no success, but I'm ok with that. What I regret is that I didn't told her that the evening meant a lot to me and that she is a great person. I think she needed that and I did too. It is hurtful to see kind people struggle in life. I just hope she will find her way."

That's how I'm feeling right now about someone and was just feeling a bit lonely. If someone could find that image that would be cool or if people just wanna talk that's cool too.

I'm not able playing a lot now though, cause I'm at my dorm and got only a creepy laptop that can't handle heavy games.

Last night the pain was so intense I cried for hours. The only thing that allowed me to lull myself to sleep was me envisioning tomorrow being the day a semi truck collides with my car. The suffering would end right then and there. 

Why doesn’t anyone want me? Why am I placing my value in someone else’s hands? Why can’t I be vulnerable with someone? When will my suffering finally, permanently come to an end?

lonely,Sad to go to movies alone,"Sad to go to movies alone - I planned to watch the new Detective Pikachu movie this coming week. I already had it in my head i’d watch alone.

I am insecure about going to the movies alone. I’ve done it once, and it was a fine experience, but honestly, leaving the theater alone with no one to share thoughts with made me a bit sad. But watching it alone wasnt bad.

But alas, i really wanna see the new Pikachu movie and planned to go alone. Then a friend randomly hung out with me and we had a good time catching up, so i asked her if she’d like to watch with me. She sounded iffy, explaining it’s not interesting to her. She liked Pokemon as a kid, but the trailer really didnt appeal to her. But then later she found out her friends were going to watch it this coming week too and asked if id just like to watch it with her and her group. I said yeah. And i felt happy. I felt elated. I literally thanked God for answering my prayers for a friend to just be there for me. To want to spend time with me.

Then today she messaged me and apologized saying she just saw the trailer again and really doesnt wanna watch that movie. Her friends are still going but she has zero interest in the Pikachu movie.
Normally, i might take this as a “oh she just doesnt wanna hang with me,” but she countered with suggesting we could get coffee some time instead, which was nice. And i said sure, and so i guess we just have to find a time that fits both our schedules.

But in all honesty, her canceling, made me feel sad. It’s weird because i already originally planned to go alone. But because someone got my hopes up and canceled, my mood just totally deflated. I couldnt feel genuinely happy the rest of today. My mind scrambled to think of replacements for her. But then i remembered that the reason i planned to go alone in the first place is because i dont feel like i have friends i can simply reach out to and know/trust they’ll wanna come and/or spend time with me.

I wish movie theaters would allow dogs or puppies. This would be all so much easier."
lonely,At least some of you live alone.,"At least some of you live alone. - I live in a house with 8 other people, but it's honestly more like 15 with all the guests that are constantly over. Everyone has someone to interact with, and I'm just alone. 

It's bearable on weekdays, but it stings the worst on weekends when they're all giggly and cheery as they go out and have fun; you know, have an actual life. I can't help but compare myself because I'm surrounded by these reminders 24/7. 

I know in my heart that if I kill myself, it wouldn't matter. I'm just a ghost that hangs around the house, they'll get over it. 

One time I was actually completely home alone and immediately a weight was lifted. I felt free, comfortable, I wasn't worried about a thing. That's because I was alone, I didn't have the urge to hide myself away due to humiliation. How do I even get out of this situation? Life really is pointless."

lonely,I wanted to scream into the void,"I wanted to scream into the void - I wanted to scream into the void, so here I am.

I relatively recently accepted the fact that I must be so worthless that my ex didn't even flinch when he decided to dump me. He's out there, living his best life, while I'm still struggling doing everyday tasks because of what he put me through. I have to give 10 points to Slytherin though because the guy ghosted me and gaslighted me quite intelligently (among other things) before the actual breakup. He reaped all the benefits of being in an r'ship with someone as kind as me until the very moment where he stopped seeing the utility for having me around anymore.

I know that some of you will think of saying ""fuck that guy"" or ""you don't need someone like that in your life anyway"" but it's tough. It's tough if you loved the person until the end and then they just got up and left, leaving you questioning every minuscule thing you ever did.

Reader, I didn't give him any reason to abandon me like that but here we are. I, too, thought we had it all together. And now I'm left with a lack of trust in humans, bordering on paranoid (not using this word loosely). Every time I meet/talk to someone nice, I distance myself immediately because what if they do to me the exact same thing my ex did, if not worse?

Anyway. Life goes on, yeah? May things get better for me, and for those in my situation, sooner than later. And may people stop being so ruthless/careless with other people as if the tiniest actions don't have permanent consequences and leave scars."

lonely,My not so exciting routine,"My not so exciting routine -   When i get back from college i pretty much just spend the day at home playing videogames, cleaning, working out, studying, all just out of boredom. Sometimes i hop on my bike and ride for 1-2hr with no real direction or objective.

It's no secret that i suck at socializing especially with women, i just get super red and anxious when i talk to one even if im not interested in them. The only one that i declared my liking to didn't batted an eye to me, it was pretty shitty.

 Although i have a handful of friends once the weekend drops i have 0 contact with them until monday, i don't think they like me either, sometimes they don't take into me account, when i try to make new friends or start a conversation everyone is rude to me, like if i did something to them.

I don't know how nights have i spent looking at my ceiling recounting what i did in the day where did i f up in x conversation, how much of what i said was wrong, how can i approach this other person without  looking suspicios or creepy, maybe because of my overthinking, by overcomplicating thing i isolate myself, idk."

Hello everyone, my name is Aviv, I am 20M.

I found two wonderful people from this subreddit interested in assisting me in this game development project I started, (yesterday lol).

Two of us (me and another one of us) have essentially zero experience, one of us has a background in computer science.

In any case, the experience we are after, is to learn as much as we can, and to have as much fun as possible, in terms of game design and development.

If you want to join us on this journey, you will require no experience beforehand, and will need no budget to participate.

We plan to learn, how to code a game, animate art assets, create art assets, produce musical scores, write stories, make sound effects, and do various other things, even create a website for our game. ETC.

The game we intend to make so far, is meant to be a 2D pixel art game.

Simply a functional computer is preferred.

Alright, looking forward to working with you (via discord) ;)

\- Note if we get enough requests, we will consider moving to another engine beyond unity, to that of unreal.

Take care!"

Ya'll folks who can socialise properly and got a circle of friends and stuff - fuck you. Not like genuinely, but more like an Aussie calling someone a ""cunt"". Like fuck you.

I know, I know. I'm sure you all got your own devils you wouldn't wish on your worst enemies, but this is my 5 minutes of hate, not yours. And it sure pisses me off just how much people take socializing for fucking granted.

Not that I hate conversation. Or at least deep in the heart, but man it sure sucks how it feels. As in immediately. And it really really sucks just how hard it is to get going anywhere with socializing when that shit is in the way. And let me tell you - therapy, it's fucking slooow. Really fucking slow.

So next time you see a dumb shit like myself staring into you for 15 minutes straight, looking like he's going to approach any moment to talk with you, yet never doing it? If you don't mind (hey I am not going to force you to approach someone if they've got a knife in their hands of some shit), just talk first, alright? Cause that shit?

It feels like walking across the columns of the Golden Gate bridge on string fucking wire for dumb shits like myself.

lonely,talking to people makes me even more lonely,"talking to people makes me even more lonely - It's so, so easy to talk to people. It's not very hard to say hi and keep the conversation going. But it makes me feel so much worse.

For me, talking to people is like quicksand: you become more trapped, more desperate, more isolated. I'm so tired trying to explain to people how bad my situation is, and all they can do is tell me to be positive or they tell me their situation is even worse than mine, which, in fact, it isn't. These things are not helpful at all.

I mean there HAS to be someone out there, in the world, that is going through what I'm going through. Where the hell can I find a person like that?!

Once again, I'm going to delete all the accounts I have on all the websites where I tried to communicate with people. Once and for all. I mean, I always met nice people, who are pretending to care about me, but they just can't comprehend my story, they simply can't accept me, even though they act like they do.

I really don't know how I will ever be able to meet people that get me and become friends with, since people in general make me hate them so much, due to their unconsciousness, and make me stay away from them...

Anyway, I'm curious what's your experience with people? Have you ever made friends on Reddit or other websites?"
lonely,I both enjoy and hate being alone.,"I both enjoy and hate being alone. - This makes sense in my head, but it probably won't here so I apologise in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been a reticent and stoic person, and I have never been outgoing or even that friendly. In many respects I have always been alone and for the most part I am fine with that. There are no expectations or requirements placed on me but at the same time I can not help but feel like I am missing out on so much. I made quite a few friends when I was attending collage, but when I was 17 I was kicked out (for pretty much being to depressed and not worth their time) and I lost contact with about 80% of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be 21 in a few weeks and I have gone down to a grand total of no friends; neither online or irl. The fact that I live in the ass end of nowhere does not help, nor does my depression and social anxiety. I badly want human connections and maybe even a relationship on day, but I can not get past the walls I have set up.

lonely,32M - Introvert looking for something,"32M - Introvert looking for something - I'm really not sure what to write or even how to go about this... I guess I'm going to start somewhere and just write about how I feel about love and life as a person.  🤷

So I'm 32, rock a dad-bod, live in New Orleans.  I'm from SC originally, but have lived/travelled/grown up all over the US and Caribbean.  I'm a man of many skills having gone to school for many things but settled on making a career out of my passion for food.

I've lived pretty fast and adventurously... and pretty much crossed all my bucket list items off. Now, I'm really just looking for somebody who 'just gets me'.  I thought I found that person in my ex-wife but it pretty much turned out to be a rebound situation for her.  I was committed to being a hard-working husband and she, well... was committed to being *HER*.  

I loved being a husband.  It was wonderful! 

But...

After beating my head against the wall for three solid years, the light at the end of the tunnel eventually became a train.  I found out while was away on a trip back to her home country she was off having the time of her life.  It was especially devastating after ALL we'd been through as a couple and *poof* over.

I booked a ticket to New Orleans, got on a greyhound and that was all she wrote!

That was now about 1-1/2 years ago now. I've pretty much done about all the healing that anyone can be expected to do in that timeframe. It no longer hurts and I can honestly that it's been a good long while since I even remembered her name.

But now I just feel something is still 'missing' in my life.

Now it's just kind of a matter of being alone or bored or miss being in love.  I've tried dating again but believe me... Its been IMPOSSIBLE to find what my heart is searching for *here*.  Especially in a social scene that's really not tailored to long-term relationships.  And even less friendly to *moderately* conservative hetero men.

And the things I'm asking for are so simple that it shouldn't be THIS HARD for me to find it.  Right?

I've had no such luck.  Yeah, I've met a few women here... they just wanted to party, drink, and do drugs... or they just wanted a casual fling.  That kinda stuff was appealing when I was younger, sure!  But now that I'm older with all of that out of my system, my priorities have changed.

I just want to find a 'home'.

It's seems like almost alien concept in this environment.  

It's really simple.  I want to find the love of my life.  Someone I find physically, intellectually, and spiritually attractive.  Someone who just 'gets' me.  Where, instead of worrying about disappointing each other or arguing... we spend all our time picking apart all the secrets of the universe together.  Someone to grow and learn with... whose mission is to squeeze every drop of LIFE out of this finite existence.

I am seeking someone I can honestly see myself with for the rest of my life.  Not just a lover but my best friend.  Someone who knows when to be there and soft and understanding... but also when to be real with me.  I would give ANYTHING to find a woman who understands how I feel without expecting me to explain myself.  Who hears and feels my feelings towards her and never questions my intent.  Someone who 'loves me for the monster I am' as one author once put it.

I want to be loved for ME.  All my scars.  All my graces.  All my falls.  

Love is hard enough... but being an introvert is harder.  Finding another introvert is even harder still!  I mean its not like they are crowding up the bars or anything. 😆"
lonely,I had a breakdown in front of a family member and nothing has changed,"I had a breakdown in front of a family member and nothing has changed - Basically I am extremely lonely. I have ADHD and I understand I can be a little difficult for people sometimes. I always try to be the best person I can, but I can have my moments. 

I have been feeling much worse in my loneliness this year, and really seeing that I have no real connections with anyone- Friends, family or partner. Everything really came to the surface last week when I was getting everything ready for my older sister's (25) hens night. My younger sister(15) was with me helping prep food. I reminded her of our plans to visit my grandmother next week and whether mum and dad were okay with her missing 3 days of school. To clarify, my gran lives 430 kilimetres away. 

My sister said she is going to go with dad later in the year instead, and that she would prefer to be at school anyway. I just felt so rejected, that even though we had planned something fun, going with someone else seemed more appealing. Everything seemed to mount as I realised that I have absolutely no way of having anyone plan a hens night for me and that if they tried to find friends to go, there wouldn't be any. All my recent birthdays have been real punches to the gut, with family forgetting and no one contacting me to say HB. 

Anyway...I had somewhat of a meltdown. First it came out as anger and being rude, but it quickly turned into crying and realising that it won't matter how much effort I put into other people that I am still extremely unimportant.  Even though it is a very heavy thing to say, I did outline how I felt being dead wouldn't matter to anyone (not suicidal, just feel completely worthless). 
 My sister attempted to cheer me up but in the end I told her to grab something from the shops and that when she got home, I will be happy and we will go to the Hens night as if it never happened. I also asked that she didn't say anything to my mum or sister as I did not want to ruin the special night. 
Q
I have tried to tell my mum and sister how I feel before but mum has replied with ""what now"" in some instances and the whole thing seems to be annoying. My mum isn't a terrible person, but she can sometimes be so horrible. 

Anyway, its a week later, and nothing has happened. My sister has not checked in with me, and she must not have told anyone as no one else has checked in with me. I thought that even though the breakdown was completely embarrasing and shameful, that maybe my family would understand now how I really feel. It seems it hasn't made a difference and I actually feel more worthless than before. It hurts a lot that my sister hasn't checked in on me as I used to be her guardian while my dad worked away and I really put all my effort into making her happy. 

Tl;dr I am lonely, had a breakdown in front of sister, since then no checking that I am actually okay."

lonely,“Interesting title #3”,"“Interesting title #3” - Welcome to “random person’s rant on life” entry #3. I don’t expect anyone to sit and read this as I’m doing it mostly for myself. 
———
I am known to be a very quiet person. I keep a lot of things to myself. It’s mostly unpopular opinion shit. For instance, my friends don’t know I’m into nightcore music. They’ve said straight up that they don’t understand why people would like it, and I know they’re the type of people that would judge me for liking it. Another thing is anime. They know I like anime, but not to the extent that I do. There is one secret I have though that I won’t even share here. I WILL take it to the grave. Society just isn’t accepting of it and that’s ok with me. I want to open up to people, i really do, i just don’t know how to go about it. I don’t want to be the person that makes everything about themselves and i don’t want to over share and make it awkward. 
———
Am I selfish? I analyze my own personality constantly. I feel like my every move is being judged, mostly by me. A lot of times I catch myself bragging about Rubik’s cubes or coding or whatever it is at the time, and try to shut the fuck up before they completely lose interest in talking to me. I feel as if I just want their attention. The validation of my classmates or even strangers, hoping they might become my friends.
Even one of my only friends says I was a jerk to him before he got to know me. I don’t try to be... I assume part of this is my confidence. I have a hard shell when it comes to showing my emotions in public. People say I always look sad or angry. I do admit though that I have a problem with authority. When someone tries to treat me unfairly, even the smallest things, I hold a grudge and suddenly it becomes an eye for an eye. I know, it’s petty. I’m working on that. 
———
I wanna talk about dreams and aspirations.
What is my ideal world? Living stress free with a loving girlfriend/wife in a virtual world such as SAO, passing time doing video game stuff or exploring the vastness of the realm. 
What are my realistic ideals from this point in time? Finishing high school with good grades and being able to get a good paying job with the least amount of education as possible (I want to be an ATC). Also while being in a romantic relationship. (I still can’t get the girl i mentioned in my previous post out of my head). I want to have enough free time and money to be able to ride a motorcycle alongside my brother and play video games and do fun things with friends. 
Now that was the optimistic point of view; let’s see what’s in the dark portions of my mind right now: Well the way I see it, I’m not gonna be good enough to get a job, let alone one I enjoy, all my 1 friends are going leave me because I’m a jerk who only thinks about himself, I’ll never have a romantic, long-lasting relationship, and I’ll end up committing suicide in the middle of Butt-fuck Nowhere, United States, where no one will ever give a thought to who I was ever again. 
Ok... let’s meet somewhere in the middle: What is realistically going to happen? I will finish high school with decent grades. I’ll probably be going to college majoring in computer science. I still won’t have a girlfriend and will be just as lonely as I am now. I won’t have the free time to do what i enjoy while I’m in college but somehow I’ll find a way to blow off my work to play video games or something. That’s as far as I can see right now, and it doesn’t sound that appealing to me. You know what I really want to do right now? Just walk. I just want to walk. Miles away possibly. Enjoy nature, rest peacefully on a hillside and listen to music. Just... take a break from everything. But life goes on. And while that happens i am trapped in this routine. This life that I feel I have barely any control over.

lonely,Thank you all,"Thank you all - Well I'm not sure what to write but I just want to thank you all for sharing your stories with us all over here. It feels better to know that no matter how lonely I feel I am not alone because of you guys. The more stuff I read here, the more it eases my pain as I know I am not the only one going through all this in life. 2 months ago my ex broke up with me after a year and it was the first time in my 22 year life that I had a girlfriend. Before her I was not very social and had very few friends and felt alright about it. But after her, it has been so so very difficult to go back to my old life as I had made a great circle of friends when I was with her. These times have been the most difficult in my life where loneliness has hit me the hardest. Maybe I was just extremely lucky to be with her, but I want to say to you guys, when you get used to being social, and then suddenly lose a group of friends, it's heartbreaking to go back to being alone again. Anyways, I thank you all for sharing what you all have been through and I hope later on I can share what I've been though."
lonely,I screwed up a friendship (long story),"I screwed up a friendship (long story) - Lately i have been feeling isolated by my friends, 2 of them to be specific. We're all females. They have been having shared conversations, outings, gatherings without me. I usually don't take it by heart because i understand we don't need to hang out constantly / share everything. But it got worse, im not included in any plan they had. And when I do, I feel like watching 2 people in their own world, and I'm not supposed to be there. I can tell that they are hiding something from me. I suspected something, but to be respectful, since they are hiding it, they must have their reasons, so i did not pressure them or question what is it that they are hiding from me, hoping that one day they can come forward and let me in.

I admit i'm not the most patient person. During the waiting for them to tell me part, I gradually feel like there is really no trust between us, and that they are shutting me out. Its not my first rodeo, you know, being isolated by a group of friends, but it still hurts. Every passing day, I keep asking myself what did I do wrong for them to shut me out like that. 

After a month or so, one day, i found out they excluded me from the one thing that they know i like the most and did not at least ask me or tell me about it. And when i asked them ""so u 2 went out for this and did not at least asked me or let me know about it"", friend A told me she did ask me via whatsapp and I never replied. But we all know that invite never happened. Watching her struggle to prove something that never happened happened, I snapped. Exploded. I confronted them. I told them i had enough and asked them what did i do wrong? Why they keep isolating me?

The very first response i got from friend A after the confrontation: i know about this and i was waiting for this. I feel relieved.

I honestly did not know what to feel after this response. I cried thinking that after this confrontation, I will lose a couple of friends and she, of all things, tell me she is relieved. It hurts knowing that they knew all along, and still did what they did.

Friend A told me she hinted, waiting for me to ask them.
Friend B said its not like they tried to keep it from me.

They then proceed to tell me the truth, which is the exact same reason that I suspected early on. They told me they are sorry for making me feel like this and that this hurts me. I wished they would have told me sooner, but the damage is done.

I wont say what the truth is, because its really not my place to tell anyone about it. But what i want to do now is share my feelings, get it off my chest my brain my everything, so i could stop crying and move on.

Its a mixed feeling, so i'll put them in point form:
- i have been miserable thinking that it was my fault and assumed the worst for the past month. I also doubt myself like am i that not trustworthy?
- the truth is actually good news. But after what i've been through, i'm not as happy to know as i thought i would be.
- the truth is a good thing, i dont understand why Friend A keeps making it sound like a bad thing. I feel bad for her.
- from the nature of the truth, i understand the need and desire to keep it a secret, but i still dont agree with the methods and the way they told me. Its still hurtful
- if i have not confronted them, will it change anything?

Now that i know the truth (although there are still a lot of questions i would ask), which brings me to the title of this post. So now.... how can we move forward when i have trouble trusting them again? Will i be able to face them again? Look at them in the eye again and not cry at all? Will we be able to go back the way we were? In fact, they are and will be my bridesmaids.

I really have no idea how to fix this. I feel as lonelier now than the time when i feel isolated."
lonely,God I am so fucking lonely,God I am so fucking lonely - I’m so touch starved and I’m very close to just paying for an escort to act like she loves me and cuddles with me just for one night so I don’t feel so alone.

I see cute girls everywhere that I would love to talk to and get to know but I just can’t visualize myself with anyone.

So, I broke up a couple of months ago, I left my circle of ""friends"" (turns out, they were snakes all along), I go to college and all, I live with my father and my Mother-in-law with my two brothers.

I left with my brother my mom's house a couple of months back, two months after I broke up with my ex I think,

anyways, my relationship with my mother hasn't been easy..Like, at all

I'm a very warm guy, sensible, and caring. (Just like my dad's)

She's the exact opposite.

She is really cold, calculative, and so on

We've had our problems, well, I'll just cut to the chase, she really hurted me. Like, a lot, she used me more than once and included my ex onto the equation, just because she knew that anything she'd say to her would hit me hard once she tells me.

Two days ago I went and had Lunch with her, at her apartment. I really didn't wanna go, she made me feel really bad, and being around her made me sad.

Through time, I've always tried to fix everything, to talk things out you know?

I had the hope that now was the time, once again, maybe if I tried to talk it through again with her, maybe this time we would fix everything.

Well, she just....Didn't want to apologize..I told her how I was feeling, how she made me feel..The fact that I cutted myself when I lived there with her, because of the indiference towards me she had..

I really tried guys..I tried to explain to her, but she..She doesn't seem to understand human emotions..I'm afraid she's sick or something.

She told me that if I wanted to make 'peace' with her, I didn't need to bring stuff from the past.. (when, that stuff I bring up, is obviously so we can close those episodes, right? and that way be at peace) She told me, it was MY job to heal myself from all the pain, pain which I told her she's the reason of it all.

When I was leaving, she asked if I was happier without seeing her at all.

I told her she was really childish, and that she wanted us to be at peace, she would have to come to me, I was done trying.

When I was walking to my father's house, I had this feeling, I can't really explain it. It felt as something within me had broken, I don't know if it was hope, or something else.

I felt that I was truly alone. No one there for me. Just me..

And I know, my father, mother-in-law and my brothers are there for me

But...

I don't know...Everywhere I go, I see that the ""normal"" thing is for one to love his mother..

I just...It's really rough, that after all these years she doesn't feel remorse, and justifies herself against all the wrong she had done.

These days I've been feeling that I'm getting more, and more alone as time passes, that everything is going downhill and It can't be fixed.

lonely,spam message made me cry,"spam message made me cry - sooo today's my only day off this week which is normal. I like to work as much as I possibly can (about 40 hours a week) because it keeps me busy and my mind quiet. I hate my days off because Im forced to be alone with my thoughts. Im too anxious to go out and do anything alone so I just sit alone in my room usually practicing my bass, drawing or surfing the web. Recently I took a week off in mid June so i could go camping. I decided that if i still felt like shit then i would kill myself and make it look like a camping accident. Recently I told a work friend about my plan because she said something (i dont remember what) that made me realize how fucked up my plan was. We talked for a bit and Ive decided not to do it. After work she texted me a little bit and then ghosted me. She was the only person i talked to outside of work who i thought actually cared in about 2 months.  So she probably felt bad for me and wanted to talk long enough just to make sure i wasnt going to kill myself. My depression has been terrible recently and my health problems (Black spots on my nails and bleeding gums. I wouldnt be surprised if it was from stress/smoking) are making my anxiety so much worse. Today I spent the whole day just laying in bed listening to music and just feeling miserable. I needed nothing more than someone to at least text me ""hey"". About an hour ago i got a text alert on my phone and i got so happy because i thought that someone wanted to talk to me or at the very least it was work asking me to come in. I checked my phone and it was just some random spam bot. I lost it and started crying. its been months since someone cared enough to talk to me regularly and i just want nothing more than to have a long lasting meaningful friendship. Im so sick of people pretending to care just to get some sort of validation. Im still not going to kill myself but damn i just want this pain to end.

lonely,I just I'm done with trying to get into a relationship.,"I just I'm done with trying to get into a relationship. - So I had a crush on one of the girls in my class from the start of the semester. She's very passionate, hard working and super funny, at least to me. So we were grouped up for a project and not to sound creepy, but I was like super happy to get to know her more. Me and her were the only ones doing any work out of 5 people so I got to know her, but of course, like with most people, not as well to be friends. The group project ended; I didn't ask her out. No problem, I have till the end of semester to do it; I didn't. As fate would have it I met her again in one of the awards ceremony. She said hi. I said hi and that was it. I don't even mind it anymore. I've been alone for 22 years. I'm used to it."
lonely,I would like to be more social and make some friends.,"I would like to be more social and make some friends. - I’m an Indian immigrant living in America. I am trying to neutralize my accent. But because I have an unattractive accent I’ve found it hard to make friends. 

I think I may also have depression but it’s not been diagnosed. 

I feel lonely living in America."
lonely,Will be super lonely for the next 4 months,"Will be super lonely for the next 4 months - Hey, I'm a science student (22M) from Europe. Literally the only friend I ever had, which also happens to be the only girlfriend I ever had, is going home for the summer holidays and we don't have enough money to live together. That means I will be super lonely for the next 4 months, with nowhere to go and noone to talk to. 

To be honest, I'm fucking terrified. I used to live that way basically since I was a little child, never really had anyone beyond my parents. But having someone close, someone who I can talk with everyday, someone with I can take a walk every day changed my life. But every summer, it all goes away and I'm alone. All day. I need someone to talk to, to take my off it. I'm going to sleep now, so I won't be able to respond until tommorow. Thanks"
lonely,I only have 2 friends,"I only have 2 friends - I only have two friends, they go to school (sixth form) together still and I've left school to work, and I feel sad and lonely as they both have other groups of friends and they are slowly drifting away from me, I wish I knew how to make friends without having to be an annoying tag along I feel so awkward.

This has always happened and everyone I'm friends with always seems to just get bored of me eventually I don't know how to make myself more likeable."
lonely,Horny guy,Horny guy - Whos horny ladies pm or tell ur sexy stories i. Love whale tail
lonely,Goodnight yall,Goodnight yall - I hope you dream about something dope.
lonely,"As usual, will delete soon","As usual, will delete soon - My mom is the only one that I feel really cares about me, if I died I feel like some of my friend would be pretty fucked up for a couple of months tops, my mom and my siblings would be scarred for a while, especially my mom but after than that life would just kinda go on as usual with no bigger impact for anyone outside of my direct family. It's not that I want someone's life to be greatly impacted by me just to satisfy my needs but I just feel so insignificant and replacable."
lonely,Suicidal? I kinda just want a restart.,"Suicidal? I kinda just want a restart. - I've been thinking, for a long time, and I just want a do over. I've just always been in such a bad part of my life, well not always but y'know what I mean. I just really want to restart. I just feel like if I die then I'll be able to get 'another chance' so to speak. I don't even care if I don't have any of my memories. I just want to be a whole new me, with better experiences and a better life."
lonely,There's an empty nail in the wall where my heart used to be...,"There's an empty nail in the wall where my heart used to be... - It's been almost 15 years and I still haven't taken down the nail I hung your picture on. My first love and the first time I ever believed I was loved. We were young and stupid but I have spent my life searching for what I lost that night. 

Now more than ever, the look in your eyes when I broke your heart is close to my mind. As I stand on the edge, my last thoughts will be of you; an everlasting reminder of the first life I destroyed and the necessity of what I must do next.

Forgive me. 

Loneliness truly is the price of peace."
lonely,A lonely boy,"A lonely boy - I'm Aaron, 28 almost 29. I'm lonely, never had a girlfriend."
lonely,I’m about to get rid of a huge stuffed animal given to me by my last boyfriend who ghosted me and I’m afraid to lose the feeling of someone next to me in bed.,I’m about to get rid of a huge stuffed animal given to me by my last boyfriend who ghosted me and I’m afraid to lose the feeling of someone next to me in bed. - He gave me a huge sloth stuffed animal and he’s been on the other side of the bed for 5 months. I think I’m ready to give it away/donate it but am afraid I’ll make myself feel worse when it’s gone.
lonely,I feel like my friends doesn't really like me.,"I feel like my friends doesn't really like me. - I feel like I just get on my friend's nerves.
I met, and became friends with her a few years ago because we have a lot of classes together. 
But in the past few months she seems that she's become progressively more annoyed with me.
She tries to avoid interacting with me in conversations, and when I do converse with her 1 on 1 she seems really disinterested and distant no matter.
I have severe trust issues, and barely have any friends, those that I do have I am overly attached to, because I don't have anybody else. I'm probably clingy and obnoxious, and they just stick with me out of pitty."
lonely,Its okay to feel low and hopeless but never lose your dedication and aspiration for things you want,"Its okay to feel low and hopeless but never lose your dedication and aspiration for things you want - As someone who has not been lonely all his life but through stages, I hope I can give some word of advice and tips to you friends. Loneliness, depression and anxiety are little shits that will pull you down in life but you can never accept that they are an inherent part of you. Dont lose hope on having friends, girlfriend, or boyfriend because loneliness, anxiety and depression have been a part of me for more than 80% of my life. But despite that I had success finding friends and finding love. 

&amp;#x200B;

One suggestion I can make is if you live in North America (US or Canada) is to get a part time job as a server or to volunteer in homeless shelter or summer camp. I had severe depression a few years ago but I dont really wanna describe in detail. But 2 years ago I became a server for an agency (where you get 1-2 shifts per week) and you travel to different venues for work. I met a ton of people that way and due to such a relaxed and social work environment, I finally lost my anxiety to talking to strangers and my depression. I met my best friend at the banquet hall I work at and he told me he used to be introverted af before he started working as a server. My last gf I also met at work during one of the shifts. 

Please guys dont give up. Hope you find happiness in your life :)"
lonely,How do people deal with loneliness,"How do people deal with loneliness - I am a guy, 26 years old, I live in a metro city in India. I have been introvert and lonely pretty much all my life...never had any friends in school or college, acquaintances here and there, but no real friendship.

Never had a girlfriend or any sort of romantic relationship..I've been living on my own since last 8 years and this loneliness has become unbearable now. I keep myself busy, have become a workaholic and all but still, everytime I see people with friends or their partners, it feels like something died inside of me.....as if I've failed in my life. Crying doesn't help either.

Are there others who feel like me? How do you deal with this?"
lonely,"I cut off a friendship with my ""best friend"" months ago because I'm toxic.","I cut off a friendship with my ""best friend"" months ago because I'm toxic. - And this would be the last friendship I'll have, I'm not a good person, I have to be alone, isolated, for their own good. 

I always ghost people because of my social anxiety and selfishness, I'm not good at making friends, so people out of pity get to me to know me.

I told her that we're not friends anymore bc of my toxic behavior, she didn't understood, she got mad at me, and she doesn't talk to me no more.

It's for her own good, even if it hurts. 

But in the other hand a voice in my head tells me that ""I want to be alone"" and that's why I had to break up with her.

I don't know what to think."
lonely,Miss having friendships like when we were young,"Miss having friendships like when we were young - I'm in my mid 20s. And I miss having friendships like highschool friends. I miss calling people and being like ""hey, are you busy? I'm coming over, let's hangout."" I find it so hard to make friends. No I don't mean meet people. Meeting people is easy:

Hey my name is Jessica how are you? Bam, I just met you.

But building these solid relationships like before, where you'd drop everything to be with that friend because it meant so much to you. 

Thanks life"
lonely,Why do people complain about notifications?,"Why do people complain about notifications? - I don't understand those people who are like ""oh my God I just took a half hour nap and woke up to over 100 texted and snaps""

I get so excited whenever my phone goes off but then it's almost always just a ""trending on r/__"" or a useless email and I immediately get so disappointed because I thought it might be someone replying to me.

Feel free to DM me I'm so lonely"
lonely,I Feel So Lonesome,"I Feel So Lonesome - I feel so isolated. I always stay cooped up in my house, because I'm too weird, ugly, and socially awkward to make new friends, and I'm too poor to go out and do something fulfilling. I'm not excited for Summer break at all (I'm in highschool). School is my only source of major social interaction, so the moment Summer break hits, that will be cut off completely for nearly three months. I wish I had somebody I could spend the majority of my time with, having fun and shooting the shit, maybe falling in love. All that dumb and juvenile stuff. I always feel like my wants, quirks, and personality are simply too different. That, because of what um into and how I am, I'll never get a girlfriend, I'll never get more than the one or two genuine friends I have, and I'll ultimately just he lonely forever. I don't know how or what could possibly remedy this crippling sense of isolation and loneliness. I wish I wasn't so weird and particular in my personality and mannerisms. Maybe then I'd be easier to like. I'm just a stupid music nerd that plays video games and collects vinyl records and hates rap because of how annoying, over played, and mindless it is nowadays. Nobody my age that I have met is anything like that. Everything about me is different from most people my age (at least in my hometown, since I've never been outside of my own state). My music taste, my morals and values, my personal style, the way I think, hell, even how I spend my time. Everything about me is different. I hate it. It creates this sort if alienation of my person. I hate being different. I hate not fitting in. I hate the fact that I'll die alone. I feel so lonesome."

lonely,“Interesting title #2”,"“Interesting title #2” - This’ll be my second post here. I think it really helps to vent my thoughts and translate them into legible sentences like this, in a place where no one I know will read them. It always feels as if my mind is at war with itself, and it can’t decide what it thinks. I post here because loneliness is admittedly a major part of my problems, yet I don’t think, at this point at least, that I would ever consider suicide, so r/suicidewatch is out of the question. I just feel...empty. Like I’m trying too hard to be something I’m not. Like everything I know is bullshit. Constantly switching between an optimistic and pessimistic perspective is becoming very tiresome. 
Today was just a normal day. Nothing special really. Every day for the past 17 years has not been anything special. It’s all routine. I wouldn’t say my circumstances are bad in any way, but again, it’s all about standards and perspectives. I’ve always been the quiet kid. Always having nothing to say, being complimented on my ‘intelligence’, seemingly having no outside emotions. Lately I’ve been trying to be more outgoing though. This year especially. And this year has been a hell of a roller coaster. My grades, for the first time in all my school years, have started slipping. Great. I can’t force myself to do the book work, and when I tried, I couldn’t understand any of it... My friend tells me I’m still a living robot even though I thought I’ve improved. I suppose not. I just want a fresh start to change my personality.
I wanna talk about the loneliness specifically now. I had my first girlfriend this year. That was a disaster. I think I only dated her because I was desperate at that point. I would never reach out to anyone and didn’t have any female friends up to that point. It got too serious too fast and I realized I did not want to date her anymore. Cut it off quickly after I realized. Now I have a crush on this other girl in my class. I might as well bury that deeper than the Mariana Trench because I fucked up any chance i might’ve had with her. Here’s what happened: I tell my friend who I have a crush on (who, by the way, I’ve literally never talked to before; I’ve just seen her in class and thought she was really cute), he says he’ll try to talk to her and bring it up sometime. That wasn’t good enough for me. I told him to tell her NOW that I liked her. Yea, real smart. I’m not sure why he listened to me. Looking back at this now makes me wanna kill myself (well yes, but actually no) because I now realize that this girl got a text from her friend saying “blahblahblah likes you.” You know what she says? “Who?” He told me her response and that’s when I realized I fucked up. But wait, it gets better. He tells her to at least talk to me before she makes a decision. So she adds me on Snapchat. (Commence most awkward conversation in the history of awkward conversations.) I still stand by the fact that she was the one that made it super awkward though. She didn’t reply for hours, possibly days at a time. When she did reply, it always a one word response like ok or idk. I really wish she could’ve just told me to stop talking to her or something. I cut off the conversation because I knew she wanted nothing to do with it, and proceeded beat myself up over how much of an absolute retard I was in this whole situation. All I wanted was to get to know her better. Possibly make a new friend. Possibly something more. Now I can’t even look her in the eye.  I give up trying for girls right now. As long as she’s still in my mind.
I’ve got no solid plan for what I want to do out of high school. Everyone in my classes knows what college they’re going to and what they’re studying for. 
I don’t like the idea of going to college. I really don’t. Depending on what I decide to do, that would be at least 4 more years of my life gone die to schooling. Also unless I get hella scholarships (which isn’t too promising considering my grades this year) is have to take a student loan and be in debt for the rest of my life. Yea, I’d rather not. Anything I thought of though that I wanted to do requires college. Computers? College. Aviation? College. 
This will be the end of entry #2 of ‘random person’s rant on life ‘. I’ll probably be back sooner than I hope. But for now I have to get at least an hour of sleep before school. Still know it’s not gonna happen but I might as well try. Goodnight."
lonely,Does anyone else harden their heart because they know how sensitive they are deep down?,"Does anyone else harden their heart because they know how sensitive they are deep down? - My heart is usually quite hardened but I recently started talking to an old friend again and that made my heart open up again which wasn't good. We got into talking about some heavy stuff from my past and I started crying because I was kinda reliving the pain of what happened which was terrible. I do my best not to think about such things to avoid crying or start scratching myself involuntarily. I don't leave actual scratches, it's just like I'm scratching an itch is all. The problem is I keep things buried/pushed down for so long I don't even remember that they were painful until I think about them again. After we talked I literally felt a gap in me for days and felt more sensitive than normal. Luckily there's a song I listen to that fixes me up. I'm not generally unfriendly so most people don't even notice anything.

Unfortunately something happened and we have to take a break from talking to each other which sucks. I really want to believe the reason for the break is valid but my ""b.s meter"" keeps going off in the back of my mind and there is 1 thing that makes me question him. I know I'm probably wrong because we haven't even been talking long enough for lying to be an issue yet/ there's no reason to lie to me. I just want people to be honest with me but I'm under the impression that most people don't want to do that. I know it's completely my fault. My heart got way too excited by talking to someone I actually relate to because it's so rare that I do. In general I'm far from depressed but not quite happy but close enough. I try not to get too happy because every time I do pain or disappointment quickly follows. I always try to keep an extremely leveled head when it comes to being social because most social interactions fail for one reason or another. Sometimes I slip up but I've gotten so much better. I have accepted that most people have stuff to do in their lives and I don't. I just try to stay busy so I won't become too happy or eager when social situations go well for a change."
lonely,why do i get attached so fast,"why do i get attached so fast -   
so this is the story : i am not a good looking guy but i am on a couple of dating sites one of them being tinder I know it's not really a dating site but that's besides the point i have a match with this really cute and nice Chinese girl and we started talking and telling eachoter things about us and now I can't stop thinking about her I can't eat and can't sleep without having her in my mind and i just needed a place where I could tell someone and this seemed to be perfect just like her"
lonely,Do you have work colleagues you can relate to or are you isolated at work as well?,"Do you have work colleagues you can relate to or are you isolated at work as well? - I'm 33 next month and I've spent a lot of time trying to understand why I feel the way I do and why I am so lonely.

The last time I never felt alone was when I was working in an environment where a lot of my colleagues were in my age group (within 5-years older or younger) so we had common interests. Since then, the past 12/13-years of my working life have been in smaller companies where I was the youngest or currently in a larger company where I just don't have anything in common with my colleagues and mostly due to cultural and age differences.

I miss the after work drinks on a Friday or the ''I have someone I think you'd like'' conversations.

As an adult it is so much harder to meet people and one of the last ways to do so is through work connections if you don't move in a large social circle."
lonely,My friend group made me lonely,"My friend group made me lonely - My boyfriend has ADHD and I believe he's on the autistic spectrum. I am part of a large friend group who I've been friends with since school but when I started dating my boyfriend, they started to lose contact with me more and more. I still go to parties and hang out with them every so often but not as much as I used to. My boyfriend considers my friend as his friends because he doesn't have very many of his own. 
Recently one of the friends told me that they have made a group chat without me and my boyfriend and made most of their plans on there. She said to me that they found my boyfriend annoying and they didn't want to invite him to things. By accociation, I've stopped being invited too. 
I had gone through such a lonely time for years because they've left me out and now I finally know why, I cannot fucking stand them right now...
Im so pissed off and sad that they'd just push us away like that just because ""hes annoying"".
I've felt so lonely for years because of people like them...I feel like I have no friends anymore."
lonely,Im tired of living FOR myself just as much as by myself.,Im tired of living FOR myself just as much as by myself. - Im tired of doing everything for myself. I want to wake up and go out and work so I can come home and provide for someone. I want to do everything I do to make someone else feel special. Im tired of going through the motions for my own benefit. Im tired of taking care of just myself. I want to hold someone and provide them with the best life possible. This may seem strange but its how I feel. Im tired of living for myself to phrase it best.
lonely,No Title,"No Title - I am so confused about everything now. I feel like I am not even sure what my life is, what I am suppose to do, how to do things. I don't know what my goals are. I feel extremely alone. Even when I was in public school I was and felt alone. I am not unique, the emotions I am feeling are not unique. I don't really know who I am or why I am and I am scared and sad at the same time. I have been thinking about death a lot and it freaks me out. But thinking about my life freaks me out too. If I was more open too my family I might feel better at least having someone there with me as I go through life. But I can't, I can't talk. I think the high point of my life was before I was alive, I don't want too feel anymore."
lonely,I want to be held,"I want to be held - I want to be held. I just want to feel loved and be held by that person. I want to lay down with my head on their lap. I want them to play with my hair and I want to finally feel loved and at peace with someone. 

I'm tired of being so lonely and feeling neglected, when I probably have no reason to feel neglected. I'm just lost in life and don't know where else to rant. Or who to rant to."

I always worry that everyone literally hates and therefore I go off on them and end up distancing myself.

lonely,Worrying about my future,Worrying about my future - I been by myself for 6 years. I used to uave close friends back in 3 grade but things change and we grew apart. Im now in highschool now and im currently going to be a senior next year. Ive been depressed throughout my highschool i usually sit in lunch by myself. I do have some senior friends but the thing is that we are always busy and there is going to be a good chance that we might disconnected since college is right around the corner. I used to liked this girl and luckily enough liked me back but she is also a senior and we both have to end it because she said she wasnt ready for a relationship plus she will have to cut everyone off because she doesnt want highschool memories to get her held back due to the fact the she actually enjoys my school. Im 18 and im one year older than everyone because i got held back due to a nasty elementary school teacher. So i find kids very imature and i usually hang out with senior who are my age and i get to know them a bit better. I see people in groups and it makes me depressed because i cant even make one. I tried going to play hand ball to interact with people but i realized that its harder to meet people and get to know them outside of school. I couldnt even joined clubs because im just completely shut down and depressed. I also had dramas and it screwed me up more than ever. I plan on doing clubs in college but like what happens if i dont make friends again in college. People say i need to be independent and make myself happy especially the girl who i liked told me about it. But back of my head im saying that its easier for them to say be independent when they already have friends. I just fear that after college if i dont have my stuff settle in and i dont make friends than what else am i going to do. I had people telling me that life takes patience but 6 years to make friends when others take like one month. I sometimes wash my pain away by getting high and drinking but the results seems to be the same. I also went to counseling but im still feel sad. I tried making friends with loneliness but it always beats me. I did everything i can and i listen to linkin park to help me with my pain

I'm going to enter the university after this summer but I'm scared of being alone again, I struggle a lot to make new friends because I need to get to know them well and I need to be sure that they are nice people. 

I feel that I have distanced myself from my friends during the last two years and they are slowly moving away from me, I know that this assumption comes from my head, but sometimes I feel like a stranger. 

And also, what will happen if I'm not able to find a new friend group at the university?"
lonely,Is it possible to die of loneliness?,"Is it possible to die of loneliness? - I feel like I legitimately couldn't stand another week without companionship. The most social interaction I got this week was a brief lunch and stifled conversation with a friend who I one-sidedly love.

I just want to have meaningful conversation and make memories with somebody. It feels as though everyone already has an existing friend group and is not interested in making new ones though. I feel like the people looking for friends are often too weird for me to relate to. 

I've lost interest in everything. Instead of occupying my spare time with hobbies, when I get home from work I spend it sitting on the sofa with a burning desire to talk to somebody. 

Fuck I just want this to be over. I don't know where to meet people."
lonely,My heart hurts and no one knows.,"My heart hurts and no one knows. - Okay, my therapist knows, but I only see her once a week. And I pay her to listen, so it's not like she's a friend I can lean on. Don't get me wrong, I find therapy enlightening. I'm more miserable now and more often, but I'm finally being honest with myself. Before, when I was ""okay"", I wasn't really... I was just lying to myself. And while ignorance can be bliss, it took me to some pretty dark places.

Anyway, I'm here because I broke down last night. I felt the full weight of my loneliness and sobbed. I don't think I'm suicidal, but the ideation that's been with me for years took some dark turns last night. I didn't call the Suicide Prevention Lifeline, but I did look up the number. I saved it to my emergency contacts so I can get to it quickly... just in case.

I still don't feel okay and I'm not looking forward to seeing what tonight brings. I just wish I could tell my friends what's going on in my head without feeling like a burden. So I'm telling strangers instead."
lonely,"Dear redditors, can you relate?","Dear redditors, can you relate? - Do you ever stop for a minute and think ""What the hell are you doing?"" 

Meeting all those people on reddit, trying to form a friendship, maybe a relationship or any kind of connection you are looking for. You name it. 
But things dont work out well. You end up hurting each other, misunderstand or there are simply unfortunate situations that make things  go down the hill. 

I have talked to a handful of people and it was kind of a rollercoaster of feelings, all kinds of feelings actually. Seeing all those people come and go. And today I just feel empty and kinda messed up. I think I disappointed myself aswell.

I dont want to point my finger towards anyone, but the time I've spent on reddit felt more toxic than anything else. 

Im not here to bring people down, I'm just wondering if there are people who can relate."
lonely,Can I allow myself to let people in? (RANT),"Can I allow myself to let people in? (RANT) - So, I'm 21 now and I honestly feel for the past 3 years I've done nothing. I've taken a back seat in my own life and I essentially just sit there and comment negatively on myself. I still think about every mean thing that someone said to me in secondary school and its pathetic, I just beat myself up and then beat myself up for feeling negative. I fantasize about saying the right thing or having an amazing comeback to something said to me when I was 14 or something. The worst part is it feels like I can't help it, that these thoughts will always exist and closure is almost scary. Its like there's a very powerful part of me that likes being this way and its winning every time. I've always been interested in psychology but I don't think its really helped, I can put names and labels to behaviors and emotions but this awareness has done little in actually changing my attitude. Its been a long time since I've enjoyed something, or made a good memory. I understand that by reacting to these thoughts i'm feeding the ego but I keep slipping back into old ways, I will act how I normally do and my therapist and others around me say that i'm not taking care of myself. I honestly don't know how else to be. I feel that mentally I am still the same as I was when I was a child, the same issues persist and plague me and change is just not an option. There are days where I wake up fine, filled with confidence and the next i'm back to my old self with no rhyme or reason to it. Ok, got a bit side tracked there and this is a loneliness post. In school I had a good group of friends, guys who were on my level, we got along great and had similar interests I could be myself around them. But I held a deep insecurity that I think was plain to see. I never felt ""cool"" in myself, I was awkward and painfully shy. Always wanting more and taking my friends for granted. My lack of confidence really affected my social skills, I was terrified of other people. Whenever possible I would spend my time in-front of the TV playing video games. I could play it for hours, in my own world where I was in control. No one could hurt me or saying anything mean. I feel I should mention that ever since I was a kid I've been extremely sensitive, anything said to me I would take it to heart and the physical sensation was torturous. I hoped that I would not care about these things and I would develop thick skin, but it never really happened. I built my life around protecting myself. I was a yes man to anyone who was mean to me, I would be nice to people even if they treated me like shit, even when I fought back either physically or verbally it just led to more ridicule . I put everyone above myself if it meant being safe. But try as I might I couldn't control everyone, there were cracks in the defense, so I tried to change myself as much as physically possible becoming extremely self-conscious of my looks, this was most prevalent during my teenage years and has lessened now. But that idea of protection has never gone away, I come home from work or college and sit in my room, still playing video games or just browsing the internet and i'm gradually slipping away from my friends. I've almost convinced myself that I don't need them, and that they're actually bad people and I don't need them. But Jesus Christ, I need someone. I just want to be part of something, to belong to a group and experience the world together and i'm afraid that I will never allow myself to get there."
lonely,I thought graduating from high school would solve all of my problems. I was very wrong.,"I thought graduating from high school would solve all of my problems. I was very wrong. - A bit of a dramatic title, but I guess that's just how I'm feeling. I'll admit that I was very depressed in high school, and I thought that once I graduated, everything in my life would be made right. I graduated from high school less than a year ago, and I started college last fall. The friends that I had in high school usually left me out of things, but I was at least grateful to talk to people every day. I never hung out with friends over the weekends or after school or during breaks because I always felt like no one ever really wanted me there. I left high school on good terms with all of my friends, and we follow each other on social media. The problem with that is that every time I see a post or a snap from them, they're always hanging out with friends (from high school or with new ones) and I never am. I'm extremely shy and introverted, so I haven't made a single friend in college. My roommate tried to be friends with me for about a month until she gave up due to my short answers and general quietness. I just can't help it. I wish more than anything else that I wasn't so socially anxious and that I could be outgoing. I feel so lonely. I don't have a single friend, and I'm 18 years old, which should be a time that I'm trying new things, but I just can't out of fear. I'm at home for the summer now, and somehow it feels even more depressing that I'm at home and still no one wants to spend time with me. I fear that my life is always going to be like this, but taking the first steps to get to know people feels so impossible. I've seen several therapists and psychiatrists throughout the last 7 years, but I feel like I make no progress, which I blame entirely on myself. I can't shake the feeling that I've ruined my life before it ever really started."
lonely,im so messed up,"im so messed up - missed school for 4 days, i don't know what's wrong with me i just don't want to see anyone or anything related, don't wanna see the hallways, dont wanna see people coming and going and chatting and laughing, don't wanna see the only few people who i used to care about, 
 i wish there was a special someone who i could tell everything to and do everything with
 this year is supposed to be the most important year that determines the direction of my future education. i do care about studying and so on but it seems like i don't, really. school was never a place i enjoyed because there were always stupid things and stupid people. most of the times im alone, sitting somewhere, in a corner, gradually i started to spend most of the time in the washroom stall
 who really cares, i mean. i used to think i had a couple of people who cared about me. screw my life, i mean.

A bit ago, I had broken my leg and sprained my hand after a skateboard accident. I've been fortunate to have family around to help me out; but I don't have friends. I cut off my last best friend after she attacked me while she was drunk. Although my roommates are cool, they're not the type of people I'd like to hang with. I can't go anywhere without a knee scooter, can't exercise until the injury is healed. I live next to a large university in Miami, but I don't know how to find events on campus since no one tells me.

&amp;#x200B;

Because she’s scared she’ll hurt me and lose me forever and despite what I say nothing changes her mind. At first i didn’t believe her, I kept trying and trying, even now I try. But, I think I’m finally starting to agree. She struggles with commitment. And, she may just break my heart like those in the past. I know this yet, there’s still so much love for her. She’s suggested I find someone else, yet despite how hard I try I just can’t. I cant find anyone else. And, I really don’t know what to do anymore."

lonely,Going to prom alone and crush just promposed to someone,Going to prom alone and crush just promposed to someone - I needed to vent. My Senior prom is coming up and I have no one to go with. I've never been in a romantic relationship nor been approached by someone so I didn't expect for anyone to ask me to prom. However I saw my crush posted his promposal to a girl and I felt my heart sink. A few months ago I had already approached him and confessed my feelings and got politely rejected. I'm mostly over him but the post got to me somehow. I didn't feel jealous. I felt lonely. Prom was always a night I imagined I would spend with someone I really cared about. Seeing that post made me realize how truly alone I am. I felt so unwanted and alone. It got worse once I saw everyone pairing up and people who were once single get dates and partners. I'm going with friends but most have dates and I'm going to be the awkward third wheel. I went to my homecoming and it was the same outcome and it came out terribly. I feel like my prom night is going to be the same and including me self loathing and pitying myself all night. I dont know how to avoid these feelings and I can't talk to my friends because I'm tired of bringing him up. I can't control how depressed I am over it.

I've observed it in my mentality and the way my beliefs and values have become skewed because of it. I'm 26 and I just feel this impending doom like ""I'm running out of time"" to form lasting friendships. I just want to belong to a group of friends and try new things, play some board games, go hiking, eat new foods, have some goofs and gaffs, just whatever you know? I literally have no one and the most fucked up part is that I delude myself into thinking that I like it this way. I don't. I'm ambiverted, but not antisocial and this loneliness has been picking away at my mental health these past few years slowly breaking me down. Humans need other humans, there's just no way around that. We may not like it, but we have to conform to our nature. So I'll keep trying."

lonely,Venting because I got no frens,"Venting because I got no frens - Get your popcorn, this story isn't short. 

When I was younger, someone once told me that your life doesnt start until the day it almost ends. Well for me, that day is 3/14/13. My parents were drug dealers so they never really kept an eye on me or my siblings so when I was 13, my friends who had a similar background would run amuck in a smallish town in Kentucky. We walked across town to the movie theater pretty often and sometimes we even walked to the local Walmart. Hearing it like that doesn't do any justice so note theres about 5 miles of bypass and highway to either place and we're just a group of 8th graders. On pi day, we had pie in math class, did a lab in science, and overall had a great Friday. Afterschool we were hanging at T's house. T's parents were addicts so he and I got along well because we understood each other. We got another friend, IA, to go with us to go see this liam Neeson movie where he's an air marshal and the plane gets taken hostage and after the movie we walk back to T's house to spend the night. I got hit by a Red jeep while crossing a bypass. I remember being on the ground and getting up to walk towards T, who was mortified. I shattered my left foot. Metatarsals 2-5 broken in 2 places each and metatarsal 1 was at a 45° angle. 

Fast forward a few months.

I had just started highschool and we moved to a nearby town to lower the risk of my parents getting busted. Got my first girlfriend. She was extremely clingy. Things at the new school worked out great for about a year and a half. Feb 5, 2016; my grandma died. My mom was in prison for selling drugs and my dad moved back to the old town, I was living with my sister. I dealt with her passing pretty well for the most part. I spent valentine's day at the funeral and the girlfriend wasn't happy about that at all. Somehow it got miscommunicated to the girlfriend's mother that my sister was selling drugs to feed us so she calls my grieving sister and starts a fight, the sister responded by sending me to live with my father. 

A couple weeks pass and I move in with him.

Upon my arrival he tells me that ""you know, you're 15 and you're old enough to take care of yourself so I'll just be here if you absolutely need me"" and he vanishes to go live with his mistress that he eventually leaves my mom for. So 15 year old me gets a full time job at a fast food place nearby and works full time while going to school, my grades suffer, I starve, and eventually become homeless after a couple months because he was already behind on rent.

After nearly a week, T asks me why I smell like ass and dumpster and I tell him I've been homeless for a few days and dont have anywhere to go.

I move in with T, and his family, in a house that wasn't exactly the safest of places. I live with T and eventually carry the house by paying the rent and utilities (pretty impressive for 17.) I even got a new girlfriend. I didnt pay the water bill one month and his parents told me I had to leave. Ok whatever. 

I'm homeless for 2 days before I bring myself to tell the girlfriend. Her mom calls me and tells me she's coming to pick me up and I'm going to live with them until I turn 18.

Girl tells me in January of 2018 she doesn't love me and wants her ex back. But decides she wont break up with me until graduation so I dont have to be homeless again. She slowly became distant and cold over the next few months and eventually started to hate me. My birthday was 2 weeks after graduation.
May 25th, she breaks up with me and I starved myself for 18 days because I was too sad to eat. I didn't sleep much, or do much of anything but cry because I was so hurt. She was apathetic about the whole situation and didn't understand how much I still loved her. I was still working fast food and on my income alone, didnt qualify to live anywhere and the income housing in the town is ridiculously packed. I bought a car for $1500 and didnt know how to drive it, and we kept it parked at her grandmas house because it didnt have tags until I turned 18.

The day comes.

We wake up at 0800 and finish packing the rest of my stuff. It was at this point she told me she planned a vacation with the ex and they were going to Tampa Florida for a couple weeks. She and her mom dropped me off at my car and her mom asked me if I had somewhere to go. I told her and old guy was letting me rent his vacation home until I'm on my feet, I didnt want to hurt her moms feelings and didn't want her mom to feel bad because her step dad was the one who ordered that I move out on my birthday. I hugged both of them and that was the last time I saw them. I got in my car and turned the keys in the ignition and said ""if I die, I die"" and then taught myself how to drive by driving all over town to visit people.

I hung out with T and he had told me about plans to go on vacation with his wife and he said he wished I had money and time. I told him I had 5 days off and $1000. We went on vacation up north.

After vacation I lived in my car for 2 months. Still hurt about the girl at the time and to this day, still uncomfortable with everything. I moved in with an old coworker for a few months but the conditions were terrible. I wrecked my car shortly after I moved in with them and got a new, better job. 

Right around Thanksgiving my mother had finally gotten out of prison and rehab and moved in to income housing with my younger sister. I decided to move in with them and after being there for 3 months. She had 4 strokes one night and went to hospital the a couple days later. When they were loading her into the ambulance, she told me that I had 2 days to find somewhere and move because we were getting evicted. I spent the first day finding a place and managed to pull $1100 out of my ass and thin air and then spent the second day moving in while the sherriffs dept was putting our stuff on the road. We've been here for 3 going on 4 months now and I'm almost 9, carrying a family of 4. 

Now the reason I posted this. It's 0300 and I'm sad as shit and I'm just wondering why I had to go through all of that and why it's still so hard. That's not even the full story. I'm sad because since that girl I havent even met anyone new because I'm terrified of getting close to anyone. I haven't really spent time with anyone outside of work and home and I'm dying for answers. It's always been crazy and I feel like all of that shit is affecting me mentally. I feel like being comfortable is an impossible task. Someone please tell me if you've got any answers."

lonely,Venting,"Venting - I’ve lived a pretty lonely life, I’ve never really had friends and due to being homeschooled I never really had a lot of interaction with people my age after my only friend moved away from next door when I was 11. I’ve never had a real connection with any girls, the only relationships I’ve ever had were short flings that lasted less than 2 months each; I didn’t go on a date until I was 21. 

I decided to start attending my local community college at the age of 22, about halfway through my first semester I started talking to a girl that I had been crushing on since the first week of class. We had a lot in common and really hit it off, our conversations were always fun and sometimes flirty. She was the first person that genuinely made my day better whenever I saw her, whenever she showed up it instantly improved my mood. Fast forward a few weeks to when I built up the courage to ask her on a date; I asked her out on a date specifically so there was no confusion as to whether it was just a friendly hangout or a date. She initially said yes but said she had to work so I should text her later and we could figure something out. I texted her the next day to set something up and that’s when she explained that she had a boyfriend that I had not heard a thing about this entire time. She said with respect to him she would not go out with me, and said she felt bad for possibly leading me on. I probably shouldn’t have done this but I creeped on her social media and found out that she was not lying about the boyfriend.

This was only a couple of weeks before the end of the semester and we only saw each other a few times during that span, we didn’t talk in person again but still had conversations through text. Following the end of the semester she transferred to a major university 12 hours away. We haven’t talked in 5 months now but I still think about her pretty often and I really miss her and our friendship. I know I should probably just forget about her and move on and I’ve tried to do that but I haven’t been able to. 

I’m sorry if this was long but I have nobody in my life that I feel comfortable enough with to open up to like this. I’ve gone through most of my life alone and I’m tired of it, I just want somebody to genuinely spend time with. I just want some advice on how to deal with this."
lonely,Some bittersweet hope,"Some bittersweet hope - Hi guys,

I’m not sure if this really fits here, but I’ve had anxiety my whole life and have had trouble relating to people / people relating to me, so I thought I’d share this.

My female friend (J) and I aren’t super close, but we’re similar. We’re both pretty introverted, prone to feeling lonely and craving connection, not sexually driven to the extent some of our other friends are, we always laugh at each other’s jokes/ what we say. I think we both share anxiety about a lot of things.

I don’t know if I’m just completely wrong, but when we look at each other I feel like there’s this unspoken feeling that we just kind of “get” each other.  We don’t hangout outside of a group setting really, and don’t text each other much, but I still feel it.

My other friend just started dating her after two years of them being best friends. I’m excited for them; I knew I’d never be as close with her as he is - they became close pretty much immediately after we met her - and I never had any intention to pursue her. Our friend group has kind of been waiting for this to happen, it was seen as inevitable. They work so well together and are pretty much inseparable. 

Even if he wasn’t in the picture I don’t think anything would have developed. Because we’re really similar, neither of us would get the other to open up in any significant way. But we still share a connection, I think.

For my birthday last year, along with a little gift she wrote me a little letter on a flash card that was so warm and genuine I kept it the whole year. The other week one of my friends texted me asking to go to a festival (were in New Orleans). I said sure, and she said she would ask J too. A few minutes later she texted me again - a screenshot of their conversation. J, when she learned I was coming, said “wait he’s my favorite person”. She’s not the woo girl type to just say something like that. It made my day and weekend, and still makes me feel warm when I think of it. 

It makes me a bit wistful and hopeful. The fact that there are people out there whom I can understand and who understand me, the fact that I can feel a connection with someone without even being that close with them. I guess I feel like we’re kindred spirits in a way, I don’t know. Again maybe I’m just romanticizing it way too much. But I’ve had crushes and cringy longings for girls before, and this isn’t that.

 It makes me emotional. It’s really hard to explain, but it just makes me feel like I’m not alone. It makes me really happy to know there are people like her."
lonely,"It’s me, again","It’s me, again - I have written these kind of posts many times now on many different subreddits, and even though I haven’t had success finding a friend yet I still believe that one person is out there somewhere, I am strictly looking for a friend, nothing more. I have talked to a lot of people on reddit now, and even though it hasn’t gone anywhere I still believe there is someone on here for me, I’m a person that will not give up and I am not going to give up on this. My current situation is this; I have no friends, I never really have had any friends, and me and my family aren’t close. I’m a 19 year old guy from England and I am currently taking a break from college, I have already been there for two years but I will go back in September to study history. I won’t list all of my interests here because that’s boring but I’ll just say that I am a really athletic yet nerdy guy who is also a devout Catholic. It would be awesome to meet someone similar to me with similar interests, or even same religion. 

I have been through so much, it doesn’t make me special or unique, everyone goes through their own shit but I can say with confidence that I have been through a lot more than most have, six relationships, three of them cheated, one I had to end because her family were Muslim and she got married forcibly, one of them was incredibly abusive towards me and I have never told anyone any of this, I’ve never seen a therapist, I’ve never seen a doctor, I do have mild autism, anxiety and depression but I deal with it in my own, healthy (might I say) way. If anyone were to send me a message it would mean so much to me, you would be giving me so much happiness, just one person who would be willing to talk and to listen would probably change my life for the better to be honest, I’m Just looking for a friend."

And if I don't have any close personal connections, which for all intents and purposes typically means a relationship, then I'd feel no energy to work toward my creative pursuits.

In most cases when I feel sad and lonely, it's the latter.

The second problem is that the first problem is self-perpetual. Having less energy to pursue personal connections with people means that over time, I will have less energy to pursue personal connections with people. 

So I try to make do by delving deeper into the other source of fulfilment by staying alone, and working on creative things. Playing piano, writing, drawing, programming, you name it. But after a while I just kind of lose the desire to do that too.

And that's where I've been at recently. To be fair to myself though, a year ago I was in a worse place, and I essentially cannot go there ever again. A year ago, I'd never been in a relationship before in my whole life and had no memories to look back on to comfort me in my loneliness. Today, I have some of those memories and they won't go away. But they can only help so much, you know? 

I think it's important to be aware of positive stuff like that though. Right now, I'm tired. Mentally tired of trying to pursue a deep, meaningful connection all from scratch again. Online dating (and dating in general) is a slow, painfully gradual process filled with constant defeats and rare successes. And while I've become more resilient to the process over time, it still wears on me after a while. 

I had such a small taste of that meaningful connection before I parted ways with my first and only romantic partner, and it made me realize how badly I need that sort of thing in my live. The number one thing I need right now is a person to whom I can express the deepest, most securely guarded aspects of who I am. And to receive the same from them. Online connections help to some degree, but they just don't compare to the romantic connection of a real relationship."

I'm also want to find someone to have a relationship with, but again, there's no one around me. I miss having friends to hang out with. Life is very lonely for me. I'm alive, but I'm not living.

Its like they can see the weakness and just want to prey on it. I always felt like I’m just not on anyone’s level and that I don’t fit in. Never had a bad upbringing the rest of family is just fine. Thought out my teenage years and in secondary school i stop being all emotional or cried, i just started lying and hyping myself up just so I could avoid getting pick on which made me feel like was developing fake relationship with people. I’ve now cut them all off because I felt like I was doing the wrong thing life just felt stupid. Especially as I failed most of they my exams at the end of Secondary School. I though that when I get to University that life would be much better didn’t have to lie just be myself and hopefully I can make friends that are worthwhile. But when I got here it was just the same old shit with people, everything I said or did felt fake didn’t understand how to develop a friendship with anyone. Coming to the end of university without knowing where my life is going. At home everything is falling apart live in my family. Some of my siblings have stop talking to me without any reason and I don’t do anything anymore I literally just wake up, go on my phone, do uni work, eat and go to sleep. Feel like I’m just a waste of space tbh. I just feel like I don’t belong anywhere don’t know where my life is going just feel like there nothing for me to do anymore. I’m just lonely."

lonely,No friends,"No friends - I am a Junior in high school and I don't have any friends. All day I'm either doing school work or am on my phone since I have no one to talk to. I have really bad social anxiety, to the point where talking to a stranger makes me throw up, so I can't just go up to someone and make a conversation based on nothing. Watching tv shows and movies of people in high school and seeing them with their big friend groups always makes me feel depressed since that is something I want but will never have. I don't want to live my entire senior year as someone who eats by themselves at lunch and has no one to write in their yearbook. Most of the time I feel like nobody talks to me because I'm ugly or since I am of bigger body proportions, and seeing ""fuck &lt;my name&gt; on the bathroom stalls doesn't help. I just want someone."

They're all really nice but I just dont have much to say so I just listen or sit by myself. This one super nice girl named Hannah asked me if I was okay because I wasn't talking with everyone and I am, but obviously Id like to talk more. Its difficult to join into their conversations because they're actually on real stuff not just silly high school things. I don't talk about high school stuff really but its hard for me to think of stuff to say. Its only my second day and its just training. But when the museum opens in two weeks we will be in smaller groups so I think I'll find that easier to talk with people."

I crave someone that takes the edge of and treats me nice, an inspiration to really become the best version of myself, someone with a tender touch.
But all I see is the Madness of what people call love.
I'm doubting everything when it comes to love and having a SO. I talk to women to find myself in disgust of them instead of beeing able to develope a bond.
I feel like there is no consistency in relationships, everyone is promiscous, and everything related to love is just doomed. I hate the mating game for its competetiveness and paranoia projecting essence.  I've lost all faith, but unfortunately the feelings won't go away.

lonely,Random late night thoughts,"Random late night thoughts - Hey guys  if there's anyone feeling lonley and want to chat I would be open for that!

I am an introvert and I never fit in anywhere in society. My family thinks I am the akward person who always avoids everyone at family meetings. I had lots of friends in the past but I started to focus more on school since the people arround me were always fake. I mean I dont understand why humans are like this? Most People make fun of others because they look different etc., how would they behave if they were in their body instead of their own. Are we just determined by the way we look? But after all, dont this people realise that this universe is just what me make out of it? We could change the hole world. But this revolution would need to many people and people are tired and lazy so nothing happens. If we were made by aliens, did they create us on purpose being so mean to each other? Maybe there's an alien race that is connected thelepatically, so they feel each others emotions as their own, therefore they wouldnt be so mean to each other. I think the age of the internet is something powerful, it lets us already share some thoughts we would otherwise never speak of in real life. Every morning and everytime before falling asleep I loose my motivation because life seems so meaningless. Do most people just seem to fit into society? Are they really happy, because I think deep down most of us are truely sad. If you look around all the angry people are just very sad people (I discovered a friend of mine who had this behaviour). The bad thing is if you hang out with those people they start being mean to you , but then sometimes they apologize. So you never know if you should get rid of those people since their negativity drowns you or just look away from those traits and help this person to cope with life. And then you feel just isolated and alone because your ""friends"" are pretty mean. Being a loner changed my life in a happy way, although I would like some human contact. I just cant stand the negativity anymore. (However I still have contact with those people but I stopped calling them my friends in my mind)Being alone can be so peaceful and yet so painfull.  My mum has cancer and due to her chemotherapy her mood changed into a bad behaviour. She gets angry really quick and yells at me, but I just dont respond because I somehow think its not her fold. All people in pain are angry. And then the people surrounded by those get depression. Is it the rule of life? (Angry=Sad?)

May there be no meaning life, we still stand up every day trying our best (or worst). How do you guys deal with feeling isolated, surrounded by negative people, feeling not being worth anything for others? Does anyone also feels like this life is a joke? Therefore I cant be serious arround people anymore when they get angry. I just think what will it mather in 100years when we are all dead? Theres not really a meaning in life its the concept of the human mind like everything else we experience. After one long existential crisis you cant take anything serious anymore.

Sitting here contemplating life I just wanted to get my thoughts out, thanks for reading!"

About summertime, youthful, vibrant love, when feelings first brew between two people, exploring a whole new world of possibilities as you grow up and explore the realm together. I guess to most people you’d think back to that special girl/guy and relate to the song, you’d look back and remember in school, at prom when you first kissed, made love and did these things which are sure to stimulate such a glow inside you. You might have already picked up with my over theatrics that I have a different take on the song from the one that I feel most people have, the reason it might’ve been so popular. To me the song resembles everything I didn’t have at school. Everything I don’t have now and everything I feel like I’m missing out on. It makes me reflect now, while one by one all my friends, had girlfriends, experienced different things and emotions I’m yet to feel. I feel like I’m totally fucking up on this one, just can anyone relate this? Does the song make anyone else cry? To me it was just a huge slap in the face and a realisation for the first time that wow I’m lonely. Even worse, as I’ve gotten older I’m probably further than I’ve ever been to being in a relationship.

At my University I often see guys and girls walking around together, I mean that in the mixed and segregated sense and most of the time I just feel ashamed to be walking around by myself all the time. I guess all I’m really trying to say is I regret never having someone to love or someone that’s ever loved me. It haunts me to this day and not a single day goes where I wish I just had that someone in my life to be myself with, to just goof the fuck around since that’s what I’m like without all the angst.

lonely,A Werid Situation I'm having problems with.,"A Werid Situation I'm having problems with. - Don't worry, there is a tl;dr, but this is a drawn out post to get the whole aspect.

About a decade ago, I (now 35/m) met someone I had worked with (now 32/f). We hit it off really well and developed a decent friendship. About 5 months in, we go out for a couple of drinks and then she brings me back to my apartment and we end up making out. I proceed to drunkenly skip a base and get handsy. She rightfully pulls away (not angry but just aware of a weakened situation) and ends up leaving (don't worry, I felt ashamed immediately afterwards). For like the next 2-3 weeks, things were awkward; however, after that, we got back to being good friends. I put it in my head that she was off limits and only could be a friend.

She then ends up dating a good friend of mine (at the time). I feel kind of worried about it because I know the guy's history as he had fooled around behind his last girlfriend's back but they were both adults and I had no say in the matter. They end up marrying for about 6 years.

We end up losing touch which kind of sucked but they had moved away. In February 2017, I went through a really tough abrupt breakup that came out of nowhere and at the time, I had thought the reason for the breakup was because of a thing called ""Mother's Guilt"". Not knowing a lot of mothers I could confide in (no, I'm not going to my own mother for something like this), I reach out to her (she has 2 boys) and it was a conversation that lasted about 2 hours and it was more or less just her giving an opinion on how to go about it...nothing more.

Fast Forward to November 2018, after being out of my social circle for almost another 2 years, she posted something on Social Media about Running (she used to run and I run in my off time) and I reached out innocently enough to ask about how to get a better run time. The conversation ends up being a good catch up on things and was almost a solid 2 days of just texting and calling each other. Turns out, she ended up separating from my friend (pretty much for the reason I had thought of at the beginning) for a couple of months.

So it now gets to the point where we are texting each other every day and sending pics to each other (nothing sexual just legit smiles). Around Mid December, we decided to actually have a ""date"". One Sunday afternoon, she dropped off her kids to their father's (they both live about 20-25 minutes from me) and she comes to my place. We go bowling, go to another bar to watch a football game, and then go to my apartment to just get her to sober up since she had to drive home. I then walk her out to her car and she tells me that she enjoyed tonight and wants to do it again, but wants to take things extremely slow since she is still technically separated. I agree because I do believe in taking things extremely slow. We then share a couple of kisses for about 15 seconds and she leaves.

2 weeks later, it's Christmas Eve. She is in the area (by the way, she lives with her parents at the moment in a separate state about 70 miles away so she can't really come this way that often) and I ask her to come over and help me wrap some gifts because I'm a terrible wrapper. I gift her with a bottle of Tito's (didn't cost me anything since I work for a Liquor Distributor just in case you thought I was spending money on her for no reason). She is disappointed she didn't get me anything and I tell her it's not a big deal to me (honestly because she actually showed up). We kiss again and then she leaves.

Mid January, she invites me to come watch her oldest son in a Wrestling Tournament in my own Hometown. I drive an hour out to go there hoping to see a quick match since I had a lot to do that day and had to work later on in the day. I get there and she tells me he had just finished and his next match wasn't going to be another hour and a half. I feel bad but I have to leave before he goes again and gave her a high five (didn't want to have people talking at a public event.)

It was around that time that I realized that I was falling for her, but at the same time keeping my feelings somewhat suppressed because honestly, we would never see each other that often and even though we share some things in common, there are aspects of her that I don't really like. Basically, we are in two different places. Also, around this time, I was trying to talk to someone else but that fell through a month or two.

Come March, I feel our conversations are not as active as they once were. Sure, we were still texting each other, but it was more or less just seeing how the other person's day went. Nothing had really progressed. Around the end of March, I start seeing her post some cryptic posts about ""finding the right person"" and things like that but I don't ask about it because 1. It's not my real business and 2. It'll make me come off as jealous.

In early April, it got really bad. We talked the first Friday and she had mentioned she was going to the Dr and I joked around saying, ""YES"". She then openly admitted to me that she had a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) to get checked out. Who the hell says that to someone of the opposite sex if you are not dating them? Then, earlier in the week she had mentioned that she was going to the Opening Day game of our favorite Baseball team. She doesn't say who she is going with but tells me she will send pictures since I won't be able to go there. So then she goes to  the game, I reached out to her in the morning before the game and she never answered my text. I didn't text anymore after that, hoping to get a picture or two but never got a response.

It was now around the time I go to bed and I was laying down and I go through looking at my social media pages and then the **FIRST** thing I see (I actually wasn't searching for it, but some people's post show up first when you communicate with them I guess) when I open it up is a picture she had posted from the ballpark with the caption...

*When Babe let's you take a picture of a Player's Butt #ClearlyHesAKeeper* (I really hate hashtags....)

So  of course, I'm crushed .  It's now obvious that she is seeing another guy and I knew something like this would eventually happen but I still wasn't ready for it.  The next morning, I text her to ask her how the game went and then she said, ""It was a good time, just a shitty person"".  Turns out (although I don't know every single detail), he was pretty much just using her and he ""hurt"" her.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that this was a sign to actually say how I actually felt.  After a week of sitting on it, making ALOT of revisions to it, I sent her an email telling her my actual feelings towards her.  I went in knowing that there really wasn't anything to come out of it at the moment (not being pessimistic, but just realistic).   She is surprised at how I feel and likes me too, but can't feel anything ""right now"".  Out of the conversation that night, she kept saying ""right now"", not ""I'm not interested in you"" or ""I don't have any sort of feelings towards you"", just ""I can't do it right now"".  Which is what I honestly expected.  

Since then, the conversations have gotten better.  She is more active like she once was.  Which makes me happy that she actually takes the time to reach out to me and share things (sometimes starts the conversations).   To be honest, even the  slightest text or pic makes me feel so good. 

In the past 2 weeks however, even though she still talks to me, some days are good, some days are non existent (meaning she doesn't talk at all).  I try not to look into it but she got me into Snapchat so I'm still relatively new to it.  There is a feature where it shows where a certain person is and earlier tonight, she was at a certain town where she stayed the night  where the guy she was talking to last month lives (I don't think its the guy but its not where she lives).  

I'm not proud of looking.  I need to make that clear.  This is something I have never really done before and its like, I wasn't trying to look but it was right there for me to see and my curiosity got the better of me and it was something I didn't want to do but I am very anxious person at times.

&amp;#x200B;

 I like her, but like I said, there is nothing I can do about it and it sucks. Honestly, I really don't know how to go about the next step...but all I know is I don't want to lose touch with her again, I realize her worth and I want to keep talking to her. I guess the reason I posted this wasn't to necessarily get sympathy but more or less to get some advice.

Do I not say anything to her, let her do her thing and just slowly lose my mind because knowing I like her; it'll drive me nuts seeing posts and pictures with another guy and the inevitable relationship status?

\-or-

Do I say something to her and run the risk of maybe losing her in the process because she'll think all I'm after is just to hook up with her and not have legit feelings or not feel anything at all?

I have never been in a situation like this and honestly, it is a terrible feeling to have and I was hoping some of you out there have had somewhat similar situations.....

Please Help....thank you.

lonely,Catfish confessional,"Catfish confessional - Throw away account for obvious reasons.  This is a hella long story and I’m sorry for that. But it’s fresh and I could really use some words of direction. 

I won’t try and justify my actions because they’re inexcusable and I’ll jump right into it. I’m a male and catfished another guy. 

I was catfishing this guy for approximately two years I would say. We met via a videogame. It started off innocent enough. Simply genuinely enjoying his friendship, and the endless night we’d play until the sunrise. 

At some point it became more than that. We were clearly interested in eachother. We grew out of the game but never eachother. This sort of back and forth carried on for who knows how long. 

At one point we even “took a break” from eachother because he wanted to pursue “another” girl. I secretly prayed it was going to work out so that I could cut him free. This guy became truly one of my best friends. 

Sadly this wasn’t the case. They didn’t work out and I was to weak to embrace the persona and pick up the pieces. As selfish as it was, I wanted to pick them up. I wanted him to go back to being happy. 

Fast forward to a few moths ago, two years or so in, things are far more intimate than they were. Not necessarily on a sexual level since we had been far past that, but just on a spiritual level. I’d be waiting up until 6 am every morning to make sure he was on time for work etc etc. at some point without my knowledge I genuinely fell in love with this guy. I stopped just loving him and am now in love with him. Get what I’m saying? 

Both of us struggle with our own mental battles, just like all humans do. And recently he’s been having more bad days than good, I always try my best to do whatever I can to make him feel even slightly better. At the end of the day all I wanted was his happiness.

But I knew in my heart that these promises of children and dates that I was making. These dreams we would have of eachother. I knew I could never provide them for him. And they’re certainly something he deserves. But I also know that he fell in love with this persona I had cultivated. Not me. 

I knew I had to cut him free. Every morning it would make me physically sick to my stomach. Trying my best to provide happiness for someone I’m directly hurting. 

I can’t tell you how many times he’s asked to drive to me in the middle of the night just because he was lonely. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve cried having to say no. 

He deserves better than me. 

Jump forward again to two nights ago. He has a particularly rough day. Asks if he could see me soon. Tells me he’s not happy etc etc. things that break my heart to hear. I just couldn’t take it anymore. I for the first time did anything even remotely decent and decided I had to tell him. 

I’d like to preface this by saying I’ve tried (according to him at least 3 times) to “get us to see other people”   With the third time being this last time. It was a cowardly way out that I was trying to take but I just wanted him to get out and find somebody he deserved. 

But I just couldn’t do it anymore. I spent too long hoping he would catch on and call me out or find someone better or even just give up on the chase. It wasn’t happening so I couldn’t be the cause of his suffering anymore. Especially not when he was already dealing with his own battles. 

So I broke down, told him everything said my final goodbyes. I knew that losing him at least meant he would finally be able to get over something that didn’t exist. Much like the coward that I am I tried to block him before he could respond. But he was already prepared for this and his answer was locked and loaded from the start. 

He had already known. Literally everything. Even before I started intentionally dropping clues in an attempt to give myself away. From the start he knew I wasn’t a girl he was able to figure out who I was. I was sloppy. Before I even intended to be. 

Still he fought for me. Even thanked for me for finally coming clean. Words I don’t deserve. Because it wasn’t anything new to him, he wasn’t shell shocked like me. And him having known about it and played along didn’t soften the blow either. 

It forced me to confront my own demons and see myself for the monster that I was. And at that moment sitting in his acceptance is when it sunk it. That I am in love with him, and that I spent two years just about deliberately hurting him for my own selfish gain. 

And now to hear that with all my monsters brought to light, that he still loves me and not just my persona but actually me? It’s almost soul crushing that I did what I’ve done to him. 

If he’s willing to have me as I am, I’m willing to try and be everything he deserves and more. But the problem is, no matter how many times he tells me it’s okay or to stop apologizing I can’t shake this sense of dread in my stomach. 

It’s entirely possible that I’m over reading it, but the night that I came clean and confessed once we got past all the tears and what not it felt like time stopped. Like he really had accepted me and my persona as one and it didn’t matter to him. 

But now in the following two days I feel he’s been slightly distant. Someone who usually would love to hear from me at all hours now seems only half there. 

I thought that’s what he wanted was me right there whenever, so I’ve been trying to stay in contact as much as I can around both of work schedules. 

I want him to know that the events in my life I was sharing with him were real. I had informed him about my sick grandmother, and would often use her as a trump card for why we couldn’t. While time frames may have been fudged a bit it certainly wasn’t entirely a lie. If it weren’t for her being as ill as she was I wouldn’t have even come across him.  I wanted to keep it as close to the truth as I could. I didn’t want to just be feeding him bs “my sister has cancer, I was hit by a car” lines. I always genuinely wanted him to be a part of my life. 

But the problem is how is he supposed to trust me after what I did to him. I wouldn’t trust me if I were him. 

All I want is to show him that the things I was saying to him and the feelings I had and were conveying were real. But I know this is just as hard if not harder for him. He might have known for however long beforehand. But it was never official until now. 

I’m trying to take into account his feelings, I just want him to know that his feelings even if they’re good or bad are justified and that I want to validate his feelings and emotions. 

I’m so incredibly grateful that he can even stomach looking my way. Let alone making plans with me for the following weekend. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to tell him these things. I don’t want to blow up his phone if he needs space.

But he spent two years just beyond my fingertips. If he’s willing to let me then I want to do whatever it takes to hold him close. I just can’t shake this horrible feeling that at any second it’s going to fall apart."
lonely,My chest hurts.,"My chest hurts. - Posting here feels really futile and borderline masturbatory, but I wanted to put my feelings out into the world and I didn't want to bother my friends. I'm nearly 21 years old and I've never been in a relationship. I've never even kissed anyone. And some nights, like tonight, my chest hurts from how alone I feel. I know other people have it worse, and I know there are a million other people who are in the same spot I am. Doesn't make it suck less."
lonely,Late night loneliness,"Late night loneliness - I’m getting that numbing lonely feeling that makes your chest feel heavy and hollow as you lay on your bed—I know I’m not the only one who gets that, but it’s a sucky feeling. I wish I had someone to cuddle right now, or someone close I can talk to and be mushy with. I often feel really lonely, and I stop myself from talking to people because I think I’m a nuisance. It sucks, man."
lonely,"Closer to her than ever, yet lonelier than ever before.","Closer to her than ever, yet lonelier than ever before. - So this is not your typical r/lonely story. On first glance no-one would even consider me lonely. There is this girl a few semesters below me. We met while smoking in between our lectures, we talked, became friends, close friends, best friends. Then I developed feelings for her - of course that had to happen. But we even managed that problem and could return to being best friends again.
Fast foreward to now. She has had a boyfriend for a long time now, but their relationship is completely messed up. The only reason she doesn‘t end it, is because she fears that he would kill himself if she did. I was her support throughout the whole thing. And again it happend what had to happen. We got too close and had sex. Again and again. 
Now we are closer than ever. The only thing that is missing for us being in a relationship, is the title „relationship“. We already spend ~ 100 % of our time together. We sleep together every night, we cudle, have sex, go to the gym, cook together. Everything is there for a true relationship, except that I know for sure she wouldn‘t start one with me, even if she did break up. She doesn‘t want one. She doesn‘t want me. She wants to be free and I can‘t blame her. 
So here I am, as close as I could be to the one single human I was ever truly in love with. Yet I feel more empty and more alone than ever before. I could really understand if no-one was able to empathize with this situation. Because I know that I should feel incredible and lucky. And I am truly happy as long as I am with her. But deep within I always know that this is a farce. That I am living a lie and that sooner or later our affaire will come to an end. I dread that day. Because I really can‘t say what it will do to me. My best guess is that it will break me to a point beyond repair. 
I needed to get this out of my system. And irl there is no-one who would be understanding of this. Because in the end I am just a dumb selfish tool for a cheater."

All the shitty things that happen to me teach me to keep my expectations low. I guess it's true what they say, if you expect nothing you can never be disappointed. But isn't expectation just hope? How can you ask someone to live without hope? 

I feel like I spend most of my life just waiting. Waiting for moments that never come, waiting for company, waiting for someone to save me. I think life is what is supposed to happen in-between all the waiting but nothing ever happens.  Whatever the case may be, I can't wait much longer. 

I will not last the summer. I will not. I must put an end to it now. Twenty-two years and I don't know if anyone outside of family has ever loved me. But nobody is showing up to fill the void in my soul, so I guess I'll just fade away.

That's apparently asking for the moon. I have a simple, peaceful life and I don't allow anyone into it who would disrupt that.

lonely,The Feeling of Obsolescence,"The Feeling of Obsolescence - My kiddo and I have been close pretty much since day 1. We've always had a bond that was tight.

Now that she's turned 18 and working while going to school I am not as much in need as I once was. I know I know, its all a part of growing up and me growing old but damn.

After me and her mom split 11 years ago I've had a few relationships but I always put my kid first. When my last relationship ended about 5+ years ago I decided I was done with it all. From then on it was 101% about my kid.

Well now she's grown and I'm not the indispensable figure I once was. So now I have to figure out what to do with my life.

I'm introverted but can speak publically. I can shake hands and make small talk when called upon. So I'm not as painfully awkward as some.

But

I'm 45, chubby and lonely. Single dads aren't like the hot thing women want, especially middle aged, chubby record nerd, ex punks. So I'm kinda stuck.

On the one hand, I'd love to have a woman to love and cherish, argue about music and go with me to Record Store Day and concerts and watch horror movies and such. These women exist, I chat with a few on Instagram, but women like that have their pick of the litter as it were.

On the other hand....dating sucks. Online dating sucks even worse (not photogenic) and a waste of time. My daily travels are fairly routine so my orbit is small. I rarely meet any new people, especially women. 

So what do I do?

I'm hauling my fat a$$ to the gym in the morning. Eating better. Yes. But I just don't think I want to venture out into the miserable experience of trying to meet people, but yet I would like to ride myself of the loneliness.

Anyone have words of wisdom? Experiences to share?"

lonely,He cancelled...again.,"He cancelled...again. - One of my closest friends introduced me to her cousin last summer because I needed a weed plug and he happened to sell. I stopped picking up from him eventually because I found a closer and overall better dealer. We somewhere along the way added each other on Snapchat and have written on each other’s stories/sent mass snaps, etc. Here and there. A while ago we tried to make plans but it didn’t work out, so I didn’t try to contact him for a few weeks. I posted a story and he posted the creeping eyes emoji and since then we’ve made plans to hangout and smoke at my house probably 4 times. Every time he cancels. It’s always because of work, he works overnight construction so his sleep schedule and time he has to go to work are kind of fucked. If it’s not work, it’s because his family is staying over his house, so? It seems like there’s always a magic excuse as to why he doesn’t want to hangout. Now, I’ve definitely done this to guys before but when I was younger and more immature and needing of shallow attention. Maybe that’s what he wants, but even after just canceling because he has to be at work in 5 hours.....he said “Still want to see you.” Do I just cut him off? We’ve never properly hung out before, only quick hi’s and bye’s. Do I give him of the benefit of the doubt or am I being stupid?"

lonely,All my efforts have meant nothing,"All my efforts have meant nothing - I thought I had friends when I was younger, but looking back at it now I realise I was never really included or part of the group, I was just too naive and socially blind to realise it. 
Growing old that only got worse to the point where I think no one except my parents would realise if I just disappeared. 

Last year I spent my birthday drinking by myself in my room and it felt especially shit because until then I had always had someone, if anything because people from school would hang out out of obligation or even just lack of anything else to do. But since I’ve come to university I literally have had no one, and it honestly annoys me how everyone seemed to find friend groups to hang out with the first few weeks, and even tho I made an active effort to try and be socialI was never really included and ended up alone after everyone already had formed groups and it wasn’t really possible to fit in with anyone anymore. 
I do have lots of acquaintances I’m on friendly terms with but I imagine that’s true for many of you here too and you probably know how it is. 

So this year I was really determined to give it my best shot, it seemed to work for a bit, most of the groups I tried being friends with stopped hanging out with me but this time I did manage to make some friends and hang out quite a bit this year, text often and what not. 

Comes my birthday again, and I try to organise something. Of course everyone is too busy for it and no one even tries to make it sound any better, just treat it like it’s no big deal. 

I ended up putting on my best clothes and ordering delivery from my favourite restaurant just so I could feel like at least I had done something and it hadn’t been just a day like any other. Ate alone in front of my computer and drank the rest of the night. 

It was probably the saddest and most pathetic thing I’ve ever done and I kind of needed to get it off my chest but it’s not something I would ever tell anyone I know in real life. 
The weird thing is that it didn’t feel as bad as I thought it would, not as much as last year. I guess that probably means that deep down I don’t deserve anything better and I’m not meant to have friends and parties and have fun like everyone else my age I see around me all the time. 

I’m kinda done trying, it honestly only made it worse, and don’t expect next year to be any different but at least it won’t feel as bad I guess."

Sometimes I get so lonely that I’m willing to give up everything (no matter my boundaries) to the next person who’s willing to take it. Even then, I don’t get that opportunity.

I just want someone, even if they don’t love me. I want someone who won’t hurt me and that I can love to death. I have had so much love building up inside me all my life and I’ve never felt someone love me. They all say it’ll come eventually but there’s no sign in sight. I’ve just given up hope."

Is it wrong to feel this way, to want to just snuggle up on a couch with someone and watch tv. To play with their hair or hold hands, to wrap your arms around them and hold them close.

[Me in highschool and me now](https://imgur.com/a/exJe1uC)


I met this guy when I was sixteen. I went to a party with his friends, I got wasted, and two of them brought me to a different house and had sex with me. I bled I felt baffled. The next day they told all their friends they were 18 and 19. I was already getting bullied and had slut rumors spread about me, so they thought I wanted it. They called me gross.


He left for the military but still kept in contact with me. I would send him pics over two years and see me when he was home. He cheated on one of his girlfriends with me.  I didn't know because the one social media I had he posted no photos but on every other platform he did. He would have sex with me then ignore me for a month. He implied I'm attractive enough to fuck but not be seen with

I feel so ugly. Two years ago he texted me after having a girlfriend for eight months. At first, I didn't know when he told me that I said I don't feel comfortable talking to you with a girlfriend. He sent me dozens of texts saying he missed me and posting old pics he had of me from three years ago. He asked,” if I was single would we be cool again.”


I kept ignoring him, and a couple of weeks later he got a new girlfriend. Posted lots of pics of her saying she's gorgeous. He went on deployment we stopped talking. After his deployment, he got discharged and moved to the east coast with his girlfriend. Before he left, he tried to see me and tried face timing me like 60 times. Thank God I was in a different state.


Now he's been messaging me like crazy saying he misses me and that I'm beautiful. I just blew up at him after six years of this I couldn't take it anymore. I called him a rapist, a douchebag, self-centered, a cheating loser, a sociopath, a liar, and a coward.

He just kept saying ”why are you mean to me.” and ”if you're going to put me down stop messaging me.” he also tweeted stuff like ”if you can’t respect me. Then at least have the decency to leave me alone. B It e your problem.” after I blew up at him the first time he tried apologizing for a couple of months later, but I just started saying the same stuff to him.


Why do people cheat? Why does this guy treat me this way what's wrong with him?"

So yeah. Turning 18 in a month and I still haven't done anything in my life. I've never had a gf and I don't even remember when I had conversation with a girl longer than half a minute, I dont have good friends, I never go out with anybody because noone invites me. Maybe because my social skills are garbage. (And I wanna add I'm not looking at a girlfriend as a sex opportunity but more like a simple teenage love experience.) I've never was loved by anyone except my family members but that's a different kind of love. I just feel sad and empty most of the time. All I do is play video games and make music. Nothing more. I literally have no memories of the last five years.

I wish I was less socially awkward, I'm trying to change but it's so hard. And I don't think I'm a weirdo from look because I take care of my self. I like fashion a lot. I'm planning to pursue in music but idk how it will work out because I have almost 0 connections.

Does anyone has any advice what to do to not waste my last chance to experience something as a kid? How to talk to new people without stressing out? Especially girls because that's the hardest. But please don't say ""be yourself"" because it's like a no advice.

I feel like I am in front of a speeding car every time I talk to people, and it has made breaking out of my loneliness extremely, extremely difficult. - Seriously. 

I get extremely nervous when approaching new people and talking to them. This inevitably leads to awkward conversations that make both the other person and me uncomfortable, and thus my attempts at socializing lead nowhere. 

This is in addition to the fact that talking to another person is one of the worst experiences I get regularly. It's incredibly frustrating, I want, I really badly want to break out, but this damned block keeps holding me back."

it’s also been nearly one year since i deleted any and all social media, effectively ending the last vestiges of any remaining connections i had with any of my old friends from high school and anime conventions. aka my main friend group. the only people to ever make me laugh, dance effortlessly in conversation, and feel effervescent with joy.

but it is futile to try to contact them again. i have changed so much. i don’t even like anime anymore. i am completely disconnected from the realm of references and inside jokes that once made up my identity. our identities.

this fall i am going to college and starting from scratch. 

but for now, i spend every night alone. left with the sorry version of myself that lives for no one. that struggles to talk about the weather, when i could once make a whole room laugh. 

i sympathize with all of us left in the dust, who have fallen off the train at one point or another. i hope i can find a semblance of the friendship i once had."

Maybe I’m just meeting the wrong crowd but where do I meet the right one. God, nobody ever taught me how to approach someone as much as how to even say hi.

A few years ago I used to be a homebody without a job. Gradually I nudged myself to get my masters. Found a job and developed more interests. Essentially I changed my personality from extremely shy introvert to a confident introvert. I learnt to have fun by myself. 

I have now reached a point in my life where I travel, go to film festivals and concerts, eat at restuarants, attend talks etc. *ALL BY MYSELF*. My weekends are enjoyable. 

But every Sunday night when I lay in bed I feel so terribly lonely. And I don't know why. If I am able to enjoy my own company why do I suddenly feel the desire for a friend to talk to? Maybe I just want someone to acknowledge my presence and  to comfort me. But this is puzzling to me. I have learnt to be strong and face adversities by myself. I have overcome challenging circumstances in life without others support. Then why do I feel the need for a companion now?"

lonely,Ideas of setting up a legal/contractual caretaker for my cats in the event of suicide?,"Ideas of setting up a legal/contractual caretaker for my cats in the event of suicide? - I am a 37 year old mail. Basically I have a job and a decect upper middle class life, and despite a long spell of addiction/recovery, I have a life most people would be happy with.

Except socially... Since I was 5 I have been unable to relate to people or make friends. I have acquaintances at work but we all know those don't count. I have gone through times with people where I petend to be someone I am most definitely not (aka someone normal people will I can associate with/sleep with/invite to baseball games/go with to concerts or barbecues, etc.) but at the end of every day when I an alone, doing this makes me break down and cry and I am in a great deal of emotional discord/pain that literally hurts my head, shoulders, back, and gives me a headache and the most crippling depression with the inability to sleep without heavy medication. Plus I spend all night having bad dreams and I wake up wishing I had died in my sleep.

Anytime I become ""close"" to a person, especially a girlfriend, I start to show my true self and they become annoyed and frightened (not in a case od physical harm, just in a ""boy have I met a damaged crazy person"" sort of way. Nobody sticks around after I show myself.

I have attempted to solve it with religion, spirituality, meeting similar people, supoort groupsbm, hundreds of illicit drugs, dozens of psych meds, and 20 years of therapy with 5 different professionals. Not one thing has improved, it gets worse every day, and it has come to the point where living causes, unexaggwrated, a truly unbearable amount of pain.

7 years ago a friend forced me to take 2 kittens (littermates) and they have been my only friends ever. If they didn't rely on me to feed them, I would have killed myself years ago (I do know the correct chemical combination with no pain abd 100% success rate and I can obtain anything) but this is not fair to the cats and I cannot stand the idea of them being euthanized or separated because they are so accustomed to their brother/sister routine.  I know they will get over my passing as long as they remain toferher so that does not concern me. I also know a better life awaits them rather than beinf taken care of by someone who can barely muster the energy to play with them.

My question is, what are my options for ensuring they are together and in good hands for life when I am gone? Surely a program exists, a kind, openminded, and understanding stranger is reading, and/or a contract can be created? I should mention there is an amoubt of money involved that passes on to them and should cover them for the rest if their life.

Any ideas?"

Jokes like ""I want to jump out of a window"" or ""I hate my life"" or ""Hang me from the roof and call me a piñata, because I want to die"". Jokes like that. They may not seem like jokes, but it's the verbal delivery that separates them from statements of a disturbed mind, though they still sort of are. I say these jokes, hoping to God that somebody, anybody, will pull me aside one day and just ask me ""Dylan, are you alright? Your jokes are alarming, and I worry for you."" I know, it's silly. It's stupid. It makes me an attention-whore. I should never expect it to work. But the very faint chance that it may work forces me to continue. It's like tourettes, almost. Not literally, but you get the point. Some may ask ""Why not just directly ask for help?"", and then others will completely understand why. Talking about my issues, especially my very serious issues, is a very difficult task for me. I see a counselor, not a therapist, a counselor, and I tell him a lot. It's very hard for me, but I can tell him because he's a professional. But, family, friends, teachers, or peers? I can't do it. I just shut down. So, I use these jokes in a desperate, feeble attempt to get somebody to notice and care. Again, I know it's dumb. I know I shouldn't do it, and I know it's such an edgy and childish thing to do. But, I don't know any other way. Does anybody else do this? I want to know, because I feel alone in this regard. I don't know. Thanks for reading, anyways. Cheers."

Even if I do decide to call up a friend and ask to hang out, the moment they say yes or the moment I call, I regret it and feel like I would rather be at home. 

Most of wanting to be at home is wanting to smoke weed because I feel like it would be less money spent relaxing at home and smoking up rather than going partying or going out to the movies/dinner etc.. but I still do feel waves of lonely anxiety. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Is it better to stay home or go out in these scenarios? 

I feel like it would be nice if I had a friend who I could leave msgs for when I’m feeling lonely so I don’t necessarily have to go meet someone physically but I feel like I’m bothering my friends as I feel lonely quite often. I think I feel loneliness a lot stronger than most people because I feel it at least 10 times a day.

I woke up and pretty much all day had nobody to talk to as usual, so I tried to get ahold of two of the only ""friends"" I have... nobody answered or replied at all, also as usual. 

Then late last night I got a notification on Instagram. A girl I used to talk to quite a bit went live, and it was just her playing the guitar and singing, which was really nice for a few minutes, especially because she's quite good at both, but I started to feel a bit weird just sitting there and saying nothing. So, I said ""I feel kind of awkward sitting here lurking 😅 you're really, really good though 😊"" she read this and said, ""don't feel awkward haha you're completely fine"" and then within about 3 seconds literally every single person in the stream chat called me by my full name (it's in my account name on IG), and told me I was weird/creepy/a loser. Like 10 people I didn't even know.

I still kind of can't believe that actually happened, and not a single person even actually knew me there other than her. I just closed the app and sat there for awhile depressed and hating myself. I don't know what it is about me that makes everyone seem to hate me so much whether they know me or not. I have no real friends. I'm fairly attractive, I'm intelligent, and I've had plenty of relationships, romantic and platonic in the past, but none of them have ever lasted, and they've been getting even worse/shorter for the last several years.

lonely,I'm tired of it,"I'm tired of it - It's not just the lack of people to to date, but I feel like a small friend group would be nice.

A couple friends moved away. One is supposed to be back at some point in the next year and a half.

As far as dating goes, having friends does not hurt. I don't know how but people some way meet through work still. Not gonna happen where I'm at though and I'm confused how people stay together at work if some say don't shit where you eat. I met my ex at a place I worked for just 3 weeks. That was luck.

Online dating has never worked for me and probably never will. To too many of these women I'm probably average.

Also don't see the point in dating someone I'm not attracted to. 

I'm tired of the loneliness, honestly, it's starting to depress me."
lonely,I should never have transitioned,"I should never have transitioned - I'm 6'4'' tall. I'm a fucking ogre. I was useless as a man, and now I'm worthless as a woman. I am panromantic/pansexual, and yet I can't get a date. There is something inside me, something wrong, something that people pick up on that drives them away. I'm disgusting. Repulsive. Off-putting.

That's not to say I'm ugly, of course. Guys talk to me when they're horny. They really get off on it. They take advantage of my loneliness. They build me up, and then, every single time, when I ask them if they'd date me they make excuses as to why they won't or can't. And invariably I learn that they are dating or go on to date a cis girl.

No guy wants to date a trans girl who's taller than them. No guy wants to be seen in public with a girl who towers over them. It's humiliating. I know it. It's basic social psychology. I would be a mark of shame.

I am so fucking lonely. I'm 31. It's been a decade since I've been with anyone. It's burning inside. It's physically painful. I can't be who I am and be loved; I can't be someone I'm not and be loved. I don't know what the point is. I don't know why I should try. And I don't know what to do at this point. I can't live like this anymore.

Anyway, sorry."

lonely,I was at the mall last night...,"I was at the mall last night... - It was my first time leaving the house in a week. I was super excited because I love cities, I love malls, and I love people. And I finally got to leave the prison that my parents refer to as ""home"".

So we're just walking around the mall, and it's a Friday night, so there's a lot of people.

I just can't help but notice how everyone is so happy. Everyone is laughing, having a good time, and (this one stings the most) absolutely no one was alone. Now, don't get me wrong, I love seeing people happy, and I feel happy for them, and I wouldn't want any harm to reach them, but when you're so fucking lonely, seeing other people having a good time just breaks you. No, it KILLS you. It kills you on the inside. 

I walk past a cute couple holding hands. I walk past another cute couple holding hands. I walk past a cute couple sitting on the bench, showing each other something on their phones and laughing. I walk past another cute couple laughing. I walk past another cute couple cuddling.

I walk past a group of teenagers. All of them must be around 16-17, like me. They're a few boys and a few girls. They're all laughing. They're all so carefree. So relaxed. They were having a good time. This is how teenagers are supposed to be. This is what this age is about.

We sit down at the food court and I'm sitting eating my Cinnabon roll in silence. I'm not exactly alone, my family is there. But they're not my family. They're my masters. On the tables next to me are a cute couple, and a group of 5 teenagers who are friends. I keep glancing over and notice how happy they are. And every time I take a glance, I die on the inside. It hurts way too fucking much.

""Why do you look upset? You're always upset. Why can't you be happy?"" My parents bark.

I want to say ""Because I'm fucking lonely. Why am I lonely? Because of YOU. You guys have homeschooled me, you guys force me to work and not focus on my studies, you guys don't let me leave the house, and IF ever you do, you guys go out of your way to ensure I don't have a social life. Because of you, I feel like a prisoner. Because of you, I feel trapped. Because of you, the house feels like a prison. And seeing others MY AGE laughing and being so carefree FUCKING HURTS. It hurts so bad you guys have no idea. It hurts so much that my chest LITERALLY burns. It hurts. It FUCKING hurts.""

Obviously I can't say that. Instead, I just put on my fake smile and say ""Oh what? Oh no I'm fine. I'm not upset, I'm 100%!"" While internally rolling my eyes. 

I come home, I take a shower, and I go to bed. Once my parents have gone to bed, I start to cry. I cry, and I cry, and I cry. I'm hugging my pillow, and am shaking. And I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying so much I'm struggling to breathe. I pick up my phone and open Messenger. Absolutely no one. I open WhatsApp. Absolutely no one. I go through my contacts, absolutely no one. This makes me cry even more. My pillow is drenched in tears. My pillow is all I've got. He never judges me, he's always there for me, and he always wipes my tears.

Eventually I stop crying, and now I have a terrible headache and my eyes are burning because of crying so fucking much. I feel pathetic about the fact that I was literally hugging a pillow. A PILLOW. A FUCKING PILLOW.

I wash my face and I lie down. I close my eyes, trying to go to sleep, while thinking of everyone out there enjoying themselves, feeling happy for them. But it hurts. It fucking hurts."
lonely,Feel like I'm losing my mind,"Feel like I'm losing my mind - I've been on the edge of friendship groups for as long as I can remember. When I finished college I had maybe 4 people that I was in semi regular contact with and hung out with but it was always me initiating contact and making plans (which were often bailed on last minute). 

Anyway, I started working and was doing a masters in the evenings and on weekends and didn't have as much spare time so I wasn't making as much contact with them and it soon hit me that they would never bother to message me. That's when I stopped making an effort with them. In the last 6 months, not one of them has contacted me. Maybe I'm being petty by not messaging them but I feel like why should I have to do it all? Friendship takes work from both sides and surely if they were really bothered they would have done something about it. 

Anyway, this brings me to my current dilemma. In the 6 months since I stopped making the effort with them, the only people I have talked to are my parents and coworkers. Which is fine but they're not *friends* and the conversations are mostly shallow. Recently, it's really been getting to me and I regularly find myself unable to concentrate and upset and distressed for no reason (even though subconsciously I kinda feel like it's the zero new message notifications and no one to make fun plans with at the weekends). 

Does anyone else get this? Is it possible to go insane from a lack of meaningful connections with others? I genuinely feel like I'm losing my mind."

lonely,Friend Proposition,"Friend Proposition - I'm often here looking for friends or anyone to talk to really, I've met some nice people but it never seems to last, that's why I thought I'd try and propose this;

Anyone who feels lonely and wants a friend or someone to talk to casually or on a daily basis should message me, I'll act like we've been friends for years and talk to you how I'd talk to a friend I just haven't seen for a while, all I ask is that you do the same for me and we keep the conversation going until the friendship becomes real."
lonely,Yeah,"Yeah - I don't know where to start to be honest. I know it's just part of being an adult, the not having friends, the loneliness, the not having someone to talk to, the working constantly. I'm not even looking for someone to talk to, I just feel like I need to say how I feel or am;  I don't even know. I was raised not to talk about my problems so it's not really something I do with my s/o, I listen to hers though. I was pretty much molded into an adult at an early age because of family problems, i'm sure some of y'all know how that is. I have commitment issues, i'm not an open person, i'm very serious, I don't like to drink because I know I'll drink for the wrong reasons. I grew up in a police household, not many will understand that. My s/o doesn't understand why it's what i'm gonna be doing. I guess it's some false ideology of heroism. I can be honest I won't be able to save everyone or even those who don't want saving, I've had that pounded into my head. When i'm in that mode though i'm different. I know how to react, I know how to relate to people, to talk to them, it feels natural. I don't want to be praised, it's not about that. It's about knowing what i'm doing and who i'm doing it for and with. I don't expect anyone to understand that. I've gotten so good at dealing with other peoples problems at a young age that I constantly ignore mine day in and day out. I know tons of y'all understand that. There is so much more I want to say, but I don't know where to start let alone even type it. I guess that's one of the things that gets me. We can never truly understand each other because unless you're in that persons head you don't know exactly what they need to say, yet can't."

lonely,"Why are you lonely, what do you think is holding you back?","Why are you lonely, what do you think is holding you back? - For me, it's mental/social aspects as well as financial.

I am employed, but cannot afford to live on my own. Because I don't have anyone to rent-share with, I still stay at home. I pay my way, contributing to the household and buy my own personal items. This is basically an intimacy death  sentence for a grown man.

The fact that I still stay at home is a massive block in how I interact with women. If it does seem like there is a chance that something might develop I sabotage it by telling myself she'll reject me the minute she discovers my living arrangement, so I shut it down. It also prevents me from ""closing"" if I have managed to get intimate with a woman and the time has come to ask ""do you want to get out of here?"" Where am I going to take her?

Other social aspects are that I am reserved, shy and very self-conscious (mostly rooted in my living arrangements), so when I am out I tend to have a whole bunch of limited interactions where there is some small talk and the people I am speaking to seem to get bored/put-off.

I feel that if I can make some progress in my work life and get my own place, doors will start opening."
lonely,Is this good or bad?,Is this good or bad? - So the past few months I've been really upset about my ex leaving me.

But around the same time the feelings of sadness and longing have turned to angry and resentment. before when I thought about if he ever message me again how happy I'd be and how we had like this great reunions. Now all I can think about is telling him how disgusting he is and if you wants to talk to me he can wait until I feel like it. Idk if this is a sign of recovery or if I just snapped.

lonely,I just realized I might have severe attachment issues. What do I do?,"I just realized I might have severe attachment issues. What do I do? - I have an online friend. She's my bestie (I'm also a she, if that matters), and I realized recently that I maybe try to talk too much with her. Because with my few other friends, all also online, I just message them whenever I have something specific I want to talk about. And they'll stop replying back at a point, then pick it up again when they feel like it or are able to. And that's fine. 

But in the case of my bestie, she's the one who drives the loneliness away, even though she's in Europe and I'm in the U.S. She's the one who makes me feel like I am special. 

But I'm always messaging her, ""Hi! How are you??"" Every. Single. Day. She never initiates conversations with me, I don't think she feels the same need to as I do, I'm always the one to do so. And then we run out of things to say. And then later on, I message her out of the blue to try and keep the conversation going.

And I make it sound like it's easy for me to message her like this, but it's really not. I have the biggest anxiety trying to hit 'send.' And I'll often just stare at the green 'online' icon next to her name hoping she'll be the one to message me, but she never does...

She'll also mention that she's chatting with other people sometimes.  And those people probably don't bug her like I do. And given that she'll sometimes reply with very minimal effort, I'm crushed thinking how most of her effort is going to those other people instead.

I know none of this is healthy... But I don't know what to do."
lonely,Starting to accept my loneliness and incapability to make long term friendships,"Starting to accept my loneliness and incapability to make long term friendships - I know I sound like a doomer and isolationist but I don’t really have a reason to keep trying to make friends. 
I realized that having friends is a need, not a want. It’s a burden for me and I’m sure it is for others. 
And because it is a need, it is inevitable people will receive the golden few that they have that keeps them alive. 
I can’t really think of anybody who doesn’t have that ONE person, at the very least, they could call a friend, regardless of how alone they say they are. Not because they wanted to have that friend, but because it was part of their unconscious need to survive. I could be wrong, but I personally don’t know how l could completely say I have nobody when I do- even if they do live really far away and we haven’t seen each other in 3 years. 

But in my attempts to maintain friendships outside of the internet- and honestly, even on the internet, I realize it’s become a chore. There’s only temporary gratification before that kindled friendship sizzles out. Any attempt to reignite it only leaves bitter smoke and charcoal remnants of when the fire used to burn brighter."

I’m so incredibly lonely it hurts in places that I didn’t know existed. I’ll get involved with a guy only to find out he just wanted sex and then he disappears. It’s really beginning to get embarrassing. I could brush off the family questions before with different excuses, but it’s getting harder and harder every day. And I’m so incredibly lonely.

I remember first semester of college we use to call eachother almost everyday and just talk about everything happening with us. Then second semester she got depressed and just didn't wanna talk on the phone anymore, but she would text. I'm not a huge fan of texting because you have to type everything out and it's just way easier to say it. But we worked on it. I always felt like I was initiating conversation and even always asking to hang out so I felt like she didn't even care if we hung out or not. I know when shes depress she isolates herself but I'm just tired of trying and her just not giving in at all. It hurts because shes my only girlfriend and the only other person I talk to all the time is my boyfriend. And I always feel lonely because he has friends he hangs out with during the week when I'm always alone. I never hang out with anyone except him on the weekends. I do enjoy my alone time but it would be nice to see maybe one or two other people, that isn't my boyfriend and be friends. I am starting a new job (well not new but a summer job I had last year) so hopefully I can connect with some people there and make friends.

The thing about me is, I've been depressed for the longest time. However, I never thought that I had issues. I believed what I was feeling was something everybody felt every day, and that I shouldn't be getting all bend out of shape about it. That I should suck it up. So, I was still able to have some great times up until last year. Once I realized I have crippling depression and other issues (having been told by medical professionals), it all went downhill. Now, whenever I think back to the good times I've had, though they were far and in between, I become extremely depressed and get a feeling of isolation, and whenever I think about the future, I only feel fear and dread. Is anybody else this way? I often feel alone in my principles and mannerisms, so I turn to subreddits like this to make me feel more normal and not as alone. Any responses are appreciated (as long as you aren't a smart-ass). Cheers, and have a good night/day."
lonely,Musings of a single girl,"Musings of a single girl -  Sometimes I feel so desperately lonely but I keep these thoughts to myself because 1) I feel embarrassed to not live up to my seemingly strong and independent façade and 2) who the fuck would I even express these thoughts to, I feel so distant from everyone I used to be close with. And when I do reach my tipping point and allow myself to be the tiniest bit honest about the way I feel, I will always preface it with “I know this is so stupid and I shouldn’t think like this but…” because I don’t want that person’s perception of me to be in any way shaped by these flaws that I work so hard to hide. And of course because I raise the issue in such a dismissive way, they dismiss it and we immediately move on. I never imagined that I would be the only single girl. I question whether there’s something wrong with me. People will ask me why I am single and tell me that my standards are too high, and I will laugh it off and agree, but the reality is that I often don’t even have the opportunity to exercise my high standards because no one is chasing me to begin with. And as much as I would like to blame it on today’s dating culture, the simple fact of the matter is that no one else is in this position, all of my girl friends are in happy relationships or are at least being pursued by guys. Is there something about me that puts guys off? Or is it that there’s nothing special about me at all and no one ever gives me a second thought. I’ve always been someone with a pretty high self-esteem but when I think deeply about myself as a person I wonder what my redeeming qualities are, the things that make me stand out from the crowd in any way. I have good career prospects, I take care of the people I love, I’m told I have a pretty face. On paper I sound like a catch but why is no one interested?"

A year ago I met this amazing Korean girl, we talked and she became my first girlfriend at the age of 17. I flew to Korea and we traveled the country together for a couple of weeks. It was the best time of my life. Her interest started to fade away after some months and she left me by text just to ghost me after I asked for the reason. Apparently she got flowers from some guy 2 days after the breakup. It has been a week since then. I feel like life is crashing down all over again, I don’t want to spend more years here alone.

lonely,I catfished someone and fell in love...an appropriate story of heartbreak.,"I catfished someone and fell in love...an appropriate story of heartbreak. -  

I must be living under a rock, but I didn't realize catfishing was an actual term that applied to what I did. I mean I have heard about it but I never followed it closely or anything anyways let me get to the story. I'm probably a 5 or 6 .....when I dress up and look nice, a 7 tops.

I'm a male, late 30's, and I was a few months out of a long term 14 year relationship and I just didn't have the confidence at the time to date. So I decided to live in fantasy world of sorts. I created a profile on OKC of a person much better looking then myself and of course there were hundreds of interests. Many of these women were absolutely gorgeous and I entertained the fantasy of dating them for a bit nothing crazy. It was a lot of ""you're sexy"" I'd sleep with you type of things. I never solicited nude pictures or anything like that, again this was just for fantasy. I was just about to delete the profile and give the whole account up until I met her.

She is ten years younger, she has been dating online on and off for a few months. She would consider herself a 5 or 6 but she is beautiful. She's easily a 9 but a 10 to me. She has blonde hair and blue eyes and an amazing smile. At the risk of boring everyone, I'll just come out and say that she was my dream girl. We talked on and off at random, I was very busy and she has her own career as well. I had experienced a death in my family, in real life, and I really didn't want to continue talking to anyone, let alone someone who I won't ever meet. I explained that I was in a tough place and couldn't really focus on another person. I suppose this was my way of trying to say goodbye. Well a month goes by and she texts me and asks me how I am. I was feeling better and I decided to pursue talking to her again, I mean she is beautiful and smart, I couldn't help it.

For a week or two we texted everyday, we talked about our goals our hopes and our dreams for the future. She wanted everything I wanted, it was really amazing. What is my luck that I am finding a beautiful woman who wants exactly what I want and I'm not even really me. Over these weeks we expressed how lonely we were with our everyday lives and how we should just ""run away"" together and start our own family. This was of course music to my ears, but of course I couldn't tell her why it would never happen but I agreed that is what I wanted too. She really wants to meet up at this point and I need to find a way to deflect that. Well, because I deflected and stayed away she found herself in the arms of another man which of course drove me up a wall, especially because this guy used her and of course he used her again. I was jealous with rage! Imagine that, and of course how terrible is that of me to make her feel bad or worse then she already feels about it?

This is where our talks and our texts became much more personal and intimate. We shared even more, even things about mental health. Then we started talking on the phone and she has the voice of an angel. I needed to talk to her everyday, she was consuming me, she was absolutely the love of my life. She confided that she felt love for me as well. This began to hurt, this began to make me feel horrible, here I am in love with this beautiful woman who wants everything I want and I realize at this point there is no getting out of this without being hurt. Well, I've been told I am being transferred to a different city and this should be it right?

I grappled with this and of course this hurt her, but she asked everything she could...what about my life here in our city, what about my dog? How can they just move me to a new city? I didn't and still don't want to go, in fact that's a separate story but anyways....I felt bad, she felt bad....I had to come clean with her.

It was three weeks ago today. She told me that I should just let her love me. I told her that she was in love with my words and not with me, the ugly hideous monster that I really am. She asked me why I kept referring to myself as a monster. I told her that I was going to write/read her a letter that I wrote to her. She kept asking more questions. I suggested we talk on the phone. We talked one last time, I came clean about everything. She was so compassionate and loving about everything, she told me how she understood how this could happen and how the world makes us do things we normally wouldn't. She still wanted to meet in person. I agreed but hesitated in my agreement to do so. She told me that she told her friends right away and they told her she was being too nice to me and of course she was.

She asked me to send her picture and I told her I was really ugly and she then sent me what she considered an ""uncute"" picture of her, of course it was beautiful. I sent her my picture. Of course she said I was cute. We texted back and forth, mostly me apologizing for being the horrible person I was and for what I did. She told me that the deception was too much for her to overcome and that she has to say goodbye to me. She told me to be well and to treat myself well and that was that. She blocked my number, which is easily known via having iPhones. I presume she never wants to hear from or speak to me again because of that.

Again, here we are.....21 days later....the karma of what I have done is catching up to me. I think about her all the time. I think about her smile, I think about her voice, her dog, her entire being. I fell completely in love with her and I didn't expect that to happen. We shared songs we like, we shared movies we liked, all of this....I can't listen to these songs, I can't see these movies, I'm of course, never ever going to do anything like this again. Before anyone asks, I completely deleted and removed the profile from OKC. I have learned a valuable lesson from this at the expense of my heart and probably hers also, if she is hurt I would do anything I could to make that go away.

Anyways that's my story. I'm completely heart broken and I can't stop thinking about her and that is my punishment for what I have done."

I'm tired of not being able to talk to anybody about anything. I can't turn nowhere because if I reach out to old friends, I'll just get the cold shoulder.

But it is the only time I can go into autopilot mode and not think of how ridiculously sad my life is (except for breaks when my coworkers talk about their SO). There is nothing worse than walking out of the office on a Friday afternoon thinking “Huh, again I don’t have a social activity planned for this weekend. How am I going to get through the next 2 1/2 days? Who could I call? No one?” 

I wonder how you feel about spare time. Is it the same? Or is that a luxury problem of a spoiled European guy with a 40h week?"
lonely,I started really think I am really really a failure despite how hard I tried,"I started really think I am really really a failure despite how hard I tried - 4 years ago, I was dropped out in my college years twice. From now on I entered my lowest point of life and I had such deep depression for the first time of my life. At the same year, I decided to work as operator at i-cafe (basically I did everything from cashier, mopping floor to cleaning toilets). In the next 2 year I open my business and try not to become a burden in my familly. And yes it didn't run smooth as I expected. A year later I finally got my first professional job as an art teacher, yet something really missing. I feel so lost and lonely. No friends, no people to hang out, alone at weekend. 

From there, I thought if I push myself a little harder I will get a decent job with great workplace and healthy people. So I can really change my self-destruct lifestyle.
Finally, I got the job I wanted as an artist at multinational edtech company and feel really proud of myself.

I thought I can finally leave my depression, but it's not that easy. The time and strength which allow me to get this point obliterated my social life even worse. Now I am in my first month in my new workplace and people started really think I am a freak and socially awkward. There was a time when I have a lunch and sit down next to a group of my colleagues. They glanced at me with very flat and odd face. I tried to smile at them but they don't respond at all. They always have so much things to talk about, meanwhile I just sit there and blank-gazing at my computer. There was also a time when we went to cinema. The same things happened, I just froze in front of them after the show.

At first, I think because it's my flat and serious looking impression, I also decline politely when they try to reach me. Is that considered as rude behaviour? I just can't accept every invitation because the same thing could happen and makes me even more sad. I don't know, after everything that I've been through, I'm still looks like a total failure. I'm losing hopes in myself."

I've always wanted a family, but I'm starting to feel like it's too late for me. But all of that aside I guess what I miss most is being touched. I miss hugs and holding hands, and cuddles while watching TV. I miss all the most innocent thing about a relationship because those are the things I enjoyed most. I know it's all my fault, too. 

I got my head caught up in a girl that had no interest in me. We were very close friends and we had a real connection between us and for some dumb reason I always thought she'd finally see it and she'd be mine, but I was naive and let my heart linger on her even after she moved to a different state. I don't know why I'm writing all of this down other than to get it off my chest.

My childhood dream was to join the special forces in my country and I was lucky enough to get accepted and left for basic training on the 6th of February. Now you think that everything sounds great right? Two months before I left, at the start of December I was rejected yet again by yet another girl whom I loved dearly and I was a mess, my best friend helped me to get through this bad stage in my life and things started to feel great because his little sister showed a lot of affection for me. I've never been shown so much love in my life, hugs, cuddling, hand holding, I was going crazy and the date I was shipping out come closer by the day. And the day came and I was there with my bags and for some reason I was calm and very relaxed. Everything was going great, I passed all the tests, loved the place and got along with everyone in the barracks. But then in the forth day it hit me, I missed her, I missed her a lot and I wanted to explode. In the seventh day I was going home, I've always had crazy mood swings but this was different, in my greatest depressive episode up to that point my stupid self ask to leave for pcychological problems to the shock of everyone who knew me there. But here comes the worst part of the story and the reason I'm writing this. Fast forward to the end of April and I went out with her and confensed my feelings being sure that she would accept me, she is a unique person with very strange behavior but I managed to understand her ways very easily. I've heard it all up to this point, ""I see you as a friend, as a best friend, as a brother, as a teacher"", now I also became ""an older brother"". I quit my dream for a girl that never liked me back, my best friend has grown distant, my only other friend is constanly bored or sleeping and here I am with no plans for the future and no chance of getting in any other military because of what I did to get out. Oh and here is another problem , she didn't deny me because I'm ugly, or too nice, she couldn't even find a reason she didn't want me. Why is this a problem? With every other rejection I found my flaws and fixed them, now I don't even know what is wrong with me.

I don't think anyone actually read this but if you did thanks, I'm really going through a lot right now and I don't have anyone to speak to, I'm not one of those people who don't speak all that much and then disappears so if you want to talk about anything just send me a pm and I'll reach out to you as soon as possible."

lonely,Am I the friend no one wants?,"Am I the friend no one wants? - It seems as though I might be the friend no one wants to hang out with, but the friend people want when things get tough. Over the last couple of years I have noticed that the people who I would consider my friends and whose lives I make an effort to be apart of have been leaving me out of hangouts and friend activities. Some of those years I was not able to hang out as much as I would have liked due to finishing college, but still made efforts to try and join up when I could. Now that I am done with school and have a lot more free time, it appears no one wants to hang out or invite me to do things anymore. Usually what ends up happening is these people won't invite me to anything, but I get to see all the fun on snap stories or posted on Facebook &amp; IG. When I confront them on it and say, ""Hey you should of told me..."" that is usually followed by a BS excuse. Now I have considered the thought that maybe they don't think of me because I don't reciprocate inviting them to do anything. I invite them to do things or join me each weekend, but that is usually followed up with a maybe and by the end of the weekend I see snaps of everyone hanging out together doing other things. The only time these people contact me is when they have issues or questions. Other than that, no one talks to me which leaves me feeling lonely, used, and left out. If someone were to ask me, ""Do you have any friends?"" I would most likely say no to be honest. I am used to being the lone wolf, but its nice to be included on things and have people other than your parents/siblings who care about you. My life is pretty busy and making new friends is not that easy for me which is why I keep holding on to these people even though they treat me this way. Sounds like I need to cut the ties and move forward with finding some people who will appreciate me and want to include me in their lives..."

Back then I was into Vocaloid and listened to anime songs, one day I saw this girl who had ""Gumi"" &amp; ""Miku"" on a white jacket hoodie. We became ""friends"" one day, when I went to hang out with her she was surrounded by some of her other friends. I said Hi and she waved without speaking or looking at me, I felt kinda odd about it but ok. But most of the time, I felt excluded. Then I meet this emo girl named Raven and we hit it off, but then one day on facebook she got mad at me.  Apparently I was ""Talking about anime too much"", which lead to a bitter breakup. One of my worst and most awkward experiences was at P.E. and we had to choose from a few different activities. I didn't want to choose an activity so I got mad and climbed up the bleachers in front of everyone. I felt so ashamed about myself I started changing for P.E. in the bathroom of the nurses office. I've always hated changing rooms in P.E. Then in highschool, I had some interactions with people here and there but no one really stuck around. Due to the loneliness, a negative voice in my head, and mean people on the internet I became a misanthropist. I wish I had some cool IRL friends Who I can share my interests with. I've tried having ""Internet Friends"" but I find it unsatisfactory, it kinda just feels i'm just chatting with a robot."
lonely,Dreams,"Dreams - The world is a mind full of dreams, connects inspiration to faces to chasing the gleam, the thing we can never catch, the life that will never hatch. Make a promise, keep yourself honest, bring yourself homage, keep going on it, it's still far away, like the myth of a yesterday, all we have is today, can't slow down, fade away, give up, no way. But that's all I ever wanted. Not to be a face for homage, turned dishonest, meaning something, gleaning nothing. I just wanted to be free, I wanted to live for me, I wanted a kind state of mind that leaves my heart upon my sleeve. Life's a roller coaster, I would ride it, but if I can't slow down I prefer not to try it.

Everyone was supposed to get into groups to table. Except that the number of people meant one person would be left out. That person was me. Not even sure what the organizers will do. I hate group projects because I’m always last. In early high school in gym class we paired up for some game and I was left to pair up with the gym teacher. I felt so embarrassed. Three people got into a group just so one of them wouldn’t be in a group with me. I don’t mind being alone. I just don’t like others seeing that I’m alone and thinking I’m a loser. I am. But still.
lonely,How do I get over getting bullied and feeling ugly?,"How do I get over getting bullied and feeling ugly? - [what I looked like in highschool vs now](https://imgur.com/a/B3qG6Pz)



In high school something bad happened to me. It was by some older guys when I was 16. It made me an outcast. I was ridiculed a lot for my looks from this group of guys in my grade. Everyday in class they would pick apart my looks. They said I looked 40, that I was gross, that I have wrinkles, and that no one would ever want me. They would also say that I’m a slut. 



I met this guy when I was sixteen. I went to a party with his friends, I got wasted, and two of them brought me to a different house and had sex with me. I bled I felt baffled. The next day they told all their friends they were 18 and 19. I was already getting bullied and had slut rumors spread about me, so they thought I wanted it. They called me gross.




I just lost all confidence at that point I felt like damaged goods. I still hooked up with one of them after that because I felt like no one would want me after that. John would hook up with me when he was drunk but ignore me during the day. 

He left for the military but still kept in contact with me. I would send him pics over two years and see me when he was home. He cheated on one of his girlfriends with me.  I didn't know because the one social media I had he posted no photos but on every other platform he did. 



He would have sex with me then ignore me for a month. He implied I'm attractive enough to fuck but not be seen with. He said he only wanted me for sex and nothing more. He would never want to talk to me unless it was sexual. He said he felt no connection with me. He said all of this to me when I was 16-18 he was 19-21.
I haven't seen him in 4 years, but he still tries to contact me



I feel so ugly. Why would someone treat me this way? I haven't seen him in four years, but he still tries to contact me I think I'm damaged goods. Will any guy ever want me. Have been treated this way because of how I look? Why are men like this? I don't think I could ever trust a man.


Tl;dr: have bad experiences with men feel awful about myself.

lonely,People never seemed to like me?,"People never seemed to like me? - hey everyone,

so, this might be a really emotional post, and it feels so sad and pathetic to be searching for advice on the internet but, that's the reality of what my life feels like.

growing up, people didnt seem to like me and i always thought it was because I was weird. so of course in middle school, i tried to be ""cool"". it worked for a little, til the popular girl got intimidated and told everyone to hate me. but we've moved on from that. In highschool, people loved to talk about me, I never understood why, but I changed schools going into highschool so a lot of people from different towns knew me. Again, we're passed that.

But here I am in college. I'm 21 and go to school 1000 miles away from my hometown. my parents moved too, so I've started a whole new life down here. Yet, somehow I feel so alone. I made new friend my first year, but I'm only friends with one of them now who I am in love with too (but that's a whole different story). He's my best friend, and he cares about me, but he doesn't give me the type of relationship I want from him.

Besides him, I don't really have many friends. I have a couple girl friends I consider close, but one of them is always busy and I hear from her rarely, and the other one cares about me a lot but she is so misguided and in her own world that being around her too much is very toxic for my well being. 

I feel like I haven't found ""my people"" yet, and I don't know how. I moved into a single bedroom apartment after having some terrible random roommates. I live with my dog, and I don't mind it. But sometimes, like tonight, I'm really emotional about some things, like how I'm in love with my best friend, and I have no one to talk to because I can't talk to him about it and hes busy hanging out with other people. We hang out a lot, but I want to hangout with him all the time, but realistically that's not a possibility. 

I guess I'm just kind of venting, but I also feel so alone. I feel like I never have anyone to talk to, nobody cares about how i  feel. Nobody checks up on me daily. If I got injured or really sick and couldn't get to my phone, there wouldn't be anyone looking for me except my job. So if I wasn't working for a couple days, which happens often, nobody would noice I was gone. And that really hurts me.

How do I make friends? What could make someone so unlikeable? I love everyone I'm close to and I'm very compassionate and reliable. Why can't people return the same to me?"

A little backstory, im a music/photography/general artsy type. Im down in florida in the middle of true redneck county, like i walk outside and see 4 rebel flags and twice as many hunting dogs level of redneck. 

In high school (im 19/m, graduated last year) i was a quiet guy in the back with headphones in. I genuinely feel like i truly changed this past year, I'm more assertive, i dont let peeps walk over me, i can talk to people no problem. That change has happened in my room and i have had no chances to show it. I cant connect with people because theres nothing i can connect to around where i live. I feel like im the perfect antithesis of all things local to me. For instance, being a musician, i love meeting people with the same interests. Recently i met 3 separate people through my moms boyfriend who play, but all are older guys who specifically say they arent into the stuff im into, which i mean yeah thats fine and i have no issues with that. 

It feels like no matter what i try or do, no matter how good i feel about myself, i cant get it out and no one seems to even notice that im different, if that makes sense. I feel like i blend into the background despite being the type to always try and go a different path. Any advice on what i should do to avoid reverting back into my old ways?

(also ty for everyone who has pmed me, ya'll really are the best &lt;3)

&amp;#x200B;

so right now, i'm okay but in like an hour i have a feeling i'll be balling my eyes out, so i'm gonna try to write this really fast so i can go to bed before that happens. sorry if this doesn't make sense, i just wanna rant about some people and my feelings for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

there's this girl named sarah in my class. everyone loves her, even my best friends who supposedly 'don't like her'. i remember being best friends with her in the beginning of the school year. after a couple of months, i realized how toxic and abusive she was. she'd always call me ugly and fat, the continue to say how pretty she is. as a really insecure person, i didn't wanna be around her, so i gradually stopped talking to her until she got the message. it wasn't until recently, she really made it clear how obviously abusive she is. one of my ex best friends, i'll call her antonio, went to go hear about the shit she talks about me. apparently she talked about how i should go kill myself, i'm worthless, i'm a fucking whore, etc. i don't wanna go into detail of what she calls me. but she also mocks me when i pass by her, she once pretended to hit me, threw garbage at me, etc. antonio  told me everything. i kept telling antonio to stop talking to her, but she keeps constantly talking, and i'm pretty sure taking shit about me, with her. antonio has done some really.. bad things in our friendship, so i left her today. i don't know how to feel yet. she was my best friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

this happened recently, (i honestly don't know when it started though). on april 11th i posted a photo on instagram of my friend and i, and not too long ago i found out that that photo went ALL around the high school im going to in 2 years. (i'm in middle school). from what i've heard, guys have said they wanted to wheel/fuck my friend and i, they've jerked off to it, etc. so that kinda makes me uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

i also really want a boyfriend who i can just cry to and hug and hold their hand and just... love. y'know? i really want that. i really *need* that. i feel like i can't talk to anyone of my friends without them making jokes about it or making them uncomfortable. i just need a guy i can talk to hours to, while being in their arms and knowing that they actually love me and will listen to me. but instead i just have to hide behind a screen, hide my identity and probably never talk to anyone who will even see this again. i'm just being dumb. i'm young and annoying and won't be taken seriously. 

&amp;#x200B;

i have so much more to say, but the more i write, the more i'm about to cry. gn, see you tomorrow. maybe?"
lonely,Make sure you make tea before u read it,"Make sure you make tea before u read it - So basically im lonely most of my life. Im 19 and I have graduated high school recently in Poland. I didn't had problem with lack of friends in school. In high school i was that person everybody liked and nobody hadn't problems with me. 

Also Im kind of good looking and funny and so a lot of girls was attracted to me. But in general I only liked one other girl and she dumped me(she turned out to be very weird person wasting her life on Netflix and alcohol, that was good side of it xd). It was harmful for few months but today only hurting feeling that I have is loneliness. In my whole life all of my best friends had someone else as a best friend(literally everyone) so i was always that second one. 

In addition I have like 3 niche hobbies, video games Im very passionate about them. Always wanted to encourage my friends to them but it didn't went good all of the times. Since they're not popular(hobbies not games) and im living in the small village I don't have possibilities to meet one. Of course those interests aren't my only ones but most important to me. Since kid had a dream to make it come true.

I remember one time around 13-15 yrs old that i always texted to my friends but it always felt like i was only one holding the conversation and when I found that it has no sense i stopped texting to these days. That ""silence"" of lack of conversation with my friends in years was overwhelming.

I have a lot of friends that I really like and so they really like me and appreciate me but it feels like our ways aren't crossing. I think maybe i didn't find my ""soulmate"" yet.

My ""first lonely feeling"" happened during summertime 2017 when i was working outside my country with my dad so i didn't have good relations with my friends and also I wanted girlfriend. I had opportunities but it always didn't work out for me. Almost every time i look behind that and I regret it. 

In october 2017 my grandfather died. Seeing a dead body of your grandfather and trying to resuscitate him is hard time for 17 yrs old I think.

 my mental collapse happened since I was dumped by that girl(I was angry about it and it was that sparkle that started the fire but also it was just another thing to be depressed or something like that) and it peaked during vacation 2018. 

I had a physical work that my family forced me to in place i don't know anybody, knowing that all of my friends are having great time during vacation was terrible. Of course I tried to meet with friends while i had day off with different effects.

During that time I had suicide thoughts and so on it carried to school time for about 2-3 months. 

Never opened up to my closest friends about it. Nobody knows maybe there will be time when im gonna tell it to somebody else not only this subreddit xd

And so I managed to get out of ""teenage depression"" 2017 and 2018 was pretty rough for me. Learned a lot during that time. Right now I don't have problems with my mental health but occasionally when it is weekends or vacation time I don't have any plans nobody is reaching me and when im reaching them it will probably won't work out I just feel lonely with no contact with my colleagues. 

Maybe right now I have leveled up in existential problems because i think about whole reality, is this life even real, what i should do to regret life less, what could be that sweet spot of life but im not getting sad, depressed or something just some serious thoughts without existential crisis. I think i have handled that once so i stabilized for a while. 

I think that particular loneliness feeling is quite compound.

I don't know what i want to get with that post, maybe i just needed to share my unable to solve life problems. Might delete later.

lonely,truly lonely,"truly lonely - I don't know for how long I'm going to be able to live like this. Facts: I have no job, no career (therefore no income), absolutely no friends, no family, only a narcissistic father that clearly doesn't want what's best for me, otherwise he would help me. I am desperate. And Reddit seems to make me feel even worse, because I'm not sure how many people who are not in my situation understand what I'm saying. At the same time, I don't know where else to go. I'm aware it's a very small chance I'll make a friend here, but I suppose I got nothing to lose. I wish I could meet someone just like me, then possibly meet up in person, so we can make it together in life. I'm not functional at all. I can't function without someone by my side. I've been lonely and alone my whole life, so I've only been getting worse and worse, year by year. Sometimes I get these urges to write or draw or paint something, even though I'm not good at it. But I just don't have the energy to do that. I don't have the energy to breathe anymore. My whole body hurts. I always feel this hole inside of me and at night time hurts even worse. I'm not really expecting anything from this post. It would be a miracle if I could get along with someone on Reddit (send me a PM if you're also on a dead end road regarding life), but I know it's not so easy to find that kind of person."

lonely,I'm alone again,"I'm alone again - A year ago i was probably the happiest i had ever been, i had started dating my now boyfriend, and had a very lively discord and talked with my friends everyday, but as when a relationship starts i just wanted to be with my boyfriend, rejecting everyone. 
The end result is now, being alone, with only my boyfriend, its like i don't even know my best friends anymore, they've moved on when i thought they would be there.
I'm an annoying human being to myself, if my friends need anything i will be there for them, i will put aside anything for them although they would never do the same for me, which sucks.
I don't have anyone close anymore, no one to talk to or vent to apart from my boyfriend, but when i'm upset with him, i have no one but myself to fill with emotions.
I've pathetically tried to talk to people online but i'm way to awkward without someone here (which is even more awkward when you don't have anyone in the first place).
I just don't know what to do, i have college friends, but i wouldn't want to go out with them, i hope that makes sense, i just want to chill but they are the more go out to club type, i'm very boring.
I just get sad when my boyfriend talks/ goes out with his friends when we haven't talked all day, i feel so weak and stupid, its like i depend on him because hes the only reals source of communication i have, i hate myself for it.
Its just full circle with me, i'm back to being alone again and i forgot how it felt, and boy does it hurt.
This was  rant i wanted to do for myself because i'm sad right now, i since i have no one to express this with, i will leave my mark here, i will probably never come back for a long time.

Just feeling so low at the moment 

I know these are totally first world problems, and alot of people have it much worse then me. But I can't help feeling down

I moved to a new city in September and it hasn't gone the way I had planned. Despite my efforts I haven't made that many friends so I found myself relying on texts and phonecalls from my friends back home

My best friend had been doing things that has been progressively pissing me off. She doesn't make near as much effort to keep in contact with me that she used to, constantly telling me she's too busy for phonecalls and texts even though she replies in group chats

We had a huge fight when I went back home. I was feeling upset about my nana being diagnosed with terminal cancer, and I just thought she wasn't there for me at all. We were on a night out and despite.my best efforts I ended up crying in a toilet thinking about it, she went off to get a drink with our other friend and didn't respond to my messages asking where they were. I would have written this off but I told her I didn't even want to go on that night out in case I were to get upset and she persuaded me telling me she'd take me home if it came to that

After the night out she went into her bedroom to call her boyfriend and didn't try to talk to me or ask me what was happening. We haven't spoken since. 
Whether I brought up these issues she flips out and starts blaming me for her behaviour. It'd just shit to realize that the person you thought would.have your back in times.like these, doesn't.

I think the moral of the story is to not rely on just one person for conversation and comfort because it will always bite you in the ass, no matter how wonderful you think they are."

I don't have any contact with my family. There's only my sister in another city. I occasionally get a text from her. I don't have many close friends. Mainly people I've known through work. I live alone following split from my long term partner a few years ago.

We are still in touch and we are meeting up this weekend to go see a band. I'm gay and I've tried online dating but not met anyone with any long term potential.

Tomorrow I will spend the day alone and have no plans apart from a girl I dated casually, who plans to come over, sleep with me then leave. She doesn't want anything apart from that occasionally.

It's upsetting that tomorrow, like Christmas, I don't have any permanent people in my life to celebrate with. I'm thinking of cancelling the hook up because I'm worried that when she leaves, I will just feel empty having spent the day alone and the only person who wants to see me doesn't value me enough to want me as a person.

I do spend a lot of my time alone but I think it's tomorrow and Christmas that are hardest for me as these are times that others are surrounding by family and friends but it's just another day for me."

I feel like an afterthought to all my friends and have never had a relationship that lasted more than 3 months. I'm unhappy with my friendships but so desperately lonely. I go back and forth between blaming myself and my friends, I feel like an awful person and that I associate with the wrong people at the same time, I never know whats right. I'm moving out at the end of the month and I'm terrified and excited to live alone. I have a problem where when I'm living with roommates I'm constantly scared of their opinion of me and fearful of confrontation (telling them things that bug me etc) and I'm also terrified of being alone.

lonely,What is this life?,"What is this life? - Oh...man! How should I start this?

I came to USA for a PhD around 4 years ago. All these years, I have suffered/ suffering extreme loneliness!!
I have roommate, but no use. We rarely see or talk each other.
Everyday, I call my parents 4-5 times just to talk to someone. They understand my situation.
Life has been so mundane and lonely recently.
I come home from college, cook the food, eat, watch some YouTube videos, sleep.... Everyday same thing...
Sometimes I feel so lonely that I call random customer care numbers just to have some small talk..
I'm tired of using various "" Talk to strangers"" websites.. Everyone there is horny af..
Recently, I tried few Meetup groups. That's it..no follow ups. Just temporary conversations..

All these years, I'm taking support of various movies, music etc. to heal my loneliness and depression.

In my lab, I talk to my labmate, but there are no heart to heart conversations. Everything fake! Everyone fake!
"" How are you?""--- ""I'm good""
No..I'm not fucking good..I'm damaged, exhausted.

This epidemic loneliness has significantly affected my research, personal life, and everything.

I just close my eyes and listen to soulful songs and cry..
 I hope someday I and everyone who's in the same boat with me, will find the happiness, solace abd purpose of this Life!!"
lonely,"I slow-danced with myself, just so I could pretend to know what it was like.","I slow-danced with myself, just so I could pretend to know what it was like. - I was the last person to leave my place of work really late a few nights back. I was finishing up a few things on my computer, and (since the building was empty) decided to play some music. I hit 'Shuffle' on Spotify, and after a few songs, a slow romantic song started playing. It hit me then, all at once, same as it does every week or so - just how lonely I am.

At 21, which I know is very young, I've never experienced the warmth of a girl leaning up against me as they look deep into my eyes and smile. I've never held hands with someone, kissed them on the cheek, and sighed just enjoying being in their presence. I've never awkwardly try and put my arm around someone at the movie theater. I've never stayed up til 3 in the morning talking on the phone with someone.

At that moment, as the song was playing I thought about how more than anything I would love to slow dance with someone. To have a girl rest her head on my chest/shoulder as I hold her and we sway peacefully back and forth. So - I stood up, and held my hands out in front of me...and fucking pretended to be dancing with someone. I used my imagination like I hadn't since I was 6 years old, and slow danced in the dark with tears running down my face.

I don't really know why I'm posting this. I've not been active much on this subreddit at all before, just lurked some. Is this normal at all to any of you? Have you had any similar experiences? It feels like one of the more genuinely pathetic moments in my life.

lonely,"Just a small, late night rant","Just a small, late night rant - I'm just really tired of how my life has gone these last few years. It hasn't really felt like I've had anyone in my corner. My parents support me of course, they always do their best, but they never really get down to where I am and help me in that way. I'm kinda just left to do my own thing, only occasionally helping when things get dire, but I don't know what to be doing with myself. Really, I don't know if I want to do anything, because sometimes I'm so afraid to just go outside my house to the shops. I don't know how to make friends, since in school it was just a case of who sat next to me.

I don't even really know what would help me. I would like a romantic relationship, like a girlfriend, but I'm not sure. I still have feelings for this one girl who I can't be with and who doesn't seem to have as much time for me anymore. Maybe I just need a group of friends, but I struggle to make any kind of deep connection with people, so all friendships just feel like we're keeping each other at arm's length.

I think I just want someone to just sit down next to me and tell me to stop panicking. That I really am gonna be alright, I'm still young, I still have time to figure things out and I'll find people eventually. It'd be even better if I could stop pitying myself for a moment and believe everything they're saying."

lonely,"People suffering from loneliness who have hope, where do you find that?","People suffering from loneliness who have hope, where do you find that? - I've been lonely and depressed since I was 14, i'm 32 now. Even though I'm much older I still battle the constant fear and anxiety that i've had since I was a kid. I feel at this point there's no use in fighting it any longer. I just need to get used to not having friends to go to for help, and get used to not having a significant other or someone to share my time with.

I now have to survive life being by myself, and learn to overcome obstacles in my life that would be much easier with friends and support. Basically I no longer have much hope in overcoming this, I want to give up. For years and years i've spent thousands and thousands of dollars on therapists and medications/drugs to ease the pain, without any kind of relief. 

How do you live a secluded life alone? How do you handle the loneliness? If you are in the depths of despair do you have hope? If so, where does that hope come from?"

and everything is rotting for so many years. What happens when it keeps on rotting? Won’t you start to see my dying flesh from the outside?


When loneliness took me in, i lost some chunk of myself, whatever was taken eventually i became a puzzle towards my identity, this physical corpse i carry is only a burden.


I have nothing but loneliness. I don’t know who i am, what i am, why i am.

lonely,Losing a friend every year,"Losing a friend every year - Mobile. Bad mind state. So what has been happening is I lost a really close friend of mine a couple years ago and he completely blocked everyone from our friend group and caused our friend group to get smaller. I was really depressed about this and I realize now that this person is gone. I still brought him up in conversation with my friends and we talk about it and this happens every time. Recently (within the last 12 months) another friend that highly criticized and said what that friend did (left us without explanation) was ridiculous. Now the hypocrite has done exactly the same thing he was complaining about. I was really close to him as well so it’s really draining me. I only have 2 close friends at the moment and one of them has a girlfriend and a full time job which makes it really hard to spend time with and the other is about to move away for work. I hate not having human connections and i get really depressed because of this. One other thing that adds to this is that I can’t find love which has been a problem before all this but I coped with my good friends. Now my coping mechanism are disappearing I have gone back to my old habits of spending 10+ hours on the computer distracting myself from real life and coping with extreme gaming addiction as a result. 


I know this is ridiculous but the sight of people being close or being in a relationship or getting married subconsciously triggers me and I start acting stupid and I don’t notice what I have done or said until after I have. Could anyone help me please?"

lonely,"I only have 1 friend; and she constantly leaves me, and it hurts.","I only have 1 friend; and she constantly leaves me, and it hurts. - So I met this girl about 8 months ago around September 5th 2018. I met her playing an online game and chatting on the discord server for that game. We were best friends on that server and we would talk all day and night about our days. It got to the point where she started opening up to me more and more and I figured out she had a bunch of mental disorders like depression, anxiety, bipolar, and the rest of the usual sadness related disorders. I found out later that she is anorexic, but I'll get into that later. Things were really well with me and her, she trusted me.. and I trusted her. We started getting closer and closer to each other around October 2018 so she decided to invite me to a server on discord with all of her friends (I'll keep their privacy by calling the girl well girl and her other friends friend 1,2 etc.) Her friends instantly hated me for whatever reason, my theory is that they saw how close I was getting to her and got jealous. There was 1 thing I didint know though, and it was about friend 1. Now, friend 1 was nice to me at first, but it got super dramatic really quick. Friend 1 saw how close I was to (girl) and got suspicions. Friend 1 asked me if I liked (girl) and instantly I started to put 2 and 2 together and figure out that Friend 1 was in a relationship with (girl) or so I thought. I told person that I had a girlfriend (complete lie, girl was my only friend atp) and all of them believed it. After that though, things were starting to plummet for me and I had to keep up the lies I was making to keep my only friend who cared about me. I dont remember exactly what happened but I do know that I hurt (girl) 's feelings over something. Things were really bad so I thought I would just tell her straight up hey, all that talk about me having a girlfriend was false.. I really like you and wanted to keep our friendship and stuff like that. At that point I was obsessed with her, but the only problem was that we were arguing over stuff and she got super pissed at me one day and just left me. I was super sad, I started to go into a depressive state and cry each night thinking about how she was the only real friend I've ever had and how she got me through the kids at school bullying me and my family thinking of me as a disappointment. Eventually, I decided to add her back on a new account and talk to her there, it was Christmas morning so i thought she would be more open to talk or whatever. We end up getting super close again for about a good month or so. Now, girl had a friend and I'll call her friend 2, she was awful.. she was a drama queen and still is, she is an attention whore. Their friendship was always on and off, and I was always there to guide her in it. This is where the story gets really really interesting, around feburary 2019, when someone who knew friend 2's brother and dated him for a while. I dont care about his privacy because idk i just dont care. His name was justin. This was around the time where I sat at a different table at lunch and the people were taking advantage of me in every way (I had no idea abt that) they told me to lead justin on and sext him and do all this weird gay shit that I was so uncomfortable with. Well through all of this, girl was single and I really liked her so I decided to ask her out. She was thinking about it the entire day and I started to worry. So i made the worst mistake ever, I asked justin out and he said yes (I am not gay and quite frankly I hated justin) I did that so I could tell girl that she had her chance and blah blah blah just to make her jealous and want me for anything. Well, that turned on me badly, lauren left me again and told me that she did have feelings for me and that I fucked up and I would regret it and all of this stuff (she now claims that she did not have feelings for me). I was sad of course because now I'd have to deal with my boyfriend which I did not want and I hated because I wasint gay. I realised then that I needed girl, girl was special to me and I missed her. I did the same thing that I did on Christmas again and it worked. She talked to me again but told me that I lost her trust and wouldint gain it back. I talked to her for weeks and eventually things were going well again. All up until valentines day. Girl was not single because she was now dating friend 1 because I dared her (dont ask why, I really dont know why I dared her that, it was stupid.) I posted on my snapchat story that I was alone on valentines day and did the basic wish I had someone thing and a senior responded to that saying she'll be my valentine (she was joking ofc but I said whatever and went with it) this really hurt girl for whatever reason. I didint think it would because she had a bf but this time she didint leave me. We ended up being good again and things were well finally for a while. Then our relationship was bumpy again, we argued constantly for weeks and our relationship became on and off again. I feel like this is starting to get long so I'll stop it here for the beginning part of the story. Please message me, I want to talk about this and get advice. I miss her. I fucked up. I love her.

lonely,"No friends, never outside the house except when I’m at the gym or getting groceries.","No friends, never outside the house except when I’m at the gym or getting groceries. - I’ve never been the sort of dude to bother anyone with my problems. Always had the attitude of suck it up, take it. Always someone who has it worse than you, so take it on the chin and live on with your life. But In the past 3 years I’ve had one friend who always ditches me for literally anyone else and to me he’s my best friend (only friend)  doesn’t even tell me when he cancels on me just ignores me until he has nothing to do. 

So then no wonder I feel lonely which is why I’m here. Sobbing about how bad I got it... which is sort of strange for me. On my birthday only my mother wished me happy birthday. No one else remembered or cared to write on my Facebook just “happy birthday” from anyone else would have made me feel a bit better. 

So straight to the point. I’ve not been the best person around. I was depressed for a couple of years, isolated myself. But 2 years ago I got better and I wanted to like be with people. Tried to talk with people at school which well was nice at school but when I got home I was alone again no one snapped w me invited me to do stuff or were busy when I tried to like invite people out “let’s play basketball football or just game together” but Every time I sat alone on my pc gaming solo player. I’ve graduated from school and I worked until I got fired because we went bankrupt. It’s now been half a year since that happened and still I only had colleagues there who just disappeared after we quit working together. 

The closest contact I have with other people except my mother is when I’m at the gym and then it’s just a “hey” or  “shall I secure you?” 

it feels like I’m alone in this world and the only person who cares about me is my mother... I don’t know what to do? I don’t know how I can get myself out of this life without friends? And yeah any advice or comment would be mostly appreciated :-)"

Today i couldn't take it anymore, so i just came up to a stranger and told him the whole sittuation.

lonely,Miss the days of having friends,"Miss the days of having friends - I HATE having no friends…. I say this daily to myself and no matter what I do I can’t seem to change it. I used to have friends but over the years some have fallen away and then about 1 ½ years ago my health issues seemed to scare the remainder away.  The world doesn’t like people with issues or who are sick in anyway. We are broken and useless and yes those are words I have heard from people. 

I spend most of my days by myself and in my own head. It sucks, you rip yourself apart in every way possible including asking yourself why you are not good enough to have friends. I miss conversations with other people, fun ones and even intelligent ones. Sure, I have co-workers but those are typically short talks in the hallway and that is about it. Most of them aren’t friends outside the building and trust me, I have tried. I have learned over the years that co-workers usually don’t make great friends anyways. 

I remember back in school my parents would tell me it gets easier when you get older to make friends. I have to disagree, I think it is much harder now than it was as a kid. People tend to have more excuses as adults as to why they don’t have time to hang out or talk. The list seems to be endless at times…

People are too self-centered now, can’t see past their own world and can’t seem to see the importance of being friends with others. It doesn’t take much to be nice to people or even give them a little bit of time out of your day. Sure, we don’t all have the same likes or dislikes but there are ways to still be friends with people who are a bit different than us….."
lonely,High School.,"High School. - It will be another school year in the next month. It's my last year in high school and I am actually kind of happy that it is.  
This year, will be another sad season for me. I'm currently on my summer break right now and the next month, everything will come back to the way things are. 

I am going to eat out alone again at lunch at school. I am going to miss my phone, because phones are not allowed in my school. It makes me feel less alone. The awkwardness, when you think that people are looking at you as if it is a bad thing.

I will most likely stay in the library to escape the reality by entering the complexity of my thoughts and to talk to my inner self.

I can't make friends because I just can't have a deep connection because people already have friends of their own and it's hard to even bother to make one.

I am kind of anxious right now and I can't stop thinking about it. I need to enjoy the last month of the summer break because I don't want to rue everything. I want to have a peace of mind while entering the next school year because I just want to be casual. I need some advice to make me feel better. I need you guys."

Almost 3 years ago I really didn't mind social stuffs. But almost few months ago I realised I have to connect some people as a friend. Becaue we need that to live better and without tell lie ourselves. So now I am going high school and 1 year left. I have just 3 'real' friend for me. One is a bit complicated, I like her actually. And one of them started thinking that I am insincere. And other one is not enough to talk everything I want to talk or meet somedays. I really care this people  but I don't show this so much and sometimes I see their faces like hostile. And that hurts so much. I really don't want to lose them so when I talk can't be relax. And sometimes something in my body keeps me to don't talk with them even I want it so much. 
And also I want to make another friendships too but sometimes I can't find topics or when their faces become neutral or bad I think like it is because of me and trying to finish the conversation. Also as I said the thing in my body effects that so much too. 
So folks. I really exhausted. For 17 years almost haven't been out with my friends and had fun. Almost haven't got a surprise from my friends and when I felt bad almost noone asked. 
So thank you guys to read them all. Maybe I did some mistakes, sorry about them."

A chance to actually gain even the smallest reputation in the school. 

But my two only friends are both leaving. One of them is moving abroad, and the other one's going away to a different school. I'm happy for both of them. It's a new page in their lives, something to embrace and be excited about.

They even were talking about how they needed to throw a party for another guy whose birthday is next month. One of the guys, who I spent and planned stuff for his birthday this past year as he was alone, told me he won’t be hanging out with me. 
So, I just went home. It just feels kind of shitty. It’s just me and my dogs."
lonely,I’m so fucking tired of not having anyone to talk to.,"I’m so fucking tired of not having anyone to talk to. - Other than my parents (whom I live with still), there is not a soul that I talk to more often than every few days. I just lay in bed all day, bored and alone."

lonely,Don't you love the feeling,"Don't you love the feeling - When everyone around you seems either out to get you or entirely fake or both. The one friend that you love unconditionally is entirely distant, non responsive and on the verge of leaving for good. And you truly feel like life will be over for you if that person leaves..

That's what I thought was going to happen when she left. She came back only to be more distant than ever, and she's been saying hurtful things when she does respond. Nothing is like it used to be. She thinks I'm faking my pain. And left out of paranoia that I would kill her if we were to meet. If she's not with me then who is. I can't take this heartbreak. I'm barely holding on. 😔"

I know I have friends but they all have better things to be doing than talking or being with me. I care about them so much but none of them are available when I need them. I just want to feel close to people again, even if that’s horrifying. 

it feels incredibly selfish saying this."
lonely,I’m getting tired of being here,"I’m getting tired of being here - In all honesty, I would never cause harm to myself that would be fatal, but in the end I really am tired of my life. At the end of the day no one listens to me, I have no friends that I can rely on, and I will most likely never find a girl who seems to feel the same way. I always feel guilt on a lot of things and also feel as if I do not deserve anything.

Only thing I’m doing now and plan to do in the future is hold onto that little hope that someday will bring happiness."

Of course since they push me away I get even less educated on expressing emotion and more lonely."
lonely,"Incredibly lonely, just looking for someone who will accept me","Incredibly lonely, just looking for someone who will accept me - By now I’ve posted in all the subreddits where you can ask for people to talk to, but for some reason everyone just either ghosts me or doesn’t like me. I’m going to clarify straight away that I do have. A lot of problems, I’m mildly autistic, I have depression and anxiety, I’m self destructive and I’m really good at pushing people away. I have been in several relationships and two of them have been abusive, I was cheated on, gaslighted, verbally and mentally abused, people laugh at males in abusive relationships, but you really don’t understand unless you’ve been through it. I’m not here for a relationship, nor am I here looking for someone to pile all of my troubles onto, several years ago I would of done that but I have learned now. I’ve tried so many different therapists and medications, but I know deep down that the only thing I really need is human interaction. Since leaving high school three years ago I have had nobody, me and my family aren’t close and I’m really not good at keeping friendships going. I just hope someone sees this and will give me a chance, I know I am pathetic for begging, but please, just give me a chance. 

My name is Joseph, I’m 19 and I’m from England. I’m pretty athletic, and I’m also a massive nerd so I really don’t know if I can be considered a nerdy jock but there you go. In high school I was the captain of the football team, I dated the head cheerleader, just the typical stuff, but since leaving I have had nobody. When I was 17 my long term girlfriend passed away from cancer, and after that I entered an incredibly abusive relationship where she just used me and hurt me everyday and I was never strong enough to stand up to her until one day. I really don’t know what else to say, I don’t want to list all of my interests because that’s boring and if anyone does decide to talk to me we’d have nothing to talk about anyway, but, if you think you could give me a chance, then you will have no idea how much it would mean to me."
lonely,Looking for real friends,"Looking for real friends - Hey random people that are most likely infinitely better than almost anyone I know irl

I'm 16, english and... I don't wanna say I hate my life but I'm not too happy with it for reasons that I'm not entirely sure I want to go on about here. I'm sure you'll all understand.

I spend most of my time wasting away in my room being completely ignorant to the world probably playing xbox or listening to music.

I realise halfway through writing this its probably got no flow or doesn't make sense.

As the title suggests I'm looking for real friends and by that I mean not just people who I'll talk to for a month or so and then just forget, someone who will last and I can trust.

I have no ""requirements"" except that I'd prefer any potential friends to be around my age (16) but that's not a big deal to me really. You don't have to share interests or anything I just want someone great that I can talk with and have a good time with. You don't even need to be in the same country as me I don't get out much anyway and would probably be too awkward to meet anyone irl.

If your interested in talking to me more just message me.

I think I'm about done now sorry for any potential spelling mistakes or repetition or anything like that.

If your still reading thanks so much it really does make me feel great that some random stranger on the Internet cares enough to spend a few minutes reading about me.

Have a nice day/night :)"
lonely,"I feel like my life has gone downhill, and I don't know what to do about it.","I feel like my life has gone downhill, and I don't know what to do about it. - Hi, I'm uh, kinda ""desperate"" to like, talk to someone or have any kind of human interaction at all, so I figured I could give reddit a shot (I've never really used it, so I'm getting used to it, yay). 

Well, I have broken up with my girlfriend -- a couple of months ago, and I... I feel like everything's fucking fucked for me.. I feel really alone, and don't really have friends, except for one, but he's busy with his girlfriend, life, etc.

She was my whole world, I mean.. Everyday, all day I used to text her, and make her my number one priority, some days, I would be spending lots of days with her, I felt like this was it, she was ""the one"", we were thinking about the future, we wanted a life with eachother.

But, she...She treated me like shit, there were moments she would just say that I'm useless, or that I needed to grow up (We were 18 btw), and a lot of stuff that I can't shake off to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never felt this lone.

I have no one to text to

No one to go out with

Nothing.

I feel really empty, and cold.

And I'm really scared that I'll just grow cold, I'm a really warm guy,I really like showing my love for  someone, but lately, I'm starting to feel more like..Numb.. For example; Things that used to make me cry, now don't really seem to have an effect on me. Don't get me wrong, I cry, a lot.

But sometimes, I don't really feel anything. At all.

.....And I don't know what to do about it.....

I just want someone to talk to..I wish everything was different.

I miss her. I miss everything..

I miss the life I lived before."

lonely,looking to make friends,"looking to make friends -  

This is my second reddit post ever so forgive me if i do it wrong.

So here goes...

i'm looking to chat to people (guys or gals) as recently i realised i've hardly any friends irl and none online and was looking to change that. the reason for this is i'm feeling lonely and usually that was fine by me but now i've sorta lost my confidence in like everything i do irl. like literally just so bored of my own space now. i don't know if reddit is the best place to do this as i know there's a few trolls on it but thought i'd give it a try.

so here's a bit about myself.

i'm 21, male,interested in gaming, i like films - my favourite genre is romance which i know sounds pretty weird but guess i'm just a big sop. i like writing and looking to start a blog about everything i've experienced in life in hopes that if someone has experienced the same or experiencing the same then i can help them deal with it.i love books but i'm dyslexic so it's definitely a task to read. i like sarcasm and humour which may not be for everyone, i guess it helps me to laugh things off rather than dwell on them anyway if you want to know more message me or reply to this post and we can sort somthing out ( like sharing names on a different app or whatever )"
lonely,Is it lame to go to a comedy show solo?,"Is it lame to go to a comedy show solo? - 20F one of my favorite comedians is performing tonight at a comedy club an hour from me and I have nobody to go with. I really have no friends so I miss out a lot on these types of social events, or any for that matter, and I really want to go. I would usually ask my brother to go with me to these kinds of things but he’s busy so I’m left alone deciding whether or not I should go alone. Im not local to the area so it would be a bit of a drive and I honestly don’t want to feel like a lonely loser in a comedy club full of couples and friend groups. On one hand I feel like I could show up looking hot and maybe a guy will approach me, or I can meet new people, or even just enjoy it alone. On the other hand I’m scared of feeling like an idiot in a sea of people and that I’ll just end up feeling worse. It’s something I really want to do but I don’t know if it’s too lame or cool. Help please. Also written in class so sorry if it’s all over the place."
