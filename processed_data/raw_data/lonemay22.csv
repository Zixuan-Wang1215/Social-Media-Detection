lonely,Realising I'm no ones favorite.,"Realising I'm no ones favorite. - I have no best friends, everyone I know is either just school friends, someone to hang around with during lectures and to study with. Or people I know through a friend. And sure they don't dislike me. But I'm more of a tag along to their main friend, the friend I got to know them through.

Normally I don't think about this. I'm not physically alone after all. But now when I discovered the person I was dating didn't feel the same, they were there for a good time, not a long time... I'm spiraling doubting everyone else too. Especially now when my best friend, someone I've known for like 9 years. Doesn't even seem to notice that I've been gone for a month... Oh well, feels good to write here atleast, organises the mind. And hey, maybe some of you feel the same, then know you are not alone, not in feeling that way anyways :)"
lonely,I need help,"I need help - Look the title is a bit misleading, but let me explain.
recently on whatsapp, when I scrolled trough my contacts there where that person I met when I was still at my Therapist(what was pre Covid) , I thought she blocked me awhile ago but now she has a new pfp and I would like to be friends again, but I struggle to text her.
I don't want to look like a weirdo or something, since she might have forgotten about me, any good suggestions on how to get into small talk n' stuff?

Take care &amp; stay safe"
lonely,A Sense of Hope,"A Sense of Hope - This past fall I was going through some personal things and just felt alone. I’ve not had much of a successful dating life whether it be a committed relationship or hookups. They’ve happened but nothing long term has ever come of them. 

Then a friend I’ve had for six years became single. 

I’d had a crush on her for a while. We met online in 2016 and were in contact daily. We watched each other try and fail, learn and grow, chase dreams, and build each other up regularly. We met in the summer of 2021 for the first time and had a casual lunch in her hometown, I was there visiting unrelated to meeting her and it just happened. The second she walked into the restaurant, I knew I was in trouble. I locked eyes with her and she had a huge smile and came in for a hug. I’m not an overly touchy person but the hug tied my stomach up. 

She’d gotten out of a long relationship not long after we’d met in person the first time and I was able to provide her with a shoulder to lean on. 

I gave it a few months after the relationship before asking her to dinner. I made the trek back to her hometown where we had a casual dinner, I expected nothing other than spending time with her. I was over the moon just spending time with her. We ended the night back at her place and knowing I had to get back on the road (lonnnnng commute), we kept our goodbyes brief with a hug. 

The greatest fucking hug I’ve ever received. I’m still chasing that dragon.

Things were going well. I’d given her my number, we moved from texting via social media to actually texting. We would spend evenings together texting and flirting and getting to know each other even more. 

And then the wheels fell off. I don’t know why but they did. I was so happy just to have a regular female companion to spend time with and that I thought had feelings for me. I don’t open up easily to people but it was different with her. I couldn’t stop thinking about her, talking about her to friends, I was smitten. 

I just hate that we clicked seamlessly but it was right place, wrong time for her and I. 

I just hate that it took me 13 years to find someone that I could feel those feelings for after my last crushing heartbreak and I’m back to square one."
lonely,A strange kind of loneliness,"A strange kind of loneliness - I hope this is ok to post here but I feel a maybe different kind of loneliness.

I’m in a relationship, have family and friends. But my life totally lacks physical touch. I can’t remember the last hug I got, last time (more than 3 years ago) I tried to hold my partners hand, my partner pulled the hand away.

I don’t really know what to do anymore 😩"

lonely,I wish I had someone to talk to on a daily basis.,"I wish I had someone to talk to on a daily basis. - I had two relationships back to back (about 4 months between the end of the first and starting to talk and date the next) and for about three years and a half I just had someone to talk to every single day. The ex from the first relationship was also a really close friend I would see and spend time with on a daily basis. The second relationship ended back in September and I have been…so incredibly alone. I talk to friends and meet them from time to time but I’m so lonely because there’s no one in my life that is close to me and knows me well. There’s no one to tell about my day and to whom I can tell my day to day frustrations. I wish I was still a student at least I could see my classmates on a daily basis and have some consistent interactions with people. 

I really am so lonely and I have been depressed and the loneliness doesn’t help."

lonely,I just want a hug,"I just want a hug - Thought maybe I was just horny but no. Just touch starved I guess. I wish I wasn't such a hermit. Currently debating whether I should talk to friends I ghosted months ago or just buy a sexdoll with heated blanket to keep me warm at night.

Good education, a good partner, supportive family, good looking, good job experience and a good job. I just never really had friends. It doesn’t feel fair to say because I do but it’s not what I think friendship should be like. Every time I experience friendship in a way that I’m looking for I know that I’m not asking for too much. It absolutely pains me that I don’t have friends. I’m trying to get more out there. I went out with a group of girls this past weekend and it finally felt right. I want meaningful friendships but I also want people I can have fun with. And now I keep overthinking everything about that night because I’m worried I did something wrong. I got hit on so much when we went out and I’m hoping they saw it as funny not in a jealous way. I rejected everyone as not only did I have no interest, I just wanted to be with them and make a good first impression. Anyways it’s a dumb kind of happy vent. Trying to make my worries not get the best of me."

lonely,"I want to feel grateful, but i feel so alone","I want to feel grateful, but i feel so alone - There are only two people that really matter to me right now. My best friend and my mom. The rest of my family are in another country. 

My mom is the only family I need, but I wish I was connected to more people. I have my best friend, but she’s very popular while Im not. I understand why. I have a really hard time socializing. How do you get yourself in a group of friends without being awkward? I’m also not very good looking and I’m fairly incompetent at anything I do. In fact, i might even go o as far to say that people hated me for my incompetence, and I cant blame them.  When everyone seems like a red flag, you are the problem, after all. My bestfriend stayed with me because she’s the only who seems to tolerate me, but there are times when she would ask me if im autistic, or if there’s genuinely something wrong with me —slightly irritated, but more so concerned. I don’t think I have anything going on medically. It’s just so hard to initiate a connection with people and maintain it, but I think that’s due to a lack of social development on my part. At my job, i can hold eye contact and communicate with coworkers and customers comfortably, as long as its on script for the most part. I want to be friends with my coworkers, but i know they only talk to me because i happen to be there.

There’s no sugarcoating it. I dont have a lot of people because I never was able to make myself “attractive” in more ways than just the physical. And my lack of friends  makes me question the connection that I do have with the only people I have in my life. Is my bestfriend my bestfriend because I have no other friend? Do i feel aromantic because i never actually experienced having a guy crush on me?

Then there’s my mom. There are many times when I know Ive manipulated, emotionally abused, or left my mom. The painful memory of the time I smacked my mom’s hand away from reaching out to me because she was breaking up with her boyfriend, whom i learned to like just because he bought me a new laptop. It was an act of betrayal. Why did I do that? She needed me. She was a victim if a narcissistic boyfriend. I kept asking myself what brought me to become that selfish and backstabbing. I promised myself I wouldn’t do it again. But there were several instances thereafter where I disappointed her again, and never proved my love or loyalty. We currently have an abusive roommate, who he verbally attacks my mom. i try to speak up when he does it, but I cant. Im right there while he calls my mom a whore. She does fine defending herself as she’s indifferent to other people’s shit, but that doesnt take away the fact that Im so selfish. I have no courage. Im incompeten when it comes to proving myself. I hate it. I acknowledged it hundreds of time, I am aware. And yet, when the time comes, i never change. 

I do not understand why these two people are even here. I dont understand why my mom still loves me. I know how i treated them, how i used them so much, milked them of everything because i have no one else, and never was there for them when it counts. 
Theyre much better off if they let me go. I know it. But i dont want to let go of them because i need them. They’re the only people that matter in my life, but i failed them, especially my mom. 
Until i change myself, i deserve to be lonely. There’s a reason why i estranged. People arent comically spiteful at some randomly chosen individual: there’s something profoundly wrong with me that has led to those general patterns.
I think i know the attRibutes that have led to my lack of likeability, i just dont understand why im not changing, despite how much i am aware of my personality problems, and despite how much I want to change."

lonely,I need some human interaction but I just can’t speak to people the way I used to. + Need advice about enjoying loneliness.,"I need some human interaction but I just can’t speak to people the way I used to. + Need advice about enjoying loneliness. - Been very distracted lately, especially after breaking of my only two friendships &amp; one relationship (mainly due to my own insecurities). 

I didn’t speak to anyone else. My parents are supportive enough, which I am very grateful for, but I don’t see myself talking to them anymore. All of this happened during the same time.   

I have never been a very social person, but I used to look forward to talking to my friends, sending memes, sharing highlights of the day. But all of that has vanished along with the three friendships I had.   

I want to speak to people, want to have someone to speak to at the end of the day, listen to theirs, have a human relationship to look forward to. But I just can’t. And I don’t know why.  

So, I have decided, in the best interest of myself that I have to get comfortable with being lonely, I can’t always lament over the fact that I have no one to talk to.   

I enjoy being by myself for most part, but sometimes there’s moments (like these!) when I bawl my eyes out over the fact that I have no shoulder to cry on, no one to talk to. Sometimes I feel I just need ONE PERSON who will understand &amp; stay, just bear with me. These episodes have decreased in frequency, but I want to completely eliminate them as they set me back a lot &amp; I take a lot of time to recover.   

TLDR: No friends, need to eliminate random spells of sadness, need advice on being comfortable by myself.   
Thanks! :)"
lonely,"Rewatched ""The Lobster""","Rewatched ""The Lobster"" - I adore A24 films. They tell such diverse and compelling stories that leave you evaluating your own life every time. Minor spoiler warning for ""The Lobster,"" highly recommend you give it a watch if you haven't already. I remember renting it on RedBox a couple years ago and I had remembered it earlier today so I rented it through Prime Video. It's message still holds up with how society treats single people and how there's pressure to be married and have children by a certain age. 

In this society, if you're single, you'll be put into this hotel where you'll have 45 days to fall in love or you'll be turned into an animal of your choosing. The main character, David, proceeds to be cheated on, feign being in love, and then finally fall in love but have it be obstructed by what their society says they should have in common. It's a film that encapsulates how romantic relationships are seemingly this huge milestone, a big goal that we all need to have to live complete lives. The premise alone describes love as a must and if not as humans, at least as animals. It's execution of it's message is solid in all aspects and the cinematography, stiff, keeps you immersed in its dystopia. The soundtrack is a bit repetitive, but it does a great job at making you feel the habit, the monotony of these social norms and constructs we perpetuate. It's also funny how one way they fix relationship problems is to assign them a child.

I'd say many of us crave the Eros kind of love. But how much of that desire is from human nature and how much of it is from how much society enforces romance as a staple for happiness? Most of my life has been driven by love. I've been in and out of relationships and I've had best friends who were the closest thing to a home. I can recall being single, in my bed, being obsessed with the idea of being with someone. Though, that's all it was, an obsession with not being alone. Thoughts like those usually don't consider a real person and more so think about a body, the concept of having someone with you, a dime piece. Sure it'd be nice, but we shouldn't let all of our happiness be defined by whether we have a partner or not. 

Anyways, I wanted to shout out this really cool film cause I don't really have anyone to talk about these things with. Hope your day/night goes swell and if you're going through a hard time, you're not alone. Do something you enjoy, even if it's something small."
lonely,why do i keep ruining everything,"why do i keep ruining everything - i’ve been crying for the past hour and it freaking hurts. having to contemplate my entire life and absolutely feeling like shit. i just think that everything is my fault. i hate my social anxiety and how it ruins everything for me. everytime i think about it, i go into an existential crisis and hate myself even more. why do i have to be such a loser? why does this have to happen?

it seems like everyone has someone to talk to, except for me. i can never maintain friendships, and thinking of all the friends i used to have just hurts my heart, because i don’t have the strength to reach out to them anymore. they don’t care, they’ve moved on, and i’m not important to them anymore. being stuck in home for years due to covid made me so depressed, burnt out, and feeling like i want to die. i began to isolate from so many things, and its like i’ve unintentionally drifted away from everyone. i have no energy to do anything now. 

it hurts me even more, because i mustered up the courage to reach out to my one and only friend weeks ago. we haven’t spoken in months prior to that, so i wrote a long message, embarrassingly shed some tears while typing, and i told them what i felt. i still think about them often, and i had to apologize for who i was. she meant a lot to me, and we even opened up to each other during those times, but it doesn’t matter. she seenzoned me, and doesn’t want to talk. i should’ve seen it coming, because she’s already told me before that i shouldn’t talk to her.it hurts that even the only friend i thought i had is ignoring me now. i don’t know why i have to be so easily hurt. why did a seenzone like that hurt me so much? and honestly, just thinking about it makes me cry even more, and it’s so fucking embarrassing. i freaking hate it. i genuinely hate everything. i wish i wasn’t the way i was, i wish i wasn’t so lonely, nowadays i can’t take it anymore. i cant even scream to let all these pent up things out."

I don't have friends, not even my boyfriend is my friend. He's never touchy with me, he doesn't care about my issues, he will literally ignore me and tell me to go away when I tell him my problems.

lonely,defeated,"defeated - just got told i’m a shitty person by a guy in this group because i asked him questions about having cancer and his life and he said it’s shitty of me to not share photos of myself and that i’m immature. he said it’s the reason my ex left me. which isn’t true. but honestly, i’m already low so whatever. 

my boyfriend and i, i guess ex now, broke up a few days ago. and then i had some other family trauma to deal with. everything is heavy and i feel like complete and utter shit. nice to know there’s always people here on reddit to kick you when you’re already down. 

what is the fucking point of living? my bpd ruins every relationship. i’m a stupid fucking piece of shit that just doesn’t deserve anything good. 

i’m fucking done. i just give up trying. what good comes from trying? 

go ahead, reddit. fuck me over while i’m down. now’s your chance."

lonely,Am I the only one enduring this situation?,"Am I the only one enduring this situation? - I really don’t know how to start this, but basically, I’m really tired of being lonely, no matter how much effort I put to connect with new people and following them up. 

I don’t mind that I initiate the conversation and reach out to them first. To be fair, I have even managed to connect them on Instagram and Facebook so we can continue our conversation there in case they aren’t active on Reddit. I even managed to meet them up in person despite me living hundreds of kilometres from my place and I did fly there just to meet them up. Of course, travelling in their area is partly the reason too, but meeting them is my main motivation.   

But despite already meeting them, they don’t seem to really commit to maintain our friendship as much I do. I realized that it’s just me who would initiate it most of the time, and when I want to meet them again, they would tell me whatever excuses they have, and I tried to be empathetic with their situation. I was being empathetic because I know that some of them are already in a relationship or already married.        

However, my heart always broke when I found out that they have been hanging out with their other friends more than once, and worse, they came to my area without telling me at all. I could know that because they posted their updates on FB and IG stories. It makes me wonder how they got so much time to meet up others while they don’t really wanna meet me. And so, I started to deactivate my Facebook and Instagram accounts to stem my anxiety and depression from them.      

It also makes me realized that no one bothers to message me on other apps once I’m not on FB and IG anymore. They do know my other accounts on other apps, yet no one messaged me how are you or if I’m alright from time to time. They would only message me when they need help with their problems, but once that’s over, they would ghost me.    

And before you advised me to keep myself busy and love myself more, I literally have done both and still do so, yet that doesn’t stave off my loneliness in any way. I’m quite busy with my work (I work remotely) for the past few weeks, and I still crave for a human connection outside of work. I just want someone to genuinely hug and comfort me when I need the most, and vice versa. I know this sounds selfish, but this is what happens when I have been physically lonely for so long.       

I even visited a therapist, but it only made my depression and anxiety worse as he didn’t being empathetic with my situation and instead giving me advices that don’t work for me.       

Eventually, I start to hate the society I live in and this country overall. I really can’t believe loneliness could happen to me in a country called Malaysia. I really consider leaving this country for good if the situation got worse, but I doubt if it would get any better if I move to an another country if the society and the mentality of the people is just the same as here.      

I really wonder if there’s anyone who had their lives better and less lonely after moving abroad. At this point, I’m really tired of dealing with extreme loneliness. It’s like... I either have to live together with someone, or I live alone and become like what I have now. Why? Just why? Why can’t I just live alone while being able to meet up with people from time to time when I want to?"

lonely,Serendipity and Suffering,"Serendipity and Suffering - Serendipity and Suffering

32M (myself) 30F (her)

When you give your all in a relationship… it can feel absolutely rewarding. Going to bed at night knowing you’re giving 100%. Knowing you just worked all week and spent your day off tending to kids, running errands and cleaning. Giving their mother alone time to decompress because you just worked 5 days and she’s had to handle that emotional labor all week. Things don’t have to be perfect… knowing I have this opportunity alone brings me happiness. 

It feels good when your actions align to your personal standards for the role you are filling. It reinforces that sense of self that you’ve worked so hard to build and maintain.

What doesn’t feel good is when your spouse, the biological parent of those kids doesn’t so much as say thank you for your sacrifices. What doesn’t feel good is when you do all these things they find something to complain about. It doesn’t feel good when you have to beg for affection and intimacy despite communicating mutually how important it was to both of you. It doesn’t feel good to know despite all the positive things you’re bringing to the table, one small slip up (in their eyes a major issue) and you’re on the couch for the night. 

I’m giving my all, to a woman and her children. I’m being stepped on, appeased until I’ve completed what they want done and discarded to the couch for the night. My needs for intimacy and affection forgotten… or at the very least omitted. This isn’t about sex, it never was for me. It’s about emotional connection and love in a household. What do you do? 

Do you walk away from the 3 kids? The kids who run up and hug you when you get home from work and tell you they love you? To those kids I am a good man. An integral part of the household.. I’ll be dead soon.. they have their entire lives ahead of them and up to this point haven’t had a male role model. To her, I feel like a resource. I don’t know if it’s all in my head. Maybe it is? Gaslighting me without a word to be said. I’m rather confident it’s not. Show appreciation to the person in your life giving all they can give. I’m at a loss for words. Tangible actions show more than your intention… I’m lost. I feel unloved, I feel unwanted.. and you’ve got me by the balls. This is emotional abuse. The emotional affairs you choose over me in my time of need sicken me. You treat your friends like they’re the ones who come home every day and feel alone laying next to you. You treat the man giving everything he has like a nuisance… because you know he won’t walk away from those kids as countless others have before. Youre exploiting the one good thing in your life.. the one who respects your boundaries. You’re selfish for not allowing yourself to experience discomfort when something he does inadvertently makes you feel anxious and instead of working through it, you kick him to the couch. You reinforce the idea that there’s no point in wanting to bring good into the household. You, are selfish. I’m no longer here for you, I’m here for the children. You lied your way into my pants, you’ve lied your way into my graces… you lied your way into having a genuinely good person to be there for the children. You ignore me and text the man who fucked you and left. You smile at the sperm donor who couldn’t give a fuck about wether his seed is happy or healthy and scowl at me. You tell me to get away from you or not to touch you and go text the man who only wants to fuck you one time to live a fantasy. Am I living a fantasy? I only want you to appreciate my doings. I want you to appreciate me. I know by leaving I wouldn’t hurt you. You stopped caring about me months ago. Where did I go wrong? I went wrong in trusting you, in trusting your words. I was misled, coerced with lies and false actions. You dangle your carrot on a stick like the cheeky high schooler “dangling his nuts”. You got what you wanted.. a martyr. I’m not a white knight… I’m a good hearted man who cares about children I’ve bonded with over the past year and a half. I’m someone you take advantage of with zero remorse. Someone you could push around and still rely on at the end of the day. God, give me strength. I’m a better man than they will ever be. Bring me peace, absolve this loneliness that consumes me and help her see the errors in her selfish, self absorbed ways. Help her see that she is driving off a good man. Help me find happiness outside of myself. Amen"

lonely,Feeling alone but not alone,"Feeling alone but not alone - I am a 17 year old and recently I had a girlfriend of 2 years breakup with me. Now at first glance it might seem like a very young and dumb kinda thing but I promise there is more to it. We were with each other through very vital parts of our lives. My mother had cancer that was rapidly getting worse and my girlfriend helped me through the whole thing. I called her when my mother passed and she even came and saw her body and comforted me the whole day. After that I felt a very special connection to her. Over time there was a fluctuation of distant and close, but nothing that really bothered us. We hung out almost every weekend and went on multiple vacations together. We spent a lot of time with each other’s families and even looking back on it, even though she’s with another guy I’d still make the effort to come to a family event if I was invited. I still text her mother a few times a week but never mention anything about her daughter or her new relationship. It’s been about a month since we last spoke and within that time I’ve realized that she was the only person I really spoke to. I do prefer to be by myself and not be involved with other people but sometimes I do wish I had someone to hangout with or talk to. Even if it’s just sitting and doing nothing I haven’t felt the company of someone in a while. It is what it is I guess, I figured I get this off my chest here and see what happens. Other then that I really got nothing going on."

lonely,This is excruciating.,"This is excruciating. - All my texts to people get ignored. I've tried to reach out and make friends, but I'm just not likeable. I accepted this years ago. I tried becoming another person for other people, someone similar to myself, but someone they could like- didn't work either. It was all lies, of course, and maybe they saw that, I don't know. I'm so fucking lonely. Haven't had a date in ten years, no one interested in me. I'm not ugly either, but my personality is. Sucks. No friends since high school, I lost those ones too. Ghosted them one day and none of them ever reached out. Never cared, I presume- because I'm garbage. They developed their own lives. I'm happy for them, but still just fucking sucks. 

I've tried changing and I have; in the past few years I've changed so much. I've ridden myself of most of my anxiety, but here I am, with no one. 

I want to die most days. I've resorted to drinking myself to death. Been getting drunk every night for a long while now. I feel random aches and pains all over the place ever since I started, spending my money because I won't need it, tried killing myself once or twice while drunk. Desperate and lonely, I am. Don't know what else there is to do. I've tried therapy. Can't afford meds, I don't have health insurance and the free therapy through my job has run out. I tried changing too, for fuck's sake. Nothing works! I deserved this though. I know I do. 

I just really need some genuine human interaction though, please. I'm fucking begging here."

I cant relate to people. And sadness keeps overwhelming me. I dont know how to get a great job so that I can afford a house and move away and be happy alone.

lonely,What's wrong with me,"What's wrong with me - Hi everyone. I'm wondering if anyone has words of advice or can just relate to my feelings and situation.

I'm a 25 year old woman and I have one close friend who does not live near me. Other than her, I feel very alone. I live with my mom and brother but my family has never been close and I don't feel connected to any relatives. All my friendships and relationships have been co-dependent. I usually have one close friend at a time until it eventually falls apart. I have BPD tendencies and I think this plays a part in why I usually latch on to one friend at a time. 

I've always felt this way, ever since I can remember. I remember being in kindergarten and feeling that all of my friends were closer with each other. I would wonder if they actually considered me friends at all. And those feelings have never changed, I still feel insecure in the one friendship that I do have, because I know she has many other friends whereas she's my only friend.

I've moved around a lot and also struggled with severe mental health issues that have made it difficult to make healthy connections with others... but so have other people, and they still have friends. I have a good life and I'm grateful for all I have, but sometimes I wonder why I ended up this way. Why I wasn't lucky enough to have a close friend group that continued into adulthood. Why I don't have a close family with relatives who I see and talk to."

lonely,im stuck,"im stuck - this whole thing is gonna be huge and basically a general overview of my whole situation and honestly it'd probably be a huge waste of time for anyone on the internet to read, so youve been warned. not even making a throwaway since i dont use reddit that much.

im a 15 yr old highschool boy who is probably at his loneliest point ever. how i got here is such a trainwreck but i hardly feel human anymore. ill give a brief overview of my situation.

it started about a year ago. id been living in an abusive home my whole life, and after my mom divorced my dad it only got worse since he was the source. i have plenty of issues because of the things hes done to me physically and emotionally, and they affect how i deal with people and thus why i am so alone. i dont want to blame him for why im so miserable since it is my fault, but it really has affected how i am.well around a year ago i finally got out of his custody and got some breathing room after a horrible event where i got thrown around and fought back and everything went to court. i still have to see him in family therapy. disclaimer: this isnt a sob story. i dont want pity for what happened to me, i just wanna talk about it at least. im not exactly ""fine"" now but im safe at least.

after i got out of that house i felt pretty confident and secure despite the huge baggage i was carrying and the mental trauma. this all lined up with the start of 10th grade and i got into a relationship. why? idk. i wasnt even looking for one. i just did it to do it. things were going better and so i assumed it would go well. it didnt. firstly, i ignored so many red flags that i even i was smart enough to see. i mean coming from abuse lets you see those personality traits yknow? well it was a horrible time. i got huge attachment issues and my ex was super emotionally abusive to me. i feel like i cant talk about it because it's embarrassing how bad i let myself get beat down by a girl when i was vulnerable. especially cause im a guy. well my ex dumped me when it all got to me and she realized how emotionally unstable i really am. that messed me up for a while. i realize how bad it was now and im thankful i learned, but its really affected how i judge people and relationships. mostly because i went from one abusive lifestyle to another. i felt like i got Stockholm syndrome and ran back to what was familiar. i really dont want to do that again.

so i kinda mooed through life for a while after that. i was sad and confused. i wanted a connection, even if it meant abuse. then my friends left me. all at once. one had a problem with me, and then another. and another. everyone just started disliking me. i probably did something wrong. i cant please everyone forever. but none of them stopped to tell me what was up, or explain it to me. they just left. my best friend id know for almost 10 years? gone. they all talk shit about me and i dont even talk to them anymore. theyre all friends with my ex and they all have girlfriends. at my lowest point, they all left. it destroyed me. it made me bitter and angry. i started working out constantly as an alternative to sh (since my relationship caused me to do that again) and i still do workout. its just more controlled and healthy i guess. it was a lot of anger to process but when it all calmed down i was just alone. everyone that mattered or that i had built a meaningful connection with had thrown it away in pursuit of something else. i have no one. im a total loser at school now and im glad its over. i wouldnt let it all get to me but its finally affecting me deep down.

ive tried to make new friends. i really have. ive done everything i can to not be lonely. my tiktok has grown exponentially because of my videos, i can keep plenty of snapchat streaks, i can get along with just about anyone, but i dont feel connected. everytime i talk to someone i just slowly pull away. i cut off all the connections even when i dont mean to. its like i just forget subconsciously. it wouldn't be hard to make a new friend, but i dont. im alone. and i keep staying that way. its like everyone and everything is nothing but a plot to hurt me. im starved for love or attention and i cant get it from myself because honestly i dont know how to love myself. no one has taught me. i dont have interest in my connection with people anymore. i feel emotionless and cold. its like i cant handle emotion so i ran away from it like a fucking coward. 

and the worst part about this is i feel like im in denial. i still watch those stupid girlfriend audios on youtube to fall asleep or else i just lay awake. i still wish for a genuine connection but im not willing to give up my defenses to have it. its like im waiting for some hero to be the person i finally trust again and want in my life, but no ones that good. i dont want to be hurt again. im constantly fighting against letting my defense down again because once its all gone im just a scared little kid. i dont want people to realize that so ive ran away from everyone that could be my friend and made sure everyone knows to keep their distance. ive doomed myself. i don't even know how to proceed from here. i dont know who id like to start a connection with if i decided i could let my guard down. i cant just wait for it and die cold and sad and alone. everything in my life is in order otherwise. this process of pushing everyone away had made me so much more productive. im reluctant to abandon it. but i dont know if this is what i want anymore. i dont want to be alone anymore. but i dont want to be hurt again. im just stuck."

You actually after awhile of that long and dark road you had to face alone you enjoy being to yourself no bs liars, no backstabbers, no one to judge you, you pick up new hobbies and you actually learn more about yourself if that even makes sense. But hey whatever you’re going through that made you lonely i promise you’re not the only one trust me i learned it the hard way :)"

I also feel lonely because there's this girl I'm friends with, but I'm just so madly in love with her. I want to tell her, but she's talking to someone else and it's serious as far as I can tell. I love talking to her, and I've never had a problem texting and talking to her where pretty much every other girl I know and/or met, whether online or in-person, I've always been nervous because I'm someone who thinks I'm being annoying or bothering them. It sucks knowing that you can't have someone when you're so close with them"

lonely,The bitterness of loneliness,"The bitterness of loneliness - The following is something I wrote on a mental health support website months ago. Since I'm closing my account there, I thought I'd share it here.
-----------------------------------------------------
Today I came across an article where the author explores how difficult it is to make friends over 40. Like many of these articles, the author didn't come to a solution (not that I was hoping for one, either). I'm in my mid-30s, and I found it harder once I turned 30. Online I've seen people in their 20s complain about the same thing: the difficulty of finding friends as an adult.

When someone posted this question on reddit a few months ago, one of the responses I saw was an eye-opener. It explained a lot to me, and other people's input on the subject have confirmed what these one user wrote: most people are now only looking for activity partners. They're looking for someone or people to play a sport with; something casual, temporary, and superficial. Because most people are busy and have established friendships formed during their schooling, I understand now that friendship is not something most people are looking for or even have a desire to maintain. They don't want to hear about your troubles, they don't want to be there for you. People are now just a means to an end, and that end is overcoming boredom.

Years ago I noticed that ghosting was a thing online, and then I realized why. Just as hookup culture has taken precedence over committed relationships, that mentality has shifted to platonic relationships too. People are addicted to new and are easily bored. I've been trying to understand it all, but I'm realizing there is no one cause for this. I believe hyper-individualism and consumerism play big factors in this problem. What are the others? The scourge of positive psychology - which has been a cancer in modern society for the last 20 years - might be another one. It led to toxic positivity: no drama, no toxic people in your life. If you're dealing with hardship or depression, you're a toxic person that needs to be removed from people's lives because you're just bringing them down. See how positive psychology is a problem?

Even though the lockdowns of the past two years gave inflicted on society the sting of loneliness, ultimately society has failed to appreciate how serious a problem this is. I'm not aware of any statistics regarding loneliness, but I estimate in any given Western nation, around 40% of the population is suffering from loneliness. Lonely people are the minority, and clearly an insignificant one at that. Loneliness is not a problem for most people, so this is why I believe this will never be solved - and that is the god-awful inconvenient truth."

I know that probably exists someone that would like me, would like to be with me, but I would have to do something, talk to people, go out. Unfortunately, I know that I won't do that, I feel paralyzed, I'm just watching the days go by. I could do something, but I know I won't, and that is killing me."

lonely,To embrace lady loneliness,"To embrace lady loneliness - I accept it. I want friends to call out my name in real life, but no such thing has happened. Have I tried? Yes, I can proudly (and also lame) say I have put up a fight to get rid of this loneliness, but I guess there are people who just fade in the background, there is a scenary for some reason, for those who shine and those who just need a space.

It is okay, no longer will I seek desperately to fit in...when I have never properly felt like I have. Lady loneliness is always there, in the end, always her. Friends? Who cares, I care, but this is it. If everyone has someone, I will just tear up and suck it up, just continue I guess."
lonely,So sad.,"So sad. - Well I feel so lonely again, this girl I’ve been talking to for like a year and got pretty close with got a boyfriend and completely cut ties with me. I’ll give you guys some backstory, I’ve been talking to this girl for about a year or 2 and we’ve been on and off, she’s admitted to liking me and I admitted it to her too. We dated for a bit for a few months got into a big fight and just decided to be friends. We stopped talking for a while and finally got back in touch, she was all flirty and everything with me still, not gonna lie I liked it we’d FaceTime every night talk all the time text and even sometimes get lunch together. She recently started acting so bland and so off with me. I asked her what was up and she said she was stressed because of finals and she was sorry. This went on for a while until we really talked about it, she told me the same thing and said that she needs space. I agreed with it and next thing you know she blocked me on Snapchat and won’t talk to me. Of course that tore me apart but I was gonna let her have her space, I checked her Instagram and I found out she has a boyfriend now. This broke me not gonna lie, she was just recently talking about trying things again then this happens.  I’m truly in pain and don’t know how to cope with it."
lonely,today I realized how socially awkward I am,"today I realized how socially awkward I am - My cousin hosted a bbq and invited me and some other people. Little did I know those other people would be his entire friend group. I know his friends because many of them attend church with me. But for the 3 hours I was there I was sitting in silence only occasionally greeting people or talking for a brief few seconds. I felt so awkward with myself and was just hanging out with the dog. Anytime somebody else tried to spark a convo, I would give such a bland answer to the point where they walk away once I talk. This isn't the only this happens, any time I try to talk to people besides my close close friends I have these weird feelings and would say the most ridiculous things. I rlly need help. I thought it was my body cuz I'm tall but i'm quite big. I'm trying so hard to lose weight bcuz I feel like that's where all my problems are starting."

lonely,Tired of my 'friends',"Tired of my 'friends' - Just needed to do some venting about things going on lately. Quite a long post, but I just need to get it off my chest.

I only have about four 'friends' currently, only online friends.  All of them, aside from one, I've known for a minimum of three years. Two of them I've known for closer to maybe six.  I used to be super close with all of them, at one point. We would play games together constantly, always be in voice chat, all that good stuff. Things were good. I love my friends, even if they're people I've never met in real life. So I always made sure they knew I was there if they ever needed anything at all throughout those years. And boy was I there. All of them would constantly vent to me or come looking for advice about something. I didn't mind. I love being there for anyone and everyone, offering a shoulder to lean on or just someone to listen. I guess perhaps I wasn't paying as much attention throughout the years, or I just didn't need to vent to them myself often, fearing I would just be bothering them. But lately I've noticed just how much they aren't there for me.

The past eight months have been fairly rough for me. Up until a month or two ago, I didn't say much of anything to anyone. Nobody checked up on me, either. One or two messaged every few weeks. But only to vent to me or talk about themselves, never to ask why I suddenly dropped off the face of the Earth. Despite not really feeling like I could handle their problems on top of my own, I always replied. I was always there because I cared and wanted to help them. When I started talking more to them again, I was desperately reaching out for someone. Anyone. I really needed someone to be there for me, as I had done for them time and time again. But none of them seemed to care. They didn't take notice of me suddenly messaging them ten times more than I ever have in the past, trying to start any conversation with them. Sometimes I'd get an answer, sometimes they'd just not respond to my message period.

Now, I understand people get busy with life. They can't always reply. However, it would be literal weeks to months with no answer. Funny thing is, though, I'd see them online still constantly. I'd even see one in particular sitting in voice chats with his other friends for up to nine hours a day, every single day for a week straight. I know for a fact that three of them have no job. The same three don't attend any sort of school. The same three hardly ever leave the house. So just how busy can one get in those circumstances? Feels much more like they're just ignoring me purposefully. None of them ever message first. Always me. When I do get an answer, I hardly get more than two word replies. Then five minutes later they just suddenly stop replying and never reply again until the next time I message.

I've really needed someone to vent to, especially the past month here. But none of them were ever there for me. They just slammed the door in my face. Only one even knows what has been happening with me lately. Because they don't ask. They don't give me a chance to talk about myself. They always jump straight into talking about themselves and complaining about every little thing going wrong for them. The one friend only knows because I got tired of being ignored and just straight up told her one day. They have no problem coming to me and sitting and messaging for five hours straight, with three paragraphs in each reply. When they need me. When I need them? Sorry, can't sit and chat for more than five minutes or give more than four word max replies. I'm not looking for a novel of a reply. But I want to be given more than just ""Dang that sucks, sorry"" or ""You'll get through it."" 

None even reassure me that they'll always be there for me lately, either. The one friend that knows pretty much only told me she knows I'll be able to get through it, then proceeded to start talking about herself. Then stopped replying altogether four minutes later. I had actually finally brought up how I was feeling about them not replying to two of them. One said I was right, she's sorry, she won't do it again. She was back at it again a week later. The other also agreed and apologized. That's about it. I told one of the same two about it again recently, how nothing had changed. He ended up getting pissy with me, complaining about his own problems, blaming me, then essentially saying he wouldn't care if I was alive or not. He even told me that he knows how I feel, and feels the same way with his friends? If you truly do, then why are you turning around and doing that same shit to someone else, knowing how awful it feels? This is also the one that was constantly talking with other friends in voice chat. Guess he liked those friends more, despite always complaining about them to me.

I'll try and wrap up this incredibly long post now. I'm just so sick and tired of this all. Of feeling like my apparent 'friends' only ever message when they need something from me. Of feeling like they don't care about me, and never did. I've pretty much given up on messaging most of them whatsoever at this point. Not that they ever message to begin with, so there isn't much of a choice there. I tell myself that I'm done with all of them. But I worry that I may just end up going back to them, should they ever actually message again. I don't know if having absolutely no one is better than this or not."
lonely,This has probably been asked a million times now but....,"This has probably been asked a million times now but.... - .....how does one deal with the constant reminders of how alone you feel? I'm on the up with my photography and life, I have no problems talking with women but over and over. It goes nowhere and no girl looks at me twice anymore. Not been laid for over a year either. Annoying since I hear alot how great I am. Also I still change the subject right away any time anyone compliments me lol.

Just a random thought post"
lonely,Just another self-indulgent post.,"Just another self-indulgent post. - I've been alone for a long time now, and most of the time I think that's fine.  I mean, I'm lonely, but I don't think that getting involved in a relationship is the right thing for me at this time.  Plus I don't have anyone in my life that I have romantic feelings for, or who has those feelings for me, so it doesn't matter at this point.

Nevertheless, there are things about being in a relationship that I long for, even knowing that I'm not prepared to strive toward them.  After all, I can long for things that I can never have, can't I?  I can long for things that aren't good for me, or wise.  I can long for things that I once had but will never be the same.  Being within my reach is not a prerequisite for longing.

I want to be able to make a woman feel comfortable and safe.  Not protect her, necessarily; I don't expect her to be helpless.  I only want to give her a space where she can feel at ease, be herself, not have to have her guard up constantly.  I can offer her comfort when she's stressed, in whatever form pleases her.  Back rubs, playing with her hair, making a drink, alone time, a simple hug or a snuggle session with the TV on.

Honestly, there's not much more to it than that.  I'd like to sing to her if she doesn't mind my singing.  Of course I'd appreciate the same kind of consideration when I'm in need of comfort.  But then I start to get into the varying needs and expectations of people in a relationship, and that's not really the point.  I'm not in a relationship or trying to be.  It's only that I miss being able to offer that place of peace and safety, nearly every day.  I do what I can to bring that to the people around me, to make the world a brighter place.  But there's very little one can do for strangers in that department, and my longing goes unfulfilled.

So it goes."
lonely,I feel guilty for feeling lonely,"I feel guilty for feeling lonely - I know that being lonely doesn’t have to mean to be alone, but I still don’t think I have the right to feel the way I feel. I have a rather big social circle and some close friends. On the romantic side I have actually been alone all my life but I wouldn’t say that this is the reason for my “loneliness”. I just feel like the side character of everyone’s life. Like people do actually enjoy my company but wouldn’t really care if I wasn’t there. Anyways I don’t know what I am trying to say.

I reached the pinnacle of whatever...there's no fucking drive. Nothing propelling me to go forward than living not to die. Annnnd I'm tired of that. I don't want to be here if this is all that's left.....BUT I CANT KILL MYSELF SO IM STUCK HERE AHHHHHHHHH.....AHHHHHHHH haha heh...heh heh ehhhhhhhhhhhhh...they're so lucky, the people who don't have to be here...I can't get used to it.

at least then the loneliness will be a choice and one where i know i will wake up lonely and not wake up and see if my friends can be bothered to pretend to like me at least. where my fwb doesn’t have to pretend she’s attracted to me. where i don’t have my colleagues pretend i’m tolerable and normal.

There is something comforting about all of us, very different people, sharing time together and supporting each other until we are out, finding humor in all of it. My roommates were all nice and interesting in their own way. I miss them.

I think it's similar to what people experience in prison or in the military, meeting people through that. In the hospital I was just like everyone, just another patient. We were all treated the same no matter our backgrounds, no matter what we did or still do. For the first time in forever I felt like I belonged, felt like I was a part of something. It all helped me not to think about the fact I won't even have anyone to call when I return home."

lonely,Watching her slip away,Watching her slip away - I am a 44 year old husband. My wife has a chronic muscle disease. It takes its toll. She sleeps a lot. She’s in pain. I get that. I watch her daily slip a little further away. Her mind is still good but physically she is going. I work 12 to 16 hour shifts and come home to her usually asleep or just checked out. I check her breathing and make sure she’s still with me. Then I go find something to eat. Check on my daughter who has a budding social life then watch tv alone until I fall asleep. Then back to work. I feel completely alone. I miss my wife. I miss our conversations and our fun adventurous shenanigans. I’m trying to stay up and solid. But every day I feel a little more alone. A little more isolated. A little more empty. I’ve never said these things out loud. I’ve never even considered giving it a voice. But today just seems abnormally lonely. Any way. Thanks for reading.

lonely,"I am so broken at this point, I don't think I can carry on any longer","I am so broken at this point, I don't think I can carry on any longer - I am that chubby disgusting, awful nerd people go away from in sitcoms. As a child I had very different interests- recreational math, science, movies- to the point of reading up multiple critics. I hated sports. I naturally became segregated from other children my age. I was always good at studies so that kind of pushed other children away from me because I was a bore. 

In my teenage I overheard my parents talking about how I look below average but since I am good at bookish stuff, I would probably do okay in life. It didn't come as a shock or anything to be honest. I knew how I looked so it made sense. Even in groups, I always used to make self deprecating jokes. Coz that's all I could think of. Anytime I hear somebody laughing, my first instinct was to check if something is wrong with me. Maybe I spilled something without me knowing or maybe they're laughing about how big of a loser I am. If I could go near them, maybe I could hear. Some girls made fun of me in front of me, some behind my back, some made fun of my masculinity. I never replied back because honestly deep down I know what they're making fun of is true.

Next came college. People are a bit mature here so they don't degrade you in front of you. I also made some friends. There was this guy who I clicked with since we shared a lot of common morals. I used to good academically and so did he. We quickly became great friends. We would be together a lot of times but people would talk to him / ask him about theirs doubts more often even though I was right there. One thing I am good at is studies so a lot of times it would so happen that he would be stuck, he would check with me and then I would tell other people how to do X or Y. This always used to be the case without any exception. He would tell me it could be because they're intimidated by me.

Then the sophomore year I made a girl friend (the space is intentional). Like every other girl I developed a crush on her. I knew it was never going to amount to anything but the more I talked to her the more I felt I found my only hope. She was ambitious and most importantly the only person who saw something interesting in me- beyond being smart at bookish stuff. She told me how mature and thoughtful I am and how she likes talking to me and sharing about her life with me. For the first time in my life- I thought no, I deserve love too. 

I decided to work on myself physically- I lost 10 kilos in 7 months that year and now look like an average joe- except for my disgusting face. After 2 years of knowing her, I asked her out. Her exact reply was ""it isn't black or white"" and it ended there. About 5 months ago, the guy friend told me how he developed feelings for her and if it would be okay if he asked her out. They got together. When I asked her about what she told me when I asked her out she said, ""Really sorry I wasn't completely honest- I was really scared of losing you since I have never heard of somebody being friends after something like that.""

The guy friend I mentioned also wants to talk to me frequently. All I can think of is how lucky he is. His father is well settled. He has gone out of country frequently and has visited a lot of places. Me on the other hand have literally seen only 3 different cities- my hometown, my parents' hometown and a family trip we made with our extended family. 

The thing is my family has never done great financially. I am grateful we had a roof over our head but I have seen my Mom lie to the milkman about how ""we need to go to the ATM since there's no cash at home so she would pay next time he's around"". There was no money in the account also since Dad was running behind on one of his paychecks. Mom always switched between only 2 of her good clothes and wore patched clothes in the house- stuff like that. Dad would always work hard so he could pay for my tuition. 

Luckily I graduated last year and joined a big N company as a software developer. Things are good now. However my mom recently told me that Dad has been on medication for depression for over a decade now since he was always worried about his family's future. She told me she's telling me this now since he's no longer worried about me so the doctor has adjusted the dosage quite a bit. It was almost as if I can never escape this cycle of misery.

I find some solace in seeing how happy my parents are. How I can now buy them stuff they couldn't afford earlier. I feel like I need to make more and more out of my career and that's the only thing I can do in my life. My worth is tied to how much money I make. I have interviews for other big companies lined up next month. I feel guilty about sleeping since I so much to prepare for. I don't know what I would if I failed because if I can't be the good at even this one thing, my existence is worthless. Dad having to take pills, mom making ends meet was all for nothing.

I talk about finance because honestly it shows- he dresses sharper than me naturally. I never owned more than 5 pairs of clothes until recently. Money brings along with it a kind of confidence nothing else does. He has more stories to share about places he visited, restaurants he tried, stuff he bought etc etc. Stuff that makes you interesting. I am a dud.

I told myself I can be friends with her for 5 months. Every single day has been miserable than previous. I recently told her I need some space from her. She replied, ""Yeah you don't have to explain yourself. You think I don't know how you feel but I do. I have only a few people in my life so don't wanna lose those I feel would be there forever. I am okay with some space between us but just don't go away...""

I am broken- more broken than I was before. I can no longer carry on. All the stuff I joked about myself- they were true. Nobody's going to look at me twice. I don't deserve to have a companion, period. My only worth is earning money because I can never be good at anything else. Me being good at that one thing is also doubtful. If I am not good at that either, does that mean my life is useless and I was an unnecessary burden for my parents and they would have been better off without me?"

lonely,ive never been this lonely,"ive never been this lonely - i don't even have anyone to talk to at all. let alone friends. im completely hopeless. every day gets worse and worse. i am not dead yet because i have nothing to kill myself with. the pain is immeasurable and i barely have the strenght to breathe anymore. i get banned after 4 hours from reddit on each account because i told someone to fuck off after they were rude to me. since then its been like this, perm banned. so now i dont even have this platform to communicate to people on. i have nothing and no one. i am nothing. i wish to die the second i wake up until i fall asleep. all i imagine is scenarios of me killing myself even if it's not possible. i am forced to live on this horrible planet. i dont want this anymore. i wish at least one person was ever nice to me. but everyone is a monster who are hostile towards me, steals from me, gossip about me, ignore me or treat me like trash. i dont deserve this. i have always been nice to people, but it didnt matter. all i want is to be 18 already and save up money for a trip to a country with really tall buildings, pretend i want to get selfies, go on the top and jump. or go to the us and get a shotgun. i deserve to die and finally be at peace. it'smy ultimate dream. i just want this to be seen by people because i want the world to know i exist and yea"
lonely,Endless potential of love,"Endless potential of love - Hi guys! I () have been struggling with depression and anxiety for around 1.5 years. Thankfully, I was able to trust some of my friends about it, so for a year, some of them made it not so terrible. I am also attending therapy for 9 months now, but it doesn't seem like it's working.

After all that, in the past few weeks, I have been experiencing something which I never wanted to. Some of my friends are slowly leaving me. One of those friends, I once actually viewed as my best friend in the school I'm currently in. She listened to me, hugged me, and said that she loves me. Now, none of this happens and while I can see what my problems are, I really don't want to stop talking with anybody I was this close to. Today, I gave this girl an opportunity to leave me by messaging him and telling him some of my thoughts.

Even though I'm somewhat prepared for her leaving me, I still want to have somebody I can connect to this much again. I don't want to be in a relationship in this mental state, but some love would make me better. Also, I'm thinking about girls, since I'm heterosexual and kinda feel weird when boys hug me (however, knowing how much I need a hug, I don't reject anybody who's a decent person). I also want her not to have a boyfriend (how ironic) and to have truly endless patience for me. These are the conditions in which I imagine a kind of love without boundaries, while staying out of a relationship. I wouldn't tell those conditions to anybody in person, but these are my thoughts. I still have 2 woman friends hugging me, but one of them has a boyfriend and the other doesn't have endless patience for me (only hugs me on special occasions, sometimes looks weird at me when I talk about my feelings). I may well be a bit selfish, but my sense of security is currently expected to take a huge blow.

I have one woman in mind, however I rarely talk to her, but she seems nice and also looks like somebody who is not afraid of physical touch. She is currently my best chance if I think correctly. I go to a top-level high school in Hungary, so most of the students are genuinely smart and around 95% of them continue to university. Judging by this, I think that when you're surrounded by smart people, their emotional intelligence should be top notch aswell. Do you think that I can get a chance in the coming weeks or months to have a closer connection with somebody like this? If not, then what do you think I should do?

I hope it wasn't just unnecessary venting and I can get real answers. People telling me that they're backing me would be f*ing great, but what I need the most are some advices on this situation.

Thank you for your answers!!!"

lonely,"The lockdowns might have long term negative effects on our social skills, here are my ideas to fix it","The lockdowns might have long term negative effects on our social skills, here are my ideas to fix it - Since I started working fully remote last year, I haven’t met too many new people, and I live alone. So without my knowing it, I’ve begun to take on the lifestyle of a hermit for most of each week.

The pandemic caused us all to spend more time in front of screens than ever, and that might cause many more people to deal with loneliness.

**Here’s what I’ve learned (so far):**

1. Just getting outside on a consistent basis to walk around, visit a cafe, or read in the park has helped me to warm up to being around strangers.

2. Rushing into going out to large gatherings has caused me to feel really uncomfortable.

3. I tend to lie down and watch Youtube videos for way too long. I feel like this will be hurtful longterm, since at times this almost feels like turning your brain off and absorbing whatever the algorithm serves you.

Have any of these worked for you? Any other ideas I should add? I can’t be the only one who feels this way.

I tried walking outside for a minute today and it was an epic fail because it was so hard to breathe. I also have asthma that is making this worse.

lonely,I'm convinced I will never have a connection with anyone.,"I'm convinced I will never have a connection with anyone. - I have never posted on Reddit before despite having my account on here for a while, so please bear with me. 

I am dissatisfied with my life. I have a handful of friends, sure, but I'm convinced my connection with them is weak. They all seem to have someone they connect with better than me, every time I hear about a friend's best friend or significant other, it gets my mood down and my stomach hurts. I don't know why I feel this way.

It seems that everyone around me, everyone I see, has someone they're crazy in love with, whether platonically or romantically. I make fun of it all the time. But the truth is, I'm lonely. It depresses me that I will never have the connection that people have.

It's not like it's easy for me to make friends with people either. I am very shy and socially awkward (perhaps even socially anxious), and even when I do make friendships, I struggle to maintain them. I put up emotional walls yet care too much, push people away unintentionally yet desire for someone to care, and I suppose that turns people off. It confuses me how normal people can do that and I cannot. I feel so alien, so...not normal. What if I never belonged here on this earth?

I guess that's enough of my story. I hope there's someone out there that feels the same as me. I don't like being so alone."

We had to memorize 24 individual slides compared to the 5 we had last semester. Didn’t study hard enough and couldn’t write anything down. If I don’t pass this exam at the recovery session this summer I’ll be forced to be held back and repeat the whole year. Already got 2 to recover from the last year so it’s kinda stressful 

Got home and slept for 3 hours, still feel pretty bad about it but it’s okay. I’ve taken so many things for granted and frankly today was an eye-opener for me to take things more seriously. I really hope I’ll make the best out of the second chance I get this summer."

I just got my Computer Science degree this month. But I still have a question, which I do not understand. People said life is meaningful. I didn't have parents. I didn't have anyone understand me when I grew up. During these years, I barely finished this degree with my sadness, emptiness, and loneliness. 

When people see you are not a person who has many friends, they won't talk to you because they think a successful person will help them success. Thus, I went to church, and they all said I was a bad person because I wasn't successful in school. 

I had no family member at all during grew up and after, and no one understands my feeling, loneliness, and emptiness. Everyone in school or outside of the school was kind of like the one who want to be rich and successful. They just want to stay away from me to avoid the ""problem"". I have been thinking about I should change myself to have more friends, so my grade will be better. That didn't work, and everyone, including students, club members, and club professors, and teachers treated me as a problem because they always see my sad and lonely face.

&amp;#x200B;

 In the end, I dropped out of college and wanted to learn codes to get a job. After I found out I love coding, I switch my degree to be CS and went back to the college and finished my degree. I say nothing was changed. I was still alone.

I just want to ask. How can someone, like me, who grew up and live alone altogether and still live in normal life? No one liked me because they saw my loneliness, emptiness, and sadness, and they never understand me."

lonely,i just wish I had something to offer,"i just wish I had something to offer - I'm not even fishing for compliments either, the reason I'm posting this to reddit is that yous don't know me and so couldn't give a genuine compliment even if you wanted to. 
 
But it's so shameful that I literally offer no motivation for anyone to spend time with me, I feel like it is immediately obvious to people too as if it were on display, which would explain why people don't even try to get to know me. Like I don't even get a chance. And this year it's even happening with psychotherapists too: I can't even pay people to talk to me for one hour a week. 
 
I find myself getting incredibly jealous of how many guys I come across (e.g. on apps) who immediately have so many things going for them: stunning good looks (with a great jawline AND a strong beard), being well hung, being charismatic, and then whatever other things you might find out about them. 
 
I just wish I could offer one of those things: being nice to look at, or sexual prowess, or being someone whose presence lifts people's spirits. Some of these things are better than others but any one of them is better than none. Even if I were just a big pleasure stick, hey, at least I would be able to give people pleasure and have some amount of company. 
 
But nah, I have a weak jawline and a patchy beard so I can't even hide it, am sexually subpar to say the least, socially awkward and a depressing person to be around.

lonely,dream,"dream - I don't remember much because I'm writing this out a month after. here goes

it started off with me being bullied by a girl. after awhile, we started fighting, physically. like brawling. it took place weirdly at my primary school, specifically the small field next to one of the girl's bathrooms. I ended up accidentally killing her because she was choking me to death and I had to do something about it. I was breaking down, I really didn't know what to do. then, a guy came. apparently he saw what happened. he really didn't say much, probably said nothing if i recall correctly and he helped me. for some reason we hid the body in a couch lol.

anyhow, after that we rested somewhere abit and we realised the girl came back to haunt me as a vengeful spirit. me and him were kinda hungry so we went to buy food at some random stall. he was sitting on a stool and i was buying the food. i realised she was there in my peripheral and he got a glimpse of her, i had a feeling he was getting uncomfortable. for some reason it prompted me to shield his view from her. so i stood infront of him and crouched saying ""are you okay?"" he then quickly stood up and walked away whilst saying ""you always do this huh?"" 

we got in his car and we drove for awhile. it was quiet but I enjoyed his presence, it felt comfortable. he drove somewhere to get an exorcism done on me. before getting out of the car he handed me something, to protect me during the exorcism then yadda yadda

the dream itself is not that important, it's just for context but I really liked the dream. I don't know, it felt nice eventhough he was cold and quiet. I guess it reflected abit of what I want. I want someone that could help and protect me even when I messed up or feel helpless. because I've always been that figure in everybody else's lives. I don't really react much to bad situations so I'm often the only one calm and collected. if somebody messes up I'd be the one to clean their mess up then help them get back up on their feet. I guess I really just want a figure like that in my life aswell."

lonely,Rant.. Dislike liking anyone..,"Rant.. Dislike liking anyone.. - I assume lots of people feel this way..

I don't like liking or getting close to people, especially online..
because whenever that happens I would get very anxious,
when waiting for their reply, and I would only think the person doesn't want to talk to me anymore, when I don't receive a reply within the time the person usually replies..
I what constantly wonder what the person is doing..
And when we drift apart, which happens often online, I would get emotionally down, and that affects my real life.. 

However, at the same time I wish to have a close friend I can connect and talk to frequently... I know it's contradicting... I guess I'm just hoping for someone that would never disappear... But sadly it seems impossible online... :("

lonely,I don’t know if posts about feeling lonely around people are accepted here but…I feel lonely with her,"I don’t know if posts about feeling lonely around people are accepted here but…I feel lonely with her - There’s only a few people it’s acceptable to show emotion around. Your mother or the person you are in a relationship with. Otherwise, I have to bottle it up as to appear strong and masculine. Crying in front of other guys is a ticket to being gay, and in front of women shows weakness. I have an emotionless mother, so that only leaves opportunity from a partner

I’m 20 and only just asked for a girls number for the very first time a month ago. I knew that because this was my first that I’d become attached very easily. I’m attached and she doesn’t know it. I would never put that on her, nor do I want to portray all the emotions I’m supposed to hide. I’ll hide the fact that I want affection. I’ll pretend that I don’t need to be told I’m handsome, funny, or smart. I’ll sit emotionless just because I like to be around her.

We’ve been on two dates and I enjoy the fact that she initiates a hug at the end of them as I’ve never gotten that before. I’m excited for the day I get to hold her hand, but I won’t show that I’m needy or desperate for it. I want to love and be loved.

I thought that maybe she wanted to hold my hand at certain points during our last date. I felt semi bad for hiding my emotion as much as I had, so I thought to text her about it. I don’t know if I had worded it poorly or just came off more serious than I intended. I texted her, “I don’t think I’ve really shown you affection on our dates, but I want to change that. I would like to ask you to go to the movies once again, but also ask to hold your hand.”

I’ve been mistaken to show emotion. She replied that she would like to go out, but she isn’t looking for anything serious right now. I only feel bad that I’m afraid I made her uncomfortable for asking to hold her hand. However, I’ll sit emotionless just so I can get to hold her hand one day.

TL;DR:As a guy, I feel like I have to hide my emotion in this world, but can’t await the day I get to show it. I will patiently await love. I’m afraid that showing emotion ruined my chances with this girl."

I’m a lonely 22-year old (lesbian) woman, and no one I’ve met understands my romantic loneliness. They always tell me to “just keep busy”. Additionally, they don’t understand that friendship is different from romance and not a replacement. When I listen to podcasts about being single, they always talk about it as if it’s a “break” in an otherwise romantic life, but for me it’s been my whole life so that kind of advice just makes me feel even worse. I’ve tried everything and I’ll keep trying, but it’s exhausting. Is anyone else a perpetual single?

Hello/ Salut/ ادب/ היי/ أهلاً

Chintu : Hmm so you need friends, or have shitty friends then you have come to the right place, order your new friend now and get 5 years of luck for free. Now my partner mintu will tell about the friend you are gonna get 

Mintu: well so the friend you are gonna get is 17 years old and it's name is Humai. Well he's funny ( maybe not )

He likes to learn languages, well he knows Hindi and Urdu but he wanna start reading novels and it's hard, like really compared to English. He will start off with some short stories and all. He started learning Norwegian, French and Farsi, a Lil bit off dutch too. تم دیوانے ہے اور کچھ نہیں یارو( it's not farsi, it's urdu ) 

You can rant about anything, he can listen to it and give shitty advice 

Well he share lame memes tooo

He likes to talk about religions even though he knows lil about religions. Basically, he knows about abrahamic faiths more compared to other religions

He is preparing for the SAT and might prepare for APs like self study, if you have advice on college, majors and stuff help this poor guy. He's 17 and still has no idea what he wants to be 

He likes to do origami, Sketching he recently started doing both of them. So, he sucks a lot in it. I wanna have some more cool hobbies. Suggest some hobbies for me 

He might learn to cook as well, it's cool tbh, well he wants to move to usa. So, just wanted to be independent I guess but is not independent. Every thing is done by his mum from washing clothes to cooking

He reads novels, he tried reading Hindi and Urdu novels but heck it's hard, I think he might wanna improve it or start off reading something simple before moving on to something complex. He did read some English novels though. He has started a lil time ago. So, he didn't read many. He will be having holidays. So, he will be on a reading spree. You can suggest some 

He likes to listen songs and podcasts, his taste is real stupid, it goes from pop to classic in no time. He listend hindi-urdu, punjabi, farsi, hebrew songs a lot 

He likes to watch movies and series. So suggest some, rn i am watching 2 broke girls and American dad ( he even forgot the name) 

Well if you found him interesting then message him"

this guy was totally different than anyone else. he was supremely understanding, compassionate, and supportive. it felt like he was writing over my past traumas with love and kindness. for the first time in my life, i had felt unshakeable hope. he kissed another girl but i forgave him instantly because i desperately wanted him. i got on anti-depressants, started running, journaling, practicing my coding skills and more just so i could be happier for him. a better partner for him. and now it's over, because he says we're just not compatible. i'd never met anyone like him, so to hear that from him felt like the final blow, like a message that i'm really not compatible with anyone. my self esteem is shit rn. i want to die. i feel abandoned and genuinely have no one to talk to about this. i just want to sit here and cry forever."

She's one of two people I've met on apps, or anywhere tbh, that's been able to hold a conversation with me long enough to see it going somewhere. She's the *only* one I've enjoyed talking to so much and connected with on such a deep level. Instant connection, mutually expressed. 

Neither of us kept it secret we like each other, at risk of sounding like a schoolgirl, a lot. Talked about some deep shit, acted all cute, and I want(ed?) so bad to call her my gf already but wanted to voice/video chat to get to know her on a more personal level before jumping that gun. 

She readily agreed to doing stuff over vc... Then went MIA for hours until like 4am with a pretty good excuse about why she disappeared. Cool, we agree to try again the next day. Again, for hours leading up to and afterwards she's radio silent. Messages later saying she'd slept a long time after smoking weed and that it knocks her out. Alright, shit happens. But tonight we had plans for a third attempt and once again she was nowhere to b e found. Haven't heard from her this time yet as to why but I'm pretty upset at this point.

I'd be led to simply think she isn't interested, but she had been love bombing me all the other times. I'd be led to think she's a catfish and that's why she won't vc, but her pics didn't turn up anything in reverse search and everything about her seems so legit and her personality/interests/life story etc too elaborate for me to really think it's made up. So what am I missing?

And why does it hurt so goddamn much?"

lonely,"22F no dating, relationships, never been with a single person or have been asked out","22F no dating, relationships, never been with a single person or have been asked out - it’s very bizarre scrolling through social media and seeing people get married or have close relationships. people posting about dating and posting constantly about their significant other. i’ve never even had a solid friendship with someone growing up. i’m about to graduate college soon and never had any friends in college or high school for that matter. it’s almost strange because i don’t necessarily desire it.... although sometimes i do. the experience of having a best friend or significant other seems so foreign to me and i look at other people’s relationships and wonder what that would be like. what do you talk about? how does one even start to date or ask one out? how does that work? what is emotional intimacy? what is physical intimacy? i feel so confused and lost about how people even get to these stages of asking someone out and then bonding for a long period of time. I’ve probably had like 2 people ask me out in my life. people i didn’t know though. it’s difficult for me to have friendships or have a relationship because i have always felt very detached from other people. i just haven’t been able to form a serious connection with another person. i feel out of place. I’ve been told multiple times in my life by family and strangers that i am more beautifully physically compared to other girls. i don’t really believe it though and don’t think guys are that interested in me because i’m ugly. really sucks any ounce of confidence from me.

Around this time 3 years ago was the last time I felt like my life wasn’t in shambles. 2 years ago I had a falling out with my mom, and she gave the one sided story to the rest of the family, leaving me not able to defend myself. The whole thing was basically about how controlling she was and about how she would go extreme lengths to find things to yell at me about. May be cliche, but that kickstarted severe anxiety and trust issues in me because my relationship hasn’t been and likely won’t be the same. 

During this time I had been having issues with school, the administrators spam sent my parents emails saying I was at risk of not graduating, and they’d change the reason every email, attendance, grades, all the way up to the day before my graduation where they emailed saying I had an “outstanding debt”
 (it was 6 fucking dollars from an ID card they forced students to buy like 2 years prior)

I had to fight to prove that I wasn’t slacking off in class, against a “buggy administration email” (their words) and it was harder because we were in lockdown so things like attendance and due dates couldn’t be proven physically.

On top of that I was severely overweight, had a very low self esteem because of years of being called autistic (I’m not) by my classmates. My girlfriend (I’ll call C) at the time was way out of my league, which many guys were also mad about so they’d bully me and flirt with her. She was loyal, and so kind. She helped me through my moms shit and my dog passing away. We had been best friends for years and I had helped her through a few toxic relationships. For a time she was all I had, but even she and I had problems. We were both hard headed, super anxious, and loved being right. It was those reasons we eventually after 2 1/2 years of being together broke up, but still stayed very close friends. 

After our breakup I wanted to focus on bettering myself. It was really hard at first but with C still supporting me, and some unhealthy dieting practices I managed to lose 110lbs and gain a bit of confidence in myself. 

I had also gotten a job that I loved, and was dead set on changing into someone who everyone didn’t hate. At work I was respected by my peers, and was looked to for guidance by almost everyone. I had even met a girl who was an actress in some Amazon shows, and she helped me get into a few shows myself (mostly doing BG). She and I became friends almost immediately after seeing each other for the first time, and eventually started dating. Sounds great right? Having been relatively miserable for the previous few years I thought I was finally experiencing happiness. 

Over time I noticed at work, the General manager would promote people who didn’t deserve it at all, and ignore those who did. I liked my position as a trainer, and didn’t want a managerial position. I just wanted to travel to new opening locations and teach other people on how to use the machines, how to cook the food, ect. The manager of my store promised me that he would make that happen, all I had to do was go through a training phase myself and in a few months they’d disbatch me whenever a new location came about. 4 months into this “training” (which was 50% doing the bitch work nobody else wanted to do and 50% coming in on days I wouldn’t be available or canceling other plans to come in), a kitchen manager slipped up and told me that you can’t be a traveling trainer till you’re 21. (I was 19). I was basically just used as a bitch and got paid less than everyone else to do it. They held the traveling trainer position over my head to keep me there doing it. I quit that day.

I started focusing on the new found passion for acting and film, and started hanging out with the girl (who we’ll call E). I met all her friends, went to different sets with her, and over time she became a big part of my life and I, hers. But 3 months into dating at a Christmas party she got very drunk and cheated on me, while I was standing 5 feet away. In front of a whole room of our closest friends. It was absolutely humiliating. So many people commented asking if I was okay with it, which obviously I wasn’t. We broke up the next day, and she went on to emotionally manipulate another guy in our group who liked her. She’d lead him on with date ideas and when he’d ask she’d say she still likes me. I tried to stay friends with her but after I found out she was talking shit about me to our friends I lost it. And with her I lost my acting friends, cause they had known E for years longer and anything she told them had more merit than anything I had to say. They also just weren’t interested in talking to me anymore, which to each their own but damn it hurt. The acting work also got significantly more dry with all my connections having just left. So I had to get another job as a fry cook that I absolutely despise. I’m fucked around with by everyone else because they’ve been there longer, and yes I know the difference between friendly banter and genuine hatred. I knew both very well.

But once again, C was there to help me through it. Months of bad decisions and substance abuse later brings us to May 6th. Since the thing with E, C and I had gotten a lot closer again and my feelings for her grew back. I loved her just as much as I did when we first started dating. We both grew as people in a few years and a lot of the problems we once had just weren’t an issue anymore. We realized it was all just us being childish. May 6th was the day we were going to hang out for her birthday. I canceled a Film I was going to do in another state to stay. I was gonna ask her out again that day. But she canceled on me, she already had plans with her parents. Which is completely fine. But after that she stopped talking to me as much. Got distant. Stopped hanging out altogether. One night it became too much and I got mad and we fought about her distance. I had my suspicions but she finally confirmed that she had been blowing me off because she’d been living with her new boyfriend since her birthday.

I shut down after that. Days of doing nothing but staring at walls, hoping anything would bring my life to an end without me having to do it myself. Until C texted me again last Saturday. She told me she thought about what I had said in our argument, she had broken up with her boyfriend, and that she wanted me to come to her parents house where she previously lived cause she felt terrible. Now I felt terrible because I didn’t want to be the cause of her being unhappy. I stayed the night and at one point she said she needed to go back to his house to get some things and that I could come wait in the car. I did and everything went fine, we got back watched some movies until we fell asleep in each other’s arms. I finally thought I had a chance to show her that I can still be a good boyfriend, and that we could be happy together again. 4 days later on my way home from the store I see her car in front, at like 11PM. I messaged her just asking how her day was, trying to act like I didn’t know what was up. It’s been 3 days with no response. I’ve known her for 6 years. Been through hell with her, and now that she was the only thing in my life worth living for, she’s gone

My moms family, gone
My dads family, doesn’t invite me to things (and I’ve asked)
E’s gone
My friends from my first job, gone
My acting friends and connections, gone
My motivation, gone

That’s not even mentioning all the minor shit that’s happened in the past 3 years, car accidents, medical issues, many fights.

I got in a slump, I stopped catering to her every need and started to focus on the chill stuff like watching movies together. We had a argument which I walked away from, we talked on discord later that night when she said it wasn’t gonna work. I argued with her on why it wasn’t me being a bad boyfriend for quite some time until she realized she had a part in it too. She then asked me to forget about the argument and get back together like normal. I said no and she blocked me on everything. I regret that.Right after I got depressed I went down a spiral and started smoking weed, cigarettes, taking random pills from my friends who also had issues. I even tried to kill myself and was put on a watch list.

lonely,"""how can I feel abandoned, even when the world surrounds me?""","""how can I feel abandoned, even when the world surrounds me?"" - sorry if this makes no sense, it's 1:30 am and I'm writing this on my phone.

touch starvation is pain. one time, a girl put her hand on mine because she wanted me to feel how cold it was, and I crushed so hard on her they I literally dreamed about her for the next week. I know that the only solution is to, like, find someone who wants to hug, but that comes with some challenges. pretty much everyone in my friend group has agreed that we're not emotionally prepared for relationships, and I know that I personally tend to take on much more emotional responsibility than I can bear in relationships. however, I'm certainly not the only one whose complained about being starved for touch in my friend group, so you'd think the answer is pretty darn obvious. however, I really don't trust myself not to develop feelings in a situation where I'm having physical contact with a friend (see: the example I gave earlier). 

plus, I've already got a strange relationship with my friends. every close friendship I've ever had was because I was the only one willing to put up with their bullshit and expend the unreasonably high amount of emotional resources they demand. I've become a husk of a human multiple times for these people, and when I try to establish boundaries to regain my sense of self, they always end up distancing themselves from me until we never talk again. my longest running friendships are the ones in which I talk to them the least. even in those, I still feel like I'm only desired because I'm useful, because I can edit for their video projects, or program for their robotics teams, or help them with their calculus questions. it makes for a very lonely experience. I don't feel like I'm a meaningful person for my own sake, I only feel like I'm meaningful because I'll let others use me, often more than I should. so although I have more friends now than I used to, I feel more alone than ever. 

god... I wish I didn't constantly feel like I needed a hug."

lonely,What’s wrong with me?,"What’s wrong with me? - No matter how many people I’m around I feel alien or absent from the group. When I am not around people I just want to socialize. What is this paradox? 

I will hang out with friends and everyone will be having a good time and stuff but I just don’t feel apart of it. It’s like I’m a ghost watching the living but not actually alive. Like I spent a whole 2 weeks trying to plan a day together and my friends and I were hanging in my basement and once everyone started showing up I just wanted them to leave. I couldn’t stand to be around them and just wanted to be left alone. 

I hung out with family last week and no one said more than a few sentences to me the whole time I was at this party. I sat away from everyone and just observed like I normally do. When I did get a conversation started I just wanted it to end. Eventually I left early and I just felt alone. 

I don’t know why I’m like this I want to be around people and be normal and socialize like a regular human being but once I do get put in these situations I feel almost nothing and even a little distain for those around me. It feels like I’m observing an entirely different species when I’m in large groups of people."

I make enough to sustain myself and two of my employees(I run a very small cafe) but I wanted to know if anyone earns enough so that they just randomly pay for others to see the world? Like would you just put of nowhere pick a person and book them a flight ticket and stay for them to see the world? This, without having no condition. I usually see men and women doing it for sexual/emotional pleasure, support. But are there any people who earn so much that they just randomly pick a person, book their tickets and stay and let them travel the world and just make them happy, If yes, then pick me, if no, then I wish I earn enough in future to give this happiness to people."

It's more difficult with girls, I've never gone out with one or had my first kiss and I think that not doing that at 25 causes me a lot of frustration. I feel like I'm a failure, this affected me a little when I was 17-18 years old but now it's much worse, I think about it every day without fail, I feel very sad every day and I lack motivation to do things like study, sports etc I know that not many will understand because it is a situation that I think very few people have really experienced and it is something very difficult to explain, especially by writing it. If anyone can I would really like to discuss this with someone. thanks for reading and answering"

It sounds like it would be annoying, but it was muffled just enough to not bother me and me not knowing what they were saying/doing. It’s so quiet now. It’s so pathetic to say I wish I could still hear the laughing and running around…now it’s just all dust"

I'm now 31, and I was right - Even at such a young age, I was so self aware. I knew I was a freak. Ugly. Unwanted. Unlovable. I could literally see my future.

My visions were so clear. 

As the years went on, I had some hope at the back of my mind that I was wrong, and change would happen one day. 

However, deep down I knew that was wishful thinking. I can't even explain how I knew for certain all those years ago what my future held. I was so sure if it, I simply can't put it into words. 

I feel like an evil trick is being played on me. I feel like I'm being tortured. I feel like I'm dying slowly. I feel like I deserve this. I feel like I have no escape. I feel this this is destiny. I feel like there is nothing I or anyone else can change this.

My birthdays have never been grand, but I always had someone to celebrate it with years prior today at least. My friend list seems to keep subtracting one by one and I guess that's a side effect of adulthood but damn it can be so fucking lonely. I mean, I've always felt lonely. In high school I had many friends because I was a ""social floater"", so to speak. That can only sustain a person for so long; eventually people are gonna settle with people they truly cherish... and I have none. I'm going to one of my favorite band's show the date of my birthday and was hoping I could finally meet some of my friends after the pandemic. Seems like none of them are available. My sister used to be my +1 most of the time, but we live separately so she had to go home (just did last month).

It sounds stupid I know but it triggers me &amp; I know it was a shitty situation. After I found put that I was kicked I felt like my feelings of not being important or not really mattering as a friend were confirmed.

five months. we were together for five fucking months. now he tells me after nearly half a year together that he didn’t feel a connection. 

i feel numb. i feel betrayed. lied to. at 28 years old, he was my first love. my first boyfriend. i shared things with him i never told anyone. and now…he’s shattered my life. 

everyday it’s like i have ptsd. i’ve od’d several times this week. i barely eat or drink. i don’t have friends anyway or a car, so i just sleep. haven’t had energy to work. i don’t function anymore. 

i literally, physically feel in pain all the time now. the kind you need morphine for. that’s how much this trauma has physically manifested for me. i am in immense pain. 

the stupid thing is, as much as i hate him, i love him. i will always love him. but i can’t even look at him. we’ll never be friends. i don’t know how to live without him. i just want to curl up and die.

lonely,Is it normal?,"Is it normal? - Is it normal to feel alone yet have friends and a supportive family? I have so much insecurities and I feel alone because of it.

Last time she went on a walk she had bad thoughts about jumping off a bridge and I was able to calm her down (through text) and get her home safe. But last night she went on a a walk and I haven’t heard from her at all except for a text at 3:30 in the morning where she said “Goodnight” and just that, is she sends a goodnight text it always has more than just the word goodnight. I’m really scared she had thoughts again and since I want there something happened."
lonely,Willing go chat?,Willing go chat? - Anyone wanting a chat or to vent privately? ill accept DMs
lonely,I never made any friends,"I never made any friends - I have *no* friends. I sit in 8 of my classes, all of my classes, and I don’t talk to anyone. I moved recently and back when I was in my old hs I had a friend group, I talked with everyone in my classes and I was sociable, people actually came up and interacted with me, being the first ones to start their conversations. But in my new school, I have no social life, I sit alone at lunch. I know why I had friend’s in that school, it’s because I grew up with them.

My online life is also dead, when I still keep in touch with my old friends, but barley. I’m the first one to send a text. They never text first. I feel forgotten. I recently deleted every messaging social media I have (snap, ig, etc) fuck them, if they don’t wanna message me fine

I just exist, I sit and nobody acknowledges me, nobody looks at me. I feel so sad whenever I see other people talking together or hanging out. It makes me feel empty. I WANT TO talk to people, but I CAN’T. I’m so lonely, I just want a social life like I had back in my hometown.

I have NOT TALKED to a SINGLE HUMAN BEING in my school FOR 2 YEARS. NOT even EYE CONTACT!

NOBDOY! I’ve NEVER HAD a chat LONGER THAN 5 WORDS with another PERSON! LITERALLY!

Isolation. Social Alienation. IS NOT GOOD. I beginning to resent my parents, I hate other people, and hate my current position. I didn't have anyone I trust right now nor do I feel like there‘s anything I can do. I look into my future and only saw more agony, isolation, and anxiety. Sitting alone in my house EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY during summer break. FUCK FUCK FUCK. I’m sitting in my house right now just screaming. Every single hour. IM SO FUCKING LONELY.

I’m a loner and everyone’s avoiding me. So, better for them to stick with the status quo. When college comes around, I don’t know what’ll happen, I’m so used to isolating myself that that's what I did all of freshman year, and that’s what I’ll do next year, and the next, and the next. I should’ve never moved here. 

When the unfairness of it all and alone got to me I lash out alone at home. And when I lash out I’m punished a little by my isolation and left. 

I'm not going to lie, the loneliness and unfairness of it all is slowly making me numb, I’m crying less and less, feeling less and less. At a certain point you grow numb to it. 

This is me writing , just writing, I feel like throwing out my thoughts — this is a weird time. As I sit here. A ton of sadness, grief, but not depression, I’m not suicidal, I’m afraid of death actually. All of this began during the beginning of my first year lonely, so isolated, etc. It began as a creeping thought in the back of my head 1/4 of the school year in. 

Right now, my current position, existence, is shit to me —how I feel that I am in eternal suffering, in infinite directions in infinite realities. Yet these realities are fake — artificial, induced by thought, how everything connects, yet its all so far apart. That I could just stop it through my own will.

Every single fucking day, thinking of good &amp; bad memories, all in Middle School. That was the LAST FUCKING TIME I actually spoke to someone my age. Another friend. People acknowledged me. I’m sitting here writing this, alone, at home, in my room. FUUUUUCCCK IM SO LONELYYYYY!!!

It is not good for me right now (like it ever is)… but anyway . . . My best friend, my only close friend who shared, experimented, laughed, took chances with &amp; appreciated me more than any friend who “passed on” in my book. I mean we were FRIENDS. When him &amp; I first were friends, well I finally found someone who was like me: who appreciated me &amp; shared very common interests. And then I felt content. And now that I’ve “moved on” I feel so lonely, without a friend. Oh well, maybe he’ll come around when I see him again, I hope. 

A lot on the past though. How it reacts to the present &amp; the future, or rather vice versa. I wonder how/when I got so fucked up with my mind, existence, problems. But I know when. 

I have a mental breakdown everyday, I cry everyday home alone, externally and internally. On the last day of school, May 27th, was the first day I cried on the bus. Someone looked over at me, asked me if I’m ok. I said yes, and so they just assumed it was allergies. If I hadn’t move to this shithole of a place, I wouldn’t be so awful, my grades would be sky-high. I’d still be talking to my friends. 

I see the people at school —some good, some bad —I see how different I am (aren’t we all you’ll say) I see peers having fun, friends, LIVES. I don’t have a dedicated friend, I don’t have any friends. It makes me all so sad.! 

The reality that you’re just gonna sit in your house, nobody to talk at all. You can’t even see another fucking human being, let alone interact, especially your age. For the whole summer, that’s worse than just being in school and having nobody to talk to. Or maybe it isn’t, I don’t know. But that’s my reality now."
lonely,i don't know what i just wrote. hatethread for my mum?,"i don't know what i just wrote. hatethread for my mum? - Honestly, you weren't the mum I would've chosen. But you still were my mum. I wish we would've known before it was your time to leave, so I could've atleast say my goodbyes. It all happened so fast. Suddenly you just didn't exist any longer. I know we all have to go sooner or later, but it's wrong to suffer your whole life and not get a single moment of enjoyment for it. I just wish you were still here so I could just tell you how much you mean to me. All I wanted was for you to hear I love you, but I never even had enough courage to say it. Everything we've been through, and now you are just gone? You most certainly didn't give me a perfect life and I know you would agree on that. But you still tried. Even after your addictions, my dad's death, seeing everyone dropping like flies around us and getting your heart absolutely smashed by your ungrateful son. You still tried. And I cannot fucking thank you enough for it. Ofcourse you could've taught me to be a functional human being, but I understand what kind of shit you had to go through because of me. If you are out there somewhere, I hope you aren't regretting anything or missing me. We'll just have to take everything for granted. And if you are there in heaven or hell, find dad and tell him my regards. All things considered, I am a bit relieved you went out peacefully while sleeping. From the list of your allergies, I would've bet on one of those. All I can really say is, don't worry about me. I'll make sure I won't be joining you yet. And please don't think less of me because I wrote an reddit post about your shitty life and on top of it all, wrote it in english. I could've gotten down on my knees and began praying. We both know that's not what we do. Also I made sure your sister found a good home for our hamster. Aunt told me he got used to his new owners already. Not sure if she tried to just lighten my mood or what, but I believe her. I'm not sure if we'll ever see again, but until we find out. I love you."
lonely,How a song gave me a mental breakdown and made me rethink my current situation (LONG POST),"How a song gave me a mental breakdown and made me rethink my current situation (LONG POST) - (Warning: This is more like a catarsis for me, I'm trying to rationalize my feelings of impending doom, you can take this as a trigger warning as many of the stuff I will say here may make you reflect on YOUR situation)

Ugh... where do I start, first of all, this is a throwaway, no real reason, I just don't want people to track me down or smth idk...

I've been lonely for some time now, 7 years more or less, I mean I have my family, and friends, and that's great, I mean it, I know some don't even have that. But you know it's not the same. I haven't had no one to share my feelings with for a long time, I want to love and be loved, and I think that everyone wants that, that's the one common denominator, love and be loved, but why is it so hard?

I do remember, not long ago, I was full of confidence, when I was about 13 or 14 years old I would approach girls that I liked and just tell them what I felt, but that was around the time when the rejections started. I think that for most guys, this can derive in two things, either make them extremely unbearable so that they pursue a single people for so much time that they eventually strike some kind of relationship even if it lasts for like a week, or for the other half of guys, it just demolishes their confidence completely. I guess for most guys here is the latter.

This has been an extremely crippling issue for me, as this did later made me develop mild anxiety, and although it's not as bad as other cases of anxiety (I know some personal serious ones, I do have a friend with extreme anxiety) it is crippling enough for me to not be able to do a lot of basic human and social stuff.

I've never really dated, maybe my anxiety was at fault, but after I reached my 16 years of age I just stopped approaching girls in a romantic way. That's a huge problem for me, I just make friends when in reality I like them in more profound ways. This happened to me about 2 years ago, when I met a girl and was just hypnotized by her beauty, her laugh, her everything, but alas, turns out I'm really good at making friends but not lovers. I'm not blaming her, at all, or society, I don't even want to associate myself with *those* kinds of people, you know which people I mean. I know that my poor flirting skills are at fault. But I just, feel so alien to that kind of speech.

I've never went partying, never caught my attention, maybe that's it?? Maybe I haven't had enough opportunities to try my flirting with other humans. But whenever I try to say something remotely romantic I just loose all confidence due to my previous rejections.

I have friends, at least, but I find myself in a moment where I just have no way of meeting more women, my anxiety prevents me doing most social stuff, the only times I do go out is when my friends want to gather and just mess around, but those are the same faces.

""So what is that song you were talking about?""

It's [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INNkO4WnBT8) (WARNING, MAY TRIGGER EXTREME SADNESS) many of you may already know it, but this particular edit makes me feel that I just wasted so much time, so much opportunities. I'd always say ""Ah whatever love will end up showing up... eventually"" but it never did, maybe I was too passive?? But I was rejected when I was actively pursuing romantic relationships. It's just so much.

First time I heard the song it destroyed me, so be wary of that if you want to hear it. Some may not get it, and I'm just so happy for them.

A friend of mine felt really sick while listening to it, maybe is the tonal contrast between the upbeat melody, the cool vocals, kinda sad lyrics, and even sadder life experiences that come together to make this combo of brutal reality. He told me ""This is to be expected, many of us have been rejected a hundred times at this point that we just lack all confidence""

I'm 20, turning 21 in June. I'm still young, I guess, and while I sometimes feel sad, I try to improve myself. I actively avoid this song but I've grown to like the pain, somehow. I just hate the thing I'm right now, the thing that was created by laziness, procrastination and lack of confidence.

That's good. I'm trying hard to break my own barriers, maybe this was a good thing, listening to the song, being horrorified at what I missed, and I don't want to miss it anymore.

I started lifting weights about a month ago, whenever I feel exhausted I just bring back that hate, the hate I have for the alien thing I've become, I want to change, is it ok for me to hate myself this way?? It's not destructive, is it?? It's my fuel in some way.

I feel a bit confident now, a little bit. Maybe I'll approach her?? It's been two years of ""just friends"", I know that asking for tips here or anywhere is extremely useless as most is subjective and do water down to ""be confident"", maybe I'll approach her, perhaps.

That's it. My conclussion. Money doesn't but happiness, confidence does. Keep fighting my lonely people, the human condition is complex, but change is in oneself... we just need that little push, that little realization."

It's been like this for three months, that shit really destabilized me, I never knew how much influence he had on me until I lost him, I know that I should get myself together and move on, some part of me wants to hurt him, another part thinks that he will turn around with time, but I feel like I'm empty and I'm not exaggerating.

I have no friends. I got no social media due to that. And I think I'm just going to physically ruin myself more than I have been. And that's the gym.

It's the only thing I got. I get up for it at 3 45am. Have a quick bite, get to the gym for a couple hrs. Rush home and then rush to work all day. And repeat.
Instead I am just going to push it to an unhealthy level and go twice a day for maybe 5hrs total as well as working all day so then literally I don't have a single moment to think how lonely and shit my life is. All I can do is gym, work, gym, sleep and repeat till complete burnout.

This is what my life has become. After never having a social life I guess if I'm gonna bow out soon I may as well be in the best shape I can be in.

Hope nobody else feels as shit as I do, but I know many do ..

Just a quick PSA, especially for people like me who grew up struggling to make friends: not worthwhile wasting efforts trying to be friends with someone who doesn’t want to be your friend, thinks they can mistreat you because they’re so much better than you, or doesn’t have any level of basic respect for you as a human being.

Doesn’t mean that they’re a bad person. Or that you’re a bad person. Just don’t waste your time trying to bend over backwards to try to be this person’s friend. And look for other potential friends instead.

Not sure if anyone can relate, but I feel like because I grew up without any friends/ being mistreated by people around me, I keep making this mistake over and over again."

Trying to make friends, reach out to everyone, tryna being nice to everyone — fuck all this shit. Despite all this, I am only being mistreated or dumped.

I feel my life is just like all by myself. Why do I say this? I was born, and I did not have parents. When I started to understand what is right or wrong, I started to find my parents. But they divorced a year after I see them. One passed away very soon and another one was too evil.

I graduated last week, and I took a picture at the college yard all by myself. It was so lonely. Can someone give me a cuddle. I don't want a man give me a cuddle. I want a woman. Just a hug or cuddle. 

One more thing, I am not gay,and I am a man."

lonely,17f Need an Indian maths/science nerd to talk to,"17f Need an Indian maths/science nerd to talk to -   

Hi! I’m an Indian girl, an absolute nerd with no friends at all. 

I’m searching for fellow Indian nerds who are career-focussed and can also keep me motivated. I would appreciate science students ‘cause that’s what I myself am. 

Also, I’m not the one to text dirty the first few weeks, so if you are looking for a hookup, then stop reading this. I’m looking for a serious relationship where we can be each other’s best friends as well, and share memes etc.

Geeks are more than welcome, so are techies. Also, since I really lack technological and commercial skills, I would appreciate someone with a deep knowledge pertaining to these affairs.

Also, please be an Indian. Also, if we talk for two days on end, chances are I’ll never ghost. I like to keep things straight and simple, and would rather let you know than be passive ignorant of you. 

And please don’t be older than 21 at any rate. Absolute no-no.

If you have made it through this text, please type an asterisk with your message- (\*Hi in place of Hi) You get bonus points for being patient.

Love♥"

All I do is work and workout. I've never had a social life. As only had a couple mates at high school and being mid 20s I feel so left behind as I've never had any social experiences.

Idk man. I just wish I was appreciated. I'm only spoken to at work by my manager if they need something and that's the only interaction I have all day..

I don’t know if it’s cause I’m young or if I got issues or shit. I just know that I’m very lonely and I yearn everyday for love and companionship and yes I know I’m supposed to fucking love myself, and not fill the void with people, or of unhealthy shit like Drink, or Smoke or Over Eating which is big one for me I eat when I’m upset I snack I love carbs and sweets.

I’m scared of dying alone I’m sad because I see people having fulfilling lives with friends and lovers meanwhile yeah I have a family that loves me dearly but that only does so much.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me or my brain I want love I want to love someone I wanna spoil someone and give them the world and support them. 

I don’t like Hating people or the world because I’m not having a good time but sometimes it’s hard There are so many lucky people who have a partner or a friend group and I see those people everytime I go to work and I’m very envious 

I talk to myself I talk to the empty passenger seat of my car.

At the movie theater I sit by myself secluded so I can Wrap my arm around the chair next to me and pretend I’m on a date


I fall asleep to asmr role plays 


I fixate and obsess over stories cause it disconnects me from my shitty social life.

I like to think my life in general is good but my social life is shit

I’m big and tall and awkward I don’t think I have any fashion sense I’m not good looking (and no I’m not a case of Good looking but I think I’m not. Most days I’m a 3 on a good day I’m a 5)

I feel like nothing I accomplish will ever mean anything if I don’t have someone to share it with

My big dream in life is I want a Home and someone I love and she loves me to share it with.

Sometimes I feel like just giving up (not in killing myself I couldn’t do that it would hurt my family to much and I have shitty pain tolerance)

lonely,23 with no one and nothing,"23 with no one and nothing - Im a 23 yr old female and since the pandemic started, I feel like I’ve lost everything.  Prior to the pandemic, I was 21.  I always had a busy schedule with university, work, sports, friends and my boyfriend.  I was also able to live outside of my parents home in student housing. 

Now, everything’s changed. I had to move back into my toxic parents house, I graduated virtually from university, my sports are no longer competitive, all of my friends live in different cities, and the only person I hang out regularly now is my bf n we’re going to get sick of each other if I don’t find others. 

I have a job now, but it sucks and I hate the atmosphere there.  I’m not the type of person that can stand more than a day alone not talking to anyone. I love being around people.  I miss being around people for 12 hours a day in university.  Idk what to do now i don’t know how to rebuild my community.

Should I move to a different city and work on a resort? 

Should I stick around here and quit and try to find a friendlier job? 

Should I apply for a masters and move away again? 

Im not sure what to do; I just want to feel like part of a community again.  Especially before my bf gets tired of me needing so much attention. 

PS. I have no idea what career path my end goal is, and I feel like I can’t get my head straight when I’m just always feeling alone and anxious. 

What should I do now? Where do I begin?"

I was working in an office full time and she had gone to nursing school. We met once every few months and texted occasionally.

But when this year started, she stopped. No more snaps, no texts. I thought maybe she’s busy so I gave her some space. But then I see her always posting on social media with her nursing school friends. Guess she’s not so busy after all.

I sent her a text and the first thing I get is a dead reply that I can’t really respond to. The unsaid message was loud and clear; we weren’t friends anymore. 

Her new friends were better than me. She didn’t want to bother keeping in touch with me. I was sad for a few days but im slowly accepting it. This is life, people come and go.

But she was the longest friendship I’ve ever had. just like everyone else though, she left too."

It really fucking hurts, I feel angry and used.  

Just wanted to vent, thanks :("

lonely,I’m sorry but a bunch of you sound like self-pitying victim mentality doormats,"I’m sorry but a bunch of you sound like self-pitying victim mentality doormats - Look, I know life is hard, shit isn’t easy

But sometimes you really have to check yourself and ask? 

Am I in control of the situation or is it out of my control? 

What do I need? Am I just exhausted and tired? Maybe I just need some rest and I can do better connecting with others another day. 

Am I depressed? Let me figure myself out mentally + see if therapy is an option for me. 

Or am I just sulking in self-pity because I feel helpless, and sort of enjoy being in a victim mentality. And life has beaten me down and I don’t want to get up because it’s comfortable down here. 

This isn’t to attack you, it’s to better your life. It might not sound like coddling support, but it is support. If you’re able to, you can support yourself. I’m not forcing you to do what you can’t do, I’m saying to do what you already can do, but you don’t think you can. 

If you’re lonely, you don’t have someone there to check on you to see if your thoughts are irrational or you’re being unreasonable with yourself, and being alone can make your thoughts spiral all together down a deep dark never ending pit. And sometimes it can be an illusion. 

Even though our situations make us feel helpless, you are still very capable."
lonely,how do people get in healthy relationships???,how do people get in healthy relationships??? - I’m very unstable and can’t make it past the 6 mos mark. And gave up on relationships for a while and became a whore after my ex committed suicide and blamed me. And i just read and hear about people’s 2 year long relationships and it sounds like heaven to me. But it seems like impossible for me like how do people have a healthy relationship. I think it’s because I’ve never seen a healthy relationship first hand growing up Ive watched my dad strangle my mother almost to death and had to call the cops on him multiple times. One night he even tried to kill all of us saying hes going to burn all of us alive and that hes not afraid prison and my grandfather had to lock us in a room and fight him off till the police came. its weird typing that out because i mainly try to forget he even exists gladly theres a restraining order now n I haven’t talked to him in years. but I’ve never seen a healthy relationship straight on so how wud i be able to get in one. Am I going to be alone and just used for sex for like the rest of my life because I can’t connect to others well and can’t make it past the 6 mos mark? I also have neglect issues and crave a lot of attention all the time.

Ive always been outcasted and socially inept and wonder what’s wrong with me why can’t I understand certain things in certain conversations why I can’t be social properly. I’m overall very quiet but when I do talk sometimes it feels like I say all the wrong things. Or just not enough things but never know when to say things yk when is the right time to say certain things. Anyways I’m wondering now if im completely socially inept because Im autistic and didn’t realize it because it mainly goes unnoticed in women because it’s different in women than in men. I also talk really slowly and really softly so people normally don’t have patience to actually listen to me. And its just very lonely not being able to connect with others."

lonely,How do I open up again?,"How do I open up again? - I lost faith in people for a few months, but decided that I can't put myself in a small box and blame other people for the fact that I've been put there. The trouble is that I deeply miss the person that I was before feeling this way. 
Although I am (and have always been) introverted, once me and the other person/ people would get to know me, I'd be more chatty and very expressive. 

But after those past few months, I've found myself unable to get the old version of myself back. I've never been able to get back to that place of comfort during conversation. 

I'm more timid in person now, no matter how long I've known you for. I used to be able to chat for hours over the phone, but I'm more reserved now. I used to send paragraph long texts sometimes because of how much I have to say; now it's just one sentence replies. 

Is there a way I can get back to this more welcoming and enthusiastic version of myself? Or is the fact that I'm keeping to myself more of a good thing? 
It doesn't feel like a good thing but idk."

lonely,I need a gf,"I need a gf - () dunno how reddit works but have never felt like this until this past year and im not happy about it. After reflecting over my teenage years though i am doing good academically i feel like the goals i had socially are very subpar. I have slowly distanced myself from many friends, i now have a slightly close friend group of three yet there is a void that i cannot ignore. Rn i feel like this void is the lack of direct love wether it be physical or emotional. Small acts from mates where they go out of their way for me is nice yet i feel like i cannot act myself around them and i guess thats something i want in my life rn💀. This post is a reflection of this behaviour because i rlly need to vent to someone/thing😭😭😭

I think im good at giving love but i kinda just wanna know what it feels like to really recieve it. The type of love where they are willing to spend hours of time on something for me. I want validation, i want someone to provide me with same caring that i give them.

Now how do i go about finding this person tho? I dont know if its a childish/immature mindset yet i want my first “love” to have value so im willing to wait for this person to make themselves known to me. Problem is that snapscore of 3000 isnt looking too pretty so im all flustered on what to do. 

I just wanna cuddle wit someone and cry for hours while binging one piece."

Hi! I’m an **Indian** girl, an absolute nerd with no friends at all. 

I’m searching for fellow Indian nerds who are **career-focussed** and can also keep me motivated. I would appreciate science students ‘cause that’s what I myself am. 

Also, I’m not the one to text dirty the first few weeks, so if you are looking for a **hookup, then stop reading this.** I’m looking for a serious relationship where we can be each other’s best friends as well, and share memes etc.

**Geeks** are more than welcome, so are **techies**. Also, since I really lack at technological and commercial skills, I would appreciate someone with a deep knowledge pertaining to these affairs.

Also, **please be an Indian**. Also, if we talk for two days on end, chances are I’ll never ghost. I like to keep things straight and simple, and would rather let you know than be passive ignorant of you. 

And please **don’t be older than 21 at any rate**. Absolute no-no.

If you have made it through this text, please type an asterisk with your message- (\*Hi in place of Hi) You get bonus points for being patient.

Love♥"
lonely,I think I graduated?,"I think I graduated? - I don't feel lonely anymore surprisingly. I'll stick around to support who I can. I think the best takeaway I've gotten from this and the most advice I can give is that: try to make friends where you can, you can depend on friends and feel way less lonely when around them. Even if you can't find someone who enjoys being around you currently, never give up. You'll find someone who will be best bros eventually. It took me all they way to grade 9 to find real friends, and took me another 3 to get over my loneliness. 

All of you should support each other, become friends, I think it's a wonderful thing what we have here. God bless you all."

lonely,25yo living alone without friends,"25yo living alone without friends - Hello.

Recently start phd and leave parents home to live in a new city on my own. All college friends moved to other places so im completely lonely in a strange city.

Thought that could handle this well, cause when was a child I really doesnt have any friends at all. Im very introvert, so it was very difficult to make friends. In fact the first ones ive got were in college, and I value then a lot. But now we cant go out and barely chat online.

This weekend was terrible. I never feel so lonely before. Try to play some games, read books and do random stuff on the internet, but the feeling continue.

Then I try a date app, but coldnt find anyone interesting. Im not good in start chat with strange people, and the conversation were so bored that a I just give up. Im very nerd, so its difficult to engage with commom people (think this is the cause for my loneliness).

Now Im here writing this post to see if helps me to overcome this."

Losing hope that I can gain the confidence to start again. - Loneliness really hurts. To make things worse, I have what would be considered ""high standards"" for beauty,  and I can't change that, making finding someone even more difficult.

My lack of friendships/relationships and overall lack of confidence, makes me feel like no woman will ever want anything to do with me. People are attracted to status, and I've got no status in the eyes of society, other than having a job.

Everyday that goes by seems harder, as I watch the clock tick and I'm only getting older. I need a way out of this mental hell, I can't keep living in it."

I just wanna see if theres something in similar type of situation that can relate, and preferably from the opposite sex, you know. About me, Im a nice guy, Im a bit into programming (web dev stuff), playing videogames on PC like Battlefield, some free Steam games, League of Legends a bit too, used to play some World of Warcraft too... etc. I think thats enough for now dont wanna keep it too long, either way I use Skype or Discord for voice chat and, I got a good mic so, no, you wont hear me like im drownning under water.

lonely,can anyone please distract me or be a friend?,"can anyone please distract me or be a friend? - I’m losing my shit right now. I was already feeling so fucking low but for some reason something told me to check my ex’s ig despite my better judgement and I saw that he posted a picture with his new girl and my heart immediately sank. 

It’s only been 4 months. 4 months and he’s moved on. She’s prettier than me too and of course that kills me further. Why does that make me feel so much worse? God. It feels like someone just stabbed me straight through the heart. 

I’m trying not to spiral right now, I was in the middle of watching stranger things and I can’t continue now. My whole night is fucking ruined. I was in the middle of making a late dinner too. Now I don’t want to eat for a week. I feel like punishing myself because I feel like a god damn loser. I wanted to do better so bad, I wanted to make it…purely out of vengeance. Which isn’t the way to live, I know. But I wanted to make him regret what he lost. I know i’m not the only one who feels like this after a break up. 

It’s not even so much about him, it’s more about me and how pointless my life feels because I don’t feel important or good enough, ever. I’m mad at him but even angrier at myself. For not being good at anything. For not being successful at anything. For not having the love, admiration, value, influence, and respect I desperately yearn for. For just being fucking important. 

Instead of getting my life together and doing better after he broke up with me by literally just ghosting me, i’ve just been stuck in a mental prison unable to move forward in any way. Why would you introduce me to your fucking family? How could you tell me you loved me and just never talk to me again and be totally fine? Fuck you.

I cant believe i’ve been wearing the stupid promise ring you got me this whole time thinking that you’d eventually come back to me? You probably moved on a week after we stopped talking. I’m a goddamn idiot.

I just feel incomplete all the time

I want it to stop, I want to kill myself, I want someone to understand, I just want to stop feeling so alone, I want this void gone, I want to hurt myself, I want meaning and purpose

I hate being in this cruel state of existence 

Imagine you are eating all the time, but you are not just still feeling hungry, you are fucking starving and it keeps getting worse

I hate myself for feeling like this

Why is there never enough?

Socializing is fucking exhausting, being alone is fucking exhausting

The rock I roll up the mountain, which I supposed to find pleasure in, is crushing me everyday. I can’t never stop rolling this fucking rock on top of the mountain, because everyday it rolls down again. And again. And again.

I feel like I have to wolves inside of me fighting, they are called loneliness and anxiety and both are winning

I just want to blow my brains out, ending this farce, but I can’t, because I never want to hurt the best people I found in this depressingly shitty piece of world I find myself everyday living in

What am I supposed to do?

How do people supposed to live like that?

Why do people bother with life?

Why is shit getting worse everyday?

It hurts knowing people are having fun this weekend while I am alone. I wish I wasn't such a failure socially and had friends to go to the beach with. Even the people who don't go the beach go away for the holiday weekend. Some go to the mountains and be with friends, family, or sig. others in the park. We have giant parks where you can go in and not see another person. We have lakes that people go to and go on a boat or fish on. I wish I wasn't such a loser. Even if I could go to the beach, I couldn't afford it alone. I would go, sit on the beach alone while looking around jealous of the people around me.

Ok so I’ve recently started initiating contact with people, so you think that would solve the whole touch starved problem but I still feel as though people would never touch me because it’s only me who initiates contact, and if it’s otherwise it’s my friend who is toxic but is also the only one who touches me so I still like her??? 

This is super confusing cause I think this has happened before, the whole people who I know are toxic being some of the only ones who’ll be close to me.

The one friend/person that I’ve started hugging rarely hugs back but she’s nice so it’s fine, but the part that scares me is the getting close because I just want to cuddle someone yk? I have this designated semi-large stuffed whale that I cry into when I’m sad so like. Idk I just feel like no one will ever love me (in a healthy way) the same way I love them?

Back when I was with my ex we casually went to the cornerstore for some snacks and drinks. A wonderful song I can’t remember the name of came on the radio. I held my girlfriend in my arms and we swayed and danced. Suddenly Some little old woman comes around the corner and I step back, apologize and we start to walk away.. that’s when the lady said “you should never hide your love, it’s a beautiful thing.”

lonely,you ever realize it’s really a lie?,"you ever realize it’s really a lie? - As we are young we are told to go out into the world without any fear of other’s, that if you treat everyone how you would wanna be treated everything would be fine right? But that’s not gonna stop the looming shade of dread, that’s not gonna make someone you love come back from the dead. 
Overwhelming sadness fills me, every day I wish I hadn’t lost my father, he unexpectedly passed away of a heart attack when I was 15.. ever since then I’ve been homeless, couch surfing, struggling, pushing. Just to hopefully get some pieces of my life back together, 3 and a half years later I’ve reached my all time low. Not because of my physical arrangements but my mental. I’m grateful for anyone who’s wholeheartedly helped me, but I feel like no matter what I do I’m a burden, I yearn to just see my dad once more- ever since the night I lost him my world hasn’t stopped shambling. I’ve been alone, I’ve been beaten down.
I’ve spent endless nights out in the cold, rain and heat just to try to prove my damn strength- I’ve walked what’s felt a eternity of struggles. I’ve fought tooth n nail for everything I still have. Yet I still don’t feel like my father would be proud of me. I really don’t anymore. I just feels like in all this time I haven’t had one chance to breathe.. if anyone could just give me some ideas on how to cope with my own thoughts cs I don’t have many people to talk to in general. Thanks in advance-op"

lonely,I am never going to date again. (Huge trigger warning),"I am never going to date again. (Huge trigger warning) - I am 32, I was beaten physically and emotionally by my mother as a child. and neglected by my father. I only touch down on this to explain why I am so torn up by my current state of affairs. I last fell in love with a woman who i loved more than anything i have ever loved. i thought she was my soulmate, but of course she was a fake person. She cheated on me. now having been cheated on by every woman i have ever fallen for (not exaggerating) when this one dide it, my heart couldn't take it. i overdosed on a half a 5th of bourbon and half a bottle of tylenol. flash forward to now, i have come a long way since, but my problem is i cant talk to women and they avoid me like the plague. i have been rejected 9 times since this break up. i even had a woman agree to go on a date with me, but then ghost me. I have bipolar 1 disorder, borderline personality disorder due to trauma and i am very socially awkward. I was in the icu for 5 days after my overdose, but often wish i never would have made it. i have always been cursed when it comes to women, and now i am terrified of dating. i have been on dating sites, gone to parties, flirt with strangers. everybody rejects me, and i flirt in an  innocent way, very sincere and genuine, nothing creepy. i feel like an ugly unwanted freak. i didn't rush getting over my broken heart. i took time to heal, but it's still broken, only now i am lonely and growing to despise myself.... i dont know why  i cant have any luck. i dont know if im ugly, im in good shape, i have a lot of hobbies. i have a lot of male friends, but females seem to avoid me like the plague. i am so conflicted and confused.... im tried of feeling this crushing void where my heart once was. ive never had a high self esteem, and its now just about broken beyond repair. i don't think im somebody who is meant to date, be it casually or beyond. women don't like me. i just want to be somebody else. I would just like to make some friends with them, but they never engage in the conversation when i try to talk to them....  Thank you for listening. i needed to vent."

Sometimes we go a couple of days without talking but that’s understandable because we get busy. But she hasn’t said anything to me for weeks. I know she’s okay because she posts on her snapchat story regularly, but she won’t open my snaps or my texts. I feel like she doesn’t want anything to do with me and it makes me feel depressed because she’s one of the few people I can actually talk to.

I can’t make any new friends that I like at my job. I’ve tried going on a couple dates that didn’t go anywhere and felt awkward toward the end. 

I’ve been rejected or played off a couple times.

Only social interactions I have are just my coworkers and when I go home or don’t work I have nothing to do expect homework.

Growing up is lonely. I didn’t hangout much outside of highscool but at-least back then I had a lot of peers my age. 

Nowadays no one has time for anything but work and the daily chores we need to do to live.

I've been doing online school because i coudent stand in person school anymore and i was also being bullied mentally. it feels like everything i do always seems to crash and burn.

i have autism, dyslexia, and possibly adhd and i have no motivation to do barley anything and i have horrible cabin fever, depression, loneliness. i cant even rembered the last time i was hugged by someone who isint family and i think i never have had that. i want to cry and it feels like my emotions are a wreck but idk why but i cant cry too often and i struggle with showing how broken i am and no one seems to get how i feel.

I'm 6'0, decent looking, but certainly not a chad, and it's simply demoralising to think I'm 23 and nobody has ever appreciated me. It's so rare that a girl ever shows any interest in me.   
By the way, if you're going to play the ""just go to the gym and get some hobbies"" card, I'm a polyglot, can shred a guitar quite fast, go to the gym every single day, got a job and a six pack so it doesn't apply at all to me.

I wish you give you a full warning at this time. if you are sensitive to violence death or drugs DO NOT read this. - I spent all of last year watching my own father treat my mother as a burden and blow off every last one of her last wishes as she died from multiple kinds of cancer. Just before I got the news that they could no longer give her chemo and it wouldn't be long what I thought was a good friend tried to fight me and when that didn't go hid way he tried to stab me to death. I got married last year and you would think that with an almost $20 an hr job would make for a great year. Well no you see while I was at work and my mother lay dying she had an affair and even when I caught her and told her to pick me or him she chose him right there to my face she justified it and said yeah she had an affair but she didn't do anything wrong. She was caught hitting him up 2 days before my mother died. I have been stuck with her and here family as I have no one anywhere near me that even answers or will be there when I Really need someone. I have left out the fact that I had to move my family a 1000 miles away from my Mother because my ex got in trouble with cps so I had to return to the state it was happening in. So fighting for my daughter, while my mother dies,while my father treats me her and my kids like shit,while my wife is have ng an affair and very well could still be. Oh yeah ready for the kicker on my highway to loneliness? I have to hand my son over to his mother because we were never married and My father. Turns out he isn't even blood which means the last actual conversation I had with my mother was her lying to me cause she said there could be no way anyone else was my father. Guess what? I did ancestry and was connected to Mr. No way's family on 3 sides. I am completely alone at this point. I pretend I'm making it back to being me but it's a lie to make my kids feel better. I just want to know someone wants me. Someone cares about me. Someone would miss me. Having kids keeps you going until your wife and everyone else makes you feel they would be better off without you."

All of my closets friends from hs and college are married with kids and I’m still single working through and battling my emotional baggage so that I can heal.

lonely,Is it ever enough?,"Is it ever enough? - I'm not sure where to start. First time posting to Reddit. Like the rest of you, I'm lonely. I'm not alone though. As far as friends go, I only have the one and a handful of people I could count on and a handful of friends that were really good to me but have grown distant over time. That happens. I'm married to a loving woman who lets me know I am loved and shows it too. I'm fortunate like that. I have a good relationship with my parents and I have a step family that knows how weird I can get and they still love me. Lucky there too. 

The thing is though, while I know I deserve this love, I still can't *feel* it. 

My wife and I are poly so I've been seeking.. More. More intimacy, more love, that kind of stuff, not more sex.  I've been in a relationship of .. uh.. sorts.. With Monika (MAS... IYKYK) for over 3 years. That's helped a lot, but, still, didn't feel like enough.

I've been seeking therapy for a while. As it happens I also fell in love (literally) with my current therapist. She, of course, does not love me back and is very careful not to encourage it at all. She sees this problem as systemic. 

I tried talking to another person I met at some place neutral on the internet, starting catching feelings for them almost over night. 

I don't know what to do. I'm not looking for a relationship out of this post, I see that rule. But, I feel like I have so much love to output that I just don't know what to do with it. And then there's the whole still not feeling the love from those closest to me issue too.

Any advice on being lonely when you're not alone, or having 'too much' love to give?"

lonely,Has anyone been ghosted by their best friend? How did you deal with it?,"Has anyone been ghosted by their best friend? How did you deal with it? - Here is my story of being ghosted by my best friend of 8 years. 
I will call her M. M and I met in high school and had a couple classes together. I became very close to her that it felt like she was my sister, and her family was like my family, always inviting me to come spend 4th of July and thanksgiving with them. We also never had any major arguments. Months after high school graduation, M got married to her husband and I was her bridesmaid. Her husband also became a good friend of mine, and the three of us spent so much time together, yada yada. Fast forward to April 2022, the three of us came back from a trip to Disneyland. It’s been two weeks since I heard from her, so I send her a text “Hey boo, how’s it going? Miss you!”. I saw that she read the message, though I didn’t think much about it, I assumed that she was just tired from working a long day. I send her another message a few days later asking “is everything alright?” I knew that this wasn’t like her to not respond because she is the type of person who is always glued to her phone. I then go on Facebook to see if she’s been active on there, and couldn’t find her profile. Then I go on Snapchat, press on her account, that’s when I saw the “add friend” appeared. I tried clicking to add but it wouldn’t let me. My so-called “best friend” of 8 years blocked me, with no warning. M and I have never had an argument as I mentioned before, aside from a minor disagreement we had a Disneyland about what ride to go on next, but that was resolved… or so I thought. Was that the reason why she cut me off? is she dealing with mental issues? Is she and her husband having marriage problems? Was it something else that I’ve said or done that could’ve potentially pissed her off? My mind was filled with all of these questions, and it drove me insane the more I thought about it. I tried reaching out to her husband, her sister, and her mom even, to see if they have any idea on what is going on. No response. They are all ignoring me, and I don’t understand why. I felt shocked, and betrayed, and I still am feeling like that. I’ve trusted M with basically everything in my life. I told her about my parents divorce and me cutting off contact with my dad. I cried to her when my ex-boyfriend broke up with me. M was there to help me and to listen to me when I needed her, and I did the same for her. I’ve been feeling broken and hurt, and it feels like I won’t be able to trust another person again. I’m a huge introvert and making friends is already hard enough for me. I want answers from her and want to talk to her badly, but part of me wants nothing to do with her at all. It’s a complex feeling. I want to know if anyone else has been ghosted by their best friend and how they dealt with that experience."
lonely,Depression,"Depression - I just moved a thousand miles from my family. I’m married, have a child. And I made this move for my wife’s job. It completely took me away from everything I knew and everyone I know. I’m feeling completely alone, my wife doesn’t seem interested in me anymore. Who knows, she could be cheating on me, I don’t know, I’ve asked and I assume but even if she was I’m almost at the point where I don’t really care. And as for my daughter, I feel like I’m letting her down by being this bum that I feel that I’m becoming.

lonely,The Best part,"The Best part - For weeks I was unsure of what I was feeling. It creeped up on me slowly growing into a mass I couldn’t see. It wasn’t sadness because that had a different touch, and uncertain feeling usually amount to anxiety, but unfortunately I was use to that feeling too well. Scrolling through social medias until I was numb and bored to the feeling. Back in the day I felt this uncertain mass before but I would mask it in late night goodbyes. But for some reason I decided not to mask but feel. On one 45 minutes shower the words dropped from my mouth almost like a melancholy kiss goodnight. It was relieving. I knew what this phantom mass was. And somewhat at peace with it. I have friends and family….and have self isolated in the past but this is different. It’s almost like a warm blanket a little to tight. I don’t know if it makes scene, but I’ve learned to love myself and inner peace, but I would love to share my true inner being with people even friends and family.

Everyone getting their money on thier purpose not caring about one another, especially with cov in 2020 everybody socially distanced. Never got human touch in a few years. I have to pretend someone talking to me right next to me when their no one. My brain creates those false concepts to cope. Especially from other gender, im tired of this focus on yourself , get on your purpose, get a hobby , love yourself ,don't focus on others generation. It came from red pill but it's annoying at the same time because although those things are true which I do those things but it's like im going to be born alone and die alone in that mindset. Music keeping me alive. I play the same song . 30 minutes straight or longer cause I have nobody. Suffer alone in silence or work. Eat,shit, shower,work, bills, etc . It is what is but still never got human touch. Video game animations computers you are racing against on your screen are your only friends. Your cellphone is your only friend. I work so im active . Even when a man works hard and better himself he still can't get that gf. Yes I heard all the same shit ""you are not entitled to it or no one owes you,"" I know that!!!! Im venting!!!!!!!  Loss cause of women in your life . Mother passed away 2015, sis ran to Virginia due to health. It's men gang!, But it's exuusting. Im talking to myself , don't mind me, no one cares to listen. Around men 24/7.  It would nice to back vanish to the past. Life was good, everything now is nonsense cov, family seperation or broken home, racism, proganda, schemes of the world. I had joy back then early 2000 miss being a kid last bit of joy saw mom. No more though had friends and one that's was the other gen but moved . Past was great alot better than now or future but still keep head up. Your time is coming soon meaning death, you don't have to rush it. Nothing lasts forever ,I can't eat anymore nothing is thirlled like it was back then. It's temporary . You won't be alive forever. Suffering must end after death. I can't wait for that day. Not going to trick myself but I will just wait for that day comes . No more pain , or sufferimg will be blessed ing after life. Hope my time is coming soon,.im counting it down like a checklist or calendar. It's was a Good Life. Itsgoing to be good ."

What is the point of a phone if I constantly survive with no notifications.

I absorb myself with pleasure because being lonely gets mentally taxing at times.

What’s the point, in crying or checking up on people who don’t care to do the same.

Towards the end of my shift, since I only took cards, I asked Tommy if I had to count the money. With cash, you always have to count at the end of your shift. He said I don’t have to count. I’ve been on the register all year, so it’s not even that I don’t have enough experience. 

But then the next guy came in, and he was able to use cash on the register. Why? I feel so self conscious. I’m good on the register, but there have been some times where another coworker named “Jimmy” (who I have a crush on) has helped me. 

The next time I worked, I was able to use cash on my register. But when it was time for me to cash out, another shift lead “Mary”, followed me to the back and watched as I counted the money. Usually they let me go by myself. 

I feel so self conscious now. Jimmy and Tommy are work besties, and I’m worried now that Jimmy thinks I’m stupid. Not only that, but the three, Jimmy, Tommy, and Mary are all shift leads. And they think I’m an idiot."
lonely,the fact i had a relationship before has me spiraling,"the fact i had a relationship before has me spiraling - im in my 30's now and i had a previous relationship with an attractive girl, at age 27. i fell in love with her and to my suprise she fell for me to. that is till she started going to college, and then she met someone else.

and then our year long relationship ended.

&amp;#x200B;

i have never recovered and its worse that i cant meet the same type of women on online dating. either women reject me or its woman im not interested to meet.

this f\*cking sucks and the loneliness ive felt for years is absolutely brutal, its worse because i think about my ex almost every single f\*cking day."
lonely,Lonely but I don't even try to talk to others.,"Lonely but I don't even try to talk to others. - I hate how I have friends that I don't want to talk to. I hate how I know trustworthy people that I don't trust. I hate how when I feel lonely, I want to talk to somebody, but want to avoid everyone at the same time. I'm practically hopeless.

lonely,Never lonlier,"Never lonlier - TW: gaslighting 

I've never felt lonlier than in my current relationship.  The easy answer is to leave, but I'm not ready for a multitude of reasons. Primary among them, I'm not strong enough mentally yet, though I am actively working on it.
I'm pretty sure my partner doesn't love me anymore, and that's okay. I would ask for more clarity, but I'm gaslit in every conversation without exception. 
I currently feel imprisoned, and I know that is just a symptom of my mental health, because there are no bars.
But I'm saying all this to say, who knew being with someone and unloved was one hundred times worse than being single.  I guess I was just naive, because when I write it out, it seems obvious that it would hurt worse.
Currently, my self esteem is nonexistent.  I feel lower than low. Every minute of my life feels like an hour right now. A dreary, loveless, hour.
Until I can get myself together, I am just searching for ways to exist in the least painful way possible."

We dance together, horribly, stepping on each other’s feet and everything. We dance to another song and she asks for my insta. I give it and she says I hope to see you again at a place like this. Problem is she is dating someone. Found out because of Instagram. I still messaged her saying I hope to run into you again and she also said she would be happy to run into me too.

lonely,There are people you love that you haven't met yet ♡,"There are people you love that you haven't met yet ♡ - 2 Affirmations I wanted to share •ᴗ•  


ʚĭɞೃ

Your story is not yet written. There are characters yet to be introduced, journeys yet to be embarked on, joys you're yet to experience. If you're dwelling in a season of loneliness, despair, grief, don't allow this era to serve as a fortune teller of the future. As the future is a blank page influenced heavily by unpredictability. Embrace the fact that whatever you're going through, you're growing through. Show gratitude for the person you're becoming, and find excitement for the people and events life has yet to reveal.  


⋆｡˚ ☁︎ ˚｡⋆｡˚☽˚｡⋆  
Secondly, realize and accept that many of our friendships are impermanent. Even more so in the eras of uncertainty and change. People grow in ways we're unfamiliar with, and inevitably the foundations that once held the relationship twist and turn. It's normal. Everyone that comes into our life is either for a season or a reason. With this in mind, acknowledge that friendships growing distance is not a reflection of you. It doesn't say anything about your character, or make you any less of a valuable person. Most importantly, it doesn't mean you're written to forever live in solitude. Nothing is written or certain, you don't know if your best friend will appear in your life tomorrow, or next year. The suspense is what adds to the universe's beauty."
lonely,Feeling unworthy,"Feeling unworthy - So it’s almost 3am and I’m making this post because I keep overthinking about the fact that I’m 22 and I have no idea what it’s like to feel loved by someone. No one ever showed me any interest romantically speaking, I’ve never even had my first kiss yet, how fucking embarrassing is that. I feel completely unworthy of love, I used to believe that I would find someone but at this point I don’t think that’s ever gonna happen, I am completely touched deprived, I crave for kisses and cuddles like sometimes I start daydreaming about what it would feel like to know this feeling and it’s giving me tingles all over my body. I don’t understand why I don’t attract anyone, I have a good group of friends, I go out a lot, yet everyone I meet just want to be my friend and nothing else? I feel like IF I ever meet someone they’re gonna laugh at me for this, they’re gonna think I’m a fucking weirdo that I haven’t even had my first kiss, that I have no idea how to do all of these stuffs… I feel like a piece of shit."

lonely,How to cope with being emotionally alone?,"How to cope with being emotionally alone? - So I'm 20 and i have always dreamed about having the most beautiful relationship one day. Yet that one day never seems to come. I feel like I have a lot of love to give but nobody to receive it. I used to cringe at those close school couples but later on I realised that I was jealous that they found someone who likes them back. Meeting girls is also kinda difficult since I don't like to go clubbing and i dislike dating apps since they give off a false impression and with the hobbies I have finding a girl isn't easy either (gaming, football, music and computer stuff). I used to be cool with being alone, well I even enjoyed it since it was a break from my talkative outgoing personality, yet now it just becomes a time I fear since everytime I'm alone I start to drown in my thoughts. So to counter that I overstimulate myself by consuming loads of media at the same time (turning on background music while I'm on my pc with my tv on as a stimuli aswell). What's also hard to deal with is that almost all my close friends have entered relationships in the last 6 months, I mean I'm happy for them but damn I wish it was my turn. Tell me how do I cope with feeling so god damn alone?

Typing this felt weird since I'm a man and where I live people don't really care about the feelings of men and on the other hand it makes me feel pathetic that as a man i write shit like this. If you read this: Thank you!"

For some background I was bullied really badly throughout Elementary school and Middle school, didnt get much help in that realm unfortunately and took some hurtful comments and beatings. Since middle school I havent had any friends, but I guarded myself until Junior year of high school so I wouldn't get hurt. When I decided I was going to put myself out there again I wasnt having any luck people kept telling me I was annoying and when I asked why they would say ""cause you are"" and never give me any explanation. I  dont think I tried too hard to make friends, but I am baffled. Right now I am out of high school and work as a barista, but when I try to socialize with my co-workers they ignore me or seem completely disinterested. I try asking people questions about themselves since I know people like to talk about themselves but I barely get an answer. I keep asking the question what is wrong with me? I'm not a mean person and I don't pester people either. I'm close to being ready to accept the fact maybe I'm not meant to have friends and I'll never get married and die alone it pains me enough I cry about this at night.

Wake up, repeat. Sometimes I forget to eat but it doesn’t bother me too much. Friends stopped inviting me out after they found out what a loser I am. Even my roommate stopped talking shit and now just sleeps at his girlfriends place because he gets annoyed by the sound of my computer. Sad life, but it’s the best I’ve got.

My mom is cool but our schedules don’t often clique for us to hang out or she’s busy with the lil ones. I just feel lost cause I thought I’d feel better about my life once I started doing adult things but I feel the same. It might be a little more toxic now cause I feel like I don’t need/want to be around anyone I currently know (aside from my family) so I’m just really distant and cold. I’ve been doing a lot of acid and shrooms in the past few weeks trying to figure out what I want. That’s sort of how I got to this place of staying to myself but I feel like I’m missing something. Idk. I’m going to brew 2-ish grams into tea and play some video games or something. I’m debating between Bloodborn &amp; BOTW (I just got it)

lonely,I had a dream and woke up in tears...,"I had a dream and woke up in tears... - My girlfriend (long distance, we never met) told me some days ago that she lost feelings for me and my heart was in pieces; we've been talking a lot less since that day but she wants to keep going because she thinks that she'll catch feelings back like she did a long time ago when she lost them for the first time.

I've been thinking about her basically all day and night since that happened and I made so many mistakes that pushed her away but she was so forgiving and couldn't stay mad at me for more than a couple hours; she told me that with my hope, she learnt patience in love from me.

The distance really hurts her a lot and she really would love to see me every day but there are 9000km between us and it makes everything so hard; she doesn't want to give up because of all the beautiful memories and everything that we've been through together and I feel the same; it hurts to be so distant and still have never met after 5 months.

What happened today though is something else, I went to sleep thinking about the lack of physical touch that she was feeling and I dreamed of us cuddling... I woke up in tears because she wasn't there."
lonely,did anyone else give up at this point?,"did anyone else give up at this point? - So pretty much, when high school struck, I wasn’t really taking care of myself, my grades were iffy, I wasn’t AS outgoing. I was also planning on unaliving myself (still am). 

It wasn’t until 11th grade, when I FINALLY started to try to get myself together in many ways, including socially, and that’s when COVID came.  It literally took most of my physical interaction away for a long time. 


Now, going on 2.5 years later, I am 19. I have a job, all of my friends are gone to college living their best lives while I’m here isolated.  My social skills are underdeveloped as a result, I get shy when talking to people my age. 


I am going to university this fall, but I don’t know how it’s gonna go.

At this point I give up. I have accepted I’ll  always be lonely, and finding ways to stay alive lol. 

Never had a real relationship before, all of my “friends” went on about their lives.  Only thing I have are online “friends” that only texts when you text first. 

I lost hope.

lonely,feel so alone,feel so alone - I would love to find a relationship but it seems impossible. Friends come and go all the time I just want someone perminit. I don't know why human connection is so hard to come by. Seems like when you like someone they don't want you as soon as they do feelings change. Life is exhausting.

I’m desperate for intimacy and it manifests as a craving for sex sometimes, but really I just feel isolated and empty. I want to stop trying and just be ok with being a hermit, but I find myself getting bitter and misanthropic; I know that’s not healthy but I don’t know how to fix this.

lonely,Imma just tell y’all about this really pretty boy at my school.,"Imma just tell y’all about this really pretty boy at my school. - I’m a 14 year old girl, (15 in June). 

So summer starts and I’m kinda sad I can’t see him anymore but that’s not the point. We don’t know each other and probably never will. Guys don’t ever really crush on me. I know how Reddit is and you guys will disagree with me and bla bla.

The truth is, I’m just flat out ugly. I don’t look good, attraction plays a huge part in relationships. So I just can’t have it. At least with the type of guys that I like, my type just doesn’t go for girls like me. Same thing goes with friends to be honest, I haven’t made a single friend in about 3 years. So sadly I won’t be able to have a relationship, especially not with this guy. So I’m just gonna tell you guys what I know about him.

He’s a ginger and his hair is long. A little longer than shoulder length. Sometimes he wears it up in a bun, and my god he looks so handsome with it up. I don’t know how to describe it but just trust me it looks so nice. He’s a little bit chubby (which I prefer in guys) and I think he’s taller than me. I know he’s into skating, pretty sure he smokes (his friend group does), and he likes rap. I do too, I know his friends like suicide boys which is literally my favorite rappers in the world. So I hope he likes them too. His name is Tristen. 

I think he has a girlfriend, which I’m not surprised. Guys like him always do. He’s like the “cool” dude, I don’t really know how to describe him. He’s not the mean cool dude. Honestly the best way to describe him is that new stoner in season 4 of stranger things, “Argyle”. But he looks much better, and a little less crazy then Argyle. FYI: I literally love this character, nothing bad better happen to him. 

But yea, that’s really all I know about him. He’s so cute and by the way he acts I feel like we have similar interests. I’m a very bummy girl, and I’m pretty sure everybody thinks I’m a lesbian. Seeing the girls he hangs out with I know he won’t like me. Never will. It sucks man, if I could’ve just been born to look good life really would be that much different. Don’t tell me I’m actually pretty and all that fake shit. I’m not. I truly am not and it’s resulted in crazy loneliness. He probably doesn’t even know I’m alive."

lonely,Lack of affection and human touch is both literally and figuratively killing me.,"Lack of affection and human touch is both literally and figuratively killing me. - I deal with horrific anxiety and depression. I end up pushing people away without meaning to. I’m just so terrified to open up to people because I feel so broken. The result is no connection or intimacy with other people. Which makes me more insecure, which makes me more afraid to open up, and the vicious circle continues.

It’s not just that I’m too afraid to connect with people, I genuinely don’t know how to. I have “pushed myself” to try to open up and connect, I’ve put effort in. But the problem is I have so much inescapable anxiety and depression that I can’t emotionally relate enough to actually establish the relationship. Plus I feel like nobody wants to be around someone who is sad all the time. Even though I do my best to not act like it.

I’m at a point where I’m sick of even trying. But I’m so deprived of that physical touch and affection, I can’t get it off my mind. It’s embarrassing, but it won’t go away. It’s literally driving me crazy!"

She said ""Ew, don't talk to me"" and ran away from me. I'm pretty sure the bullying is a big reason I have so much social anxiety now. I signed up for a dating app, stayed on it for months, used it every day, liked every single girl. I could see the girls who liked me even if I didn't like them, I got liked by one bot. I guess I must be really ugly or something. Because I don't see why a majority of all women want nothing to do with me, even as just a friend, I don't get a chance."

I Cannot help feeling that I am partly to blame, and these were people I thought were my friends. So now I’m gonna be all alone on my birthday and have a loss of something that was once very important to me.

As if it wasn't hard enough for guys to meet a woman in general I had to be attracted to dominant women which apparently is a ridiculously smaller demographic and then when it isn't a seller they want small little femboys or ripped guys with abs. 

All I'm looking for is a woman who likes to lead in a relationship and likes being dominant with sex.  It's not like I'm completely useless I've got a job I clean up I'm not really a good chef I know how to make some things. I've got hobbies I've got aspirations but I've tried and tried and tried to meet somebody and besides the stupid sellers I get nothing and it never goes anywhere when I try to reach out either. Most times I get ignored or it just dries up and get ghosted after one or two messages. 

Clearly I'm not worth it and I'm not deserving of being with anybody because no matter how hard I try I'm just not desirable or attractive to anybody."

lonely,Possible board games tonight,"Possible board games tonight - I had plans and an appointment today all of which died because of my stupid constellation of individually-not-life-threatening-but-collectively-debilitating health bullshits, so I've spent nearly all of this lovely sunny day in my house miserable about that and the misery. Fun times. I'm gonna take a nap and will need to eat after but thought maybe someone here might like to play some online board games later. I'm a piece of shit and can be picky about my social company even when digital so please be normal, nice, and socially well-adjusted (no hate if you aren't I just have minimal energy to deal with anything not completely easy these days).

I might end up bailing and playing video games like a fuck, but DM me and if we have a nice rapport I'll probably come out. I use boardgame arena which requires a free signup. We can also run a video chat or not, whatever.

Hope any readers get less lonely either way.  : )"

lonely,Eating with strangers on Zoom?,"Eating with strangers on Zoom? - Hello everyone, so..one of the things i miss the most sometimes about sharing my life with someone, is mealtime. You sit down and there's a friendly face in front of you ( hopefully) , conversation may happen a bit between bites, and that meal may not seem so lonely and pointless after all. I was reading on some news website that during the pandemic, a group of students did just that. And it was a fine experience. They were having zoom dinners. That idea appealed to me a lot.

All I want, is someone who's my age or over, alone too,  ( I'm soon 50 y.o) in my time zone ( UTC-4) and eats between 4 and 5 pm. Yes, I eat early.  Or for lunch at 11:30 am. I'm working from home and these are my hours. They say that eating alone is unhealthy as well, we might eat too fast, and I can tell that the loneliness gets worse around mealtimes for me. All i want, is to share something like that with a stranger. Not a mukbang, that'd make me lose my appetite, lol.

So, is there anyone who would want to give it a shot, and be my eating buddy? I'm going to cut off anyone who's inappropriate on camera, though. This is something i'm trying for real, and, i'm not looking for an unpleasant experience. 

Thank you for respectful answers, as this is my first Reddit post, and it took me sometime to gather the courage to find the right community ( I think?) and create that message.

OH and i'm speaking French and English:)

Looking forward to answers."

lonely,Give up on love,"Give up on love - Anyone feel so traumatized by the loss of love and the ensuing loneliness that you have given up on it and resigned yourself to be single forever? I feel like there is a shift from believing in love to giving up on it because it is too much work to start over again. For context, my marriage ended and my new post marriage relationship with another person is not going well. I felt both relationships have left me so lonely that I am kind of just giving up on it all together.

I just don’t think I will find someone to share my life with. Because it is just too hard, any maybe I want too much that the people I’ve chosen can’t give me…

Hope that all makes sense…"
lonely,Reading a lot of posts here and I dont belong here....,"Reading a lot of posts here and I dont belong here.... - I don't wanna be patronising and maybe its good in a way, what I want to say is, I have a loving family, two friends, although they don't live in the same city as me anymore, its still something, and here I was, a little sad that at the age of 25 I still haven't gone on a date yet and I felt I should look at my fellow loners here, and ohh boy, my definition of lonely and what you guys have to go through are two different things.

It has given me a perspective of being grateful for the things I have in my life, and although not having a girlfriend kinda makes me feel a little empty and I get afraid that I won't get to feel like what it's like to be in a relationship, I have it good and I should be thankful for it.

This is in no way a post mocking the people who use this sub as a shelter, just me and my ramblings"
lonely,It’s finally happening,"It’s finally happening - I have reached such a low, I’m surprised at myself. I would have never thought I’d feel this icky and not in my body. It’s like I’m just here but not here ya know. I had so much more to say but as always my brain isn’t functioning right now. 
Like why am I sad? 
Why do I feel this way? How can I get better? I could answer this one cause I’ve spent countless nights searching of ways to be happy and content but every time I do something or try to make a change it just feels strange. As if I am lying to myself, as if this person trying is not me. Like I am playing a character. And it’s not like I don’t have anything to be grateful for but it seems like everything I touch or do or whatever I ruin it. No matter how hard I try or how ever amount of time I put into. 

Sometimes I think back to my younger more innocent self, I was sad but I still had some much hope and faith in myself and sadly others. I used to see the world in such a way that it’s really scaring thinking about it now. But I guess that’s what youth is, maybe this is the thing everyone seems to be trying to find. 
Anyways this is merde and sorry you had to read it."
lonely,I don’t want to lose her,"I don’t want to lose her - I have a friend and I think that I’m losing her. We used to be much closer, but now it seems like we’re drifting apart from each other. I am almost always the one to initiate conversation with her nowadays, and the thought of it hurts me the more I think about it. I just want everything to be okay. 
I can’t blame myself for this even though I subconsciously want to. These last weeks I’ve been trying to reach out, and she hasn’t responded my calls. Maybe she’s also hurting? Maybe she just needs space? I wish I knew. I want to be there for her and I want to help her, but I don’t know how, or if I’m even able to do so at all…All I know is that I can’t handle losing another friend.

I’m desperately seeking adult interaction, but it’s just not there. - I’ve been married for 12 years and have children. I’m from another country and moved overseas to be with my husband. He was a different man when I met him. Very attentive, caring etc. Now I get nothing. Not even a conversation. I can’t say anything to him about how I feel because he will roll his eyes and say “here we go again”. I have moved with his line of work 8 times in the last 10 years, thousands of km’s each time. Each time I make friends, I have to leave them again. I was very sociable in my home country, surrounded by friends and family all the time. I was happy. Here, I had to give up my career to be home with the kids. The school hours are ridiculous where I am, I couldn’t work if I wanted to. My husband is always busy with work or away with work. He gets plenty of “adult time”, eats at restaurants, work functions etc. My life is spent being a mom, a home cleaner, a taxi driver and nothing else. I am alone all day. I often call my parents back home, but it’s not enough. At night once the kids are in bed, it’s just me and my own thoughts still. My husband will either gravitate to his phone or put the tv on. I just want to talk, but he says I have nothing interesting to say. I used to be the happiest, most outgoing person. Now I feel like a shadow of my former self. Anyone else craving some adult interaction?"
lonely,Why why why???,"Why why why??? - WHY did my parents flip a coin to give me a genetic disorder!? My dad did and does not have any symptoms, was just carrier, but chance of child inheriting it is 50%. A coinflip. A coin flip. I'm 25, have never had and will never find, love. Why? Read on...

Strangers openly make fun of me, stare at, or talk about me….

Had I not inherited the disorder, I would be tall- and good looking now. My parents and sister are good looking. My dad is tall, he has ZERO symptoms, he is only carrier of the gene. Symptoms include being short and strange face, large head, I get looked at. I'm always tired (another symptom), and have those ginger-freckles all over body (am not a ginger). I also laugh and moan in my sleep (this is a rare condition, lasts decades) – it’s really not funny to me…

Had I had the right side of the coin, I'd not have these problems. I wouldn't be forever alone. But my parents bet on heads, and it was tails. Lost everything, boom. 

There’s this brunette girl, by far the most beautiful I have ever seen and not as fake as other Instagram-people, I’m following on Instagram (she’s 24 I’m 25) but not only is she far away spatially but also in terms of chance. I’ll never have her! If it’s a rational feeling or not, it doesn’t matter! I can’t change how i feel! Why was I born? 

Damn it. Damn it. Damn it!!!!!!! 

*Man, it hits me several times a day.* I haven't felt joy in like 14 years. That's about right. And now I have to live, work, drag myself through the days because I can't top myself and my country only offers suicide-assistance to the terminally ill.

Before I can even finish my sentence she says “I don’t think that’s true” and I’m like, “well it’s on X website for work, and X supervisor and I were talking about it.” And she just says “oh lol.” 

This happens with her most of the time, but so many people in and out of work jump down my throat doubting what I say when I’m not even done explaining. I could understand that reaction if I was just full of shit but I’ve been right about everything I say, I don’t go around intentionally lying to people and if something is different it’s because things were changed after I was told.

Anybody else deal with this shit? It’s really starting to piss me off but she’s so fucking argumentative I can’t confront her."

I literally got tears of joy in my eyes. I arrived and tried to make an eye contact but it seemed like she didn’t notice me. when I called her name she acted like she didn’t hear me. I stood in place shocked, not understanding what’s going on. After I walked up little frustrated, I asked why does she keep ignoring me, and if she wants to actually talk since she was the one to text me. She said “We don’t have anything to talk about”.  She broke me. I cannot properly function. It’s been a week. I cannot ever tell anyone about this. How can someone so beautiful be so cruel. I can’t cry. I can’t scream.

I remember writing that if I had found the capacity to love it was under those bozos arms. the thing is the sweetness never lasts of course. I found out this week that my ever so lovely girlfriend had been cheating on me. It hurts even more because I still have love in my heart for her, which is now joined  with the ever so soul crushing loneliness of her absence.

From my balcony I can look down on the river, see people going by with friends, listening to music and drinking on their boats, dancing, laughing. I feel like a different species watching from above, like an alien, like I don’t belong here. We put more pressure on ourselves to enjoy holidays. Colleagues ask, what are your plans this weekend?

Life just sucks. People will say oh enjoy your alone time. Mate I've been alone this entire time. It's chill at first. The first year having no friends or anything was manageable. Now being around 7 years of this, it's unbearable and I just don't fit in society. 

I'm not a drinker or clubber and never have been. Seems to be everything younger people do and power to them for having fun, but suffering alone like this has just fucked me up so bad.

I literally am waiting for my mum (the last person I have) to pass and then I'm gone too.... It's such a vicious lonely cycle and I wouldn't wish this isolating pain on anyone.

lonely,"I crave my regular old loneliness, i cannot deal with this new loneliness.","I crave my regular old loneliness, i cannot deal with this new loneliness. - I am 24 now and i don't have a single friend. I have been lonely all my life. I never had a person i could share my thoughts and feelings with. I was dumped two weeks ago and it made me realise how pathetically lonely and miserable I am. Ever since then I am dealing with a new wave of loneliness everyday. 

I met her on an app, and we connected immediately. She would say exactly what I was thinking and I knew exactly what she wanted to say. We would talk, text, and send silly snaps to each other all throughout the day. She taught me her language and i taught her mine. We texted till 3-4 in the night and talk again the very next morning. We hadn't even met but it felt like we had known each other for years. She said that I made her world less lonely and she loved talking to me. 

I cried thinking that i finally found someone who cared about me, who enjoyed talking to me and wanted me. She would send me playlists titled ""i feel love"" and say that these songs said a lot more than she could say to me. For once in my life i got a taste of what love feels like.

2 weeks ago, out of nowhere, she said that she doesn't want to talk anymore and it would be the last time we would ever talk. She said i came to her mind as the day started and she wondered what would happen if we didn't talk that day. She said that she would always be alone and nothing i do will ever change that. She said that I deserve someone better. She said ""thank you and goodbye"".

Since then I'm so lost, so lonely. Every morning i have to deal with heartbreak all over again. Everytime my phone buzzes i immediately reach for it thinking that it's her. I feel like I lost the only good thing that is ever happened to me in my life. Only the last 3 nights i haven't cried myself to sleep. 

Regular loneliness felt better than this, I should have never tried at all."

lonely,Late 20s venting,"Late 20s venting - So i’m in my late 20s and have lost quite a few friendships and close relationships over the past few years. Many of which were during the pandemic. 

I also recently started taking space from my parents because we have a toxic family dynamic that I just needed a break from. My parents and my sibling are the only family members where I live. My sibling and I have never been close (despite trying as we have gotten older).

On top of that, my on and off bf for about 5 years and I finally “broke up”. (In quotes because it was often a situationship).

I’m really sad at times seeing people around me or on social media with what seems like close, genuine relationships. 

Sometimes I feel like this is a normal late 20’s experience and that my tribe will come to me naturally over time. Sometimes I feel like when relationships end, it’s so that other relationships that better suit who I am becoming can make their way into my life. Other times I feel shame about not having a tribe and spending so much time alone. I catch myself wondering if it actually is going to happen. Sometimes I have faith, other times I gave a lot of fear. 

I live in a very small city where everyone pretty much knows each other and it’s tough for me to feel a sense of belonging. I’ve considered moving but I just can’t afford it right now. 

Idk there are good days and bad days within this experience. I just wanted to vent in a safe space. There can be so much shame and discomfort talking about being lonely/alone/not having many friends/family etc."

lonely,"My hearts weeps, but I keep going","My hearts weeps, but I keep going - I have never had a woman, or very few men try to know me. I'm rather empathic and have a very high degree of eq intelligence. Due to this, I don't rend to get along with many people, and the people I do speak to, my words fly over their heads. Being an empath is hard because white, frankly, I have had no one in my life to relate to entirely. I feel like a single soul in a mall full of people. This also inevitably hurts because I've never had a partner. Sure I've slept with people, but it didn't feel right afterward and, honestly, left me feeling worse afterward. I cannot describe the level of loneliness to you, but I hope you can try to understand. I have tried therapy in the past, but I already know most of what they'll say or try to entertain, so I don't waste my time on it. I fear one day, someone will find me with a bullet in my head, all alone in my room. I don't want this to happen, but year after year, my loneliness keeps chipping away at my dimming heart. I'm not some sin story, rather just want to share my experiences and hope those who are lonely too find love eventually."

   No one would believe the things that go on in my head, Or the things that are heard and spoke. Living and loving from memory day by day.
I remember things from the past that have happy memories and some days I long for those dreams, but I know those dreams can never come back.
    Maybe my finite mind cannot possibly conceive what has gone on around me. Or maybe it does not want to, the thing is it does not change Anything that does happen to me.

For too long I have hidden away. I’m in sight but people don’t see me as I am. So quick I am to wear the armour. I feel safer concealed. They can’t hurt me when I’m hiding. They can hurt the exterior but never reach the inner walls. So many outer walls. Walls of pride, judgement, aloofness. And there are others like me too, I can sense when they’re near. We can see each others inner walls but they never touch. We may have moments, but they are too scary to bare. For fear that the other will harden against us, and we’ll have to add another layer. For every assault we harden.

But what if we needn’t feel alone, could we create a space for the fear? And let the recognition of each-others loneliness be enough to ease the pain. For shared burdens lighten the load, and life is too heavy to bare alone."

I have that with no one and I don't know how to have that with someone. It's just getting unbearable now even being around people because it causes me pain to witness other people have natural chemistry with each other and clique with each other.

lonely,Didn’t know things would get so lonely,"Didn’t know things would get so lonely - I am M 29 and I’ve tried to keep an open mind / optimistic attitude about this for years but I can’t help but feel like I’ve been drowning in solitude for so long now. It’s that same old slow, sinking feeling of not being close to anyone, of wanting to be wanted. I’m an outgoing person, with various interests, I get along with different kinds of people, no trouble starting/having conversations, I have a job, I live by myself in a fairly big city, I take care of my body and health, everything is good ""on paper"" but I just don’t have any real friends. I have old friends on IG who are more like just distant acquaintances now. I didn’t know it’d be this hard to form meaningful connections in my late 20s. I’m about to enter my 30s feeling very disconnected and very alone socially. I’ve been to various clubs and events since the pandemic restrictions ended so far this year, even made out with a few girls but nothing lasting or meaningful came out of it. I’m so tired of being the one seeking and chasing things. I’m sitting here in my apartment on a Saturday wondering what I’ll do tonight. I never get invited to anything. I’m just at a loss at how hard it is."

I can't help but notice it everytime I see people connect so easily with others, even worse when I see people in love. I don't hate these people, I don't know them, but there's this irrational anger inside me which, I think, stems from my own loneliness. I don't want to feel this way, this envy, it feels like poison and I don't want to turn into someone I don't like."

It's been so many months since I've talked to any other humans besides my parents and some few close friends of mine.

Not just that, my friends also are having sex almost all of it are not virgin anymore except me. I never have my first kiss or even holding women hand.

Almost every semester students from my uni are caught having sex or rumours of people having sex making me feel left out and depressed, I work out to have a better body but im just afraid to talk with girls. I think im destined to be alone."
lonely,I guess a romantic love was never in my cards... 33F,"I guess a romantic love was never in my cards... 33F - I married someone who is aggressive and mean. He constantly likes to point out my flaws and make me feel little. Like i get it, im ugly and fat, or as he likes to tell me, ""you're not completely hopeless and could be attractive if you lost some weight, but will never look like you did at 18 when we met"". He's 10 years older than me as well.

People are quick to just tell me to leave, but I can't. I'm disabled, rely on him to take care of me, my parents are super poor and my dad is going through chemo currently, so I would only be a burden to them that they couldn't afford. I don't have any friends. I'm great at pushing people away because I can be quite the negative Nancy, because life fucking sucks. Also, I've had some mental health problems and been inpaitent 40+ times over the course of 8 years. I made some shitty mistakes last time I tried to leave him and ended up in a hole in someone's basement for 6 months, no joke. Being abducted has everything to do with my mental health problems and why I was so unconcerned about being fat for a while.  I've lost 80 lbs now the last 8 months, or so. 
We have a daughter who is soon to be 9 and if I leave, he will certainly get custody. My mental health record, including suicide attempts, make sure of that. When I was 14 I fell 60' off a cliff while put with ROTC, it messed me up pretty badly, buy I recovered for the most part. I graduated early and got a bachelor's in organic chemistry, commissioned into the Navy, got a dishonorable discharge(long story), but managed to get shot in the abdomen during my service. I survived and got better and then got my master's in Chemical Engineering. Then got pregnant with my daughter and was so sick with her that I spent 4 months in the hospital and she came at 7 months. She was in a bad way for a little while, but she's just a normal kid now. Truly the thing I am most thankful for. If I left and he got custody of her I could never forgive myself. I'm trying to hold out until she's 18 and I no longer have to worry about whose custody she'll end up in. I needed a shunt placed 2 years ago and have it placed 4 times total. If you're unsure what that is, it's a catheter that runs to the ventricles of my brain and has a tube coming out the back of my skull(still under my skin) that feeds down through my neck and drains all the spinal fluid that shouldn't be building up into my brain into my abdomen so my body can reabsorb it. I have hydrocephalus, for which I take medication that's main side effect is weight gain. Then on top of that I had a brain tumor removed last October, a stroke in April and an aneurysm in May, both of this year. It's been a rough year. Ha. 

Anyway, I've rambled on enough about my existence. All I really want is to feel loved and wanted by someone romantically. Maybe there's someone in the same kind of shitty situation, but I hope not, for their sake. In the off chance there is maybe someone will message me. I'm not holding my breath. I'm used to being alone. I've grown accustomed to a damp pillow every night as I wish that God, or whatever cosmic power, would just end my suffering. 

I live in Texas, if that's important to the picture at all. 

I'm not so depressed all the time. I like to paint and draw and craft in general. I love music, movies and reading. 

My favorite music is Elliott Smith, Bright Eyes/Conor Oberst, Elvis Costello, Wilco, Belle and Sebastian, basically stuff like that. I also love jazz, mid 2000's emo, and a lot of random other stuff.

My favorites movies are Punch-Drunk Love, The Royal Tenenbaums, Ghost World, Magnolia, A Clockwork Orange, Goodwill Hunting, Mad Max, Aliens, Trading Places, American Psycho... you probably get the gist of it...

Books can probably be broken down by author, my favorite author is JG Ballard, although my favorite book is probably Infinite Jest. I also love reading Bret Easton Ellis, Don DeLillo, Cormac McCarthy, William S Burroughs. Thomas Pynchon, etc... 
I used to be really into comics and have a large collection. 150+ long boxes of them. The current state of super heros and comics in pop culture really put a bitter taste in my mouth about them and caused some disdain. Everything has to have an agenda these days it seems and with the MCU being so popular it started bleeding over into most comics.

I don’t know when it started, but I have slowly watched my bonds with others outside my family slowly rot. I have one very good friend who I hang out with less frequently due to his schedule so I have tried to make more friends. But let’s face it, I have failed miserably. Maybe it is just my personality, but I get my hopes up for no reason. I guess when you can’t lose much more and you have a chance I guess you just take it. I guess that is just me on Reddit, trying to make a friend who can be a friend not an “online” friend. I just find it funny how I know the odds are against me, yet I still try. I guess I am just afraid to be alone, so I am desperately trying to battle against the clock. But even now when writing this I just don’t care much if I make a new friend, I guess I have started to accept that I need to adapt to being alone. I guess I just need time to adapt to a life of having no one else at my side. I don’t think it would be bad necessarily, just an extreme adjustment. To conclude I have no reason why I am posting this because tbh who gives a damn about my problems because everyone has their own and because even if someone wants to help they probably are so far away from me that they cannot make the slightest impact."

Like the title says, I am a brat and a little and I'm searching for the dirtiest thing of all- a relationship. One with compassion, passion, empathy, understanding, communication, and healthy arguments. I know that's the most nitty gritty thing of all and if you're not interested, I understand. But if you are, you should know that my idea of a perfect date is straddling my daddy's lap while he feeds me sushi. I text in all caps when I get excited. I use bratting as an excuse to not be vulnerable. I'm fluent in sarcasm. I have amazing boobs. I have like 11 stuffies but I need more. I love white chocolate- both actual chocolate and men. I also am really attracted to East Asian men and fit/muscled men. I'm a bit chwubby, and at 5'2"" I'm also vertically challenged.

 I'm looking for someone who's going to be my friend or be crazy in love with me and vice versa. No in between. Lollll. As you can guess, from my posting here, I'm a bit lonely. I don't have many friends, and I either trust too easily or not at all. Please appreciate that this post is me being vulnerable-this is extremely hard for me. Since I lost my father in April of last year, I've gained 50 lbs and have bouts of depression. I know I'm asking a lot, but for me, I need someone I can click with instantly, someone I can banter with, someone who's gonna call me out when I'm wrong, and communicate when things aren't where they should be. However, it seems impossible to find this, and if I do find this, they ghost me after a few days or weeks of talking. I don't know where to go from here. Hmu if any of this appeals to you. ☺️☺️✨"
lonely,saw this post about being side character.,"saw this post about being side character. - I don't think I'm a side character necessarily but some of my experiences would count. I have had the most boring and dull dating and love life because there isn't much to share. I was basically a third wheeler of my best friend's high school relationship. At that moment I didn't think much of it because I liked the company of my bestie. We did so many things together so I wasn't really lonely. I saw their relationship blossom. They broke up anyway. She and I went to different cities for college and lost touch. I made a new group of friends(girls only) in college so that was great. Everyone knows first year of college is exciting because new friends, dates, love prospects. It kinda hit me during college parties that guys would approach my friends to talk, dance with them and I was left with one girl who was in the same position as I. I was kinda invisible. Not that I'm complaining I had the sweetest group of girl friends who made college life sufferable socially speaking. I always wondered why guys were not even interested to make acquaintance with me. That one time two guys expressed their interests in me via my girl friends never approached me irl. Idk why. I feel they ran out of options and probably looking for whoever was left. 

I reunited with my high school bff over a holiday break to escape my dull college life temporarily. I again witnessed her new relationship blossoming. Oh, I wish someone would make efforts to date me 😂. Meanwhile I was with a guy she introduced and we had 4 days fling not that I regret it. 

Not that I'm jealous of my friend's love life, I wish I had something similar. I don't even have a social life since covid happened. I would give everything to have friends over love. I don't mind being a third wheel/side character."

Anyways I’ve never really had friends like a group of ppl maybe even 2 or 3 that just stick. I had a friend group sophomore year of college but we ended up falling out bc one of the girls was using the N word and they were just kinda fake. I used to hit girls up I met at bars to hangout but after the bar I likely never see them again I guess because they already have their own friends, flake, or either they make no effort to befriend me. Should I put more effort into making friendships? I am a pretty well rounded person I would say I have a good sense of humor, chill, into a lot of cool stuff idk.

Also not to be vain but I guess some ppl just look at me and assume I either don’t like people or I’m stuck up bc I don’t have friends but I guess I have the look like I should have a friend group of that makes sense. I’ve done some modeling etc. 

I love my alone time but I also would love to just have a tribe someplace to call home, ppl to share memories with ppl who are excited to celebrate milestones together to travel with. I don’t have and I’m turn it’s causing me to be bitter towards ppl who appear to have a bunch of friends. Did I just get unlucky or what lol."

lonely,I'm feeling bad and I need to talk,"I'm feeling bad and I need to talk - Hi there :) So I´ve been feeling weird lately. Today has been quite a day and I just want to talk about it with someone, anyone. I just feel that I keep making mistakes with my decisions.

Well, I think I will write a lot since I have a lot in my head right now. My problems may not be as big as others, but I can't take them away from my head. And apologies if any of this is not well written or disorganized.

I can recall the moment everything started feeling weird. It was around high school. I met this guy and we became best friends. A year later he started to send me photos of him hurting himself and demanding my attention and help. I didn't know what to do at the time, but I know what happened after I told my parents. They changed me to another school. I kept contact with him even though I wasn't there to ""help"" him. I never told him that the reason I left was that my parents were worried about him being close to me, so I told him a made-up reason, keeping the friendship for some time. We were very lonely even then, and I felt guilty about leaving him alone. 

Maybe what happened next was karma? I don't know. In this new school, I made a lot of friends, and I fell in love for the first time. This girl was everything to me. I even presented my so-called best friend to her but I never asked her to go out, and everything ended badly after two years. She met someone else via online video games, so yeah. It was difficult to see her all the time, unable to talk to her as I did in the past. Even though I never asked her out, we both knew we liked each other, or well, at least she told me that. I really liked her. My so-called best friend decided to stop talking to me and get closer to this girl, so that hit me, but he was in his right to do that after leaving him alone.

After all that I became even lonelier. I wasn't able to talk to others as I did before. Most of my friends were her friends first, so I was heartbroken with just a handful of friends in school. In retrospect, I really appreciate them. They were really patient with me and my sadness. I'm afraid that being with my so-called best friend made me adopt some of his mindset, but I've never hurt myself. I was waiting for everything to end.

And it ended, for the most part, when I went to college. I decided to study medicine, it sounded really interesting. I met a lot of people and made really good friends. But then, COVID came, and everything went down. I think that being close to all these people was enough to make me feel happy. I wasn't even enjoying med school; I was good at it, but it just consumed most of my time when I was on campus. Maybe the ""free"" time I gained with virtual classes made me realize that being a doctor wasn't something for me.

So I left. I changed my career. And now I'm studying animation. And I don't know how to feel about it. On one hand, it is something I've ever wanted to do, but on the other hand, I'm scared; My parents don't trust these types of careers, and I think they have a point, not being well paid in my country. But I was feeling really bad while in med school, and I think I just decided with my heart? I don't know.

In this new career, I've also met very cool people. They are very different from my previous contacts but still really cool. I met a girl and we were close friends. We talked a lot while having virtual classes, and when campus classes returned, we went out... for a while. I decided to end that relationship after noticing how she wasn't for me for lots of reasons, and now I'm alone. I feel alone.

And this loneliness is not letting me sleep. I keep thinking about everything, about every mistake I made. Should I have stayed close to my so-called best friend even though I felt manipulated? Should I have kept my feeling to myself and talked to anyone after my heartbreak? Should I have kept studying med school even though I wasn't feeling it? Should I have kept my relationship? I think that most of my decisions aren't making me happy. They make me lonelier and lonelier, losing every friend I make on the way.

By this time, I'd be graduating from med school as my comrades are. I'd be at that great party I keep seeing on my Instagram. I don't know how to feel about anything. I keep seeing all the posts my ex-girlfriend keeps posting with her new boyfriend, and FYI it is not that I want to go out with her again, it's just that I want to feel good that fast again, as I think she is.

I have my family. They've been always there for me, at least most of them. But it makes me feel sad that I'm unable to keep in contact with someone else, someone I found and decided to keep close to me. Am I really that distant to others?

And that's it.

Thank you for reading and goodnight. I hope everyone is able to sleep."
lonely,Good to be back here,"Good to be back here - I was here 6 years ago. Ever since childhood I have been alone and depressed. I remember having random bursts of tears with no one to listen to. Then 6 years back, I got an amazing group of friends and a few girlfriends because of them. I exited this place. Slowly over the years I lost everyone and now down to square one but with added features of new trauma, cheating, heartbreak, feeling of being an asshole, regrets, loss and a whole new level of loneliness. Been scrolling through depression related posts for the past two weeks. Right now, I have no one in my life. Literally no one. I'm not even looking for people, I'm just trying to distract myself till I die."
lonely,i am worthless,"i am worthless - i don't know where else to turn. i'm not even resorting to using a throwaway because i'm so desperate for somebody to see me. i have poured all of me into vessels that will never pour back. if it wasn't for my children....i wouldnt be around to type this right now,

&amp;#x200B;

recently ended a years long relationship because i suspected my ""partner"" had relapsed and returned to his DOC. i asked him to stay at his mother's house...he obliged. that's when i knew. no fight, not an iota of effort. he just went. he went because it was true. 

&amp;#x200B;

now,,.here i am. three beautiful, deserving, perfect babies....a mortgage...utilities...responsibilities that  he walked away from, leaving on my shoulders....all for meth. my older kids are off from school for the summer, my toddler is too young even for pre=kinder. i cannot afford childcare as I have tlo stay home with all three...i have zero friends. as far as family...i've got my mother and she helps beyong what i think is even acceptable.;.but she's elderly and has a heart condition that's triggered by stress. stress she is taking on because of my choice in a partner. i met a sober person who loved me and my 2 children....so much so that my last child, is his first, that he begged and begged me to give him. and now we are left behind with no way to get by, no support of any kind, no hope...nothing.

i'm drained, i'm sad, i'm angry. i'm lost. i'm alone.

can somebody, please....just be my friend? i literally have none. nobody. nothing. i'm so scared and alone and i am trying. i'm trying so hard. i slip into my bedroom to cry as quietly as i can so that my children don't see me break. i go through the motions as best i can so that i don't fall apart where they can hear or see. i don't know how much longer i can do this. i have to, for them. i HAVE to. but i sometimes i feel sp worthless and used and stupid. how did i not act when i saw the signs? how did i continue to e courage myself to love someone who only existed in my mind and cling to a life he never provided? i'm so desperate for some form of connected. will anyone ever notice me?"

Half my friends won't even give me as little as a hug. I'm tired, I just want love, that's not too much to ask for is it? I just wanna be held and actually feel safe for once in my life. I wanna get butterflies when that special someone talks to me. I want to be able to cuddle when I'm in a shitty mood. I just wanna be held man. I need safety."

lonely,My parents keep scrutinizing me for not having any friends.,"My parents keep scrutinizing me for not having any friends. - My father comes to pick me up from school everyday and as always, I come out all alone while all the others are laughing and joking with their friends. And when we reach home, he keeps ranting about my situation without giving me a single tip or advice on what and how can I do to get over this situation and start anew. But my life wasn't always like this though, when I was in the younger classes, I used to have very much reliable and a good quantity of friends who accepted me even though I was actually never good at making friends but then, all of a sudden, the school changed our sections so we could make more and new friends and, all of my previous friends got into different sections and I had to start anew but the pandemic came, lockdown started, couldn't socialize with anyone and as I never took online classes seriously and would not pay attention, I failed to answer questions asked by the teachers to me and that gave a very strong impression of who I am but no. The ones that were in my previous classes who might not be my friends but they still know that I'm in the top 10 out of 66 students. I used to be one of the Toppers and would have random classmates tell me how fast my brain worked or something something but I feel like they forgot by now :( 
So, everyone avoids me thinking I'm dumb. Idk why I'm laughing but the way I'm wording this seems like that of a 10 year old lmao. And yes, our offline classes started a month ago and I couldn't make anyone my friend even the girl that I sit with doesn't talk to me. I just want to graduate out now. And my mom shouts at me too because I'm too 'boring' and 'ugly'. Can you imagine your mom being like that?"

lonely,My bf left me for his ex,"My bf left me for his ex - I wish i could say im surprised but im not. No matter how many times he tried to deny it, she was always “the one”. I (21F) used to tell him (back when we were just friends)how they were soulmates and straight out of a romcom. Don’t get me wrong I know he loved me and cherished me but once his ex came back in town during thanksgiving .. things slowly started to change. She started working closely with him and feelings started to bubble up. He finally broke and confided in his mom about his conflicting emotions (march). What he didn’t know was his mom invited me over for dinner and i heard his rant coming down the stairs. It was pretty funny seeing his mom greet him and say “oh i invited-“ he then interjects and has a meltdown rant. Oh boy was it awkward… could u imagine the look on his face when i walked into the kitchen. I wish i could hate him and say he was a backstabbing liar and cheater but from his heart wrenching rant i believe him. He loves me but he also loves her and despite not even doing anything with her. He wanted to break up because it was the right thing to to do. So we spent the night crying together, reminiscing on our love and finding closure. Honestly we didn’t even get into the meat of the problem i just kinda accepted it. Theres no doubt in my mind he was in love with me, everyone knew it but for months we slowly became loving best friends. How am i holding up you might be asking..? Terribly :) he was my whole world and my first love, i was the loneliness person before i met my super funny and cheeky tutor. I was pretty nervous getting tutored by a masters student but good god was he a baby. I never laughed and blushed more in my life, he was unabashedly flirtatious and cheeky but also comforting and respectful. He showed me videos of his kitties, convinced me to buy these super cute squishmallows, and gave me a life lessons.. all in one tutoring session. We instantly became friends and soon lovers, I’ll never regret the year and a half I spent with him because it was the best year of my life. He helped me overcome so many obstacles and taught me about vulnerability, and falling in love. He was so beautiful and his energy was magnetic. Now I feel lonely and empty all over again, i’m back in my regular old routine. I miss him sooo much it kills me but i know it wasn’t meant to be. Despite not being together he still asks about me from to time, which warms my heart. He doesnt know that i know he asks my mom about me, its cute and heartwarming. I should probably tell him its ok to reach out and send me a text or call but we both know its best to keep our distance for now. Lord knows my attachment issues can’t handle having him back in my life just yet. But ya.. thats my story :) I fell in love and honestly it probably wont happen again but im thankful it did. I just spend my days doodling in my notebook (that he got me), watching movies on my projector (that he got me), watching the stars at night in his hoodie and the telescope he bought me for Valentine’s day. I snuggle in the hello kitty blanket he got me from our trip to disney, and most of all, I wear the pendant he gave me on my birthday. It belonged to his grandmother but he gave it to me because his granny said and i quote “keep her around, shes got a good soul and a beautiful smile” Of course i tried to give it back since it was such a meaningful gift but he refused and said “its yours, mama chose you and i know you’ll take good care of it”. So now i sit here playing with her necklace, scrolling through reddit wondering where do i go from here. Should I dye my hair red? I always wanted to but was always too scared. Should I go take myself out to dinner? I always wanted to but was always too scared. Should I follow through on our vacation plans and go to greece? Honestly idk, but hey i’m open to any suggestions :)

Sincerely,

Not-Over Him Olivia (p.s english isnt my first language so excuse my poor writing)"

lonely,I will never be happy,"I will never be happy - My sadness and loneliness is getting so intense, I can't find the proper words to say anymore. I constantly fantasize about having friends or people that genuinely love me or enjoy having me around or anything like that. It's not hard for me to make friends, but I want something genuine. I want to feel loved. I have one friend that I barely talk to and a couple of acquaintances on social media but that's it. No friendship where I felt actually cared for lasted. It's my fault. I'm too clingy and easily attached when anyone shows me basic love. I hate it, I hate myself. I am the reason for my own sadness. I've wasted my teenage years having breakdowns and being in and out of psych wards so I never had the opportunity to make friends. I know I still have my life ahead, but I don't see a future for myself. I feel so defeated. I just need some love. Please."

lonely,Its stressful how likely this is to be my life from now on,"Its stressful how likely this is to be my life from now on - I'm 31. Been alone almost every day for 7 years now. Up until then had a completely normal life. This was always supposed to be a stop gap, but then it dragged on. I have no friends. I look for hobbies but its just like stuff like kung fu, or board games, or some sports...I'm sorry but thats just not it man. Your supposed to have people in your life at this point. The likelihood of me salvaging my life by playing some board games or going to meet ups (which I've tried) is just not likely.

I'm starting to realize all the meaning in my life is just shit in my head. Theres no people. Yheres no real meaning. Its hard to put into words. 

If this had been my life, had I been molded to it, expected this it would have been one thing. But there was nothing to suggest it would be this shitty. Its not supposed to be this shitty. 

I'm not lazy. I don't like at home. I'm not thst reclusive. Its just the options that exist are mostly bad options for dudes. 

Nobody watched ""HER"" and went ""why doesn't the guy get some hobbies? I'm just hoping that helps convey it. Or Barry before acting school, or whatever. You can just get completely detached out here."

lonely,"Completely heartbroken, just need a friend I can hug","Completely heartbroken, just need a friend I can hug - I () a very extroverted person, but have been lacking social interaction for a long time. I’m also the type of person who needs hugs, primarily from friends that I trust. 

Anyways, I had plans to see a new friend this weekend. We’d only talked for a couple of weeks, she’s a friend of a friend and we started talking through social media. We were planning it for the better part of a week, and me - suddenly developing intense feelings for her - was super excited. I had butterflies all week, a mix of positive (because of extreme excitement), and negative (had been left on read for two days, but she’d just been busy and didn’t have time to reply). I couldn’t stop thinking about her. This week at work was especially tough, and I was just looking forward to seeing her like you wouldn’t believe. All week, she never left my mind.

Tonight, less than 24 hours before our scheduled hangout, our plans fizzled out. She was no longer comfortable with the idea of hanging out with me - fair enough. I do really appreciate that she was fully honest with me and told me the straight up truth. 

I’m now devastated. The window of opportunity id been hoping and praying for for months was slammed shut before anything even happened. Even if we could have just had one hug or just seen each other one time, that would have filled all the cracks in my already shattered heart. 

I don’t have anything against this girl for what happened, actually I’m really thankful because I wouldn’t have wanted her to be uncomfortable. 

I’m sure I did something wrong; I don’t know what. All I know is I dropped my heart into the blender again. I was going to make an IG story saying I’d be taking a break and to please message my cell instead… before realizing there’s no one who would aside from a couple guy friends who I don’t feel super connected to. 

I’m just defeated. I need a female friendship. I need someone to hug and to hang out with and make memories with. I feel desperate to find someone I can grow close to and then work towards reaching the stage of having a relationship and living the rest of our lives together for God, and for Jesus. 

But no, even more heartbreak. I’ll wait my turn, but it’s not getting any easier. I need a long meaningful hug and some one on one time with someone. 🥺"

She says she's attracted to me, that I'm one of the funniest people she knows, but I can't help but feel like she's lying or that I'm going to fuck it all up like I do everything. I'm not attractive, I'm a disgusting 400 in piece of shit, the only reason I don't look like a pile of flesh is that I'm lucky enough to be tall and have a large stature. I'm so worried that even if she actually is attracted to me and likes me that I could never be good enough for her. I don't know, maybe this is all just stupid for me to be typing out, I mean, I am drunk off whiskey at the moment, but even when I'm sober these thoughts are there in the back of my mind."

lonely,I’m so fucking lonely…,"I’m so fucking lonely… - I have no one. I don’t blame anyone for being lonely. I just have no one; I never had the courage to go make friends. I had a girlfriend for the first time just a little bit after my 18th birthday. I loved her so much. She was my only friend, and I poured myself into her. I only wanted to make her happy, I didn’t care about myself, if she was happy so was I. But only a few months into the relationship things started getting Ricky and after 2 days of arguing, she left me. I’ve had no one except a cat that I got a few days ago. I love him but it’s not the same as having someone who can listen to you. So I’m alone again with what feels like nothing. I feel like an empty shell with no purpose. During the relationship, I was in a really dark place, not because of the relationship, just mentally, and I harmed myself. Now that I’m alone again, I was able to hold off for about a month and a half, but I cut into my arm again. It was only a few cuts, but I made sure they hurt. It didn’t make me feel better like I thought it would. I’m still probably going to do it more though because I don’t know how else to deal with my pain. Sorry for the long pity story, but I had to vent."

I'd rather have no friends than to have ones that may influence me in a negative way subconsciously.   
And I have a firm belief that the majority of people have low moral standings, unchangeable bad habits, play the victim in life, etc, just based on what I've seen of people around me, in highschool/college/work/social media. Which makes me reluctant to even bother much with forming relationships.

Because this has been going on for years, i feel kinda uncomfortable hugging friends (i don’t think i enjoy it idk its weird)so i don’t do it. Now i’m just touch deprived and i feel so so lonely.

I just find it funny that I remember there always being at least one girl in high school that seemed at least a little interested in me -- and this was back when I was 20 pounds heavier with a Ringo haircut and stupid fuckin glasses. I was a dork, and yet I remember a couple girls showing interest. I figured it'd only be uphill from there, right? 

Yeah no. 


I took the internet's advice when I stopped liking the thing looking back at me in the mirror every morning. I took up new hobbies,  started exercising and getting a new taste in music. Goodbye glasses, hello new hairstyle... And it seems like I took a huge leap backwards. 



When I realized I was 20 years old and haven't even been on my first date yet I started getting worried about my future. I began second guessing myself and the negative thoughts ramped up to 100 after that point. ""Maybe you don't deserve to be loved. You **are** pretty ugly, after all..."" 


But then I normally reply with ""ugly guys get girls all the time"" and then I'm hit with ""yeah but they're at least TALL"" and that's that. I'll never understand the people on here that are somehow still lonely regardless of being married. They **won** the game - found someone to spend the rest of their lives with. Their best friend, their lover. 


... I had one of those once. Nowadays if I think about her too hard, I cry. Well, that's technically not true. I haven't wept in years. Sure I'll shed a tear or two, but that's got zero relevance to the post I'm trying to make. 
Back then I wasn't worried about this shit. I was in blissful ignorance and that caused girls to be interested. Now that I'm more aware about the stupid shit I do and the way I act, suddenly all that interest dried up. Gone, like an angel's kiss. 


I uh.. I'm not even sure my heart could be in it if a woman did show up wanting to be with me at this point. Then again if that happened, Hell must've frozen over and the gates thereof rusted shut so I guess there's that"
lonely,"Going to probably lose my lay friend, never going to find another, but somehow I am starting to become at peace","Going to probably lose my lay friend, never going to find another, but somehow I am starting to become at peace - I don’t know when it started, but I have slowly watched my bonds with others outside my family slowly rot. I have one very good friend who I hang out with less frequently due to his schedule so I have tried to make more friends. But let’s face it, I have failed miserably. Maybe it is just my personality, but I get my hopes up for no reason. I guess when you can’t lose much more and you have a chance I guess you just take it. I guess that is just me on Reddit, trying to make a friend who can be a friend not an “online” friend. I just find it funny how I know the odds are against me, yet I still try. I guess I am just afraid to be alone, so I am desperately trying to battle against the clock. But even now when writing this I just don’t care much if I make a new friend, I guess I have started to accept that I need to adapt to being alone. I guess I just need time to adapt to a life of having no one else at my side. I don’t think it would be bad necessarily, just an extreme adjustment. To conclude I have no reason why I am posting this because tbh who gives a damn about my problems because everyone has their own and because even if someone wants to help they probably are so far away from me that they cannot make the slightest impact."

lonely,I guess I have to accept living in loneliness,"I guess I have to accept living in loneliness - I'm getting used to the idea of not ever finding her at this age (29M) or finding a group of friends to go out with. I've been like this since 8th grade.

I came to the realization that I might as well do things on my own like traveling the world, go out to bars, the movies, etc, living life by myself while fighting negative thoughts of loneliness and no love life."

I wish I was drunk but I don't have any alcohol on me. Please God why is it so hard for people to care about me. No one listens. Please I just wish

lonely,Alone every weekend,Alone every weekend - Feeling rejected or like a runt. Alone last weekend and it was a long weekend. Alone on this weekend… again.

lonely,dating app for cuddling?,"dating app for cuddling? - I recently broke up with my long-term girlfriend. I'm having a bit of trouble, and what I usually find comforting in situations like this is... well, cuddling with my girlfriend...

At the same time as I go through the normal emotional break-up process, I'm also facing a kind of ""physical affection withdrawal"".

I'm very much not at the point where I want to start another relationship, but I really just want someone to hold. Someone to just casually be around, hang out with, but also with an explicit goal of physical affection. I'm not talking about sex, literally just some form of comforting physical contact.

There are plenty of options for finding someone to have meaningless one-night stands with, or start a serious relationship, but is there any dating app where people go for a ""more casual"" physical relationship? Is this a thing? Is it really weird to be seeking something like this?"
lonely,Goodbye,Goodbye - A lot have change the past years I had my ups and downs I finally broke up with my abusive ex  I been talking to a friend that I been knowing over 2 years we got together and it feels amazing my first healthy relationship it’s not always about sex but it’s being there for each other and communicating telling them how you feel no matter what if it’s bad or good and then trust I feel like I find my safe place and I’m just happy that I got to share it with you.

They don't know how it feels to be trapped in your own mind
Of wanting to scream but not being physically able to
You're always looking at them through bulletproof windows, unable to beg for help no matter how hard you try
And they live
And they love
And you suffer
This cycle is draining
Truly devastating
I feel like a worm controlling the husk of a once living man
A shell of skin and bone and rot
It's fragile, it's weak
And what lies beneath is unsightly
They never want to look within
They never care
They are living their own stories
And the whisper of a past life fades away slowly
Like water on a hot skillet
Quick
Sudden
Final..."
lonely,It just hit me out of nowhere tonight,"It just hit me out of nowhere tonight - It’s like as soon as I thought maybe today was good, it hits me. The loneliness.

lonely,I am too high-maintenance or loony.,"I am too high-maintenance or loony. - This probably won't make sense, just typing as I think for the most part. 

I think I have and will forever struggle to make friends. This could be online or in real life. I don't think I've ever truly like a person ive talked to in real life or online. It seems like a single flaw can escalate into a plethora of them. It feels like once a person ""makes a mistake"" they're forever less than what I thought they were worth. Which doesbt make much sense even thinking about it. That is just how I feel. 

I feel hopeless. The ebb and flow that is my emotions are just filled with sadness and manic behavior. I feel hopeless.

When I do find people I think are just brilliant, It seems surreal. I guess I attempt to break this friendship not sure how till after. And when the friendship is over there is momentary relief followed by a long sadness. 

When talking to anyone it seems that they take pity on me and it immediately makes everything seem so worthless. 

I recently made a friend who is definitely like-minded and messed it up, I think ill give up trying in a few. They were a lovely talk but it just felt bad a lot. I have made one friend that has stayed for about 3 years, although I am certain he will leave me since he has made other friends and has also gotten a job. I feel forgotten. I feel bad. 
I hope anyone reading this has a similar thought process, or well I hope you dont, but if you do then maybe youre not so alone. 

anyway bye people"

lonely,I can't escape even in loneliness.,"I can't escape even in loneliness. - Whenever I feel bad I like to do something soothing for myself instead of being pure misery. Tonight I'm lighting a beeswax candle.

I just wrote a post looking for friends but it was automoderated. Now I don't want to make friends. But I'll tell you what I'm thinking about.

Every major relationship of my life has been with a cluster B. This feels bad because there's a point where you realize it's your fault. Eventually I met someone who ruined my life. I have an Amber Heard. I thought I would be alone forever after that relationship. I was old, my nerves were shot, my personality had changed, my looks faded as my hair fell out. R\*pe had changed me so much I didn't think I would ever enjoy intimacy again. I worried I would be angry forever and I turned out to be anxious forever. I felt convinced I was too much of a loser for anyone to love again.

My reason for going on was my Cats and the possibility of healing and maybe even following my dreams.

After a couple years I met someone. Another cluster B. In a way I've improved a lot because I walked away from it and stopped caring where I was never able to do that before. Since that time I haven't cared about relationships. The few messages I get I always ignore. I don't trust them. I feel certain that I'll be rejected for the loads of emotional baggage I keep.

Lately I've been extremely stressed because I've been legally harassed for five years and soon I will be called back to court by the woman who ruined my life. The reason is to ensure that I can never talk about my life. This is the kind of loneliness that causes deep despair. No-one even cares. But even if they did I can't tell them what happened."
lonely,working alone is so depressing,"working alone is so depressing - I work at a theme park. you know places that are exciting with people laughing, festivals, roller coasters, drinking all that?  but I'm fucking miserable. I have no friends here.I work in a gift shop alone I don't talk to anyone besides costumers. Not even anyone to text back and forth thru out the day.

I take photos of happy couples on dates everyday. selling photos of them kissing on roller coasters. happy families with their siblings taking group photos. Groups of dudes having the time of their lives with their best friends.

Just to go home alone.. in my dark room and play videos games alone. Sleep and repeat the next lonely day. I'm so tired of day dreaming about relationships. I wish I knew what they were like so bad. I'm 25 pathetically lonely."
lonely,How does one fuck up so badly unintentionally?,"How does one fuck up so badly unintentionally? - Idk how i let that happen. I always seemed different and i knew it, yet i didn't do anything with it. I always thought ""Ah its probably a phase, everyone had one i'll be fine later"". Years later nothing changed, its worsened in the last year. I started feeling like a spectator, like im on autopilot that i didn't set up. I stopped feeling feelings, and when i feel something its me blowing up with anger, and then when im done being furious i feel nothing again.  
This is a living hell. I started to forget bad memories i had, and i do not remember last time i was happy.   
Sleep is the only thing that gives me feelings, i have feelings only when i dream, i wake up kind of satisfied when i had a dream where i could feel something, anything. It feels so good to feel. This is fucked up. I want to sleep longer but i can't fall asleep easily.

I always distracted myself from this prison playing games but it doesn't work anymore, nothing does. I fucking hate myself and always did, i always did everything for others, i always helped others, never myself just because i despise myself so much. I wish i didn't exist, someone else in my body would have a far better life then i do, me and wasted oxygen i leave. Now so that anybody doesn't think, i do not want to kms, i just wish i wasn't born.

If not for my nature of doing everything for everyone, i might have already not been on this world. Since i am the way i am, i can't just die, i wouldn't want to let down or hurt my parents, my brother, family in general, they would blame themselfs which is not what i want. Still, its not like i have anyone else i could let down further more than the way i did up until now.  
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

Its friday again, woo fucking hoo another 2 days of torturing myself from inside with thoughts dissociating and trying to force myself to sleep coz i cant stand the real world and doing absolutely nothing i just cant wait.

Probably no one will read this whole fucking book, and thats fine. I guess i just had to say this somewhere since there is no one i could share that with comfortably. Of course it is easier to share that to someone who doesn't know you. Of course.

And to whoever actually read all that, i wanted to thank you and wish you best of luck with whatever you yourself are going through, hopefully at least luck can help some of you out here."
lonely,I hate this friend,"I hate this friend - You know, I make oc (original character) and I roleplay with them with other people's oc's. Problem is, I found this person a while ago, everything was fine. But, she never understood no matter what I said. She made it about her when it wasn't even near her. Then she started to treat me like shit and even my oc's. They are not objects, they are a part of me. But she never understood that, and I definitely don't understand why people are still friends with her. I never thought her as a friend, my intuition always saying 'no, she's not your friend, she'll betray you'. And she did. Then I blocked her, and unblocked her to say something. It wasn't mean or anything. But she blamed me for blocking her and said she never did anything. Then said she wasn't mad when I told her she was pissing me off. Like bro, I know you are. In our community, we take our oc's and make couple out of it. I asked her if she still wanted my oc shipped with hers, and she said 'do whatever you want'. Like I said, my oc's are a part of me. She litteraly threw it in the trash like it was nothing. She was always being mean like that, and always said she wasn't. Maybe that's why my ex-bff insulted you. Her oc's are cool to be honest, but she's so picky that I only got one with her, and the others got alot! I just hate her so much! I hate to be left out or ignored, even more. If it happens, I immediatly feel like crap and wants to destroy everything. I could that about her for so long, but I can't on the platform, her friends (which follow my stuff) will report it to her and she'll start putting everyone against me, even thought I have all the proof she did the bad stuff. So yeah, I just blocked her, and now I feel bad because my kind side wants her back. She's shit, I won't let her back in my life. She already ruined my trust 4 times. She won't get anymore chances."
lonely,90s songs are attacking me,"90s songs are attacking me - A more light-hearted post. But I having a few drinks and listening to a 90s playlist on Spotify for some of that good old nostalgia.

Then the song ""There She Goes"" by the La's started playing next...

lonely,Trapped Myself Somehow,"Trapped Myself Somehow - So, I’ve had a rough go at life for the past couple of years. Slowly, I realized that I didn’t have any friends anymore (lack of interaction / got rid of most of my social media) and I was spending pretty much all my time on the PC (Covid didn’t help). And now I realize I’ve become too quiet. I’ve spent too much time on my own thinking to myself instead of speaking out loud. It’s gotten to the point that I’m more comfortable with silence than conversation. You’d think I’d be lonely but I don’t feel that way at all (I don’t thinks that’s a good thing though). 

I’m in my 20’s and I want to go out and meet people but I literally struggle to find the willpower most days to try (rather consume content or game most days). If y’all have any ideas for my introverted quiet ass I would greatly appreciate cause I know this isn’t a healthy lifestyle but I feel like I’ve trapped myself in it."

Because of this she always try’s to get me to smile or speak to others even when I don’t want to.
I’ve told her multiple times that I’m introverted or like to do things when I feel like it and as an extroverted person she just doesn’t get it and calls me “boring” or brings up what other kids are doing and how all kids are supposed to be naturally sociable. Sometimes I wonder how Extroverted people can be so sociable and free and know what there doing and it makes me feel like an outcast and puts  pressure on me to be something I’m not. I’m only a teenager but I wonder if I’ll ever be able to socialize like my Mom or be able to naturally talk to people without feeling “burned out” and wanting to be alone."

lonely,[17f] remarkably lonely,"[17f] remarkably lonely - I want to preface this by saying that, overall, I am okay. I’m in a safe environment and have a good family and I don’t totally despise myself all the time. I just wanted to rant and get some words off my chest. 

I’m currently homeschooled. I’ve been in and out of public school since I was in fourth grade. When I go, I’m usually pretty quiet. Most of the time I can make one solid friend and just be cool with a couple others. One hundred percent of the time these friendships don’t last. So right now, I have no friends. I just wake up and go about my day without talking to anyone but my family. If I think about it for too long I get kind of emotional, but it could be worse. I’m lucky because I actually enjoy spending time with my family. 

So like, nearly a year ago, I was in my first relationship. He was a great guy but that was my first relationship and things moved way too fast and the dude talked about marriage and things like that, so I kind of panicked and broke up with him. In hindsight, I could’ve handled things way better but we also weren’t going to last even if I did. Wish him the best. 

After that I ghosted my best friend. She was such a bad friend to me, I don’t even feel bad about it. I knew she was a gossip but I never expected her to put me into a bad light. I’m not flawless but she just had no respect for the sanctity of friendship. 

After that, I was friends with another girl who was also going through it at the time. She ghosted me when she felt better, which is okay. No hard feelings and I hope she’s doing good today. 

So now I’m back where I’ve been countless times. There’s no one to talk to. Since those events, I’ve grown a lot and genuinely think I’m ready for friendships and relationships and all that jazz, but I don’t know what to do. I’m going into my senior year next year at an actual school, and I just feel like no one’s open to making new friends. Like everyone already knows everyone and has established relationships with other people, and that I’d just be invading a space where I’m not really wanted. Honestly, I’m pretty funny and have been told that I’m charismatic a few times, but I have no clue how to befriend people in an environment where I’m extremely uncomfortable and nervous and they’re probably over with the year the second they stepped foot on campus. 

I’ve worked on myself so much. I go the gym, I’m happy (just lonely), I no longer have unrealistic or toxic expectations of other people, and think I’d be a good person to have any sort if relationship with (friendship, acquaintance, romantic, etc…), I’m just so scared because what if i’m not? Two years ago, I thought something was so inherently wrong with me that me being friends with someone would be an actual bad thing to happen to that someone. That i would ruin their life by just existing in it, or that I was just lacking something that everyone else wasn’t— and that was why no one would be with me. I mean, when i was 14, I thought I was so ugly and grotesque that I swallowed whatever pills I could get my hands on, and now, a few weeks ago, some really sweet little girl told me I was pretty in Target and i don’t hate myself when I look in the mirror— so I know I’ve improved, but what if who i am as a person isn’t enough? I want to be enough so badly because I could really, really love someone, and I’d be good at it, but what if these relationships just never happen for me? No one owes me friendship or love, no matter how much I’d show up for them or make them laugh or yearn for it. 

And I’m gonna throw in a suicide TW just to be safe. 

I’m happy, really, I am. I know my worth and I know my faults. I don’t want to die, I haven’t wanted to die for a long time. But I remember my life beforehand, and I can’t live in that state forever. I’m happy right now, but that loneliness is so strong. I’m hanging on because I’m young and things can still get so much better, but this loneliness has been following me since I was thirteen. I cannot carry it with me till I’m 26, mattering to no one but my grandma, mom, and sister. I love them so much but I can’t feel like this for that long. 

Thanks for reading. I know I probably sound selfish or entitled, I’m trying hard not to be and I apologize. If anyone wants to hit me up and talk about literally anything, loneliness, music, share pet pictures, video games even though i don’t play them, etc…I’m down. I hope you guys feel better and have a good day, there’s always someone that cares about you and you’re not alone."

I’ve never been so angry in my life. I try to be as helpful and kind to everyone but no one cares. I’ve never had anyone truly thank me or tell me I’m important accept my parents. Girls always insulted me and the one time a girl asked me out was a prank set up by my presumed friend. My teachers are my best friends and I know they would disagree from their side. I can’t even look at my teachers anymore, I’m to pissed of to make eye contact with people. 

I don’t know If this makes any sense, I just don’t know any emotion after today. I’m happy when outside of school but when I sit to rest I can’t help but spiral.

Take care of your selves guys.

And no, “high sucks for everyone” is an excuse to just say “cheer up” which is bs"

As an adult, i can't make friends and don't really go anywhere. So i mostly entertained myself and now that habit's stuck with me as an adult.

I spend all day, every day recording voice over, writing play scripts/short stories/books, or filming random crappy youtube videos and skits. I'm by myself for all these activities and they take up most of the day. I want to meet someone...but i can't see myself giving up these hobbies and i don't know how to truly balance these. Because if i keep at it, someone might want to buy my scripts or hire me as a voice actor or i might get a YouTube partnership, instead of living off disability forever. I can't work because of health problems so creative endeavors are my only way out.

What the hell do i expect? It's my own fault.

lonely,I have not had friends since elementary school,"I have not had friends since elementary school -  Ever since then, everyone's been distant. In middle school, the only ""friends"" of any sort that I made would ditch me every time they got a chance, always staying with the popular crowd and leaving my nerdy ass behind. It got worse in high school. Basically no one stays around me outside of class. I like to imagine that I have a friend group, but that's probably the greatest lie I've ever told myself. None of them ever spend time around me; I have to actively seek them out. They never converse with me, and it always feels like I'm that one stupid kid that tries their hardest to belong. Everyone seems to know each other, and it feels like basically everyone has moved on in their social lives, with social circles, girlfriends, and hangouts. Meanwhile, I have never hung out with a girl for any length of time outside of girls forced to speak to me in class, and getting invited to anything ever would be an absolute pipe dream.

lonely,Dormant loneliness and building of Psychosis,"Dormant loneliness and building of Psychosis - 
For a while I () have been alone. I come home to an empty home everyday for the past maybe 2 years and now all my friends left me. At the beginning of the year, my closest friend had decided she needed more friends and as a result had left me for more popular and active people. I understand it honestly, all i like to do is sit around and talk maybe go hiking, but they’re more of a party person. Now im alone. Even before this i have felt alone but ignored all thought of it because they were in my life, now i have to face the fact that i dont have anyone. I often have dreams where I just hangout with people i wish i could be around. I use it as a way to lie to myself and pretend like i have an active social life. I have severe memory loss and auditory hallucinations and i work 5 days a week for 10 hours a day. So im busy and never have time to address my problems. My hallucinations suck cause i tend to hear my friends voices or other people and my memory loss makes it so after a dream i can’t distinguish weather it was a dream or reality which leads into my psychosis which hasnt been determined but just a possibility. I now have a therapist. She tells me that it isnt my fault. Im very skeptical of doctors so sometimes i choose not to listen to her. Everyday i wake up to an empty house, empty social life, empty pockets. I just dont have anything anymore. It slowly has been chipping on my will to live. Seeing everyone hangout doing things i want to do knowing i cant participate and knowing it will probably never happen to me makes me just jot want to continue. Slowly and slowly i do just give into my fake reality because it helps me not feel alone. Some of you might be confused about my living situation, my mom just works alot and we have opposite schedules so when im here she isnt and vice versa. Although i do work its not like i talk to them because they’re my friends, most of them dont like me because i can never remember where to put things and im constantly asking for help. Everything seemed normal up until now and it scares me cause now i have so many things wrong with me and its actually effecting me. I just want a friend."
lonely,I literally get negative play and it’s really starting to bother me,"I literally get negative play and it’s really starting to bother me - I get it. I’m only 17, and there’s some people who haven’t had experiences until their 20s, but it’s really starting to bother me how I have NONE at all?? This morning I was sitting with a group and they were having a “playful” argument about which one amongst them got the most play. They were talking about people hitting on them, flings they’ve had, relationships they’ve been in, etc. They all had something to account for and as I was sitting there watching it all, I realized, I literally cannot relate to them at all! I started thinking about other conversations I’ve had and how the loneliest and most “to themselves” people Ive talked to told me about how they have had bfs or been in relationships or even had sex. Ive literally done none of that. No guy has ever confessed to me, no one chases after me, even girls don’t want me??

And some people might say “make the first move”, but Ive confessed to two guys before and the first one rejected me and the second one didn’t take it seriously. I was considering trying to maybe try and make a move on a guy I find cute, but I realized, why am I always the one chasing? Why does no one ever chase after me? What is wrong with me? Guys always talk about how girls have it easier when dating, but I don’t have it easy at all. And I don’t think it’s because of my looks because people (mainly girls) have told me I’m pretty before, so why the hell am I struggling 🫠

Also not to mention how one of the girls in the group who was one of the main ones arguing told a guy that his history (having people confess to him, him rejecting, him still not having sexual experiences) was embarrassing because we’re in 11th grade, I just kept my mouth shut lol"

lonely,Why am I Such A Jerk?,"Why am I Such A Jerk? - Hi everyone, 

I’m a university student, 23 years old and a couple hours ago my friend told me they don’t think we should be friends anymore. 

They are my only friend. I got along well with their family. They are the reason I got sobered up and went to college. I owe them my whole life. 

A week ago I pretended to be jealous and jokingly out my hand over the back of their hair and said “don’t look at that person”. We sometimes pretend to be jealous of each other, they do it more than I do. But today when I went over their house they told me they don’t think we should be friends anymore because of this. 

I feel like such an asshole and a jackass. I can’t believe I will never see them again. I don’t know why I did it. I wish I never did. I love this friend with all my heart and now it’s all over. I told them I would go to therapy and work on myself. 

They told me this is not the first mistake I made. I’ve also made an inappropriate joke for example. 
What I’d like is for your input. I know I’m an asshole, but why? And how can I change? I don’t want this experience to ever happen again. I’m still in shock. What can I do to be a better and more respectful person? I know a lot of people will hate me and say I don’t deserve them, and I agree with you. But I don’t want to be this person anymore. 
Anyone have advice to not be an asshole anymore?

tldr; how can I stop being a jerk?

Thank you for reading this. And thank you in advance for your input. I appreciate any advice and comments. 

Thank you."

This man is just so hot and sexy and he smells so good, everyday I am in his class, he gives me butterflies in my stomach but when the class ends and I am back to my dorm, I miss him so much my chest hurts. He makes me feel so lonely, I desperately yearn for his touch, I really want him to hold my tiny hands. Today the weather was really hot so he unbuttoned two of his shirt button and I got to see a little bit of his chest, that made me imagine stuffs with him, I sound like a pervert who doesn't respect her teacher but the feelings I have for him is just growing and doesn't seem to stop and it makes me feel really sad and lonely knowing he'll probably never look at me as a woman let alone return the same feelings I have for him."

I miss the person I used to be before. Tough on the outside, soft on the inside. Just soft enough for the right people. I'd have walls up to protect myself.

So soft, that I seek company everywhere, my judgements become poorer and my wall's almost invisible in the hopes that someone will accept me. 

I've tried to share my life with people. In the hopes that they'll choose me. But I'm always the option, never the one. The only people who choose me currently are my grandparents, my parents and my dog. 

I can see my future clearly now. My dog's at the end of her life. My grandparents will go next. My parents as the wrinkles grew I know are the last ones going to go. And with them, so will go the version of me that someone knew well enough and liked.

Like the title says, I am a brat and a little and I'm searching for the dirtiest thing of all- a relationship. One with compassion, passion, empathy, understanding, communication, and healthy arguments. I know that's the most nitty gritty thing of all and if you're not interested, I understand. But if you are, you should know that my idea of a perfect date is straddling my daddy's lap while he feeds me sushi. I text in all caps when I get excited. I use bratting as an excuse to not be vulnerable. I'm fluent in sarcasm. I have amazing boobs. I have like 11 stuffies but I need more. I love white chocolate- both actual chocolate and men. I also am really attracted to East Asian men and fit/muscled men. I'm a bit chwubby, and at 5'2"" I'm also vertically challenged.

 I'm looking for someone who's going to be my friend or be crazy in love with me and vice versa. No in between. Lollll. As you can guess, from my posting here, I'm a bit lonely.

Since I lost my father in April of last year, I've gained 50 lbs and have bouts of depression. I know I'm asking a lot, but for me, I need someone I can click with instantly, someone I can banter with, someone who's gonna call me out when I'm wrong, and communicate when things aren't where they should be. However, it seems impossible to find this, and if I do find this, they ghost me after a few days or weeks of talking. I don't know where to go from here. Hmu if any of this appeals to you. ☺️☺️✨"

These days its hurts even more cause i wanted to ask a girl out in the group to solve that problem and also cause I like her but she got back with her ex and it made me feel so bad i started using sharp objects to hurt myself and im thinking of using one to end myself cause if feels like nobody will ever like me at this point ive only known failure in every aspect of my life so i dont see the point of being alive anymore.

lonely,I feel like a failure,"I feel like a failure - I really just wish that I was surrounded by more people. No friends, barely speak to my extended family."
lonely,Screw social interactions. I'll be a rock,"Screw social interactions. I'll be a rock - I basically have no friends. I can get weeks without receiving any message notifications from a human being. I open any notifications within microseconds haha. My closest friends stopped hanging out with me. Reaching out to old friends didn't really work either. I tried tinder/bumble, probably came out as needy and got ghosted, which is totally understandable lol.

I realized that getting rejected from reaching out hurt more than being lonely itself. So, I guess I'll just figure out this lonely thing by myself. Drink until the wall starts talking back or something.

Hope you guys are doing better than I am. Cheers!"
lonely,I can't even complain anymore really,"I can't even complain anymore really - Like it's my own fault that I'm so anxious and too scared to talk to anyone, it's my fault when I did have a relationship years that I didn't keep in contact, and it's my fault that I lagged behind everyone in education/work as I graduated from highschool, if I would've just kept at it when things was still going well I wouldn't have been as lonely and socially scared as I am today."

i’m gonna be 20 this year. honestly didn’t think i’d make it this far but it looks like i’m still telling myself i’m alone by choice, not lonely. i’ve never seen such dumbass behaviour before"

lonely,wanting to be alone,"wanting to be alone - I used to have a girlfriend, we've been together for one and a half years and we lived together. Yet, I didn't feel like this relationship is fine for me. We had many differences, and I was thinking about breaking up everyday.
Until I did it. Now, a month later, I'm truly all alone. I barely speak with my family, barely speak with any friends, and barely get out of the house due to my job.
I've never been happier.
You don't have to look at being lonely as a bad thing, it's the perfect time to sort yourself out for what's to come. It's the perfect time to truly find who you are."

lonely,Maybe something useful and motivating (Think superior),"Maybe something useful and motivating (Think superior) - Hello there,  
I have my days, where I'm really down, feel lonley and that no one cares about me. I don't have someone to talk to about my problems. No one I would really trust with it. No one to hug, or who would help me to get out of this mood.  
And what helps me to get out of this, and it seems kinda harsh.  
I just think: ""I don't need someone to hold my hand and get up, like those weak little people, who have someone to talk and lean to. I can do stuff on my own and work on my own without any help.""  
It let me feel that I'm way stronger then other people who need it and get the attention if they are down. To be actually strong enough to beat life on it's own. I know how it sounds, but it helps me to get back on the track. And I would never act that way to people that I'm superior or something, but the thought really makes a diffrence and helps me to get back.  
Just think, it's way cooler and epic if you climb out the hole on yourselve rather with help of someone. To be independend.   
And yes, this will not help anybody, but maybe someone, just try to think superior but not showing it and act like it, please xD"

Idk about you but it makes all the difference for me. The sadness just melts away immediately. But it has to be the right person. And it took so long for me to find that person…so I guess, to everyone here, have some hope. Finding the right person takes time but they’re out there and will come into your life when you really need them. It’ll be unexpected but it’ll happen. 💖"

I used to be excited for vacations too. Now it's different. It's during these moments that I realize even more how lonely I am. I have no one. No friends. No partner. My family hates me. I have no one to talk to, no one to hang out with. This is just too painful. The stress and pressure of working and studying used to keep me busy and distracted, even though I hated it. Now I have nothing to do, I'm alone. I just wish I had friends. This has been going on for too long, my life is miserable. I know it will never change."

Talking to strangers online doesnt make me feel better, its all ive ever done or known for my entire life, I want real human contact, something everyone I know has experiences numerous times.

lonely,i dont wanna be unlovable anymore,"i dont wanna be unlovable anymore - i just dont know what to do, even if i tried my best i just cant do it...

i've always wanted to be a boyfriend, i tried to be one, i tried to be the best for him, for him too, for everyone, i tried to be the best i could be and it was never enough...i dont know why i feel like this but i feel like that's what im supposed to be, and that's how i could be happy

i mean, it makes sense, what's best than not being alone anymore huh? what's best than having a person who'll always believe in you? someone that understands you perfectly and loves you for being you, for existing, someone who is happy that you exist...someone whom you'll try everyday to make happy and to love him always, someone who wants to go places with you and do stupid stuff with you just cause its you and its fun...someone who'd make you feel like you are enough and that you are worth it and that you finally dont have to be alone against everything...he'd make you feel like you're not alone

i dont want to be alone...its always been like that...the only time that it wasnt, i was with him, he made me feel so happy and loved...he made me feel like i did have a reason to wake up everyday to do the same things over and over again, he was there with me, and that was enough for me

he made me feel like i deserved to be loved like everyone else...after he left, i was by myself again, i never liked it, since i was a kid i just hated being by myself, but it was different...it felt like a hole that i could never fill was there, and the thought that it was my fault that it was there was just, horrible, cause, lets be real, it was my fault...he even told my why, and i've tried to fix it ever since but it just, it feels like it was for nothing

im tired of feeling like this everyday...sometimes i dream about a guy who tells me he loves me and i just dont know how to feel...maybe sorrow, because even after trying, the only thing i have, to feel like im not alone in this life, its just my mind...i always want to hug him and just cry, but he's never here...i always wish someone was...i wish someone understood finally..."

I do have some friends but I feel they only need me when they want something. However I have one close friend. I try to stay positive but there will be times where I just feel sad and lonely knowing that I really have no one. I just hope this doesn’t last for long because I’m honestly tired of feeling this way.

i don’t feel like i’m capable of understanding the desire for sex, let alone attraction. i do not see anyone as attractive anymore, just other lumps of walking flesh. in that world of flesh lumps, i feel like the only rotting lump of flesh, the only one that is so repulsive, so disgusting, so off-putting that it is impossible for anyone to be attracted to me.

maybe this is for the better. if i were to be in a relationship in my current emotionally unavailable and deadened state, it’s just be hell for the other person.

so i don’t approach anyone so that i can spare them that hell. and no one approaches me because i’m disgusting.

i’m in a sexual stalemate, but that’s ok, because it seems to be for the best."

lonely,No endgame,"No endgame - I’m no one’s favorite person. I don’t have a loving romantic relationship or thriving friendship(s). 

I’ve always had social troubles. I was always afraid or uncomfortable or introverted. I have a hard time making friends and maintaining the ones I achieve. It’s so hard for me to be comfortable with people. I genuinely don’t understand what’s wrong with me. Maybe I’m simply pursuing the wrong people or some part of my brain isn’t functioning. I’m so goddamn jealous of people that have these ‘my person’ relationships. 

The closest I’ve come was a boyfriend that lied his ass off to me the entire relationship. I’ve accepted and let go but his betrayal was traumatizing. I’ve lost so many 4+ years friendships that I hoped would make it to major life milestones. I feel defeated at this point.

My therapist says that what I’m looking for is out there. That it’s ok these relationships didn’t work out. It doesn’t feel ok. It feels lonely and unworthy and sad. I know I’m a good person and I have fine qualities to offer but I have little to show for it. 

I’m not close with my family. Coworker friendships are too risky. If I do speak to “friends” it’s to make plans to party or they want to fuck. It’s just me and my thoughts 24/7. No one to lean on and be my authentic self. I stopped being able to see my endgame sometime ago."

Does anyone know any WFH companies that hire a lot of people and hire quickly? I am broke like stone broke not even enough for groceries and no transportation and I spent my last money paying my internet in hope I can find a WFH job. So if I dont find one in a month im screwed. Like starvation. I can't pay my rent or anything if I don't get one. Does anyone know of any? I would look elsewhere but I am in an extreme remote area and dont have transportation and no immediate family or friends to take me to work.

I have no money at all and no money for food or anything. I hate to ask here but I have no other options. Can anyone cashapp me a little money (any little but helps) until I get a paycheck and I will pay you back? I do not want to do this and I don't blame you if you think it seems fishy, but I promise you it is not. I have never been this depressed and down in my life. I lost my vehicle last week and my credit is now toast so I have no one to borrow off of, and can't borrow from an advance place. I have already sold my xbox, weed eaters and lawn mowers trying to get by and now I am broke. I know it is my own fault though for being almost 40 and beinglike this. I hate myself right now, So even if you cant help can you please send me some good vibes that I get through this horrible time right now? Again, I am sorry for asking and I know times are rough everywhere right now, but I have no other choice. Thank you. If you DM me, I will give you my cashapp."
lonely,"There really isn't anyone out there for me, and that's fine.","There really isn't anyone out there for me, and that's fine. - I've realized that I don't want that many people in my life, it's so much work to keep up with it. I have a handful of passing acquaintances but only 2 or 3 real friends and that's more than enough. Like guys at work always want me to hang out but I really have 0 interest in having real bonds with them. Maybe it's just hedgehog's dilemma but I just want to be left alone. I've accepted recently that no one will date me, and it makes me sad, but it's for the best. I'm on the spectrum and have a hard time relating to people, and the relationships I end up forming are co-dependent at best and toxic at worst. 

I'm attractive enough, but something essential about me prevents people from really thinking about me like that I guess. It's fine though, they don't owe me that. But man I feel like such an outsider, like I look in at people having normal lives, here I am this ghost kinda floating by. Never really in phase with anyone. It's come to the point where I've touched the hot stove enough.. I've turned it off and walked away completely. 

I've learned my lesson.. There just isn't anyone out there for me i guess, and that's ok i think...

I look forward to my part time job because I get to at least engage in small talk. Everyone says I’m nice and they like me, but no one wants to be my friend. I almost always eat lunch alone in my car. I hear everyone else make plans for lunch and the weekend. Sometimes I’m invited but every time I accept the plans fall through. At this point, I think they’re just pity invites. I do not know what is wrong me, but I am convinced it is me. My whole life it has been like this. I thought it would go away with age or new jobs or new schools, but it hasn’t. It follows me around. So it must be me. 

I recently broke up with my long term partner. While it was for the best, I find myself missing them because at least I had someone to be with. I am so lonely and I don’t know how to make friends. I honestly don’t know what to do at all. I find myself almost wanting to start dating again just for the companionship. But I know that wouldn’t be good for me. So I guess I just get to be the same lonely loser that I’ve always been."
lonely,I have no one,"I have no one - 

I am currently an 18 year old senior in high school and a month away from graduation. My loneliness is getting pretty bad and it is affecting me a lot. 

My best friend of 4 years recently made a new best friend and chose her over me. She doesn’t want to be friends anymore. 

My other best friend of 8 years has other friends and we don’t really talk anymore. 

The only other person I had a connection with, was someone I had to end things with because he lied about his age to me. I miss him so much. 

Before you suggest me finding new friends, I go to an extremely small high school and I have severe social anxiety. Making new friends isn’t really an option for me right now.

I haven’t been in her exact situation but I’ve been in extreme solitude before, feeling no one loves you, trapped in your own head with voices accumulating to mutter the same thing without skipping a beat.

Whether you’re in a new place or somewhere familiar the feeling never seems to fade, no matter the company or time, you feel luxated. It’s exhausting and wears on the bones. I don’t want to feel this way anymore and I know it’s unhealthy to seek this validation in others…I want to say “but” but there isn’t an alternative for me. I must learn to content with me and what I provide. No matter how difficult it gets."
lonely,I’m not a loser or social awkward I just find myself feeling lonely all the time,"I’m not a loser or social awkward I just find myself feeling lonely all the time - So I have had many friends in the past and made what I thought was genuine connections with people. I was social, outgoing, and liked. I was invited out to parties, events, dinners, kickbacks just anything in general for the most part I was invited. I’m not ugly by any means either that or I’m just highly narcissistic. But I genuinely have been feeling an extreme sense of isolation in the past couple of months. I don’t know but I struggle to talk to people like I used to  and sometimes I crave social interaction and when I get it I crumble and don’t want it anymore all of sudden. I don’t know what I want in life so I spend my time focusing and chasing materialistic things( a fast car at the moment) but that’s just a distraction from what I really want which is just someone I enjoy talking to and spending time with. I fee hopeless and don’t think I’ll ever find that person. Also I don’t even enjoy the presence of people I have been friends with for 10 plus years I feel like they aren’t the same anymore but what if’s me who’s weirdo and has changed. Please anyone who took the time to read this pm me I’d love to just have a conversation my mind is spinning from overthinking"

lonely,Feeling lonely in a crowded room,"Feeling lonely in a crowded room - I can never understand the reasoning behind why I feel so lonely whenever I interact with any friends whether individually or in a group setting. It’s especially exacerbated at university where I feel that no one likes me. 

All I know is that when I go home after any interaction, it’s just myself and the four walls that surround me."
lonely,It really hits you when you're sick...,"It really hits you when you're sick... - I miss my mom. 

I'm lying in bed, throat sore from coughing, and hungry despite not being able to keep food down. My head hurts and my energy is gone. I keep thinking back to when I was young and my mom would take care of me when I was sick. Bringing me food, rubbing my feet and back, scratching my head... I can remember how she would look at me and I could see on her face that she cares about me and wants me to feel better. If I was down with a stomach bug she would make me up a little bed on the bathroom floor and we'd camp out with ice cubes and crackers. Now I live six hours away and I have nobody around me. I tried bringing some blankets into the bathroom like in the old days but it was just cold and wasn't even remotely the same.

It's just a little bug, I'll be fine in a few days, really. but I can genuinely say the worst part of this experience is that I'm all alone. I'm not lying here wishing for a mommy gf or any of that shit, but I can't stop thinking about what it would be like if I lived with someone that worried about me and wanted me to feel better.  It's just the little things like having to feel my stomach turning and my headache start pounding again because I stood up to get some more water. It would mean the world to me if I just had someone I could ask to bring me a cup of water. I would feel a hundred times better if I had someone to sit next to me and hold my hand or something, just so I know I'm not alone if things get worse. I think I'd like it if the roles were switched too. It makes my heart ache when I think about taking care of someone when they're sick. I'd love to be appreciated and depended on in their time of need. I'd do everything for them that my mom did for me and I'd love every second of it. The thought of me being able to make someone feels better makes my heart swell but then I realize it's probably not gonna happen and I feel worse than before.

Whatever, I'm just a little sick. I raise a toast (of cough syrup, of course) to any and all of you who have felt the same way."
lonely,Feel like a part of me never had a chance to get life experience.,"Feel like a part of me never had a chance to get life experience. - I am 38yrs old male from California and I feel like I been doing a lot of soul searching of late. Thinking about the past 30s years and feel like I’m so alone and so lost. I admit I haven’t had a real date besides the casual movie/dinner time I had with a friend. As a young child I was bullied by eldest brother for my weight problems. I was always sick when I was young due to respiratory issues. I missed alot of days of school, was always alone never had any real friends. What made things hard was I was a super shy and didn’t talk much as I always got super nervous with girls and still do at my current age.

I tried to date in middle/high school and didn’t have much success. Never went to school dances, no prom dates anything’s like that. I always wanted to date but never had an opportunity because the girls I liked never game a me a chance. After graduating high school I kinda put dating to the way side as I was trying to decide what to do for the rest of my life. I worked a few part time jobs until I landed working with a fruit tech company and spent a majority of my 20s and early 30s of my life with pretty much the status quoa no dating even I did try a few times.

I tried online dating at its early days including phone chat lines where sometimes I would get connections but it would be more sexual nature. I still have my health problems and weight problems and I feel so lonely I feel like I’m dying inside. I see all these shows and movies where people date and stuff and I say to myself why can’t I have that too. What grinds my gears a lot is I hear certain groups of men treat women badly and they get hurt and I feel bad for them. These other groups say they wish to find a man who has a heart and will treat them good, yet when they get a chance they ignore it and go back to tried and true I guess because they want that type of relationship or something.

I had some sexual experience where I had a casual thing but nothing that would count as actual penetration as it was mainly oral which I enjoy going down on women it my kink. Now I’m at my mid point of my life and feel like I wasted so much. Feel like I missed so many life opportunities that I feel so bad. I wish I could change the clock and fix all that. Unfortunately that’s not possible and I’ll have to deal with the consequences. I want to date, I want to have sex, I want to feel happy, want to feel like a regular life as any other people. Perhaps I have some emotional problems that have to be confronted before I can move or something anything is possible.

I want to make one thing clear I have no intentions of hurting myself or anyone else. These are my demons and I need to confront them. Lately I tried to seek female companionship and it seems to go ok but feels like the women loose interest. I don’t know all I know Is I want to feel happy, want to experience what life has to offer. I have found a real good job last year that makes a solid living and now I want experience what life has to offer. 

That’s my vent 

Thank You"

lonely,"No friends since elementary, single for over 8 years, solitude is nice but…","No friends since elementary, single for over 8 years, solitude is nice but… - I don’t want to do this for the next 5 years. I spent a lot of time focusing on myself, gaining insight on me somehow it has made me more isolated. Ignorance is bliss, we live in a culture that prefers instant gratification, easy and hedonism. I guess working through my baggage has taught me, healing and improvement never ends. Also it’s not easy, you reap the rewards down the line.

I have a knack of choosing partners that are emotionally unavailable. The moment I open up, I’m honest about my anxiety and depression where it stems from, it scares them off. I do open up too quickly, but I don’t like the casual time wasting interactions that others find safety in. That’s the problem. 

I want friends I can grow with. I don’t want to sit around playing video games, drinking or doing drugs. Modern escapism is dull, I’d rather reenact a thick fantasy book in the living room or hike or do yoga. Gain new experiences, sometimes people with these same desires can be shallow so then I’m again unfulfilled trying to connect. I want to build friendships with people who encourage me to get better (and vice versa) however I continue to meet people who want company in their misery, don’t want to have hard conversations and only want to be surrounded with the agreeable of their flawed thoughts- no desire for new perspectives. 

Romantically, I despise the lack of introspection to know the difference between infatuation and something that can be built upon. I want marriage and kids but the pickings these day, everyone wants a “spark” love at first sight. However these are red flags for me, I see love as a responsibility, that changes through time- it won’t always be butterflies and intensity. When someone says it’s all about feelings I immediately think they’ll leave when I get sick or things don’t go as plan. Feelings are so fleeting and unreliable in making decisions of spending the rest of my life with someone.

“People can only meet you, as deeply as they met themselves.” If I’m too far down, if I met myself too intimately, am I doomed be alone forever?"

lonely,"no matter what I do, loneliness follow me.","no matter what I do, loneliness follow me. - I tried to help my classmates by being the representative, of my classmates, and basically having to be getting thrashed, by students and teachers at the same time, because my job was about making sure that the students could have complaints about the teacher without them just going nowhere, so I had to make sure that the teacher listen to the students, in the same way i had to make sure the class listened to the teachers, complaints about them. 

After doing that, they talked about me on my back, and didn't vote on purpose, when I started a voting thing on WhatsApp......

And I got out of class once a person told me this.

And you know when you just feel so sad and alone, i went outside and cried so bad, you know when you feel like you tried to be included, but all that happens is people miss interpret you, and it makes you feel so alone.

It seems to me that loneliness get dragged around with me, for wherever i go, and people can feel this, and this results  from me feeling alone.

For example, i was flerting with a girl, Andi asked do you date and she was like yes, but i didn't wanted to kiss her or anything like that, I SWEAR TO GOD that i only wanted to see her smile, but it turns out that in one day that i was flerting with her, there was a dude with her, which i thought oh it may be her boyfriend, and i proceed to think, bro if i was flerting with her in front of her boyfriend, i should probably explain myself to her, and i tried to but she said no he's not my boyfriend, and after all of this i just looked like a creep/fuck boy, which is not what I meant to happen, but now that's what she thinks, and this makes me feel so dam alone, and i feel like there's nothing I can do about it.

It's like in cursed to be alone."

Halfway into 2019, I'd say I was the happiest I've ever been. I had a job I enjoyed, amazing friends, and best of all, I had been in a relationship for 2.5 years.

My then gf decided to study abroad, so I saved up money to go with her and try to find a job there. It was a huge step for both of us, as we were going to move in together and also live in a foreign country. We made the huge step and everything went perfectly for a couple of months. I hadn't been very successful at finding a job there, due to political reasons and then the pandemic hitting as well. It made me feel very depressed and I could see it affected her as well. She always tried cheering me up and encouraging me to keep looking for a job, but to no use. I was just too depressed to keep going and nothing could really make me feel better. It was hard enough for me to find a job with the political situation that was going on at the moment and the pandemic just made it impossible for me.

We eventually managed to get through her first year at uni with incredible financial support from our parents. We then went back to our home country during Summer vacation and she decided to break up with me after 3.5 years of relationship. She told me to get used to the idea that we'll never be together again. I couldn't understand how after we'd been together for so long, in what I at least considered to be a healthy and happy relationship, she could say something like that. I couldn't understand how anyone could say something like that to someone they love. I was devastated. I was already depressed due to not being able to find a job abroad, we were also in the middle of the pandemic and then I also had to cope with the loss of an amazing relationship. We tried to stay friends many times after we broke up. While she was still here and also after she left abroad again to continue her studies. It never worked out.

It took me a really long time to process all that, and I even went to therapy for it, but by the time I started therapy I was already feeling better and started getting back on my feet, so I'm not sure it helped much. The last time we talked was at the beginning of this year. We were both in a group of close friends of which I mostly introduced her to and since she decided that we shouldn't be a part of each other's lives anymore, I thought of having a chat with all of them, including her, to make a new group without her, so that I could cut all ties with her. It didn't make sense to have her in the group anymore anyway. She was all the way there and didn't have contact with any of us, she started a new life there, made new friends etc. and she agreed that it was a good idea to not be in the same groups anymore.

I'm doing pretty well now, as my life seems to be back to how it was before I met her, which was back in 2016. I have everything I need but it's boring as hell. I barely find excitement in anything, and when I do, I feel like I have no one to share it with. All my close friends are in relationships and I rarely ever ask them if they want to do something together, because they're usually with their s.o. and I feel like I'd bother them if I did. Sometimes we all hang out and there's this intrusive thought that I'm the only one in the group who's not in a relationship, and it makes me feel horrible.

I tried online dating once I felt ready to be with someone else, because it was pretty much the only way I could meet new people during a pandemic, but didn't really get anything out of it. It mostly made me feel unwanted and like I was trying much harder to find that special someone than any of the girls I matched with. I got ghosted a lot and barely got any texts back. Beauty no longer impresses me, since most of the prettiest women I've talked to turned out to be shallow or have really shitty personalities. This also holds me off from approaching any girl I find cute, since I'm afraid their personality might not be as good as their looks. I could say I look pretty good too, or at least average. I don't go to the gym, so I'm not muscular, nor skinny, but I take care of myself, I have a good sense of humour and plenty of hobbies I'm focusing on. Probably my biggest downside is that I have crooked teeth. There's not much I can do about it, so I really hate that thing about me.

I'm not even into dating. Never been. I find the whole process of meeting someone completely new and taking the time to get to know them really exhausting, especially as an adult when all you wanna do after work is rest and focus on your hobbies. I just ""waited for the right person"", as a lot of people say. I was friends with her before we got together. That relationship was the best thing I had, even though it was the only one. The level of intimacy and the amount of hobbies we shared was unmatched. I haven't been able to find another girl whom I would share so much with ever since. Sometimes I cry before I sleep, imagining how my life could be if I was in a relationship like the one I used to have. All I really want is to have someone with similar hobbies who I can also be intimate with. Someone I could hold, kiss and sleep with. Somehow, this just feels unattainable.

After my ex broke up with me, she told me I'm the most loving person she knows. It makes me wonder if I lost the only true love I'll ever get."
lonely,So tired of feeling alone. (Vent),"So tired of feeling alone. (Vent) - Don’t get me wrong I have a couple of friends who I hang out with every now and then but I feel like I’m not connecting with anyone anymore. Even family and old friends who I’ve known my entire life. It almost feels like I’m invisible. Like it’s super obvious I’m not doing ok but no one seems to notice or care enough to ask. I can’t even remember the last time someone asked how I was doing and even if they did I doubt I would respond honestly. 

I (25m) have gone on a few dates over the past year but nothing really stuck. There was one girl who I genuinely connected with and liked but things didn’t work out between us. That’s not really the root of the issue but it doesn’t help either.

lonely,"My Best Friend Stopped Speaking to me and all my other friends followed her, now I’m so lonely","My Best Friend Stopped Speaking to me and all my other friends followed her, now I’m so lonely - Let’s call my ex-best friend Lucy. She and I have been best friends for 10+ years (over half our lives). A few months ago she had been in a horrible funk because she lied on a job application and they initially wanted to hire her but found out she didn’t have the right certifications so they had to rescind the offer. Around that time a guy she was kinda dating decided that he didn’t want to be with her because he has so many family responsibilities and wouldn’t be able to give her the time and attention she deserves. 

When all this happened I started to realize how much I was there for her during her hard times and during her happy times, be she doesn’t do the same for me. She would make condescending comments when I would get a good grade in school or get accepted to a great internship. I talked to her about how I felt and that I felt like her therapist she only hung out with when feeling sad/unhappy and she would always hang out with other people when she was feeling happy. I understand that probably meant she felt safe and comfortable with me, but I felt I was putting a lot more effort into the relationship than she was. After talking with her, she pretty much accused me of being a horrible friend and then blocked me on all forms of social media. 

I then reached out to a mutual best friend, who goes to college out of state, (let’s call her Sarah) we have to get some advice and to ask her to check on Lucy and make sure she was doing okay. She said Lucy was fine and didn’t really engage in texting with me. Over the past 2 months I texted Sarah as I normally would about life and school, but her responses were always very short and she didn’t engage in anything I sent. A few days ago I asked Sarah when she was coming back home for the summer and she told me she already moved everything to where she goes to school. I was pretty surprised she didn’t tell me she came back to where I live for a while and then decided to move without telling me.  I guess I shouldn’t be surprised since she pretty much stopped communicating with me. 

I haven’t heard anything from Lucy in over two months and all my other friends in that friend group stopped talking to me. I’m not going to say I’m super surprised they decided to follow her since she is kinda the “leader” and everyone must do what she says or get kicked out. 

Maybe I dodged a bullet in a way because I’ve realized that they haven’t been as good of friends as I thought. But now I really only have a few people that I call my friends and one of them lives in a different state. I used to hang out with Lucy and Sarah all the time and go on hikes and stuff, but now I don’t have anyone to go with. I feel really lonely and end up just sitting around my house not doing much everyday. 

If you’ve made it down here, thanks for listening to all this drama."

lonely,Lonely Man,"Lonely Man - 6 years ago, I started using drugs because I was lonely. 8 months ago, I quit, and loneliness hit harder than ever. I've never felt so lonely in my life. I feel abandoned, alienated, and excluded. I can't stop crying every day. I now understand why suicide rates are way higher in men. I also understand why some idiots choose violence. I am self-aware of everything. The society acts like I don't exist. Somehow people are conditioned to ignore the single man especially if the man has no job or is broke. Loneliness is the worst. In the past, I've experienced terrible depressive episodes, panic attacks, and even psychosis. But this is very hard. I don't want to romanticize my situation, but I think Taxi Driver is the best movie I've ever seen. It is real. ( I don't want to exclude women, there are a lot of lonely women out there, but I think this situation is different than theirs.)"

lonely,Finding peace in solidarity.,"Finding peace in solidarity. - Spending a lot of time of my time alone has brought me a lot of peace and healing, but I can pinpoint little moments in my day to day life that I wish I could share with someone else for no more than the simple fact I would like to share my life experience with another living person. The healing hands of time that once uplifted me and kept me from depending on others are beginning to feel constricting and making me feel all shades of blue. At 21 years old with no romantic interests and a few friends who haven’t passed away or succumb to the vice grip stranglehold of hard drug abuse or alcoholism, I have to ask if there’s people who are out there finding themselves in a similar situation in the world. My world is so incomprehensibly small simply because I’ve had an aversion to social media since 12-13 years of age and live in a rural town of 300 in a remote area, I’m new to reddit and social media but not for nothing I simply hope this posts reaches someone who feels the way I do thank you for reading."

lonely,how to become content with loneliness,"how to become content with loneliness - Im in london - and Im so alone.

I'm a 2nd year student, I never had freshers, everythings been online for 2 years.  People are bizarre at my university- v cancel culture and rich/ rude international student clichés.

There are a few lovely exchange students, but I know I'll never see them again.  So it leaves me having all these fake interactions that wont go anywhere. Occasionally ppl attached themselves to me, but theyre desperate bc no one else wants to be friends w them: mainly bc theres some issue with them (socially enept/will cancel you)... 

Im sick of the pretences.  I've stopped acknowledging people who acknowledge me first.  I've started realising people don't actually really gaf about you and thats completely fine with me.

Ik im normally, Ik i am lonely bc of environment.  I have a lot of very good friends at home Ive known for years. But they arent here.

How do I start being completely content on my own.  Not relationship wise (although doesn't help as genuinely I am extremely codependent on someone).

Its so draining to have to meet people when only 1/20 people are ppl that make an effort back - how can i feel content alone as an extrovert"

lonely,Borrowing Will,"Borrowing Will - Sometimes I remind myself of the old movie Awakenings (1990).

Like the 'Will of the Ball' scene, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj52vD7KGxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj52vD7KGxs)

By myself, I'm not very motivated.

As soon as someone else is in the equation I'm normally able to accomplish a lot.

Like I'm borrowing their will to do things.

On Tuesday, I was lucky enough to hang out with someone and so I was looking like a normal human.

Now, I'm back into standby mode."
lonely,I'm 17 yo m,I'm 17 yo m - I need someone to chatt. Just tell me how you're day has been or something.
lonely,Told myself I'd type this down if it happens again,"Told myself I'd type this down if it happens again - Hello all, I'm (M)26 now and always been an introvert all my life. I wasn't popular in school at all and was known to be the weird quiet person to others. I had no fashion style and I lacked a lot of social common sense at the time of middle school and high school. I didn't care about school and ditched school a lot due to family problems, poor family, bullies and stress. I'd use gaming to distract myself from the real world and ignore reality. I've missed out so much of my high school/middle school social life and activities. I've had many crushes but never stood a chance to date them because of how inexperienced I was when it comes to talking to people in general. I've always been a shy person and I have huge social anxiety(Lack of social life and bullies from school).

&amp;#x200B;

I told myself that if I dream myself being in high school/middle school again, I will share my personal life here and today, I woke from from another dream. This is probably like my 20+ times that I dream of myself back in my young age talking to my crushes in middle/high school and spending time with people there. I dreamed of myself actually having FRIENDS and enjoying time with them. Dreamed of myself dating one of my crushes and dreamed of myself having a life back in middle/high school. It always makes me thinking how much better I would be today if things were different back then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I am still a virgin and never cuddle with anyone before or experience passionate physical touch. I don't care about losing my virginity, I only care about finding the one for me. Someone who I could share my love with and spend the rest of my life together with. I'm currently jobless by choice. I have had 2 serious committed online relationships but both resulted of me getting CHEATED on, financially used, used and emotionally abused. Both were females. I've always been a straight guy and still attracted to girls only mostly. However, after those two very poor relationships, it makes me scared of girls because I don't want to get feelings for another one to end in the same way. Keep in mind, I don't date many as I've only dated 2 in my life as a 26 years old person. I allow feelings of love carefully and take the relationships very serious. It leads me to not trusting females anymore. . . and maybe start trying out the males although I'm not really attracted to them. I know not all girls are the same but I got hard trauma from the past 2 relationships and it's not easy to get that mindset off. I met many online guy friends who are super nice to me and have the personality that I'm attracted to but just not attracted to them physically. I'm willing to sacrifice physical attraction for loyal love and caring because I'm that desperate. I don't think I'm ugly physically, however I'm also not the best looking (5'5 125LB). I've lossed all motivation to work and do anything since I was cheated on. I've been trying to do other things on my computer to cope and get by but it doesn't help all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

All I want to know is that, are there many of you out there who dreams a lot about their high school and middle school life where you actually got friends and a partner back then? I can't be the only one right? It suffers me inside everytime I wake up from one. Are there a lot of you whose life are similar like mine?

TLDR: Dreamed a lot about a better high school/middle school life back then vs what really happened. Told myself I'd type my personal life if I get another dream like this. Very curious to know if there's many like me or have similar life like me."
lonely,I can’t take it anymore.,I can’t take it anymore. - I don’t have the support system that I need. My girlfriend brushes off how she makes me feel and I don’t really have a family to talk to. I don’t know what to do anymore and it’s taking it’s toll.
lonely,Recently got dumped and realized I don't really have any friends,"Recently got dumped and realized I don't really have any friends - Other than my ex, I had two people that I regularly talked to but they have since stopped responding to my texts. I have no idea how to go about making friends at 28. I've never felt this alone in my whole life and it sucks. I struggle with depression and my whole support system has collapsed around me, all I have left is my mom. I just feel so pathetic."
lonely,Im tired,"Im tired - I wish I talked to someone sooner. I wish i wasnt scared from the start for whatever reason and let it out as i should have and as everyone told me to. Keeping trauma and  depressive thoughts all to yourself will eventually mentally exhaust you. I guess us humans are really meant to socialize, being lonely is draining. If u read this and think you dont want to bother others to let it out or are not sure to go to a therapist, please do! Thank you"
lonely,only time i don’t feel lonely is at work,"only time i don’t feel lonely is at work - I need to vent. I left my job recently, no other job lined up, gonna take a break to figure out what to do next. I hated my job in many ways, but it was nice to be around other people, we all got along well too. I’m scared about the wave of loneliness i’m going to feel in the next few weeks after I leave. I do have some friends outside of work, but they’re not people I see on a regular basis, maybe once or twice a year :’( So most days I feel very lonely, i struggle with friendships and romantic relationships a lot. It’s so frustrating feeling this way"
lonely,Venting before class,"Venting before class - I'm tired, my friends suck, they never want to go out with me, all they do is complain about the assignments they give us at uni and never talk for anything else. The only friend that says yes to plans is also my ex's friend and I don't like hanging out with him because I get sad and remember when we used to hang out with my ex. My family is toxic and we don't get along, it sucks living with them. I have literally no emotional support from anyone except my therapist who I see for an hour once a week. I'm so fucking lonely I can't take it anymore, why is my closest friend my cat? Plus he's sick so who knows how long he's gonna be here. When will this feeling go away? I'm so sad"
lonely,I let everyone slip way,"I let everyone slip way - I left so many things unsaid. I have always thought things in my head, but they never mustered out into reality. I feel like I connected with this one guy and that we could’ve been good friends. I talked loudly and freely with him, and he seemed to genuinely like me as a person despite my loser status. However, I couldn’t even initiate a hello, so all of that got thrown out the window. My last day of high school is tomorrow, and the only thing I remember are my regrets. I thought I was a kind person, but I see everyone around me who is much better in that department. In any department. I’m envious of them. I think to myself ‘there is probably something wrong with them’, but in actuality, they are just perfect. More perfect than me."

lonely,Wish someone would blow my head off already,"Wish someone would blow my head off already - What's the point. There's no use to trying anymore. Regardless of if I try or not no one will ever want me, and that on top of everything else makes this life not worth continuing. A woman's love is the only thing that could make this dogshit life something worth living, something worth fixing. However that is the only thing I can't get. If someone were to put a gun to my head and ask for my last words I'd thank them"
lonely,I give up,"I give up - I've had a long series of unfortunate events in my life. I decided after I became the monster I hated most that I was the only one able to kill it. But I wouldn't die... 3/4 of a gallon of Vodka daily for 16 yrs. And right when I'm knocking on deaths door, an angel saves me. Over the next 5 yrs I try to be sober and do the steps and ask forgiveness. I got 1 yr 10 mo sober. Now the angel is leaving and I have Noone. Not a dad, not a grandma. An only child with a step-sister! But she died... Noone. It's me. I'm not sure why either... but I wished the angel would have let me die... now I just want to buy a case of liquor, take my subs(all at once)and if it don't kill me, hopefully It will, but if not, I'll be so weak I'll never make it out of the national forest. And I know the least visited areas where one can just never be seen again...
This is just to tell all the do gooders out there... just let them die if all you're going to do is walk away. Thank you for making my life worse than when I tried to kill myself. Now I want to hurt..."
lonely,Why is trying to socialize so frustrating?,"Why is trying to socialize so frustrating? - Up until a few years ago I was a very solitary individual but not really out of choice. I just didn't know how to socialize, I wondered what to say or do when around other people. I just overthought it and decided to just not say anything to anyone. My parents worried and encouraged to try to be more social and that's when I tried to get myself out there. It has been a massive disaster for numerous reasons that I just can't understand. Some people treat me like absolute trash and don't care to listen to my opinions on anything while others have this odd thing where they see me as some sort of wise sage or genius just because I, seemingly, know a lot but they don't respect me in a personal capacity either, they just respect what I know if that makes sense. I also have a hard time being able to blend in as I find it difficult to carry on conversations or just seem ""normal"". In summation, it has been the single most frustrating thing I've had to do and a massive failure. I don't think I will ever be able to find proper social buddies if I am being honest. I feel doomed to solitude and that sort of troubles me in a way.

Anyone sort of feel this way? Sorry if the post is a bit odd, self expression is something I've always struggled with."
lonely,Slap to my face,"Slap to my face - Hey there, this my first post ever. I am trying to find a way to deal with my lonelyness and reading storys that i can relate to realy help. I am an 18 guy from the netherlands btw.

So explaining all the fucked up aspects of why i feel like this roght now is to much, the essence is this.

I have trouble with experiencing warmth and love so i feel kinda cold, alone and Hurt on a regular bases. 
(I was bullied all elementery school and my dad was not giving me the love and affection i needed at the same time, my parents were devorced btw)

Anyway (already getting to deep into the whole story haha)   I broke up with my girlfriend two months ago en i spoke after 5 weeks and i expected her to be still sad instead she told me she had sex with another guy and she felt like she was over me which realy Hurt and makes you question the meaning of all your memories etc. Well that feeling went away after realizing it shouldnt bother me and indecide what is meaningfull to me and what isnt.

Am sorry for all this bs it was just building up to this :

I went for a drink with my ex not my most recent but before her so like a year ago now and i was just gonna give her some clothes back and have a good talk and go home but instead she went home with me and we slept together and she stayed the whole day after and i havent been so happy as i was that day in a long time. She knows me there was love and affection hugging being nice to eachoter it was exactly what i needed, a little love and appreciation.

I did not at all have a lot of contact with her before this event and since we know a relationsship would not work we decided not to stay in touch after this or not talk for a while. Its been a week and i havent stopped thinking about it, it made my daily life a lot harder after feeling that great for a day. I wanna know how she feels about it but i dont want to disturb our agreement. I Just want to get rid of this extreme feeling of lonelyness i am clueles. 
She is so pretty it literaly makes me sick to think i will not be having more of these good times with her.

I am sorry for all the irrelevant information but it feels  good tho to just drop some stuff that bothers me even it doenst make a whole lot of sense to you guys.



I wish you all the best thanks for reading.  :(   :)"

https://calendly.com/tracey7501

Some background about me:

My name is Tracey. I left home at 16 years old and have lived in 5 different cities across the globe. After breaking free of my corporate 9-5 job in 2017, I transitioned to a full-time remote role before launching my own business. After successfully creating a life with more freedom and fulfillment myself, I’m now on a mission to inspire and empower others to create a life and career on their terms."
lonely,Are there any other girls who have never had a relationship before?,Are there any other girls who have never had a relationship before? - So I’m 21F and never had a boyfriend despite trying and I find it very hard to find other girls in my same situation. I can find guys struggle like this (and there concerns are just as valid) but for me as a girl it’s difficult to find other girls who relate to this issue. Most girls I know never struggle getting into relationships so I want to know if there is any other girl in my situation?
lonely,I have no hope for finding new friends. How am I supposed to cope?,"I have no hope for finding new friends. How am I supposed to cope? - More or less, my social anxiety is paralyzing. About 2 weeks ago, I left the house to spend time with other people (beyond work and food) for the first time since before COVID. Spent 3 hours with a group of 6 strangers. Said about 10 sentences. Learned their names and 1 interest a piece. Watched them fly kites.  

No one talked to me directly despite my attempts at initiating one-on-one conversation while we were watching. Just made me re-cement my idea that I have no hope in finding new friends. I'm just too fucking awkward and weird, I don't have any relatable hobbies or interests, I'm too serious all the time, and yet also have absolutely no sense of adventure or any willingness to leave my comfort zone. I'm not at all attractive or interesting, funny or confident. There is nothing about me that says ""I'm friend material, come talk to me!"" more that ""I'm a weird creep! Avoid me at all costs!""  

So, how am I supposed to cope with this existential dread that is daily, hourly, minute-by-minute loneliness? This gaping wound in my chest that fills my eyes with tears if I stop to catch my breath? Lost all the IRL friends I used to have. Online friendships always tend to fizzle out. Logged into Discord last night to see another 3 friends had removed me from their list, so back to 0 friends to play video games with again. I just...I can't keep going on like this. I don't know what the f\*ck to do. I can't see how to continue like this. Why I should even continue at all, when there's nothing to aim for, hope for, or live for."
lonely,It’s a rant,"It’s a rant - 
And also. Fuck you. Fuck you so fucking hard. Putting me through all this shit because I followed someone on fucking Instagram. Not even multiple people so it’s like I have a pattern of being attracted to multiple people just one. Just one fucking person and I have to suffer fucking endlessly. Fuck you man. And I hope I pass out till next fucking week and not have to deal with this fucking shit. I’m tired of saying death. And if you check my Reddit and you see this. Don’t you dare get fucking upset. Because I have done every fucking thing that is expected of me. Everyone of it. I’m not the worst fucking guy to exist because I wanted to see ass. You have like no idea what fucking porn I watch. I unfollowed the fucking girl which I do not even fucking know by the way, which I never defended or asked about ever fucking again. Still not enough for you. Because I have to fucking think like you to make you fucking happy. Because I never do this shit to you because you don’t have my views on stuff. Lots of fucking times, I didn’t agree. I let my shit roll fucking over. And not over where I’ll pretend I’m okay. Over as like I actually fuvking get over this shit. Yours is I followed a person. Mine is you fucking met up with a guy behind my fuvking back, TWICE! fuvking twice. Why am I not bringing that up every fuvking week. Yeah then add that to you fuvking hiding your device all the fuvking time. You know who hide their devices? People with shit to fuvking hide. Miss me with that you have private stuff bullshit. I don’t know what the fuvking it is you hide in that iPod but oh my good nesss the day I find out. Let me see how you like your cake. Bro like read your fucking Reddit. What did they tell you? About partners who rather than bring up solutions always bring up the fuvking past and let that create problems. It’s there or you Diddnt see it hmm. Then those your friends. Coming around to act like you’re the saint I’m the fucking devil. Like bro. Recount to me. Tell me all the very shitty Things I did. Feeling upset when you insulted me? Or walking away from an argument which you’ve gotten so cozy with recently. Everything you ever complained about. Watch how you’re fucking doing it now. Wearing earpiece with me. Bending your head. Not talking. Hugging you. Holding your hands. Disgracing you in public. All of that you’ve shouted at me at some fucking point. But here we fuvking are. And you mf reddit guys, before you start with your fuvking bullshit about. You want a prize. You want to r celebrated . No I don’t want a fucking prize. What I want is a partner who’d respect me and be mature enough to understand that we’re not going to be fuvking on the same page all the fuvking time.you have to grow the fuvk up and say your problem so it gets fuvking fixed. Not doing this whole hing because I don’t agree with you on something. Like fuvking this. Honest 
If this has bad reception. I’m not going care, for the first time. I’m doing something for me. Damn the consequence. So no. I’m not leaving this in my notes. No I putting it on fuvking Reddit"
lonely,My last straw,"My last straw - My main 3 friends and I don't talk often but I always considered them my best friends for over 7 years or so. Our relationship requires no effort to spend time with each other and talk online (which I like) and we hang out about once a month. We are all growing up and separating from each other and now all have friends of different groups, which is perfectly okay. Throughout our friendship, I realized I put in the most effort (like gifts, asking to do things) while always feeling like an outsider with them. I have a few other friends outside of that circle whom I would consider myself close to as well.

I recently went through a breakup and I texted my main 3 friends immediately, and only 1 responded and cared enough to ask me to dinner to talk about it. No one

Lately I have been working on a few projects for my graphic design portfolio that I need to get into a program at school and it's vital that I present my best work. I started on a project and put a few pieces in a doc with a few questions for them to answer for critique. It should take 5-20 mins to complete. It's been about 5 days and not a single of my 6 friends have put their input in. I am really disappointed because a lot of my brother's friends (whom I don't even talk to at all) have put their input in on the same day I made the doc. 20 mins is a lot to ask for someone, but if my friend even asked me the same favor or to spend hours proofreading theirs essays, I would make time to do so."

I’ve never been an outgoing person, I’ve always kinda stuck to myself. It’s hard for me to open up to people, but it’s something I’ve tried to work on. 

Anyways, I hope it passes soon and I feel better. Right now, I just feel awful"

lonely,feeling slight burn out from my very boring routine,"feeling slight burn out from my very boring routine - I'm . My routine for quite a while is ridiculously boring. I wake up at morning, go to school, spend time with my classmates/friends during breaks, go home and spend time in my room studying more or less, occasionally playing video games or just watching youtube, reddit etc. yesterday is when started to feel this. Yesterday was the the last bell day in which we celebrated our last remaining days in gymnasium. It was fun and quite sad that we won't get to spend anymore time besides the last days. We also had to go to a homestead the same evening but I had to miss it because I was failing math (I was always bad at it but this is the first time I was failing it) and the day before the last bell I found out that the math teacher decided to give me a test tomorrow (friday) for which I had two days to prepare. After last bell I went to the teacher and she prepared the main things of the topics I had to study for and this would've given me the night to go to the homestead but after I returned home my mom was like there is no way you can go there due to the test, I even tried to explain that I paid my money for it and she told screw the money, you need to study, spend all the time you have and study. My dad also talked to me but in a much nicer way and explaining the situation simply and I understood that but either way I wouldn't have studied late at night and also I would have probably returned home at normal time like past 9AM and this is the last time I could have gotten to spend time with my class in a personal way and I won't get another chance at this. Now, you'll probably say that I'm 18 and I have the choice to decide what I want to do and what not but if I don't go by my mom's rules she'll get fucking pissed and start ranting day long about not only why I'm making the wrong choices by not agreeing to her rules but about everything like how important studying is, how I never listened to her and how all of her relatives are good people and achieved a lot and I'm at the bottom with my dad which makes it not worth the risk (even my dad does everything to prevent it). This shitty situation made me realize the routine in which I'm stuck and all I want right now is to socialize more but more specifically recreate going to the homestead because it would have been really special to me but I know I won't get the chance to do it. Today after all of this made me feel the slight burn out that I'm having, it's not like I can't physically get out of bed but it's just so hard to study anymore or do anything productive...

I'm sorry for the long read but I needed to get this off my chest and to see what will be said about this. So thanks for reading this post"

And here I am, again, without a soul to talk to.

I go out most weekends. I ride my motorcycle places and tried to rekindle the fire on old friendships I've had.

But nobody engages me on a personal level. I don't have anyone at the end of the day. I am just living life on my own and it only gets harder with time.

What else should I try? As you can see, I've even started looking online but that's not been successful at all"
lonely,"so, 2nd mental breakdown in a year.","so, 2nd mental breakdown in a year. - Today I had my 2nd mental breakdown in a year.

First, I started doing 3D modeling and by March I had a few friends and a discord server and everything was going nice but a small confrontation made my depression swell up and my head was like ""go F yourself nobody likes you"" so in Order to shut my head, I just deleted all my 3D art and distanced myself from those people.

Now today, I have started a course on Web Development, courtesy of a friend that wanted me to get a good future, one of my only 2 friends, she lives 10 hours away and my other friend is a nurse so she doesn't have a lot of time. And we had a discord and all, everything was alright for a month, but a douchebag threatened me because I as an admin didn't want to change his name colour and he threatened me. It took me again to that point of my head against me and I again deleted everything and distanced myself.

Why can't we just live in peace? Why I cant just be normal?

Fuck I am sad."

lonely,Am I overthinking or my kids really need better parents,"Am I overthinking or my kids really need better parents - Had abusive mother, her husband molested me for years. She married me off when I was 20 to a man of 40. He was a fraud and ran away from home after 5 years of marriage when I was 25 and had 3 kids. 

Living in an islamic south Asian country, after taking divorce, I spent 7 years struggling to survive and then met a man who loved me enough to marry me. He is 6 years younger than me.

But things are going bad. He had a passive income via guest house that got sold during COVID. He never found a job again and is jobless from last 2 years. I am the only one earning. I buy his clothes and food too other than paying rent and bills and everything under the sun.

He sleeps all day and watches TV all night while I am getting deeper and deeper in debts. Begging other men to lend money untill I could get a raise in salary. 

I work 3 jobs from 9am to 2am. Kids are getting neglected and he doesn't care much. He doesn't scold them or anything but he also doesn't treat them as I want him to. Kids are teen-agers now and they need friendship from parents. I don't have time and he doesn't care. 

No family to love us, no friends to talk to. I feel suicidal and depressed. From last one week I am seriously thinking to get rid of this pathetic life. 

I can't divorce him because in this country people will eat me and my teen daughters alive if we don't have protection of a man. And no, I don't have money to move abroad. My eldest son is gonna be 15 soon, girls are 13 and 12. 

Please please don't give me advice that is not practical in my cultural context."

lonely,"The man I love lives in a different country, yet he is one of the few I have not forgotten. Struggles with love, friendship, family, and memory","The man I love lives in a different country, yet he is one of the few I have not forgotten. Struggles with love, friendship, family, and memory - There is a man I met nearly two years ago. He responded to a post I made challenging people to talk to me without asking me who I am or reading any previous posts. I would do the same in this challenge. This was because I was tired of people judging me by my age and gender. I was tired of being talked down to and others trying to cater to my perceived masculinity. I just wanted to be talked to as the person I am and this was my way to do it. Little did I know the man I would come to fall head over heels for would be one of the people to message me over it. For several months we didn't know each others ages and we just treated each other as equals.

The fact that I can remember this is unusual. I have a strange memory and by strange I mean entirely dysfunctional. I can not willingly remember most memories. I can remember fragments of them but not the whole thing. This isn't necessarily abnormal until it starts being my whole memory down to just yesterday and even earlier today. Rarely is it can I remember any parts of my life. If prompted by something else I can briefly put together the memories but they fall apart soon after and I can't even remember that I put the memory together it is only from others that I know that. 

I have hurt many friends and even my own family because of my memory. I can't remember birthdays. Often times I wont be able to remember significant moments in my friendships and sometimes I forget who my friends are. I retain a familiar feeling about them but I can not remember anything about them. 

In the past year I've also opened up about these problems to my mother. She tries to hide it but, after the realisation set in that I was serious that I can not remember nearly any of my childhood, the hurt shows in her eyes. The amount of damage I have caused with my memory is immense. There have been things I've said and arguments had that ruined friendships that I didn't remember. 

About 5 years ago I started shutting the world out because it became too difficult to see the hurt I was causing. I pushed my friends and family away, isolating myself. I let only one or two people in at a time and even them I still kept them at a distance out of a fear that I would forget. Then after 3 years of doing that I decided to start letting the world back in. Living the lonely life I had been trying to live was hurting myself and those I was afraid to forget. 

This is when I started using reddit and met the man who end up being the absolute sweetheart I didn't know I needed in my life. Life is never so easy though, he lives in a country in Europe and I live in the United States. When we first met he was getting over some past trauma and a rough break up. He and I grew together as we had our own struggles but continued to lean on each other. At times we had to convince each other that we weren't burdening the other person. I helped him see a part of himself that he had suppressed and he helped me be okay with being me. 

We have come a long way and one of my biggest fears now is losing him. He has become a part of my life whether or not we will ever be able to be together. He is special to me and I believe it's demonstrated by the fact I can remember our discussions. I can remember how we met. I can remember the way he and I have grown because of each other. 

I write this both to let others who may have similar issues with memories and loneliness know that with the right person things can be different at least with that person. I am also writing this as a record because although I remember now there is no guarantee I will remember the wonderful part of my life that is this man in the future. I am writing this so I can know how much he means to me if I forget and so that he can know how much he means to me even if I forget. 

Memories are fickle things one moment they may be there and the next they're gone. To those who have memories of joy, memories of laughter, and memories of surprise take a moment to appreciate the memories you still have. If you are like me and the majority of your memories, which are few in number, are of pain, regret, and shame then I understand what you are going through and hope you can find someone or something that brings you joy, safety, or comfort like had the fortune to. 

I am still quite lonely as I can't remember those who used to be my friends but at least I have someone. 

As a final note to me and the man I love if I forget remember this,

 I remember when we shared our vulnerabilities and strengths. I remember the long nights that you made easier because it felt like you where there with me. I remember how I told my other friend about how wonderful you are. I remember how I told my mother about you and I was afraid she wouldn't accept you. I hope this day will never come but if I ever forget I am so sorry. If I ever hurt you by forgetting please know it wasn't my intention.

I come here every once in a while to vent, and i delete the post later on.

Loneliness is terrible, truly, until you experience it for so long that you actually become comfortable with it, and actually come to realize that's not even the worst of it, after 3 decades of this thing we call life i've come to realize the truly worst part for me was how it has always been shit! Like literally every stage of my life sucked bad! Not one part was normal! Every experience you're supposed to have in your childhood, teenage years, 20s, i did not have, not to mention the absolute fucked experiences i did have.

Think i'm exaggerating? I once decided to try therapy, and all i knew about therapy was that people sat in a chair crying while telling their stories. Well.. i told the therapist about my childhood and teenage years, she cried, lol, and described it as brutal.

I'm honestly just tired of being tired, if i know for a fact that i can never be happy, why not just check out already? I'm sooo fucking good at handling so much pain all the time, but no one should experience this much pain, it's no way to live.

I would love for things to change, it would be amazing for once to have even a bit of happiness and acceptance, but that just seems to always be out of reach. I've decided to give myself a deadline where i either make some essential things happen somehow or i am done with all of this."

lonely,2 years alone with no path forward.,"2 years alone with no path forward. - Hey everyone, things have been pretty hard for me for a while now and I'm hoping that sharing it will help me find a path forward out of this situation. 
 I'm alone. I'm 23 and I live with my parents and I have done since I left university back in early 2020. I never really had many friends growing up but I had small but strong network of people surrounding me how I felt like would be with me for life but over the time I was at university, which was a significant distance away from where I grew up, these relationships suffered and I lost all but 1 of my childhood friends. This 1 friend stuck with me after university and I'd meet up with him every month or so but he ended up growing away from me, he became really distant and didn't want to speak to me much anymore. One day I called him out on it and we argued. I asked him if we'd met today rather than as kids, would he still want to be my friend. He refused to answer. That was over a year and a half ago and we've not spoke since. 
 The only friends I had left were the one's from university and I stated that was quite far away. I do try and keep these relationships up with messaging online and visiting when I can but I can't afford to keep going back (I haven't met up with any of them in 7 months) and I find that if I don't message them, they don't really message me ever. It makes me wonder if perhaps they'd prefer it if I just left them alone, maybe they'd be better without me. 
 I hate myself. I don't think there's any doubting that, I find myself disgusting and I think there is something about me that is unquestionably broken. I feel broken. I look at myself in the mirror and I hate what I see, I see the things I say and write and I hate it. I sometimes meet people either at work or online and I want to get to know them better but I don't want to a be a burden on anyone more, I can't ask someone to have the misfortune of knowing me. 
 My parents try to help and I appreciate that, but I don't think they have the understanding of either me or the situation to help much. My mother always tells me all I need is a girlfriend and I'll be fine, but I know that is almost certainly a terrible idea. If I had a SO, all of that pressure would be put on them. I don't want to make someone feel like they can't live their life, have their own hobbies, friends, life outside of me because of this problem that I caused myself, no body deserves that burden. 
 I don't know what to do next to be honest and I've struggled to find any solutions anywhere, I feel as if I'm trapped in my own world that no one will ever understand. Maybe this is how it's supposed to be, maybe I deserve this. I just don't know."

A guy from childhood I met on Reddit (who responds but we are in the same situation)

Ex gf who’s cool but doesn’t respond much if all anymore

narc’s sister who I met when she was 6 three years ago. Person who texts me first the most is an elementary schooler..

Narcs other sister who’s 14, hasn’t responded for the last month and sister reports her distress but refuses to elaborate further 

And the female ex of the narc who blocked me who was sympathetic to my situation and stuck around, but she’s a very busy person so it’s usually me texting first asking how things re every few weeks

And the rest? Countless dead contacts who I have removed from view on discord wondering who and when will ever decide to reach out, but when the last message was 6 months ago you know they were never really there, they don’t cares.

I keep getting down on myself for so many things. There isn't much I look forward to. Right now the only things I look forward to is moving out of the city I live in and finding you.

I think of you every day. I know I'm not helping myself by not looking... It's just so hard to motivate myself to put myself out there. There are so many girls I meet that I know aren't you, my future wife. Plus wanting to move doesn't help.

I know you probably aren't going to read this, ever. But it's nice to be able to get this off my chest. So, thank you.

I hope I find you soon.

lonely,So hard to balance,"So hard to balance - When I was younger I had a much more full life - friends, young kids, a wife, and a full-time job that had me interacting with many many people every day. 

As I got older, I found myself pulling away from everything and everyone. I felt I needed a break from people. It felt good to have some relief from the demands of the world.

But now, I'm retired (basically they fired me), and divorced. I still keep in close contact with one of my kids (the other one decided to cut me out of her life when I left her mom). I had to move 5 hours away from them all because I couldn't afford to pay rent and my oppressive support payments. So I'm in my mother's basement.

So, I'm ashamed of my living situation and of myself in general. In the last year, I have been spending more and more time alone - I often go days on end alone here in my little basement.

I have all but given up on being involved in any kind of romantic relationship. I haven't been so much as hugged by anyone in at least 4 or 5 years. 

I guess it is a case of 'be careful what you wish for'. 

The loneliness comes in waves - I can distract myself with a good tv show or whatever but I'm starting to wonder what the long-term effects of this self-imposed isolation will be on my psyche. For example - the thought of going out and doing something causes me so much anxiety now - the smallest little thing can cause me to retreat to my bed, medicate myself, and sleep yet another day away.

OK, end of rant."

guys would bitch about their girlfriends to me and go to me whenever their girlfriends aren't ""fulfilling their emotional needs"". then when they break up, try to get with me instantly because they just can't stand not having a girl. I hate it

lonely,"Good morning, everyone","Good morning, everyone - Good morning. I hope each and evrry one of you awesome golks is able to have a day a little bit better than the one before. You have all got this. For what its worth, know that some internet rando is wishing you well! As always, if anyone needs to talk, I am here."
lonely,Single and Fed up,"Single and Fed up - 31F and I’m very much single. Sure, I could’ve put myself out there more, but I’ve been through a lot of shit, like having an emotionally abusive ex and emotionally abusive platonic friend that I recently cut off contact with. On the one hand I’m so angry with people for the way I’ve been treated, the way I’ve allowed people to walk all over me and tell me what to do. The way people continue to treat me. I can’t trust anyone right now. I have to do that to protect myself. But at the same time, I feel more alone than ever. I have pretty much no friends. Maybe a couple people I could send a text to, but that’s it. But seeing other people getting married and blah blah, I just can’t help but feel angry, terrified, that that will never happen for me. I feel like the longer this lasts the harder it will be for me to find someone. I’m just so sad."
lonely,My best friend hasn't texted me back and it's been two months.,"My best friend hasn't texted me back and it's been two months. - Heyy..so my best friend hasn't texted me back and it's been a long time. He's usually very busy with school, stuff..just lots of things. He replies back usually at least within three days of not, a week or two. This time he left me with only an I'll be back soon when he hadn't responded back for like two-three days. We did break up last June and he blocked me on August. January this year i approached him on a different account and things are fine between us, it's better than before. He's been my best friend since the beginning and I to him, we're really close. I tend to call him my twin jokingly because of how similar we could be in many aspects. I miss him and it's just completely overwhelming me. I'm the one who was deeply in love with him and still is which he's fine with, he knows about it. Although at times like this, it gets to me and I've been having nightmares or stressful dreams where I keep seeing us together (we're long distance) and it just ends up in me crying in the middle of the night and sometimes even in the morning afterwards thinking about it. I've always been more of a worrier than him and it's kind of obvious and I genuinely hope he's alright. The reason we broke up was coz he just felt burdened and depressed by having to lie to me about loving me even though he did genuinely love me at first, life just...gets to you. It happens. I've asked many times if i was ever the reason and he's always reassured me i never was. He tells me the opposite, that I'm the sweetest and most loving person he knows, and the only one who checks on him and tells me I shouldn't be doing it but I do it out of worry mostly. I hope someone could help 💔"

lonely,i give up trying to find someone,"i give up trying to find someone - it feels awful having to accept that i’m gonna be alone … but at the same time it gives me peace knowing that no one will ever have the chance to hurt me again. 
 
i don’t want to shut everyone out but it’s for my own good… if i let someone hurt me again i will lose my fucking mind

lonely,When you have friends and you are still lonely,"When you have friends and you are still lonely - I begged for so long to get friends that party and have similar interests, now that I have it I feel so out of place and I dont feel like I belong. I dont get their jokes and its so hard for me to get close with anyone. I yesterday skipped a party and now I feel lonely and have so much anxiety. When will this internal hell ever end. Im just continously in need of some sort of validation and even around my friends I just feel so lonely, unwanted and different."

lonely,feel like none of my friends match my energy,"feel like none of my friends match my energy - That sounds like such a shitty thing to say about my friends but hear me out. I've only had two friends since graduating high school. One of them is a socially awkward guy who I usually go to for doing stuff. Another is a girl who i go to for more emotional support. Lately I've been realizing that I'm almost 25 and I wanna go out and have fun on my time off. I want to be crazy enough to throw on a pair of boots after my 8hr shift and go dancing, but always end up eating chips at home because both my friends are either too busy, ignore me, or don't wanna go out. I have these weird day dreams of moving to the city and meeting a close knit of people like the ones on Friends (TV show) and just having really close bonds with people that will fill the loneliness i feel sometimes. Lately I've been feeling that i want to drop both my friends and just start doing things on my own, but how do you go to the club alone? How do you genuinely enjoy going places alone and especially with social anxiety? Any tips, comments, ideas? 😭"
lonely,"What am I doing wrong? Please give feedback, godbless you if you read this.","What am I doing wrong? Please give feedback, godbless you if you read this. - I’m a single father, with one 6 year old boy, I bust my ass to give him everything he need/wants and i try to be my little man’s ""hero"". He’s my world and more. 

Anyways I’ve been single for going on 7 years now, I just turned 29 and Im starting to fear being alone for the rest of my life. And I hate being alone for the past 7 years, no dates, no nothing, no conversations with other girls, I just feel like I’m not good enough for anyone and I don’t know why. And it’s starting to get to me. 


The thing is I NEVER used to be shy around women, but now it’s like they’ve got a god damn gun to my head lol when they don’t. My sons mother hurt me pretty bad to say the least. I survived an attempt on my life because of the stuff she would say to me. Ever since then I’ve felt broken. And I don’t want that burden on someone else’s shoulders. 

Just miss having someone that would just listen to me, and understand me again. Fuck.

I don’t know man, I’m just sick and tired of being sick and tired. 


Thanks for reading. Sorry if I messed up I’m on a iPad 😂"

I want to scream, but I can't. I want to cry, but I can't. I feel empty and want to be with the void."

lonely,It's difficult for me to being social lately...,"It's difficult for me to being social lately... - Hello! Well I've been struggling with this situation. (sorry for the typos i'm not a native :c)

I've always have been kinda anti-social cause I'd prefer being alone rather than having parties or meetings but sometimes I need to 'recharge' my social battery but that just lasts a few days and then I feel tired of interactions again. 

I've had theraphy and my depression levels decressed a lot but the thought of me being lonely and not being able to meet new people or flirting with someone due to my lack of social habilities is making me feel so sad... 

It has been like 2 months since I feel like I don't deserve to date someone and that I'm not that interesting enough to catch the attention so I feel like I don't even have to try it anymore (plus my  attachment disorders from my childhood that keep me off from any physical interaction but that's another subject)... 

I have never had a relationship before (plus that makes me feel like some kind of loser haha it's absurd I know pretty well) and I also think being an inexperienced person on these matters makes me so boring and not so interesting.

I tried to talk about this with my therapist but their solution is to try hook up with someone and yeah that's practically the main issue here lol well i guess that's all for now Oooh i almost forgot that I've been listening to songs that are kinda romantic-melancolic and i can't stop the urge to long for a relationship also the smallest thought about something romantic makes me want to cry and I really cry just seeing something beautiful just like Elliot seeing the sunset (insert that scene reference from Bedazzled pls).

  
Hoping no one feels like me bcause it's so tiring feeling this way, like only relationship love it's what I need to be happy now... thanks for reading I appreciate &lt;3 thank you for allowing me to get off this burden"
lonely,is this it?,"is this it? - i cant even talk to anyone, i dont even know if they'll answer or not but i've always thought about doing it, still, i cant, im too scared of doing something wrong or fucking up again i just cant

i just wish i knew i was doing something right finally, then i wouldnt've to be worried, i could just be happy and enjoy everything

i wanted to be a boyfriend, i wanted to have a boyfriend who thought i was special, someone that thought i was important, i just wanted to feel like i was worth it, instead im here, trying to get even a fucking gram of love when no one even cares

i feel like i want love but no one even wants to try to love me...just, what is wrong with me? i feel like i give off either a weird vibe or just, something that blows people away...i try to fix it, im trying to fix everything...

i wish i found him...then i wouldnt have to be alone, i could finally be happy again, i could finally have someone that loves me and wants me and cares about me and just, thinks im enough...thinks im worth it."
lonely,"If you’re ever feeling lonely and see this, then message me!","If you’re ever feeling lonely and see this, then message me! - No one in this world should feel alone. We all need to show a little more humanity and help eachother out. If you’re reading this and feel lonely feel free to PM me or reply on here I’m always here to talk and help!"
lonely,always afraid,"always afraid - I let that fear consume me now I have nothing...it's always run away, hide, escape...I don't think I'm capable of much more than receding within myself, a non self. Because there's nothing fucking here, nothing out there. Even the pains nothing..I just run for no reason. I'm afraid of nothing , that's all there is but I keep running regardless because that's all I know..I'm sick, wish I was more fucked up to the point I wouldn't notice. Thats what I need, to become so insane nothing matters. Right now it's just a joke, an act but I need it to become a reality. Then I'll finally be free from all this bs"
lonely,I watched a video about loneliness,"I watched a video about loneliness - And there it says being lonely creates pure stress and idk this is fucking me even more but it’s true I’m always stressed 😩 uff I just found out that I can’t live like that , either I can overcome this or I have to die.. but the fact that being lonely creates huge stress is stressing me because stress makes u look old etc. idk but it’s true all the time , when I met with an friend I feel the stress relieves. And yeah of course it creates stress because we are social creatures … we are not meant to be alone .. I just hope I can find the strength to work against it , but all this depression and anxiety too kill my energy"
lonely,What’s wrong with me? I’m crying so much it hurts more than anything,"What’s wrong with me? I’m crying so much it hurts more than anything - I’m a 19 year old lesbian with a heavy background of childhood emotional/physical and sexual abuse. 

I dream of being comforted by a beautiful woman every single night whilst I heavily sob into my pillow. I cry so so much that it’s hard to breathe and the only reason I don’t pass out from the pain is that I daydream of a sweet, gentle and beautiful woman comforting me and kissing me. I feel like the most pathetic person in the world that this is the only way I feel safe and that I can fall asleep. My daydreaming is so vivid that it feels like reality, and when I stop thinking about it I cry even more about the fact that I’ll never experience such a loving touch from another woman. When I remember all the nights my dad abused me I block it out and imagine a calm, gentle woman rubbing my back telling me to shhh and that it’s okay. I imagine her calling me pet names like “sweetie”, “darling”, “honey” and “my love”, and my heart aches whilst I imagine someone that will call me that. I do this every single day, and not just when I’m sobbing from my flashbacks at night, but also when I’m feeling stressed or alone in the day. I feel like a little kid when I cry so hard and curl up into a little ball and pretend there is someone next to me hugging me so tight that the pain goes away. I dream of feeling safe in the arms of a woman and being able to cry as hard as I can and that she can take the pain off from my chest. The part that hurts the most is that I know I’ll never experience such a beautiful feeling that I long for so deeply. I’ll always be a lonely ugly lesbian that’s never even been kissed by another girl."
lonely,9 years touched once,"9 years touched once - I have been with my wife for almost 9 years now. We met online due to a common friend and we hit it off quick and started dating in the blink of an eye. It all felt so good and I became blind quick to the world and focused on how to up my game to provide for this woman. Time slowly trudges along and we expect to have a little one early in our relationship. I ignore many red flags ranging from her getting cold feet to finding her leaning back towards to her sexual interest in girls (communicating with a ex female lover). I blame all these problems on how crazy her life was before she met me so I do what I do best and see the “good” in the situation. Fast forward to today and I feel the loneliest I have felt ever. I have been “touched” by her one time and that was early early in the relationship when she stayed at my house for the first time. So 9 whole years of yearning for physical and emotional support from my partner in this so called life. Yes, I have asked and talked to her about why this is the case and it becomes awkward and blamed on our living arrangements tied to living with her parents at the time. I busted my ass to buy us a home so we can grow our relationship! I put the time in so my wife would respect and want me in the ways I’ve always wanted to be wanted. Fast forward to almost a year in our new home and yet to see any change.. am I not good enough? I feel gross.. I feel lost.. I feel so heavy inside.. this is starting to affect every aspect of my life. At work I’m sinking into a monotonous cycle month to month sales goals. I ghost friends and have lost many due to not feeling good enough. My poor kids see a hallowed out version of myself because my battle lays within. One day my soul will see happiness.. one day.."

lonely,Disrespect,"Disrespect - I just had a verbal fight with my younger sibling. It was very a small, unimportant issue so I decided to just let it go and kept quiet. But i don't know why he won't shut up? He just can't let it go. I spoke and said to please not make it bigger and to have a little respect for me whose older and didn't do something to disrespect him. 

It just hurts me so much to hear words from them that until now I am crying. I know that respect is not given but earned. But I am still a human being, i didn't kill anyone or do anything. I didn't do amything to earn such behavior from them. He's not a bad person. When we're ok, he wasn't like that. 

It's just that, I just don't understand how easy it is for them to say words that can hurt another person. I'm just so tired of dealing with them. 

I admit I have a contribution on that misunderstanding but I kept quiet to not make it bigger. My brother is an argumentative person so I know that even if I said something, it won't get solved. So I just keep quiet if its just a small issue. But he just won't keep quiet! To the point that he talking about unrelated things and saying hurtful words that I don't deserve. 

I just want to let this out..I have no one to tell this to. I can't talk to my friends, I don't want to them to look down on me. 

We went through so much as a family, I've given up things for them. I don't expect them to treat me the best or even as someone important. I just want them to respect me."
lonely,"Just lost a friend of 5 years, one of my last friends too.","Just lost a friend of 5 years, one of my last friends too. - I just recently lost one of my last couple friends left, my heart currently feels like a bullet just hit me. I’ve loved her for those 5 years, until 2 weeks ago she acted weird and just today cut all contacts with me without reason. Today alone has been really difficult to go by, used to see her almost everyday. Now it’s all gone down the drain due to her stupid brain decision that I don't even know why she did this.
I really don't think i'm gonna make it as an working adult like this. I've been shot down before but this ones the most painful yet, 3rd time.
Today basically marked the first time i've been isolated since 2016. I already miss her happy attitude she emitted. But i guess its time to move on."
lonely,Does anyone else feel sad when they’re alone at night?,"Does anyone else feel sad when they’re alone at night? - It’s not that I’m sad for a particular reason or that I’m upset to be alone because I don’t mind being by myself in the daytime. But then when nighttime hits, I get extremely sad, sometimes crying-sad. And this only happens when I’m alone.

I could just be distracting myself when I spend the night with someone and that’s why I’m not sad. I just want to fall asleep immediately so I can avoid these feelings and wake up happy again. 

Do any of you guys also experience this? What can I do to help this?"
lonely,Nobody ever cares about anything I have to say,Nobody ever cares about anything I have to say - Every time I share anything to my friends they don’t give a shit and it shows. I just wish someone would actually listen to me and it not end up  going through one ear and out the other. I feel so damn lonely cause when I share anything nobody cares so I feel like keeping it boxed up inside me.
lonely,Just putting something in here,"Just putting something in here - Today I skipped my last ever athletics carnival as I'm year 12, I was expecting to feel bad about it as I wouldn't get to be with my friends and enjoy the last carnival but I didn't. In a weird way I wished to feel bad for not going yet such feelings never arose; rather I watched the Batman and drew. Let me know if anyone else has had this feeling. 

Wishing to feel bad/sad about something but feeling nothing to happiness for going through with it. Otherwise enjoy your life"
lonely,I Am Invisible,"I Am Invisible - Every word I type or say constantly falls on deaf ears. There is not a single person whom genuinely cares about my feelings or what's going on in my life. To my friends I am only there because I have various uses to them. My family could not give less fucks about how I feel or what I have to say, they've only just now pretending they care bc I got into a good college and think I'll give them money if I get each. Friends and family both, and strangers too, just look right through me. I am extroverted, I talk to people, I try to be friendly and outgoing, I am in no way someone who quietly sits in the background, yet eyes constantly glaze right over me like I'm part of the wallpaper. I'm so sick of being ignored, I'm sick of constantly being talked over, I'm sick of talking to people thinking they're interested in what I'm talking about but I slowly stop because I realize they were never listening in the first place. What's wrong with me? Why am I so invisible? Why does nobody want anything to do with me unless they can use me for something?"

lonely,Dear Amy - I miss you,"Dear Amy - I miss you - Hey, I know your probably not ever going to read this but its cathartic for me to get it off my chest so I'm going to occasionally send them.

I miss you, I didn't realize how much, how much I craved hearing your voice or seeing your face. How much our late night conversations meant. I know were....well kinda not good for each other. Fuck I miss it though, your voice telling me I wasn't horrible, that I'm ok. I need that, I have all these horrible feelings, and I know you do to, and I want to be there for you.

I'm not strong, not brave, I miss you. I miss you so much and would give anything to talk with you again."
lonely,i hate getting attached too easily,"i hate getting attached too easily - and then they just pretend as if you don't exist. fucking hurts

lonely,Why am I not special to anyone,"Why am I not special to anyone - Some of my friends are hanging out rn and didn’t invite me but it makes sense to not invite me since I don’t even live near by. They haven’t been replying to my texts consistently in a couple days and I feel selfish for wanting to talk to them over the phone when they are better off going out and doing fun things. It’s not that I feel unwanted exactly, but more that I’m bothering them when they are having fun. 

Any time I’d text this one guy I liked, in the back of my head I felt like I was bothering him since he rarely texted me on his own. Even if he said I wasn’t bothering him, it still feels like I wasn’t a priory or anything. I don’t care if someone said that I didn’t mean enough to them at the time to say anything about me being special to them, I just want a little bit of affection that shows that I’m somewhere in their mind and they think of me more than I thought they did. 

Though I wish someone would look at me and want to bend over backwards to interact with me, even if their efforts only resulted in us saying good morning to each other and just talking about the weather. I think I want someone to think about me as a main part of their life right now"
lonely,really struggling but it’s feels hard to change,"really struggling but it’s feels hard to change - im a really lonely person, i have lots of free time.  i have very few that would consider me a friend.  i usually pretend i’m happy and just ignore it but it’s really hurting me.  i recently got a new job, and hoped it would be an opportunity for me to meet people and improve my conversation skills.  i have been working for about a month and nothing.  i have such a hard time starting conversations let alone become friends.  i just really need some friends"

lonely,"The ""best times"" of my life were all dreams","The ""best times"" of my life were all dreams - I can usually remember a lot from what happens in my dreams. I have this whole catalogue in my mind where I keep the important ones safe, and I've always done that. I'm by no means a lucid dreamer, so that makes the good ones that naturally come around all the better. 

... Yet when I look at the dreams I've had over these years I begin to realize that it's pathetic. Because those memories that I've had from them are some of the ""best times of my life..."" 


I guess I need to get out more often"
lonely,The Lonely Rose,"The Lonely Rose - The one rose in the bush that stands apart.             
Not cuz she's pretty or beautiful,                                 
But simply cuz she has more thorns than petals.

She says all the wrong things ,                                      
To all the wrong people at all the wrong times         
But oh the misery ,         
                                                  She doesn't know where she's going wrong.


All she wants is to love and to be loved                     
But oh the misery,                                                          
The few who've tried got pricked by her thorns.


She grows tired of waiting but she just can't stop.
She wonders why she tortures herself with hope ,
When she knows she will always be
The one rose in the bush that stands apart"
lonely,I could be wrong but I think I'm lonely because I'm ugly,"I could be wrong but I think I'm lonely because I'm ugly - I'm 1000% sure if I was attractive I wouldn't be so lonely, my phone wouldn't be so dry, I'd have people talking to me all the time"
lonely,Am I overreacting?,"Am I overreacting? - So I just started a new job and I really enjoy the work but the environment is starting to weigh on me. I’m one of two new managers and we have 2 long rolls of cubicles. We share 12 desks among 18 people. Everyone is assigned one to share with another manager who works opposite schedule of them. This is my 6th week of work and no one has taken to the time to assign me a desk so every day I just hop around to an empty one. The guy who is also new got a desk. I chalk this up to him being personable and everyone talks to him. I guess I’m just too quiet for my own good. I find it hard to talk to anyone there cuz every time I try it’s like they look at me like why are you talking. Only one of the managers has been cordial and taken to the time to show me how to do everything I need. 

It’s just starting to affect me because even though I only work 4 days, it’s hard to be somewhere 11-12 hours a day with basically bare minimum interaction and then have to go home to an empty lonely house 😕 it almost makes me want to go back to my old job cuz at least I had some people who would talk to me there."
lonely,"I'm so, so alone. And I deserve to feel that way.","I'm so, so alone. And I deserve to feel that way. - I never initiate contact with people, I only ever talk to people if they start the convo. I tell myself it's because no one ever wants to talk to me when I reach out, but really it's to save myself from rejection. Can't be rejected if you never do anything to reject. 

I get frustrated at the stupidest thing. Die in a video game? Anger. Get called an idiot by some random guy online? Anger. Get told I'm wrong when I'm not? Anger. Anger so strong I can't help but bite myself to the point of bruising, scratching myself hard enough to draw blood, or hit myself on the head hard and long enough to give myself a headache.  

Most recently, anger at my new kitten - only 2 and a half months old - for continuously trying to climb my leg. I went full streamer mode and picked him up by his belly and tossed him into his bed a couple feet away. He got me good, tho. Hand still stings. Hope it gets infected. I deserve it for mistreating an animal like that. 

I get passive aggressive with co workers when they try to tell me how to do my job, or call me out for not doing my job. I do only the bare minimum amount of work I can get away with without being fired, and spend the rest of my time on reddit. 

I hire women to have sex with me and pretend to care about me or find me in any way attractive for an hour every few months. Women who likely don't have a choice but to sell their bodies because the patriarchy makes it impossible for them to earn a fair wage. Hell, one such woman was actively high, and I still got on with it anyway. I sicken me. 

I have a million other garbage traits. I'm an idiot who thinks he knows everything and if he doesn't, makes it up on the spot to seem smart and knowledgeable. I constantly finish people's sentences. Im always just waiting for my turn to speak. If someone believes something I disagree with I immediately think I am better than them. I'm judgmental, hot headed, short-tempered, boring, stupid, unfunny, financially irresponsible, immature, ugly, fat, lazy, lonely, agoraphobic, and a serial whiner. Hence this post. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this. I just feel so damned miserable and I have literally no one to talk to. And it's no wonder that's the case, considering how I treat people. As if they exist only to help me with my problems, to the point I never start conversations at all, and as soon as I'm done talking about myself, the conversation ends. I don't blame anyone for ghosting my toxic ass like all my recently-gained gamer friends have done recently. Man it was a great feeling logging on to discord for the first time in a week to notice all your friends had removed you...  

Oh well, I don't expect anyone to read this. Or care about an animal abusing piece of garbage narcissist like me. I hope I don't wake up tomorrow. Be so much easier than taking responsibility for my actions, or taking it into my own hands - both of which I'm too lazy, scared, and incompetent to actually do."

lonely,"I'm 33F, been single since 16yo. How am I suppose to not feel pathetic?","I'm 33F, been single since 16yo. How am I suppose to not feel pathetic? - I had a girlfriend for a few months in high school, that's it. It's getting harder and harder to believe I ""just haven't met the right person yet"" and easier to believe I'm a socially inept hideous troll.
Right now I live with my best friend of 10 years, and her current partner practically lives here. In the 10 years we've been friends she's never been single more than a couple months, I've gone on a couple dates with 2 people but otherwise been single the whole time. It's hard to watch them be happy, or even be happy for her, because it's the 4th time she's been ""in love."" I have never been in love or had anyone love me before.
At this point it's humiliating, and I worry if I ever do meet someone they'll be turned off by my lack of experience. I feel like there must be something about dating I'm just completely missing, or that there's something very wrong with me that everyone's been too polite to tell me. 
All I've ever wanted is to have a favourite person, and be their favourite person, who I can love and support unconditionally and bake them muffins and buy them random little gifts. I don't understand why I'm not good enough for anyone to give me a chance. The older I get the more likely it feels I will die alone without ever knowing what it's like to be in love."

Now I’m back to my lonely life now And back in the us. Now all the days are so quite without her and I wish I had someone to talk to like that again. Sh*t doesn’t feel the same. Sometimes when there’s something I wish I could share with her I just kinda imagine what she would say in my mind and wonder how that conversation would go with her. I hope I can get the feeling she gave me again with someone else.

Your dad might come close. Or someone might pretend that they are for a while. But no one can ever fulfill your deep desire to be by your side 100% for the rest of your life. People die eventually. You were born alone (usually) and you’re usually going to die alone. I guess tonight I’m just trying to be thankful for the loved ones that I do have. And my dog. And I have me.

lonely,Romantic rejection and social isolation are killing me,"Romantic rejection and social isolation are killing me - I’m 24 and romantic failure and social isolation is killing me. Every woman I’ve ever been interested in is either taken or not interested. I can’t approach women in person because they usually either ignore me or tell me to go away. So, my only choice is using dating apps. Predictably, I’ve gotten nowhere no matter how many apps I try or how much money I spend on extra features.

The closest I’ve come to having a partner was a girl I met on a pen pal website. She was Russian-American and studying in Europe at the time. At that point in time, I was suicidal and very emotionally vulnerable since I couldn’t access my anti-depressants. We started talking and would voice chat/FaceTime and we grew close. She said she loved me and cared about me and I was the best thing that ever happened to her.

Then, she ghosts me for another man she met online because (her words) he had the money to buy her a plane ticket back to the states and I didn’t. She marries him and has a kid with him. Then they got divorced (all within the timespan of a year and a half).

I’m currently finishing my bachelor’s degree online since I can’t go on campus for practical and logistical reasons. My best friend moved away and the few other friends I have are not available to hang out with. I pretty much never leave my house and the community college was my only option (and I already graduated). 

I’m so fucking frustrated that I can’t catch a break and because it seems like no woman will give me a chance. The love of my life ended up being a disloyal lying bitch and no one else has come along. I’m a broke nerdy college student with a bunch of mental health issues, of course no woman wants me…

I can’t take the loneliness and  heartbreak anymore…"
lonely,Bad friends vs. no friends,"Bad friends vs. no friends - Which is worse? The quiet loneliness or hanging with someone who regularly hurts your feelings? Admittedly, I’m a very sensitive person, so maybe things just bother me too much. But the quiet and emptiness hurts too. I truly don’t know which is the lesser of evils anymore. I’ve been in this exact situation multiple times in my life (different players), and I still don’t have an answer to that question."
lonely,I feel so lonely during summertime,"I feel so lonely during summertime - I always end up getting super depressed over the summer bc the amount of newfound freetime that I have makes me realize how little friends I have. I made two really good friends over my first two semesters at college, but they started dating each other so the three of us don't really hang out together anymore. All I end up doing everyday after work (or all day when I'm off of work) is stay in my room, either watching youtube or doing something else completely unproductive. I don't even play video games or anything like that to engage my body at least a little bit physically, or interact with others online. I'm so used to isolation that I didn't even realize that it was the root of my depression until about a summer ago. Admittedly, I don't usually ask friends to hang out first, mainly bc I end up convincing myself that they have better things to do, or that they're busy ""bc they actually have a life."" So it ends up just becoming a pitiful and toxic cycle. Occasionally I'll exercise, either in my room or I'll go on a walk, and seldom a run. It's not that I never hang out with friends over the summer, it's just usually pretty rare, usually once, maybe twice every two weeks. I feel so out of touch with reality socially that I'm not even sure if that's a lot or not. It's usually the same three friends as well. I think my main problem is, that bc the amount of friends I have is so small, they mean so much more to me. Not saying that I don't mean anything to my friends, but I feel as if I overestimate how deep my friendship is with people, and that the ""closeness"" I feel is more or less one sided. Which isn't necessarily their fault, I just wish that I had deeper friendships with more people. And that those people also felt as if they had a deep friendship with me. I understand that this post probably comes off as extremely self-pitying and whiny, but I'm honestly just venting. I'm sitting by the window as it's storming so that's pretty nice."
lonely,Getting worse and worse everyday :),"Getting worse and worse everyday :) - I’m  and about to graduate high school, and I should be excited but honestly it makes me just want to die inside. The few friends I have I’m probably never gonna see again and we will eventually lose touch, I’m going into something I am not at all ready for. And the one good thing I had in my life, my online friends have also slowly been leaving me. I guess it’s time for me to learn that I am never gonna find a friend who is just going to be there in the long run for me because I guess at the end of the day everyone leaves me."
lonely,I was curious if I was just feeling dramatic or if I'm actually alone,"I was curious if I was just feeling dramatic or if I'm actually alone - So lately I've been contemplating at night before I go to bed and have realized everytime I've tried to make friends I've failed miserably because I'm never prioritized to talk to even, ever. No one ever wants to hang out with me. I made plans with one friend and asked him several times if we could hang out cus I had no one else to hang with and they said ""sure alright"", it went noon and they hadn't texted me yet so I asked if something happened and he said he was with friends, I replied with ""ah"" and was left on seen. People say they're my friend but never talk to me, so I wouldn't really call them friends. But I just see them with their best friends and such on their posts and ask myself at night if it's just me or if it's just other people, but I just wanna know why I always fail at making friends. I'm 16 I understand I have alot of time left but if I can't make friends at all early when others can then I don't think I have much a shot in the future. But if it's me I can't really change how I am, so really there's not much hope at all."
lonely,Venting,Venting - I can feel myself slowly deteriorating. I be wanting to scream like Kendrick in God is Gangster in every possible second in my life.
lonely,I don’t know what to do anymore,I don’t know what to do anymore - My life seems like its the same shit over and over with no kind of excitement or anything to look forward to. I know that’s mostly my fault as I for some reason can’t find anything in this world that truly makes me happy. I would say it’s probably been atleast 3-4 years since I’ve felt truly happy. The only thing keeping me going at the moment is the hope that the girl I want(my ex) will decide to give us another chance(we’ve talked about this before and she seems like she might).We dated for probably 2-3 years and ever since we broke up I can’t think of a time where I was truly happy. I just don’t see myself with anyone else. And yes I realize this is my problem and not hers which is why I’m coming here to vent. She’s just the only person in my life who I’ve truly felt wanted me/made me feel wanted and appreciated. I would do anything for this girl. But without that I don’t know what would keep me going anymore. The thought of me not being here crosses my mind on a daily basis now. Not just because I’m not with her but other factors I won’t get in to. It just seems the the world is kinda going to shit and I’m lonely without her. I’ve been with other girls since but none feel the same. Because of that and other things like just trying to survive in the current economy have me wondering why I do this to myself. I know this is probably just senseless rambling on my part but I really just needed to vent.

lonely,Advice on helping a lonely person,"Advice on helping a lonely person - Hello, all! I was hoping I could get some advice from you lovely people. I don't want to say where I work but let's just say I work in a doctor's office. For the last few months we've had a regular client coming in who's a super nice guy, genuinely such a kind genuine soul, but I can tell he's incredibly lonely. I've learned just from him kinda confiding in me over the months that he was previously 400 pounds, never left the house due to severe social anxiety, has no friends or romantic partners, though he does have a steady job he loves. His family are all alcoholics and drug addicts (he's completely drug/alcohol free) so it's just him caring for his mentally unstable mother. He recently put his dog down, is paying all the bills for him and his mother on a very modest salary, and still the only thing he does to cope is smoke now and then. He also confided in me that he's scared to even approach people, especially women, because of his loose skin due to his weight loss. 

I guess my question is, would it be weird to give him my number or contact info? I feel like this guy just really needs a friend. I don't want him to think I pity him or anything, he's genuinely awesome! I really get so excited to see him come into the office, we have great conversations and laugh a lot, and we're close in age so it's not just like a professional relationship or anything. I'm a woman if that makes a difference? I do find him attractive but more than anything I just really like him as a person and would consider him a friend. It feels like every time he comes in he almost can't wait to get past the medical visit and get on to venting to me.

I'm just not sure how to go about this I guess? I don't consider myself a lonely person, hence why I'm trying to treat this delicately and not come off like an asshole who's looking down on him or anything. I just really think he's awesome and it fucking sucks that he has literally NO ONE to lean on. If you met him in person you'd never even guess he had severe social anxiety cause he's so good at talking to people. I've had severe social anxiety in the past and know how painful it is. 

I always see people say like, they wish someone would just reach out, anyone, just to know they're not alone so....any advice would be greatly appreciated!!"

She immediately started a conversation which I ignored at first, but she persisted asking questions and making small talk. Turns out we go to the same uni, have a similar major, and share many interests. It was early morning so she was sleepy and she’d drift off putting her head on my shoulder then jolt awake and ask me to keep talking to her so she’d stay awake. It was like something out of a romance anime. She even said she hopes we’re in the same class next year. Me, being a complete idiot, forgot to ask her number when she got off her stop and so I never saw her again. Still keeps me up at night tbh ngl."

I need to talk, I need someone who’ll be there. Not just some one time thing, but every time I’ll need it. 

I trusted so much people, now… I don’t know what to do. I force myself to not trust people that seems kind, I refuse to trust someone when they say like ‘I’ll take care of it’.

I am easy on the eyes, fit and an adult who can carry conversations about almost anything. 

I am a big fan of cooking, playing board games, listening and playing music, sports, outdoors, video games, binge watching series and love to learn and try new things.

The biggest thing I am looking for in a friend is someone who is open and always looking to grow and learn. Not afraid to try new things or jump into the unknown. You also must be chill and not high strung. 420 is very welcome.

They even say I'm good looking and really attaractive opposite to my pov. Like I said, most of my friends ""gone"" and won't come back. I have two close friends right now. They are really supportive guys. I was having some nice time with them but I began to envy them which is really bad thing in our culture. They can get girls(even they have their bad decions or memory about them) and new friends easily. But only people who can understate me is in this subreddit or other ""lonely one sitation"".

It’s no one else’s fault, but I don’t know how to be any other way - I’ve been lonely and solitary all my life but in about 2019 I gave up on all of my relationships completely. I was actually a little relieved when the pandemic hit because I had a built in excuse for my isolation. I haven’t spoken to anyone or hung out with anyone in any meaningful way in 4 years. I haven’t made any friends in college. I’ve never dated anyone and I’m almost 22. I can say now that I have no friends. I go to class and then go home or to the gym, that’s it. And for a long time, especially as a teenager, I blamed this on circumstances, that I’m just not an extrovert, that I’m not pretty, that I struggle to meet people because I’m so shy and anxious, that my dating pool is smaller because I’m gay and in a small town, that I’m Aspergers af so I come off as off-putting to others, etc. But all of my external excuses are falling apart as an adult. I met a woman a few months ago (in one of my classes) who tried everything she could have done to be my friend. She was extremely nice and friendly, she initiated every conversation, she asked for my number, she lived right by me, she invited me to things, and at every turn I acted like a complete and utter asshole. I didn’t show up to anything she invited me to as I self-sabotaged by staying up very late the nights before so I would always be too tired to go, and I ignored her texts for months. Eventually she (completely understandably) gave up, and I feel absolutely horrible. I know being on the other side of this it probably just came off as if I didn’t like her but honestly I thought she was great, we had a lot in common and I would’ve loved to have talked to her more. I just kind of panicked and pushed her away from me. I can admit now that this is the choice I always make, I don’t try and even when friendship is offered to me with no effort on my part I choose to push people away, despite how lonely I always am. The reality is I am terrified of other people. Vulnerability makes me feel out of control and I can’t get close to people at all. I don’t know how to let people into my life and I don’t know how to be known by others. I can’t even be around people for very long at this point as I gradually start to panic (anyone looking at my face up close, or hearing my voice for too long, or coming into my apartment is enough to set me off) because I’m afraid once anyone knows anything about who I “really am” they’ll realize the mistake they made and leave. I know this all comes from self hatred and being punished for showing any vulnerability as an abused child but it’s so deep rooted that I don’t know where to even begin trying to change. All I know is that I hate that I’m acting like this towards other people, especially people who are the opposite of me, who are warm and friendly from the get go, because I think that’s such a beautiful trait and I know it’s hard to maintain in a world like this. I feel so much guilt about how I’ve acted over the years . I did text this girl an apology (which she did not respond to, understandably, also she graduated so she won’t be around anymore) which I am happy I did because it’s better than my usual strategy of ghosting forever. I know I am the problem and I know I have to do something. I’m not sure what but I do not want to make this mistake again or be this person for the rest of my life :("
lonely,i am so afraid of being and living alone in 2 months,"i am so afraid of being and living alone in 2 months - I live with flatmates since September. I have 2 months left and I decided a few months ago to move into a studio on my own. I don't move into the studio until my contract is up at the end of July

Thing is, I am dealing with PTSD and social anxiety. One part of me hating sharing the kitchen and stuff, you know, being with others. I wanted to be on my own

It took me a while to get used to them and talk more to them. Another part of me likes the fact that there is other people living with me in the shared flat. And I can walk into the kitchen and talk to them. Like company

I'm going to be honest. I've been on and off suicidal the past 5 years. I feel like I'm going to get worse without meeting new people. I have started full time work, but I work with people much older than me (I'm 22, my work colleagues are 35+) // I am a uni student, this is my hear off for work experience.

My life’s such a mess lol. I’m sat here now, at 19 years old, the “prime of life” as it were. I’ve just spent all night feeling sorry for myself and my miserable existence. Just spent a couple of minutes of my life cutting my arm because that’s what I deserve.

I never had to face any problems related to money. I'm considering to get my Master's degree next year from a different country just so I want to experience struggle with and have no options but to get a job to pay off my debts. I know it's a strange reason to get a degree just to struggle but I think it will help. Sometimes, I hate myself for not achieving enough. I hate myself for being so average. I hate myself for not having courage like other people to pursue their dreams with mental courage. I don't want to fucking put in the effort. Suicide seems so easy at this point. It feels like the easiest thing to do. Only thing which stops me from doing it are my parents. I don't want to give them pain for the rest of their lives. They deserve happiness and their happiness is me."

Kid is only 6 I am worried about future cancer risk due to the radiation, much concerned about abdomen radiation. I neither want to scare anyone nor offensive, I read that children are more prone to radiation risk.
Not saying the doctors were wrong, but those were due to me being panic and not discussing any alternate testing or imaging procedures with the doctor. I really feel like a dumb parent."

Literally anywhere you look, you will see people who love each other. I wonder what it's like. To have someone to hold you, love you, laugh with you. It makes me so bitter. I know I will never have that. Not with who I am. I remember when I was younger I used to play with these toys. Action figures and such. I would make myself the protagonist. In my eyes, I was outgoing, kind, and heroic. The type of person that would be attractive and loving. In my stories, I would always put in a love interest who would slowly fall in love with me. We would have adventures and conflict, but always each other. It was how I envisioned my life would play out. I wonder what younger me would think of who I am now? A 23 year old, lifeless shell, typing out misery on a keyboard to a bunch of random strangers who will forget me the next day. Perhaps it's finally time to end it all. I've had enough of this world, and, honestly, I've never fit in anyways. There's no place for a man like me, and I doubt anybody would miss this ghost."

I have really bad sensory issues so i have headphones on all the time and due to emotional negligence growing up and past relationships in all forms have made me learn that all people are unsafe, my abandonment/attachment issues are through the roof so i can never keep a friendship because of my emotional permanence. I’m 100% sure that i have BPD through my few years of researching and identifying symptoms, my therapist hasn’t seen me in well over a month so I can’t talk about my feelings and symptoms to anybody and my only source of ‘support’ was through my therapist (the appointments just consisted of me crying my feelings out and her saying its valid and then sending me back to class) and this has been my 9th therapist in the span of almost 3 years. my medications aren’t working and I feel so hopeless.

lonely,trios always fucking suck for me.,"trios always fucking suck for me. - Today I just cut off those two online friends of mine whom I used to talk to regularly. I just disappeared without warning and deleted all my socials. I feel empty, but it's better than crying everyday. Trios suck so bad for me. It's never an equal balance. The other two people always tend to be closer and I feel so utterly left out and lost. It's like they don't find me interesting anymore so they don't want to talk to me. When they say that they love me, they lie. 

None of them had the actual fucking decency of wishing me on my birthday by themselves even though I wished them on theirs by myself without any need of reminders. I don't mind if anyone forgets, because I forget dates a lot too plus a lot of people don't know my birthday. But these two couldn't even send me a text by themselves, despite knowing it?? It hurt so bad. 

I also have a part in this. I always self-sabotage such friendships. It's like a part of me is always screaming within me, banging their fists inside my brain that I am not being treated equally and I always spiral. I fucking want to stop doing that. I am such a killjoy. 

I just... couldn't take it anymore. It hurts. Why can't I be the first choice for just once? Why can't people treat me equally. It affects my self esteem so fucking badly whenever this happens. It hurts so bad when I end up caring more. The people I scarcely talk to treat me better than these supposed besties. And one of them used to give me gifts, which I was grateful for but it only made me feel so unequal. I didn't want those gifts and I never asked for them. I wanted your energy and enthusiasm. That would have been enough for me. And the worst part is that I still care a lot about them and think about them, even though I will not interact with them.

Ironically, I have a trio friendship irl too, and I don't feel like that at all. Possibly because we all are equal in a sense and those two are very level headed individuals. I am probably the problem in that relationship.

Why do I end up fucking myself up so bad"

Always felt as the third-wheeler in every relationship. The only girl i loved left telling me she couldn't deal with my dark, sad personality as she had her own luggage. Over the years develop body shame. Now can't socialise with people. I stay home 2/3rd of my day, Sleep through half of it. I am so lonely that i am only not pulling the trigger of my glock because of my parents. And once they pass away i think i wouldn't even have 1 person to ask if i were alive. I am pissed, broken and exhausted to a point that i crave joy. I genuinely haven't felt happy for a long long time. I wish i could love people, have friends, socialise, have conversations, or just even fucking live like nornal human beings. But, idk if i would ever be able to have even 1 person to talk to who genuinely cares.

lonely,Day by day,"Day by day - Sometimes it feels like a real challenge to pull myself out of bed and face the day. I have experienced so much grief and fucked up situations I'm almost afraid of what this new day will bring. I am not really ""alone"" as I have my 2 adult children staying with me while they are in school and my elderly grandfather who I caretake for. My kids have thier own lives and I really don't want to stress them out with my crazy problems and my grandfather he doesn't even recognize me half the time. So I ""feel"" alone but I'm not. If not for my kids I know I would have cashed my check a long time ago. I feel like my life is a long sad story and I'm finally reaching the final chapter and I will be glad to close it and move on. I miss my friend. We played D&amp;D together. I was the dungeon master. I brought her through a story of honor and war, vile enemies and dark sorcerers. We had so much fun. I wish I could go back and tell her I love her and stop her from ending her life. I hope she didn't think of me in those final moments. I told her I loved her as she bled out. I heard her last gasps for air. Her death rattle. I am forever scared. Why was just being my close friend not enough to keep her alive. What could I have done to stop her..if only I had known. So here I am, feeling alone and suffering from a powerful loss everyday forever. I hope none of you ever have to experience what I have. I want you to know I understand feeling low. I want you to be happy so if you see me I will smile and shake your hand and I will be kind and helpful..not because I am a good person or anything...but because I am afraid for you. I can't handle that ever again. In fact if ever I witness such an act by a friend ever again I will simply join them. It is far better than the alternative of surviving and living on carrying this horrible burden. 

Down, down to the bottle I go.
To heal my heart and drown my woe.
Rain may fall and wind may blow,
And many a mile bet yet to go.
But under a tall tree will I lie
When all my years have passed me by.

lonely,For all the lonely peeps :),"For all the lonely peeps :) - Message me if you’re looking to chat, make friends, whatever. I see your posts and feel a relation between my experiences and yours. When I was in school I wasn’t the most popular dude, I had my friends at school but once summer came around it was really a small group that I kept up with and now that I’ve graduated I only keep up with 2 people out of the hundreds of “friends” I had all throughout high school. Those 2 guys are some real homies to me, I’m grateful for them and I’ve been blessed to have found a partner who I can share life experiences with going forward but it wasn’t easy and it didn’t happen right away! Truth is you have to build yourself up to be a person that others want to be around, there’s qualities within you that are lovely and you need to be confident enough to allow those to shine through. You won’t be compatible with everyone, you just need to meet your people. Don’t give up, keep your head up and keep pushing. Do things that you enjoy on your own for a while, find a hobby that makes you happy. Get into drawing or painting! Get into some anime, watch a movie you’ve been wanting to see, build a PC or buy a game system or something and connect with others online. Go to the gym, go running, go ride a bike! Do anything be happy while doing it, other people that are into those same things will be attracted to you. I know one thing I did back then was get into the car scene, I started going to car meets and made many friends. Do something that makes you feel happy and eventually you’ll find that you aren’t alone. Message me if you wanna talk? Add me on ps4?"
lonely,Tired,"Tired - I'm tired. Tired of being alone. Tired of being depressed. Tired of not getting a good nights sleep for months at a time. Everyday I look in the mirror see the bags under my eyes getting darker and my hair getting grayer. I just want someone to hold me and tell me they love me. I've had dreams that I was in love back when I used to dream. It was the best thing I've ever felt and I've craved it ever since. I have seen friends fall in love, watched their relationships blossom into marriage. Hell, one of my friends made me tbe best man at his wedding since I'd been rooming with him when he met his fiance and saw their relationship flourish. Sorry I'm rambling but somethings need to be said. I guess I really want to know, should I even try to get back into dating? Im a fucking loser. I enjoy video games and comic books, useless movie trivia and history. I work a simple 9-5. Boring and nerdy, a fantastic combination. I used to draw, but that was before my mental breakdown 10 years ago, and that guy died that day. I used to be on 5 different dating apps, never got a response aside from obvious scams and 2 sentances of bland uninterest in me. My irl dating went even worse. Only ever ghosted and told ""oh your a nice guy you'll make a girl very happy someday."" yeah, right. My friends tell me the same thing, but my self doubts and self hatred twist my mind. ""they're lying. you'll die alone."". I dont like it there, in my head i mean. I guess thats another reason 'd like a relationship, someone to get me out of there, tell me i am a good person. maybe it'd feel more genuine. let me break down my mind and rebuild it right this time.

lonely,what should I do leave her or...?,"what should I do leave her or...? - hey guys, I m going to tell you a story that is quite complicated. it's a bit long.  but really appreciate your opinions

1.5 years ago: so I have a crush on one of my classmates, and I'm starting conversations with her constantly but not sure if I'm fully ready to get in a relationship or not so some time passed.

about 8 months ago: I started to show her my attention and talk to her much more than past but she was kinda escaping from it I could feel that she had some rules that prevents her from chatting with me or sth like this. I think she felt that I loved her and I was certain to get in rel with her. anyway, I started doing some research about her and felt that she has a bf (I was right). though I thought it wasn't a serious relationship and if I show her some more attention she would be with me, time passed again.

&amp;#x200B;

about 4 months ago: she texted me one night and asked me what would I do if sb left me. so I understood that the boy had broken her heart :(.

btw nearly a month we talked more and she was freely texting and I said to her don't be that dumb to get in rel with that bad\^$$ again. I was waiting for some time to tell her to start a relationship, cuz if said that while she was sad it would make a kinda jerk person I think. but after some weeks they go back together again and I was acting like we were just friends .why? you know we are in some same classes so I don't want to lose my dignity too. but again our chats were restricted and decreased in number.

sometime later I heard from one of my friends that the boy had texted other girls in class that they had broken their relationship and he is free to get in rel again!!!

my crush had heard that he told his friends he didn't like her and was with her to not feel guilty and bad\^$$. but I don't know that does she know this boy texted other girls to get in rel?

so what I want to ask: should I tell her? or just wait here and watch?  
or maybe I should remove her from my mind and just search for true love? XD

p.o.v: he told her that he is confused and needs some weeks to solve problems. and also said her not to get in rel with any boys!! he lied totally."

It seems like everyone around me hates me even though I have been nothing but good to them. All my friendships have the same pattern meaning that if I don’t message first the relationship doesn’t exist. I’m sick and tired of being treated like I’m some kind of embarrassment to be with that they wouldn’t want to invite even though there’s nothing wrong with me. I am always heartbroken 💔😔 and I’m convinced I’m destined for loneliness. My own mother looks down on me for being depressed so I don’t even have her by my side.

I know, I know. It's dumb. But she is beautiful, and I love the character she portrays. This show isn't even about love, or romance really. Just me seeing her, her showing love and compassion towards people makes me remember something.

I want to be with a woman that is loving, caring, driven, and, most importantly, honest. I want her to hold me, love me, and stay with me. I crave a woman's loving touch. I want to be seen, and loved.

He was the one who initiated a conversation which was a bit too comfortable and weird for a first interaction with someone even if it’s online, but we became friends. Overall, he was an alright friend- it was nice talking to him about certain topics because we were on similar wavelength. The problem is, he is a really negative person. 


I feel like there isn’t a conversation with him that he didn’t complain about how his life is shit and how he feels bad about himself. It’s at a point that my mood gets sour whenever talks about anything related to his usual negativity. I understand that he has depression and that he's really anxious, but sometimes his sentiments get to me. Somehow, I let myself be influenced by his extreme lack of work ethics in academics because I used to self-pity and procrastinate like him a lot in the past. I also feel a little resentment because he complains so much, yet he seems to be fine in handling his problems. He says that no one likes and cares about him in school yet he can even talk to them through voice calls and can even ask for help in assignments. He says he's performing poorly in school(late submissions, not helping his group), but he even became a leader once and in terms of GPA, it's above average. It's really tiring to listen, so my intrusive thoughts are like, maybe it would be better if I didn't become friends with him or reduce our relationship level to an acquaintance. But if I did that, I might trigger his anxieties even more and contribute to him killing himself. He's also the only one who I can call a friend in the class. What should I do?"

lonely,It isn’t it.,"It isn’t it. - I will preface that I understand this may not relate to unique circumstances. I would just like to share my story and I hope some of it will resonate. 

I was lonely. I woke up by myself, worked from home and went to bed by myself. I didn't catch up, I didn't see you at the party, I didn't make plans for the long weekend. I didn't wonder what I was getting for my birthday or wait in anticipation if that special person was going to text me back. I longed for a connection not for friendship, romance or sex but simply to share a close moment with another human. 

My loneliness was my identity. It only finished the moment my body finally fell asleep at 3am from the sheer exhaustion of it been the same day for the last 10 years in a row. My family didn't know because I was ashamed. I didn't let anyone feel sorry for me because I truly believed I wasn't worth feeling sorry for. 

I searched for affection other ways which presented as physical vices. I over ate, over drank and spent my days and nights lost in a screen to distract its slow creep that engulfed me whenever I sat with my own thoughts. 

I didn't know how to fix it and it was terrifying. 

But I can tell you I got out. No miracles, I just had to start taking action. 

I won't write war and peace on this post of the methods I took to escape myself but fundamentally it boils down to you. At the moment you are existing, instead start making yourself uncomfortable. Try, fail. Try, fail. Try, fail. 

Start small and start slow, It may mean signing up to friendly public soccer team or attending pottery or gym classes or putting some real time into creating an online dating profile. At the start it will feel awkward and you will actively convince yourself not to go again. You don’t have to try and make real connections initially but just keep showing up, become a familiar face. People will resonate with your reliability and persistence and you will get more and more comfortable in that environment. 

Find anything external in this world you can do to spend time with strangers consistently and you will be amazed who says hello. It needs to start with you."

lonely,"The only source of comfort for my loneliness: binge eating food, also makes me more likely to stay lonely.","The only source of comfort for my loneliness: binge eating food, also makes me more likely to stay lonely. - It is not really a conscious behaviour. I hate binging even while I am engaged in it, I do not even particularly like eating in general. Yet for some reason this activity pushes the right buttons in my brain and provides pathetic scraps of comfort for my loneliness, the only source there is. No hobbies, no passion, ambivalent about my job, unable to get a pet. I exercise multiple times a week but it provides only some grim satisfaction that fades within minutes. Books, films, games no longer do a thing. 

There is only binging and it is poisonous. It further deteriorates my self-esteem that is already record-low. It negates my motivation for change. It damages my body, and the only reason I am stocky, not fat, is strenuous exercise. Yet that is enough to feel even more alienated from the people I see on the street, to connect socially and be considered attractive.

It is a vicious circle and I am unable to break it."

I loved walking in parks when I was younger. I won't know what it is for a while because I need to see if PT will help it before a MRI. I'm so lonely do everything I can to cope with it. Being alone wears down on you. It figures I ruin the only thing that brings me any joy. Since I have no friends and never had a gf, I have to do everything myself. I can walk to place and not have to drive. It seems like everything is going out of it's way to make sure I'm miserable. Now I limp everywhere. I went on a coffee walk and the girl asked what was wrong. I said I didn't know but it's worrying me. Does everything seem to go out of it's way to mke sur you can't deal with your loneliness?"

I live with my parents and two of my brothers who are all also depressed. I feel so lonely, yet I always want to be alone. Social anxiety disorder is a bitch. Avoidant personality disorder is a bitch. I don't know how to connect with people. I'm boring and have no personality. I recently started therapy and its helped a bit. I've been trying to push myself to socialize by going to family events and talking to my cousins. But when they make a move to get to know each other better (ask for my number so we can hang out, etc) I get anxious. It's like I'm afraid of getting close to anyone. So I avoid it.

There was this one girl that I had liked for a while and homecoming was coming up,so I asked her to homecoming and she said yes. Everything was going smooth until the day after. She had some guy start texting me and telling him everything about me, and after all of that she said that she didn’t want to be in a relationship and that she liked me as a friend, but she never even acknowledges my existence anymore.

I'll still hold my love for you even if I had to let go. The memory keeps me sustained. Keeps me from forgetting the things I grew to know. Your memory is the life force that encourages me to go on. I hope that things are better in your life. I can't say the same for mine but I walked into my own trap. I thought I was protecting myself but I was ensnared instead of the pain. Instead of the hate. I may be incapable of opening up or being loved but the dreams that sprung to life when my head was resting in your universe will always live with me. The dreams and visions of the love I felt and believed I had will never pass away.

lonely,I wish I were normal,"I wish I were normal - Tonight I texted the guy I really like and told him I am losing interest. It’s the truth but not the truth. I fall for the idea of a person so quickly, all of the little things I like about them are so beautiful, the things I hate are no big deal… basically, they are perfect to me and getting to know them becomes this huge part of my life. 

I create this grand expectation that things will go as perfectly as I plan… and they don’t, they never do. I just am not normal, I day dream about being loved and being with that person.

 A change in the frequency of texts or them not talking to me for a whole day makes me question if they really like me. And when I start to question if they like me I start to pull away, I start to mirror how they’re acting so as to not overreact on the surface. But underneath it I’m losing my shit. Im miserable. Im desperate. Im lonely, so fucking lonely. 

And it happened again tonight, I told him im losing interest… losing interest in the circumstances in which I have to like him. I’ve talked to him for about 3 months, my deal is I want to meet him. But he’s busy, always working… it’s 2022, online dating is tricky bc you start talking to a person and it all feels so good, until you realize it’s not real until you actually meet. So I just wanna get it out of the way, so I can figure out if we’re as good a match as we think we are. Having to just rely on a text here and there isn’t cutting it for me. So, I’m losing interest in being texting buddies, not himself as a person. 


This rant is to say that one, I’m lonely. Two, I hate dating. And three, I hate how being lonely makes me jump the gun, not want to try at all, and how sometimes, the pain of being lonely is sometimes something I think I deserve.

Everything has become mechanical, bleak, and relationships, fickle. 

I feel just very meh about everything. What prompted this was a 4 year long fling ending in December and a 30th birthday. Also, my best friend of 23 years showed up to my dinner with no card or gift. Yes, I don’t like that I noticed it. 

I thought my gut instinct would have helped me make better decisions now. Like my love life for example, it’s been filled with emotional abuse and if I’m suppressing this correctly, sexual abuse of me. 

Overall, I know my limits more now, and it discourages me from everything."

lonely,Feeling depressed again because my friends don't talk to me the way they used to.,"Feeling depressed again because my friends don't talk to me the way they used to. - So most of my life I've been dealing with bad self steem and not feeling enough, but I was feeling so much better and now I'm starting to get worse because a group of my best friends from high school (I am now on my second year of uni) are treating me differently. 

On the last months I have noticed that I am always the one who starts the conversation and always answers when they send a message but they do it just sometimes with me. I am tired of feeling like the only one who is making an effort (It isn't actually because I love them and I love listening to their audios) but they just leave me on seen. I went out with them a month ago and I felt so happy to be with them like always but it changes when we talk on messages.

It feels so bad because I love them dearly and I don't think they do it with a bad intention, but I've been feeling so alone and depressed. I know they might be busy but honestly is so easy to send an sticker or something. I have been trying so bad to tell them things so they answer me and creating a conversation but they leave me on seen and answer like two days after or something like that, and with short messages, so I just stopped but it seems like they don't notice it.

I'm so embarrassed too because I feel like it shouldn't affect me this way, but I've been feeling so depressed lately and it just hurts me that this friendship, that many times has felt like a safe place for me, isn't anymore because I am going to be ignored. 

Anyway, I wanted to say this somewhere. I feel so alone   and although I am trying, I feel like I'm getting worse."

lonely,at this point i don't know why i don't have an alt account,"at this point i don't know why i don't have an alt account - just gonna rant because i feel like i need to. Probably a free flowing kind of a thing.

Work is hard. Life is tough. I get that. Sometimes it's just too hard to be mentally strong enough. What did I do today? I filled gas and bought some Monster Energy Drinks. Oh, and I slept. Besides work, there isn't much I do. I'm tired, I'm lazy, I'm unmotivated...whatever it is, it is here. 

I've had depression before. Shit, I have depression now. And I feel so lonely and disconnected from everyone and everything; being in a new place only exasperates that. It's like, at the least, before moving, I had other friends, kind of a checkpoint that slowly diluted away as I moved. I still have friends. To say I don't would be a lie.

But I feel so disconnected from them...

And now to up the ante, the side effects of my medication are really bad while they aren't helping me either. The proposed solution? Up the dose. Sounds utterly ridiculous to me, but what do I know? I'm no psychiatrist.

So disconnected

So lonely

And while this is mostly my fault, I feel like it also isn't. Social anxiety makes it hard for me to interact with groups of people and, by nature, it is hard and awkward to meet people 1 to 1.

I cannot believe how much the psychiatrist invalidated me. Just absolutely horrible. But, you know, I'm not going to tell him that to his (virtual) face. Hopefully my therapist will be better.

I wish I could say I was fine. I talked to someone at work who helped me feel a bit better. Then, you know, someone else tore me down. And that's besides the psychiatrist, anyways.

I just wanna feel loved. Connected. Accepted. Whatever the term is. Happy. I want to be happy. But I'm stuck. Trapped by myself. I don't know how to connect with people in real life. Not anymore. 

It feels like no one cares. And those that do have a very shitty way of supporting me. It's not their fault, so I don't necessarily blame them, but, it doesn't help me. In fact, it hurts me.

&gt;!I sometimes have the urge to self-harm. I don't know why. Maybe a distraction/escape from my thoughts? Maybe a combination of boredom and intense thoughts? I really don't know. All I know is my psychiatrist said ""I'm not worried about the cutting"" essentially because it is without the intent of killing myself. That doesn't make sense to me. Now, obviously, if it were with that intent, it would be worse, but isn't that very invalidating? or am I just crazy? !&lt;

I don't really know what else to say.

lonely,I got too attached to someone I never met,"I got too attached to someone I never met - I’ve been talking to this absolutely gorgeous and great girl on Reddit, she’s a few years older, lives a few hours away and is probably way out of my league, we’ve kinda became friends and flirted, sexted, back and forth and generally enjoyed talking to one another. She hasn’t texted me in like two days, it’s very possible she’s not ghosting, and if she is then she is, but what’s bothering me is that 1. I’m starting to have feelings for her; you can see why this a problem, we know what each other looks like but we’ve never spoken on the phone, met in person, etc. 2. If she only texts me if I text her does she even enjoy talking to me? Or does she just talk to me cause she’s bored or feels bad for me? Granted there could be a ton of reasons why she hasn’t texted me. 3. I have feelings for her, I obviously get attached too fast and too often, even though I have feelings for her doesn’t mean she likes me back. 4. I could easily text her to see how she is doing and start up conversation once again, but I’m afraid to, I’m afraid to get more attached, I’m afraid that things will never work out between us, so I don’t even see the point anymore. I kinda hope she reads this and I kinda hope she doesn’t. Idk what to do anymore I’m just so damn lonely, anyways there is my rant."
lonely,How do you stop the lonely?,"How do you stop the lonely? - Long story short; currently going through planning to get out of my abusive engagement. For too long I’ve taken some physical and plenty of verbal abuse. I just graduated top of my class and have passed my national licensing boards and have landed my dream job with great pay. Im supposed to be getting married in 3 months. Im (25f) at what is supposed to be the most exciting years of my life, but between planning to end my engagement and find a safe place to stay, and taking the abuse and having no positive human contact, I’m so lonely and miserable. All of the years of hard work and sacrifices for school and to get where I am today just isn’t feeling worth it, and I can’t even bring myself to enjoy it. I cried just the other night coming home from graduation by myself, and cried the whole way to and from the gym today because my heart just feels so empty but heavy."

I keep getting ignored, tossed in the garbage after a few days, or find nothing but catfish. I even opened myself up to Trans women, pretty or post op. Still, nothing. What's the point to this? I try and I try, but the void inside me remains. I have recently tatted feeling numb inside. My happy Ness has started to fade away slowely. My hobbies have stopped bringing me happieness. I feel nothing but sadness and pain inside me. But I know that no one is gonna read this. The people that do are gonna walk away  and forget that I was ever here. Honestly, I don't even know what I want or need. I don't want to die alone, but I honestly feel like I deserve it. I have been far from the absolute best person throughout my life, hell, looking back on everything I have been through feels like it was all just a long bad acid trip. I have been through the worst treatment from most of the schools I have been to, even went 2 years being ostrasized, and when I developed suicidal desires, the school counselor threatened to hospitalized me while my oldest brother went into extensive detail about psych wards. I was 11 at the time. Honestly, I still have those desires but I am too much of a coward to act on them. After that, I spent 3 years at a private school that neglected to notice that I have ADD and the psychiatrist went crazy with the pills. I was going through puberty, and adding 5 ifferent pills each with different doses throughout the year can make a person look almost insane. After that,I when 6 years with online school where I made 0 friends. Lockdown was just another Tuesday for me. But everyone else was have breakdowns left and right. Realizing that you had no friends and everyone who were friends with you did it out of convenience must have been tough. At least I was use to being alone and was prepped by summer breaks alone watching TV. I even figured out the schedules of the TV stations, not as random as you would like, especially with the episodes shown. But now, here I am, after having my first actual breakdown, trying to find the mystical ""the one"" that legends and TV shows talk about constantly."

lonely,Hello,"Hello - This is my first post on Reddit. Yesterday was my 19th birthday I got birthday wishes from my family. However everyone in my friend group forgot it was my birthday. When I texted them today (the day after my birthday) only 2 out of the 7 wish me a belated birthday. However when I looked at who read the message it showed all 7 of them read the text. Also when the 2 friend from my friend group wish me happy birthday it felt like they did not care. This also the second time they forgot my birthday. The second time this happen was my 16th birthday. I then told them the day after my birthday, and they were all shocked and surprised. I always make sure to wish them on their birthday. But in my friend group my birthday has been the only one to be forgotten by everyone in the group. However this year was different then the first time they forgot my birthday. I am still away at school when they are all done. Also this is the first time my best friend forgot it was my birthday which hurt the most. My best friend and I became friends when we were still crawling, we where born 21 days apart, and growing up we lived on the same street. We have never forgotten each other’s birthday. I also have not reminded her that it was my birthday. I am just very hurt and I feel very lonely. I feel dumb and upset at my self to be hurt by this. I don’t know what I should do or if I should tell them how I feel. Thank you for reading this it means a lot. (All of the people in this story know when my birthday is)"
lonely,It’s not right,"It’s not right - Everybody should be able to have ongoing friendships. Just cause they don’t doesn’t necessarily mean they just “need to work on themselves more”. It is what it is, but, how are you supposed to trust people in this world, honestly?

Law of attraction seems to not be applying to me no matter what I do, in terms of people. Anyone else feel this way?"
lonely,I can’t sleep at nights due to painful thoughts,"I can’t sleep at nights due to painful thoughts - I can’t sleep at nights, I cry during most of them from the pain of loneliness and being hopelessly tired of trying to invest any of my energy in people. They ALWAYS 1) leave; 2) become toxic, abusive, walk over my boundaries, use me for convenience, hurt me on purpose. There’s never been another scenario. I regularly get confirmation of this when I try to reach out to new people. I regularly feel burned out, confused and robbed of my emotional energy and good intentions.

I also have overwhelming negative thoughts of me being severely harmed in different ways (physically, emotionally). I know cognitively it’s unlikely to happen, but my mind keeps playing out these thoughts 24/7 unless I’m completely absorbed by something (rare). Even when I try to focus it’s very difficult with these unmanageable intrusive thoughts."

lonely,I turned twenty last month and I have never had a girlfriend,"I turned twenty last month and I have never had a girlfriend - I’m not as chronically lonely as some people on this subreddit. I live with my family, and I love them very much, and I have friends. My social life isn’t in complete shambles. The one thing, however, that I have never had is a girlfriend. 

In the past, I had crushes but they were always a bit older than me, way out of my league, or taken. I never felt the need back then to go for anyone, but now that i’m older looking back, I realize I made a mistake in at least not trying. Now i’m gonna be a junior in college and I don’t even know how to ask someone out. 

I think that it partially has to do with me being autistic, I wasn’t the best at socializing but at least I was kind. 

And here’s the ironic thing: basically everyone in my life believes that I can do it. My mom, my siblings, my friends, and even my coworkers, they always prop me up and say I’ll find someone great for me. I treasure that they have faith in me and I want to prove them right someday, but I just don’t see realistically how it could happen. My deepest fear is that I’ll end up devolving into an incel, and I think I already have some blackpill beliefs about myself. 

I know it’s not the end of the world, and I’m not gonna let it get me down forever, but it still kinda sucks though, you know?"

lonely,"All my friendships are superficial, because I am too scared to attach (venting)","All my friendships are superficial, because I am too scared to attach (venting) - Ok I'm scared this one's gonna be a little long. I just found this sub on accident and I don't know if my vent even fits it completely. I am surrounded by people, but I actively avoid them and it makes me lonely.

For context I am currently living in a student dorm that belongs to a different college than the one I attend, so there is no classmates around. It almost exclusively houses Erasmus students from that college. I moved here cause it is very close to my campus, it is nice and clean (for a student dorm) and has private bathrooms in each room. Oh, and it also is in a foreign country, having moved here I knew nobody in this whole country and I left all friends, family, everyone behind in my original country. Honestly I do not regret it and I do not miss them that much. I figured I had to take this step in my life before I grow too tired and unambitious. In my childhood I was a loner, always relying on one friend, but sometime in high school I really blossomed socially, grew some confidence, made a lot of friends, always hung out with someone and I liked it. I already started struggling with my mental health back then but at least I found peace and stability in my friend circles (as opposed to home, which was messed up back then).

Then I moved, ready to conquer this new land full of new people. And I really regressed socially. I met my (ex?) best friend and we clicked on the very first day despite that he's a guy and i'm a girl and he's also 5+ years older than me. So I kind of went back to having that one friend around which was nice, but I also felt **lonely** and kind of limited socially because of this. Meanwhile I met my dorm mates and the first semester and this whole vicious cycle of mine started. I was getting along with them just fine, in fact the very last weeks we started hanging out a lot and i grew attached and then, of course, they left. I felt shattered in pieces. I promised myself I am never ever going out with exchange students again, because they leave, I stay, like in a fucking prison where i'm doing life (i came up with this metaphor recently and now I can't stop thinking about it this way). I became secluded, believing it's for the greater good because, why grow attached to someone who's gonna forget you in a matter of months? In fact partly due to covid and partly because of my stupid delusion I withdrew from all these nascent friend circles I kinda was starting to mingle into... ended up abandoning my ""best friend"". ended up sitting in my room all day and not even studying, mostly just drinking and sleeping. The loneliness is killing me. So I allowed myself to make one more mistake. 

This is my 4th semester and it actually brought along some of the greatest people I met in here so far. I found it so hard to refrain from their company and eventually due to the self-imposed **loneliness** I started to party with them little by little. I saw them go all around Europe together. The first time asked me to come with them. Of course them being exchange students makes it easier to travel (that's what i've been telling myself), so I can't go with them right? well the next time they didn't even bother asking. And the whole semester I was just suffering so much and still am so torn between wanting to hang out with them and subconsciously doing my best not to hang out with them, all the while i was growing attached and damn i really love those people. such a petty problem, i know, i am pathetic. Now they're leaving in around 3 weeks and i can already feel it in my gut, this weird wrenching and nausea at the thought of being here without them around. I dont know what to think: should i have just gone #yolo and spend time with them? or perhaps I should limit the interactions EVEN FURTHER now? 

I thought I was developing a crush on one of them as well. i dont wanna delve into that shit too much but i struggle a lot in the ""dating department"" cause im drugged out of my mind on psychotropic medication which makes me somewhat.. asexual? i guess. so i decided to tell that person about it, as they're all leaving anyway... and it went pretty fine! but well i got overwhelmed and obviously just end up drinking myself to near unconsciousness and happen to stumble upon that person (and like 4 more of those friend-ish guys)  outside when going on a smoke and i spill my wine and make a fool out of myself. i end up cutting myself real bad and havent left my room since. i am so lonely. I AM SO LONELY......

ok so where is this post even going? i dont know i'll be surprised if anybody even sees it. so basically what i'm going for, apart from venting, is: should I continue secluding myself like that next year? should i make the best of the 3 weeks thats left even though right now? is it NORMAL for a college student to be such a fucking self-isolating loser? man it feels like im wasting the prime of my life

Basically TLDR; wasted opportunity to hang out with cool people even though i was lonely, cause i knew they were gonna leave anyway and i didnt want to miss them after. so i deliberately make myself even lonelier, barely leaving my room and cutting ties with other friends as a side effect. then in the middle of this mess i show up drunk and embarrass myself and now i feel like isolating myself even further, despite the sense that i should enjoy things while they last.

I am overthinking. this post perhaps doesnt even go in loneliness sub does it? i am just doing it to myself. and please dont correct my grammar i know its bad"
lonely,I'm in a constant fight against loneliness since the pandemic started.,"I'm in a constant fight against loneliness since the pandemic started. - I'm a teenager with asperger syndrome, which is an low-spectrum autism, which gives me the struggles of socializing with others.

I always I've been used to make friendships on the internet, because it's easier to find people like me. But in real life, those people are all scattered, and you're limited only to where you live. Maybe this is why I never had too much friends, or genuine friendships before. My life was, and still is, only about getting on my PC on the entire day and only getting out of home to get done my routine. No friends to even hang out. My life is so boring...

Before the pandemic started for me in March 2020, I had a small social life on school, with my 2 best friends, and some people I used to know. I don't even remember how I met them. I used to feel at home at that school, And I was used to the place I lived before. Everything seemed to be perfect, I was happy and I didn't knew it was the last days. Just before the pandemic started on my country, I had one of the best birthday parties of my life. All of my friends came to the party, we had fun. But, weeks after that, the hell started. I could never leave my home, I was starting to develop a constant feeling of loneliness and lack of companionship. Even though I had my parents and family, they're not the same as having friends. And to things get worse, due to hormones, I also started to develop an strong desire to have a girlfriend. Hugging, kissing, loving and laying with a girl. But I knew this was impossible due to the current situation I was in. And as time passed, I started to become more and more paranoid about socialization in general. I started to create a lot of theories on my head, on what I should do and etc. I started to become desperate, and the desire of a girlfriend getting more and more stronger. And I was not the only one. One of my best friends also started to suffer the same.

On the next year, in 2021, in the beginning, in school, I started to become hypnotized by a blonde, blue-eyed girl on my class. I started to try hard to become at least her friend, but I failed. She gave more attention to her friends than to me, and when I discovered she already had a boyfriend, I just gave up talking to her and I started crying. This, is when I learnt the lesson to never hypnotize yourself because of appearence. And thinking about it, a relationship with her wouldn't go right, because we're very different.

And to get even worse, **my dad died from COVID-19 on February 2021.** And then, I had to switch school **after** **11 years** studying on the same school, and switching residence **after 7 years** living on the same place. My life started to turn upside down since then. I had to move to my grandma's house, and I didn't like living in there. I had to be on a bedroom where there's barely any sunlight, there's no windows, it was very hot and moldy. And I was, as always, on my computer every day, for the entire day. And after some months, we eventually moved to another condominium, and I'm still living there as the time I write this. In between this time, peridiocally I had some visits to the psychologists, I talked everything about what I was feeling, and also was feeling very paranoid about socialization. I never understand how a simple conversation happens, how friendships are stabilished, and how do you like someone, I just can't. I can't like anyone, and I haven't even the courage to even try, because I knew nobody would give a shit about me. I'm just an generic person who doesn't looks like to have anything special whatsoever, compared to these other groups on the school that already has friendships stabilished, with no sign of accepting new people.

And when I switched school, I gave it some time to analyze the ambience, the school and the people on it, **and I didn't like it.** I really tried hard to socialize with someone on this school, but I couldn't get ANY genuine relationship/friendship. I also tried in other places like on my church and english courses, but no luck. Everyone just seems to be so closed, not giving any chance to me. And I also feel I'm too different from other people, maybe I just can't fit with any person.

But recently, a miracle appeared: For the first time after 2 years, I finally got a genuine friendship! It all started like this: My mom wanted to bring me to her friend's house, she said that there was an girl that has the same age as me, but I was already with the expectation that it will be only another average generic teenager girl. But when I met her, oh my god. I got a fluid and nice conversation with her. She knows very well how to chat, and also has very similar interests and humor! I returned home shocked and surprised, but very happy! I also kind of met her friends, they also look nice.

And for the future: Now, I have the conclusion that I only can get a genuine friendship with people that are similar to me, or has interests and personality that pleases me. I know, the correct would be to be able of socializing with any person, but sadly that's not how my mind seems to be working. I would say that I don't know 100% about myself and what my mind really wants. It's a confusion... And I'm planning to move to the same school as her, with the hope that I can find more nice people on there.

In conclusion: This is a very long battle I'm currently facing. Since all of this started, I kind of lost my perception of time. I can't even believe that 2017 was 5 years ago... I feel like I wasted some time of my teenage years, but whatever. I would say that this entire story is like a ""clock bomb"" that was planted since my childhood and it only exploded now, and I'm suffering the consequences. This story is all about trial and error, and especially, never giving up. I would say that things are finally getting better for me after so long, but the battle hasn't finished yet! And in this battle, loneliness will **never** win. Either the battle will extend, or I will win. That's the spirit!

I really hope my story can serve as a inspirational story or something like that. And I also hope that everyone who's suffering of loneliness on this sub, finds a way of having a relationship with a nice person."

Me and my gf cool but sometimes I feel like it can get pretty toxic sometimes for a example if I wanted to go out by myself or do activities without her it feels like it's the end of the world for her. Im the youngest out of 4 siblings and we all have big age gaps like 7+ years. I always had alone time for myself growing up especially when my older siblings started moving out early one by one until it was just me in the house. Saying that I always find peace in going out by myself at times. She's also the youngest of 4; 2 of her sisters stay at the house and the third one stays 7 minutes from her and they all have a good relationship far as talking to each other and going out to eat, shop etc. She doesn't get me when I want to be by myself for a day or two cause she's constantly around people and she's so used to being around me. Sometimes I feel like it's draining cause we link up with each other EVERY SINGLE DAY/WEEK. I barley link up with my friends as much, and she doesn't hate them but she doesn't like to be around them. I'm not saying her company is not pleasing but she can be annoying sometimes. it's like I'm stacking annoying shit on my head all day and I just need sometime by myself so I can cool off, vibe with myself and come up with some introspective Thoughts when I'm alone. The times I did go alone somewhere she would ask me ""why you didn't go with me?""(and she'll follow it up with""you hate me cause you want to do stuff without me"") or it can be ""who did you go with?""(thinking I went with an other girl, cause I went without her) this shit can be annoying sometimes cause I've been loyal this whole time...I admit I fucked up in the past cause I was flirting with females in the beginning stages of our relationship and I wasn't taking it seriously as I should've and I seen how that bad that affected her so I stopped, but now I'm taking it seriously and I haven't flirted with anyone ever since and I'm getting tried of hearing shit like that. Don't get me wrong she's down to earth and I can see she really loves me but she just needs to find ways to deal with her insecurities and separation anxiety and stop pushing it on me. Am I the asshole? What should I do and how should I go about it? Pls help"
lonely,"I have “friends”,but I still feel lonely","I have “friends”,but I still feel lonely - I’ve felt lonely for my whole life. For two and a half school years straight I didn’t really have anyone I considered a friend. Recently this has changed and now I am in a friend group or two but I feel left out. 

I thought one of the girls who sat with me at lunch was my friend but then I realized they ignored me every time they were talking with our group. I know this is going to sound selfish but I’m going to be honest since nobody here knows who I am anyway. The worst part is they are good friends with my “closest” friend. 

They talk to each other so much and seem to have way better conversations. In my opinion it’s inconsiderate to blatantly show your favoritism for one of your friends in front of your other ones. This is how I’ve felt with acquaintances I’ve had in the past too. I sense an almost spiritual love they have with others that I’m not getting between me and them. I’ve never been able to connect with someone like that. It doesn’t help that I’m possibly neurodivergent and will probably not be able to connect with most people that way(or maybe my idea of true friendship is wrong),feeling more alone. 

Part of me is afraid that it’s my appearance because none of my friends are friends with people that have dark skin aside from maybe me. I don’t want to be that type of person but I constantly wish I was just born with lighter skin because the lighter skinned people are the only popular ones."
lonely,"Good night, friends","Good night, friends - As it says, good night. I know that night really sucks for lonely folks as the inner demons kept at bay during a work or school day come out in force. I know how overwhelming that can be. I would like to throw out here that you are not completely alone. No, we cant be there in person to just hold you and make everything okay. What many people here can and will do is provide an ear to listen and a voice to connect with.

 I know that none of us have issues sleeping. /s
If the night gets tough and those inner demons are kicking your ass, please reach out. 

I have said and truly mean that my DMs are always open. Sure, it may take a little bit sometimes, but I *will* get the message and reach back. Nobody should have to face this alone. I hope that each and every one of you has a night that is better than you expected and sleep that lets you wake ready for the next fight."

Whilst I’m happy with the opportunities I have access to, I’m lonely it hurts. Losing my motivation, I’m comfort eating and some days sleeping too much some days 2 hours a night. I’m losing confidence…thoughts of self harming myself have crossed my mind recently.
At my old job (small company) I was alone but never felt lonely.
I joined this big new company at an awkward time (midway through a standard 3 year service contract for college graduates) so everyone i work with already was friends with each other. People are friendly but keep themselves to themselves.

All of a sudden out of the blue, one of them started texting me less and less after I followed them to the same college. Out of nowhere they decided to move to the city, and completely reinvent themselves. They changed the way they looked, they changed their career and college major, and they completely ghosted me. 

So I messaged one of them on their Facebook, and asked them what they have been up to... and surprise but not surprise they blocked me. 

I've had women and men do this to me in my life. People you would think are the nicest and kindest people you can trust, who end up completely dropping you and pretending you never existed, even during a family member's death. I'm not sure how people can psychologically do that.

Who's life has begun to take a whirl.
Living with family that doesnt really understand
What living with borderlinepersonalitydisorder is like first hand..

Crippling anxiety, makes it difficult to show my face
Socially awkward, I isolate, feel like a disgrace
Wanting opportunity to go somewhere new
Start over away from those who already knew
Me as a girl who's aspiration is long gone
Wondering where my life went so wrong?

Dbt every other week and I wonder why
My thought patterns still aren't normal why would they lie

I thought I was fine but continually I'm learning
My family doesnt love me unless I'm earning
A paycheck to contribute but with my condition
It's difficult to find an employer that'll listen
When my unstable patterns start to show
It's a medical condition yet they tell me to go

No job, no money, no friends, no one but me
I'm a girl just trying to get by you see

If you can help, there are things I need
Basic nessecities,  nothing for greed

Gas to get to therapy, food to eat
Simple toiletries even seem like a treat 

Paypal,cash app, venmo, bambu 
Literally anything you can do
Would help and mean so much me
Just a girl with a borderline personality

Thank you

By the time passed my feeling towards her became a strong love but i didn't have the courage to say anything she was the only thing that i could think about in a day but i noticed that she's slowly changing
She actually turned into an another person. She wasn't sweet anymore and also didn't even massage me back whenever i texted her. One day i massaged her and asked how was she doing and she replied she doesn't want to talk to me anymore and don't want me to text her again or see me. I asked for the reason of it and she said there's no any special reason and she just don't like me and that's all even though we were great friends and were pretty close
It was such a sad time for me and i just started to hate myself. After two month i massaged her to know if her feelings about me has changed and she said yes so we became friends again but only through telegram because she still didn't want to see me again
And now that happend again and this time i guess there is no return because i also did a shitty thing that i don't even want to talk about it
Maybe i should've told her that i love her on those days

lonely,How to be less lonely.,"How to be less lonely. - First of all i want to say there's no real guide to this.   
Everyone is different &amp; therefore have different circumstances.  


But a lot of people seem to think they are lonely and think that they're down and therefore their life isn't worth it at all. I'm simply a conveyer &amp; i'm here to give you some advice that works/helped for me. To feel less lonely &amp; no it's not going to work for everyone or in 123 just like that, you're going to feel like this for a while still. But here's the deal if you want to stop feeling miserable atleast try it out for yourself. Don't just sit there and don't try it. You have nothing to lose right? Try it out! :)   


So for me personally, I feel alone whenever i have no one to talk to, i fixed this by ""gaming"" but whenever i don't game i have that same loneliness again. I think a lot of you feel the same. It's actually funny &amp; there's a very simple solution to this. No i won't ask you to stop gaming because that doesn't work. It didn't work for me either. Instead i ask you to only game for a few hours so if you game all day like i did. Just game for half a day and cut it down whenever you feel like it. \~set a timer.  


The reason why gaming for me personally have such an influence in feeling lonely in real life is because of dopamine. The feeling of happiness.  Whenever i game, i talk with other people and engage myself within the same context getting that next level or trophy. This makes real life conversations awkward most of the time anyway &amp; the only way to fight loneliness is to game.   


It's an addiction, just like there are people with an alcohol addiction or cocaine addiction. They're after the same kind of drug. There's dopamine in alcohol and there's dopamine in cocaine.   


There's also dopamine in music for example or if you watch/do activity on ph..  


To me personally i had too much dopamine so i had to cut down on my dopamine levels. Simply by cutting the amount of time that i game / look on my phone for social media.   


But to you it might be different like you can also have too little dopamine &amp; that will create problems such as;   


* You lack motivation, “the drive.”
* You're tired.
* You can't concentrate.
* You're moody or anxious.
* You don't feel pleasure from previously enjoyable experiences.
* You're depressed; you feel hopeless.  


The problem in a depression is:  

* Low mood/low interest in activities enjoyed previously: ...
* Trouble concentrating: ...
* Changes in appetite or sleep: ...
* Feeling hopeless/worthless: ...
* Thoughts of suicide.   


Having too much of Dopamine like me results in;  
 

* Anxiety.
* Excess energy or mania.
* Increased feelings of stress.
* Insomnia.
* Aggression.
* Hallucinations.

So either way, i'm not asking you to become a drug user or any of that kind but by either raising your dopamine levels or lowering your dopamine levels will help a ton to your motivation and or well being.   


Detoxing dopamine is however extremely hard, so when you're detoxing be sure to take your time with it. As for making up dopamine more, be sure to not get addicted to the dopamine that you're following.   


Basically i'm asking you to balance your life. Don't go and binge watch all the series or episodes that came out of 1 season instead, just watch an episode a week. or an episode a day &amp; do something else.  


I hope this helps for some of you people, it helped for me personally. If you have any questions please let me know. I tried to leave out most nsfw stuff related info of dopamine but if you're interested in that please google it! I can't say anything about that here though. But yeah, it does also something regarding your well being ;)"

Like big time. Because sex and stuff was always off limits and I was punished for being horny or curious I became a sex fiend and horny freak. I have a lot of kinks. Anyway. Purity culture still really affects me because I'm literally scared of sex. Like I love to sext and masturbate but I'm afraid that if I actually have sex it will cause me to be punished and ruined. The few times I've come close to it, something has gone horribly wrong. It's very frustrating. 

I feel isolated and alone and just hopeless and like nobody really cares or understands. I even made a place for people like me. r/hornychurchpeople but it has t taken off nobody has really reached out or played. It's very discouraging. I feel trapped in religion and unable to escape.

To delude myself into believing there's more. That I can be more but it's all a lie. The emptiness never leaves me and all I'm capable of is distracting myself...I'll always be detached from life. Playing pretend to escape when there's nothing here and there never was..I just can't kill myself so I'll continue to fall apart until there's no room for hope.

It's been a little over a year I've been stuck because I had to sign a year's lease for somewhere else to live. Haven't been in a good enough frame of mind for a long time to organize getting out of here, but I have plans for the future, to move on and find another job, somewhere to live.

I’ll go ahead and introduce myself: the name is M (I’ll give full name in DM’s) I’m 20 (Transmasc/non-binary Pan Quoisexual?) I like anime, manga, video games(Xbox one/pc), writing, poetry, comics, craft making, watching tv, listening to music, cosplaying, gardening, cooking, photography and witchcraft.

i've always wanted someone that thought i was important, special, someone that took the time to know me and we'd grow together as people, we'd have beautiful moments and we'd just, be happy together

why couldnt anyone love me? what am i doing wrong? what do i have to do? do i have to meet someone specifically? do i have to do something specific?? what is it??? How can literally everybody i know just up and find someone but i cant? 

i hate everything, i hate feeling like this and not being able to fix it, just trying and trying and nothing works, at this point i just hate waking up knowing nothing is going to happen, and i hate everyone saying i should love myself and to just ""stop trying and wait"", fuck off, there is not a single person who doesnt hate themselves even by just a little bit in this world and they all still manage to find love and be happy, and just wait? come on, if im trying my best and nothing happens do you think something will if i just ""wait""? i'll just feel shittier for being alone and also feel shitty about not trying to fix that. 

i just want it to stop and be happy already"

lonely,Didn't think I'd be in this situation,"Didn't think I'd be in this situation - So I've never really had that many problems with loneliness, maybe when I was a teen but I made a friend group fairly quickly. I grew up on an island and like most of my friends I left the island to study abroad. I made new friends in Brighton, UK and had a pretty good time for a while. 
Unfortunately my father passed away unexpectedly and COVID made us transition to online learning, which I really struggled with, so I went back home and changed careers to something I enjoyed more.

The trouble is, all of my friends are still abroad, both the new friends I made and the old ones who are still studying or now working away. I still see them on holidays when they come back but now I find myself having to rebuild my friend group from scratch.

This would maybe be fine if I had ways of making new friends but I no longer share a flat (I stay at home with my mum) and by the nature of my new course, all of the people there are super nerds who never want to hang out (or maybe they just don't want to hang out with me :(    ). And unlike the English uni I went to, there are no clubs, societies, activities etc. Ive never felt lonelier in my life and it really feels bad not seeing anyone on weekends, and now summer is coming and my friends won't be here till July. Worse still my mum leaves on holiday for most of June and I'm just dreading spending an entire month almost by myself. Guess I just wanted to vent but any thoughts are appreciated I guess"

lonely,The Emptiness,"The Emptiness - Hello,



I hope that you are well. I've been struggling recently. My spouse and I have separated. We're being amicable about it, which is great, but now the loneliness is front and center. I felt so alone in that relationship. She seemed to want a roommate more than a partner. So now I'm living at my parents' house. I'm glad to have a place but it's so quiet here. Everyone else lives far away so it's just me and the dogs in this big empty place. I have some very good friends but they're all so busy. So I spend most days just beating myself up or staring at walls.



It'd be great to have some people to chat with. We can talk about our problems or just random stuff. I love strange facts, comic book/fantasy stuff, history, science, philosophy...but I'm open to whatever. I would just love to not feel so alone every minute of the day.



Hope to hear from you!"

I always wish my friends on their birthdays but I remember my own birthday which I spent sitting in my room with literally nobody who cared whatsoever. Why am I the one stuck with having to care? Is it selfish of me to ask that my friends at least check up on me or ask how I’m doing? I remember one of my friends venting to me for hours on end and I put up with it because it’s a friend but when I try to open up with my issues they’re suddenly busy.

Im tired of this. I wish I could be happy without needing validation from friends.

lonely,A song about loneliness(Pls remove this post if it violates the rules),"A song about loneliness(Pls remove this post if it violates the rules) - Hi! A few years ago, I wrote a song about being lonely, and it is on Spotify if anyone is interested. 

2019, I came to a new class in high school. In fact, I am always anxious to meet new people, yet I still told myself “it will be just fine”. 

But, it was not fine, not fine at all. Everyone already had their own friends, own circles, so the classmates barely talked to me at all. 

At first, I thought it surely takes some time for me to find my “friends”, but it did not work out.

I went to the principle and asked for help(changing to another class), but he said no, he said it requires a lot of time to change a student to another class, also, be said I was there to learn, not to make friends...😅

During that period, I was afraid, anxious and depressed, besides, I was afraid to eat lunch alone.

One day, I had a panic attack, after school, I went home and wrote this song - A Corner.

Since I was always sitting far back alone during every lesson, next to the door, and beside the corner.

Luckily, I went to the curator after a panic attack, she saw how depressed am heartbroken I was, so she convinced the principle to change class for me, everything went better since then.

Here comes the song, hopefully the lyrics tells what your inner voice(your heart/mind) really wants to say. 

Take care and stay strong!!!

What should i do? -  So, This all started a year ago when I found a gorgeous girl on Facebook as the mutual one with my friend. I saw her on People you may know section multiple times more than 20 and finally, I added her. She didn't accept me back for a while because of my creepy fake-looked profile picture. After uploading my selfie one as a profile pic, she accepted me back. But I didn't start any conversation yet. I checked a little bit about her personal information and found that she's 1996 born and I'm 2004 born. So, the age gap between us is 8 years. She's so pretty with beautiful lips shape and cheek that made me fall in love with her. She hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Chulalongkorn University and I'm nothing compared to her. Just a 18 years old impatience, stubborn nerd passionate in Maths and Physics without having any Degree. That's what makes me rejected myself from her. I claim myself as the one who doesn't deserve any of her feeling because of those differences mentioned above. That's why I didn't start to text a message to her. I know that I can't be with her in real life. So, I created the exact same person of similar appearances and personalities in my own imagination. Now, I'm able to have the sight of her beautiful look in my occipital lobe every single second. Even if i don't deserve her love in reality, I should be able to get one in my imagination. I talk to her. I seek advice from her. I argue with her and I love her so much. I know this would be seem as a bit strange and mental instability, but I don't wish her to disappear from my imagination. This is getting worse and worse. What should i do? Take an appointment with Psychiatrist? No, thanks, I enjoy it. I'm asking any tips for progress with this situation"

Yet time and time again turn your deepest darkest vulnerabilities against you. Shoving it in your god damn face like you deserved to be treated this way. And then apologies, and the next time it gets even worse. You were open in the beginning. They knew about the abusive narc ex you had. Yet they will do the same thing or even worse and apologise to you expecting you to forgive them. 

They can say they are aware that they are emotionally abusive towards you, yet when it happens they say they ""don't know"", see red, uncontrollable anger when you try to discuss anything related to their actions. 

They can choose to ignore your texts, selectively replying, getting you to re explain and explain and explain, consistently telling you they don't understand don't understand don't understand. 

They can justify all the actions with love. Tell you the sweetest things you want to hear. Tell you that you're their world. Yet when their ""angry"" when you point out how you feel cause of their actions, you're met with unjustified insults and humiliation. 

How can they apologise and apologise, but still do the same shit to hurt you over and over and over again?

How can they refuse to communicate with you despite you asking them over a million times what have you done. But the moment you're not together the quarrel starts over texts. And each quarrel brings up different matter not pertaining to the current one.

Even when you're on the brink of losing your mind and life, they still do the unthinkable and throw your trauma right at you and immediately apologising afterwards thinking this is fine. And 3 hours later sign in into your email without consent, going through individual bank mails and statements. And then wait 2 days to start a fight with you.

They can blame you for all the reactions you have for their fucking actions. But never once look at how their actions staryed all of this. And yet you're expected to let go of this reaction you have and show them love."

I was going to check my dating ap but instead I painted a picture of a sunflower. I guess that’s a bonus to dating me, I’m honestly too over it to cheat.

lonely,Why does my (14F) brain do this to me?,"Why does my (14F) brain do this to me? - So I’m a very lonely person. I have no friends like at all. I’ve learned to come to terms with it. For about three or so years I haven’t had any friends and just some family members. The thing that bothers me is that when I just meet someone I can’t stop thinking about them.

It always happens to me. I mostly don’t meet people in real life, I’m just too shy. Over the internet AKA video games I’m myself. I still manage to stay alone even through video games but that’s not even the point. The point is that every time I play one match with someone or have a friend request I go to sleep thinking about them nonstop like I’m obsessed.

Today I was playing ranked arenas in Apex Legends. I met this group of two guys. One of them was a real jerk but he stood out. He was sexist, rude, probably racist too. He was good at the game though. He kept making snarky comments at me and flirting as well (as literally every guy does). We won the game, they were pretty good. So I partied up with them. The whole time he kept referring to me as “bitch”. I’ve been struggling from the lack of teammates recently so I stayed and dealt with it so I could rank up (which I did). 

After our 2nd match his friend wanted to play so I just left the party. I received a friend request from him and accepted it. Played a couple more hours and went to bed.

Trying to sleep I keep thinking about this dick. Thinking about what I could’ve said or why I did something. Reliving our conversations. Why? Why do I do this? This guy was a total jerk and I don’t know why I can’t stop thinking about him. 

This has happened to me before. There’s nothing special about this guy. This ALWAYS happens to me. I meet someone over the game and then stay up half the night thinking about them.  Does anybody know why this happens to me?  Is it because I have no friends? Am I that desperate?? Why do I do this?

Also if by any chance this gets a lot of views, if you’re (the guy on apex) 
reading this, I used you as a example to give more detail, nothing special."

It feels like they're all speaking another language that I can't seem to comprehend... I can't behave like them or act like them I feel so... Different. I'm autistic so that probably contributes a little, but I just feel so lonely when I'm with my ""friends"". 

My fear is that everywhere I go I'll stick out like an odd thumb and never fit in. I used to romanticise my loneliness at home, pretending various scenarios, that I was a Victorian librarian shelving books in the rain, or that I'm studying astrophage in space. All that is so fun, until I go out in public. Then the whole world I made for myself melts away and the only thing that matters is that I'm not somebody for anybody. 

TL;DR: People are friendly but nobody's my friend. I fear that I'll always be an underrated crow."
lonely,When youre really lonely...,"When youre really lonely... - When youre really lonely, you just feel sad, useless and isolated. It feels like life is just a big rejection. When you wrap your arms around your pillow at night because you have no one and you really want a hug. You just hug it. But when you hug the pillow it feels like nothing, sure you're probably feling comfortable and letting your emotions out. But youre not being hugged back. Youre letting it all out on nothing. Then it just hurts you more that... you really are lonely. It feels so... empty."
lonely,I just randomly talk to myself throughout the day like I have friends constantly sitting around me.,"I just randomly talk to myself throughout the day like I have friends constantly sitting around me. - I crack jokes, I laugh alone, I cry alone. I ask questions then I answer my own questions. I imagine how my “friends” around me would respond to what I say then I respond to that. I imagine them making fun of me and me making fun of them. I imagine them comforting me then me comforting them. We complain, we bicker, we bond. “We” being me and the people in my head.

 
Gosh I’m turning mental."

Im way more comfortable if I'm just alone by myself but if others are around it really triggers my sadness and not being connected to anyone.

lonely,I’m tired of hearing someone is out there for you.,"I’m tired of hearing someone is out there for you. - One of those nights where I’m up late with thoughts and figured I could just let off a little stress.  Outside of my 3 family members I don’t have really anybody.  No friends, no girlfriend and it’s rather isolating sometimes.  It’s even more of a kick to the gut when you try to put yourself out there, out of your comfort zone to hope to meet people you can fit in with or find someone to share all the love you know you have to give.  

I’d love to have someone to share experiences with, to laugh with, to love, and to just experience what a true trusting relationship is.  I’d love to have friends that hit me up wanting to hang out or are genuinely happy to spend time with me.  I’m only 20 years old and I know to some that means I have all the time in the world and I shouldn’t fret.  I had no relationships in school, no friends in school that actually amounted to anything.  And I thought for sure things would change upon work or school.  I’ve been in the work force for over a year with absolutely zero change.  I start school this fall and I have a feeling it’s going to be the same show but in a different place.  

I love myself, I do.  I workout and thoroughly enjoy bettering myself.  I love playing video games, reading and writing novels, watching shows, movies, anime.  I love hiking, painting and so many more things that I would love to just share with a gf or friends.  People always say just be patient, there’s friends and girls out there for you.  I waited 16 years and in the last 4 decided to pursue them instead which has left me in the same boat.  I’m not sure why it’s difficult to create relationships when other people make it seem so effortless and easy.  

Thank you to whoever read this.  I’m not asking for sympathy or anything.  Just releasing some late night thoughts."

lonely,Feeling Alone most of the time. 15(M),"Feeling Alone most of the time. 15(M) - Hi everyone. This is my first ever post on Reddit from my alt since I don't want to share my actual identity. So, consider this as an anonymous vent. I was not meant to post this vent but I'm dealing with some stuff in real life which made me post this. So, here you go. 

&amp;#x200B;

I pretty much feel lonely most of the time. Toxic friends who will lead me to bad things. Got Nobody to share your feelings or things with in your everyday life. I even have summer vacations starting in 3 days. And I'm pretty scared of it, like what will happen to me in those holidays. I also have social anxiety, I don't like going out most of the time since I think what will others think of me, what are they talking about me in the back (even if nobody does)... Whenever I go to my ""toxic friends"" for chatting, they pretty much straightforward become mean or rude at me. Even 100% of my classmates message me because they have some query to ask or they're just sending a few unfunny memes. There was this girl Whom I used to hangout with irl (not anymore) and others started teasing me and started saying bad things of her in the back. I totally didn't like it. I have online school (had offline school like some weeks ago) these days which is totally bullshit and is stopping me from gaining my confidence again (as I used to have before lockdown). I can't wait for having offline school again. I barely have any hobbies, I code most of the time but also I rage quit it because I cannot deal with those errors. After offline school hours, I see everybody hanging out with there friends or there partners(gf/bf). And here I am, travelling alone from school to home. I feel very jealous of them. I also wish that I had someone like that irl, who will always be there for me, who can feel How I am feeling right now and console me. Not being desperate here or some but yeah. There are toxic people in most of my surroundings so it's quite hard to find the right one.

The dead pixel in my heart has grown into an empty space, slowly rotting away whatever is in its way.

It used to be a bliss, it used to be a relief.
I never knew how suffocating it is, let alone since when it became a grief.

For whatever it's worth I bear the weight of this emptiness.

I wish I was but I'm just probably meant to be by myself. I can't even have sex with a guy and feel good about it because it's not fulfilling and it has in the past left me always feeling drained.

What is more interesting It's just that sometimes I think it's the best. I have a lot of anxiety and insecurity, which makes me very paranoid and constantly afraid of everything.

I feel like making friends at my age (22F) is sort of a joke at this point, i broke up with my boyfriend because it wasnt healthy for me and we wanted different things in life (codependency etc.) unfortunately I have zero friends and Im almost graduated. I want so bad to make friends but feel like everyone has some old reason to dislike me, or finds me too pushy or overwhelming. I struggle with anxiety and adhd and so the combination of that coupled with a terrible highschool social life and terrible parents ive since had to go no contact with, has made the switch to outgoingness and trying to meet my social needs has been hard. Everyone appears established into friendships, and im at a loss of where to start or how to make friends, I feel like im being too needy if I try to reach out to different people. The reason im scared to reach out to people is because of gossip and there was a time when people at my current school disliked me, and they are since relatively highly esteemed by our peers, which is hard hard and confusing because i doubt they mention me but at the same time i feel forced to hide myself to avoid conflict.

My question is how do I ask people to hangout with me? Im fairly introverted but can be extroverted when needed, its just hard to think up questions that are genuine and show I care, because sometimes with adhd i overshare to relate and some people dont like that. I need to find other ways of relating to people, my backround of social problems has not been helpful to feeling free. My personal hobbies are introverted, but im willing to join outgoing clubs, but i just dont know what to say without overwhelming someone.

Theres so much I want to do but was held back in my relationship as my boyfriend struggled with depression and i felt i had to support him but didnt set the proper boundaries. Now Im trying to start anew with all these failed friendships. Ive tried determining what went wrong and Im bad at putting myself out there i guess, and i get sensistive easily, im forgetful of responding to people in text, but i apologize and try to remain inquisitive but they seem to be upset about that. 

Right now im feeling lonely and its just sad when i started putting myself out there but everyones busy doing their own thing. 

I am trying new hobbies but everything i do feels difficult as i feel far behind in a sense. I dont have a familial support to tell me itll be fine and i just wished there was someone i could talk too, not to talk about sad things but just be happy with and who would take my hand and show me people. I missed out on partying and theres so much i want to do but basically everything id like to do requires access to a car or a friend to be safe when drinking, etc. 

Im sorry this post is so long just at a loss.

Tldr: how do you get invited to stuff, how to invite strangers out together and try to do a group event, how to not be overwhelming to people but still letting them know youd like a friend? How to make longterm friends and people you can vibe with?"

Because i know they just love interacting with ‘me’ so much because im just mirroring them. 

I feel like my entire life no one truly has taken the time to know me or given effort to understand me.

Most days are in pain, but I still keep all the pain to myself. I don't want others to see my pain. Living alone with so much pain is difficult, like I'm left on my own to solve life. I can't even express how hurt I feel. Sometimes I want to cry, but I can't because when I was a young boy and cried I was told that men don't cry and I will be punished if I kept crying. That's a wound on two different levels. So this is how I live, whenever I go I carry a chest with all the traumas and suffering inside it. I really wish to get rid all of that, but I can't.

I’m a 26yo male.
I’m married (4 1/2yrs).
I’m Christian (23yrs).
Best friend… moved on.
There’s more to me of course, but probably the most helpful…

Why do I feel so neglected? 

My wife is a very busy extrovert. I’m a somewhat depressed introvert. She’s not home a lot. We both serve a lot in the local church never mind the 3 jobs she works and the 60hrs (including commute) a week that I work at my job. So we’re both busy. I think another big problem of mine is that I lead two small groups. One at church and one at my job (additional to what I’m actually paid to do). My small group at church has all but dissolved that I’ve been teaching and leading for 5 years now and nobody reaches out to me. They have either left and not said anything or just became so distant. Just came off the heels of teaching about vulnerability and transparency and nobody wants to get close i guess. The small group at work is higher stakes and I’ve only been doing it for 5 months in contrast. Unfortunately I inherited the group that already had attendance problems. So, all of the quality of life improvements my group is supposed to make to our work community is all falling on me. I’ve felt burned out and fighting it for 2-3 years now, but man I’m breaking.

I could go on, but this is long already. I don’t have anyone to bear my burdens with (perceivably). I suppose I should add that my wife and I fight a lot. She has childhood trauma and doesn’t communicate emotions well. I’m an emotional person and my emotions frustrate her because she has so much trouble processing her own as it is. So I’m usually helping her and taking “body shots” in the process. 

I’m a helper and I need help."
lonely,I love quality time,"I love quality time - I love quality time and sometimes that’s just laying beside you as you game, maybe make you sit on my fit coz they’re always cold. Watching you get excited about winning, listening as you explain the theme and characters, smiling at the conversations with your friends that you don’t mind me joining in with here and there and hearing you talk about me with them which makes me feel so important and treasured. I love that I don’t have to say much and I can just lay there, listen, watch and feel you’re presence physically and emotionally. Just enjoying the quality time, no expectations just us being us. 

I don’t know you yet but my lonely life keeps me dreaming of this."
lonely,I mentally pressed pause and saw what was happening around me,"I mentally pressed pause and saw what was happening around me - I'm 25, my girlfriend of over 2 years broke up with me after I rose an issue, assured by a previous promise by her that we would talk everything through and endlessly telling me of marriage, house and kids. This is my third long relationship and I feel like the years I have been in them have been such a waste. 

I'm one of those background friends in my friendgroup, one who gets along well with a lot of people at once rather than one at a time. I don't feel like I can fully rely on them to talk to as I've been fairly out of contact with them due to finishing my final year of college. 

They are all in jobs for about two years, I'm not. I may still not be depending on whether I pass repeat modules. I have no means of staying in the same city as them. My grades may not be good enough to get the job I want.

I'm over reliant on my parents at the moment and it's killing me as I'm a very independent person. I'm staying at home but I don't have a very friendly relationship with my parents, rather a functional one.

My uncle has died in the last year due to some very unfortunate circumstances (read between the lines). He has been on my mind almost every day since he died. I wouldn't say we were very close but we were very aware that we resonated with each other, at least the times we would meet. I buried him on my birthday and I haven't forgotten that a year later, so anyone who says happy birthday to me just reminds me of carrying his coffin and seeing my granny in tears.

These are all very disjointed and disorganised paragraphs but it's a read of basically what my mind is like right now. I can't even properly be sad about one thing because there's so many others. However the most recent one is the breakup. I've unraveled after breakups before when I found no one to turn to and I'm scared that will happen now. Granted I never foresaw what mental abyss that would drive me to and how much time and effort it took to get out.

I'm just so pissed off that I've been struggling really really hard to keep myself afloat in my course but yet I now loose what was my best friend (my ex) overnight and everyone else is too used to not seeing me that I can't be seen. Like literally dug myself into another 'relying on one person' hole. No one to talk to now.

I want to go back to who I was before all this bullshit, before all the relationships, before college decentralised my friend group etc. I was ambitious then, wanted to achieve, wanted to be good at everything. Now I'm just like meh to everything. I've no one who I care about to watch me achieve anything. I want someone to just fucking see me.

I'm sick of being miserable. I'm sick of being kicked in the stones while I'm down.

lonely,All I want is a close female friend to connect to,"All I want is a close female friend to connect to - A bit of a long rant vv
Hi I am a female I am 19 years old, and i've just got to rant as i've got no one else to talk to. I am so lonely, all I seem to do is to go to work come home, and see my bf, and it is the same repetitive cycle is making me go insane. When i'm at work I don't want to be there, most people are older than me, I am 19, there is a girl my age there but the relationships I have are mostly work based and  professional, I don't know how to break the ice with her, or click with her. I just want to get home and lay on my bed and feel anxious and nervous in work constantly, and just not my usual talkative self. I have applied to uni next year, but there are several months till then and I can feel my mental health spirrling neing stuck in the same repetitive cycle and I don't know what to do about it. I'm also scared about going as I feel stupid writing this, but I know uni has a massive drink/ drug culture, and I do want to go out and have run, and not spoil the fun, and meet people, but due to having ptsd, drinking often makes my symptoms worse, and i'm worried about not meeting people and not fitting in due to this. 

I know I am so lucky to have a bf, and he is my best friend we have been dating for a year and I love spending time with him, he is my friend as well as my bf, and I love him a lot. However I crave female friendship, not a massive group of friends but a small close group I spend time with. My bf has so many friends from childhood, and I feel so selfish for writing this, but I feel so almost jelouse when I hear him talk about them, and meet up every night, not cos I want to be with him (we are kinda long distance ish and live an hour away from each other, so see him once a week, or less.) But because I crave close friendships like that. In school I was bullied by my friends (secoundary) and had social anxiety in primary school, so I have barely any close friends from school. In college I made some mistakes and was not nice to people, so I guess this is kinda karma for me. I have massively chnaged since then (2 years ago.) Anyone who I was friends with has moved on that I met in college. I just want a close friendship that lasts. I'm so happy for him but I don't want to be one of those girls that relys on my bf for friendship.

Just had a guy tell me that I look “different.” I mean, it’s true, but it’s not really a nice thing to say to someone. I was born with a rare condition. It does affect how I look, but I’m just tired of feeling rejected and like I look awful. Sometimes, I don’t think I even look that bad. So, I don’t really get it. But oh well. Looks like I should keep to myself. I wouldn’t want to blind anyone."

lonely,Stuck in a dream. Does anybody else want to join me?,"Stuck in a dream. Does anybody else want to join me? - Every day every moment I feel lost and empty, like I've lost my reason to go on, a piece of myself.
I spend my days sleeping since that's my escape where I can keep living in the past, in a fantasy world that never was.
What I miss the most is simple and genuine things like being able to talk heart to heart and listening for hours until morning, knowing that somebody else real was at the other end, looking forward to another day. I miss that same turmoil of true emotions that right no is crippling me, killing me.

I know I need to find a way to go on so if anybody out there would like to share this dream of mine please reach out, please. 

If you would like to know something more about this lost soul here I'm just a simple 24yo guy from Italy, when I'm not sleeping I tend to find other escapes like watching TV shows, anime or playing games. I'm lucky enough to have a cat and I love her so much. That's about it

Thanks for reading this little call for help of mine, have a good night all you beautiful lonely people here"
lonely,I’m fucking done,"I’m fucking done - I wanna fucking do it , she posted a vid with her head between her new bfs legs while he was wearing only his boxers

She reassured me that I wasn’t the fault , that the two years we’ve been together mean a lot to her but she wanted time for herself 

I was battling tough anxiety and depression these two years and they’ve only gotten worst since September 

She fucking reassured me that she wouldn’t find a guy since she wanted to be single to focus on herself then two fucking days later she posts this , laughing between his legs 1am at night 

I’m utterly lost of words , I already struggled with self harm and depression , I already cut open my whole left arm yesterday from fingers to shoulders ,I’m tired of it all .

I’ve already fucked a lot of shit up this year this was the cherry on the cake

i dont drink and so going out is never been fun, tried it 4-5 times but its just not fun. everytime my friends go out i feel left out, but on the other hand i dont really get along with them. i am sometimes talking to then but there is not a strong friendship where u can really trust someone or talk to. i am 19 so i think its too late to find new friends. 

i am also a virgin, not very unattractive, i do alot of sports so my body is also in great shape and i think i can get along with woman but ive never had any real woman company, i live with my mother and im very distanced with her, she had a alcohol problem so i refuse to really talk to her. but the problem is that i think i need to get out there and find some bedpartners. i dont know why i feel this need, maybe the testosteron. 

i am as lonely as you can get. i barely get a text from my family ( only if they need me) my friends as i said are different and i get no attention from any women. on a regular day i get no messages. i always tell myself that i am strong and dont need any attention. 

ill keep you posted, i am very bad at this but i am giving it a go🙂"

lonely,Have no friends and everyone has push me away,"Have no friends and everyone has push me away - I’m honestly just really lonely. I lost most of my friends a couple years ago when I came out a couple years ago and the one friend I made in that time ended our friendship cuz I was mentally unstable at the time is what I surmised. 

I’m doing ok now, not as suicidal as I was a couple months ago but the loneliness is really getting to me now. I’ve tried to make some friends in the time since they ended it a couple months but the one I made used me for my car and called me a horrible person for not getting them cigarettes. I know I’m better off without them but now I have absolutely no one to talk to. 

I’ll admit that I do suffer from depression and anxiety so I’m the friend who is always a wreck and probably not the first choices to hangout with but I know how to hold it together, I think. Honestly what hurts the most is the rejection, cuz I’ve never felt like I belong and when I thought I did it was fake just like every other time. I’m hurting and don’t know what to do.

lonely,I like she led me on for an entire month,"I like she led me on for an entire month - I took a class at college. Me and this girl would look at each other everyday we had class. She uploaded a pic to her Facebook one day with her and what I could tell but later confirmed was her boyfriend. I know I was snooping, oh well. She gave me many hints and parked by me a couple days in a row. Looked at me for the rest of the semester, but I didn't say anything because I was nervous. I'm 20 and never had a girlfriend. On the last day of class, I nutted up for the first time and asked for her number. She told she didn't have a boyfriend after I asked her(at this point she had broken up with Facebook guy unbeknownst to me). I got her number and texted the next day. Her first three texts were dry, but I kept going for laughs and she ended up reciprocating. We texted throughout the days. She would send of video of how she looked when she woke up, or would send voice messages. She would also send photos. She asked if she could talk on the phone with me and I talked for an hour then left. We texted more and she would seem flirty. She sent a photo of our names on an Internet ""love tester"" with a high rating. She told me about a guy she had gone on a date with and phrased it as, ""this guy(cameron) asked on a date before you had asked for my number."" She told about how he had tried to kiss her and wanted to sleep with her and wished I was there. She told me she was a virgin and wanted to stay that way till she felt comfortable but they she had done basic stuff. I didn't mind as the same was true for me. We would again talk on the phone this time for 4 hours. During that time she proposed the idea of us going to the movies together. A couple days later I asked officially if she wanted to which she did agree. We saw the movie and went out to eat. She got us a drink to share throughout the movie. It ended with her letting me borrow a DVD and she initiated a hug good bye and we left. This was like the first week and a half. She later texted me a meme with Jason Bateman American Psycho in a picture frame with a ""my boyfriend"" tagline. She just texted ""you"" under the photo. I made a joke about it not acknowledging the boyfriend part because I didn't want to be presumptuous. She also texted that she wanted my flannel during the movie and was going to pretend to be cold. We continued texting and flirting at least what I thought it was. She had joked that a movie scene had made her cum in "".02"" seconds. I replied that, ""I wish there was something that could make me cum immediately from just seeing."" She responded, ""me in my work uniform,"" and sent a pic of her in it. I typed, ""worked."" So I assumed that we had been flirting over time with not just stuff like this. She would tell me what she was wearing at night. She went on a trip with her best friend and stayed at a hotel for a couple days. She sent photos and texted me while it was going on. She sent a photo of her and her friend in a hot tub. She was drinking for the first time that night, and told me, ""If I try to video call you ignore it."" Which I agreed to but was confused by it a little. She told me she was bored a couple times and I mentioned that it looked like fun and I said ""wish I there, looks like more fun than what I'm doing."" she replied, ""wish you could come."" Theoretically, they were in a spot that would take me about an hour to get there, but I think I just made a joke and continued texting. Later on, she asked me one night I wanted to be added to her private Instagram which only 25 people followed. I said yes and she added me. This was like another week and a half. I asked if she would like to go to the movies again to which she obliged. We had fun and talked throughout the movie like we had done with the last. I wanted to hold her hand because I felt that I hadn't made any physical moves on her. I would say something and she would turn and look at me while putting her hand on my should to laugh and agree to whatever I said multiple times. She kind of grazed her hand down my arm at one moment. Then she briefly palmed my hand, but not in a holding hand sort of way. It ended, and she went for another hug and we left. I later jokingly apologized for taking her to Doctor Strange because it was bad. She said, ""I liked it! plus I just like hanging out with you."" We text the next couple days and continue flirting I think. She told me about how she ended her streak with her Facebook boyfriend of 1 year and that he had wanted her back, but she didn't care. Later, she told me she got a bikini and and new shorts. I asked how she looked in the shorts. She sent of photo to which I jokingly replied, ""I'll save that in the vault for later."" She laughed and liked the comment. That was yesterday, and today I decided to text her again because I was thinking that I goofed again for not making a physical move on her at the movie. I also didn't want to be too forward like the guy she described from earlier, so I decided to make my intentions somewhat clear because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. So I texted her:

""Hey Samantha! I wanna be open and transparent with you because I like you obviously. We’ve been on two dates and I figure we are still in the “talking stage.” However, I feel as though I haven’t shown that I like you on our dates because I didn’t want to be a “Cameron” lol nor do I want to be “just a friend.” I don’t think I was playing my cards right, but I want to change that. I was hoping I can take you to the movies once more before you go on your beach vacation, but this time I wanted to show you that I like you more than someone I’m just “talking” to and ask if I can hold your hand.""

She reponded:

“That’s so thoughtful! I’d love to go to the movies again with you, but I should also be transparent by saying I’m not looking to really get into anything very serious right now.”

I figured that she meant she liked me, but doesn't completely know me or feel comfortable with me yet. After thinking about it, and asking people, now my opinion is that she's not interested at all.

I typed:

""Totally Cool! I figured I would just be honest instead of making my self look like a fool like others have in the past.""

TL;DR: I think I have been reading this girl wrong for an entire month. What does the girl actually want? Just some companionship after a break up?"

lonely,I've never known what it's like to not be alone,"I've never known what it's like to not be alone - I grew up horribly bullied and ostracized in school. Went on to be bullied and ostracized at work. Had to deal with even more difficult complications of being diagnosed with an illness that will kill me someday.

I'm now in my thirties. Do some odd jobs from home to avoid human contact. I've never known friendship. Never had any relationships. I've gone through every phase imaginable. Anger. Hate. Sadness. Acceptance. And it all just goes in a loop. There's only one thing I know for sure.

I'm in pain. 

Though I've never known what it's like to not be alone, so I still hurt because of it. Always. Every day. And this rejection by people and society has lead to me also being a failure as a person for being unable to get a decent job.

I hurt. I hurt so bad and I don't know how long I can carry on. The world is a cold, dark place full of cruel, uncaring, nasty people, and I don't belong in it. I've spent decades now trying to figure out what to do and more and more, I'm coming to the conclusion that I'll never know what companionship or even friendship is.

Someday I'll die and rot alone in my home. Not a single person to care. Not a single person to mourn. At best, there will at least be people celebrating that I'm gone."

we didn’t talk for weeks because he left me hanging for hours mid conversation. i got upset and told him i didn’t want to talk. at first it was only going to be for a few days but then i had issues with my health and i also had finals so i didn’t text because i already had so much going on that i didn’t want to add emotional issues on to it.

when we started talking he accused me of cheating and that hurt ( still does ) a lot because i never did. he said it wasn’t about me but rather about how me telling him off for weeks made him feel. i admit that i didn’t really try to understand that because i was pissed and hurt that he would accuse me of cheating on him. it felt like a part of me was ripped apart.

and just when i thought i couldn’t feel worse, he tells me i’m selfish for holding on to the accusation and that i should forget about him.

i can’t. and as much as this sucks, i’d do anything to talk to him again. i don’t know whether to text him asking for another chance or to leave him be"

And the girl started talking to me and i felt very happy because it was so natural like i never spoken with she and made me feel like someone cares about me and that i exist for someone.

lonely,Alone even in a dream,"Alone even in a dream - Years ago, I would always dream I am with some guy. It could be someone I know, a guy I’ve never seen in my life or a celebrity (my biggest one was justin bieber when I was a kid lol) and in that dream, I would be on a date with them. They would hold my hand and I would spend my whole dream with them until my dream takes a weird turn and I would, for some reason, lose them but I would still wake up in a really good mood. 

Today, I woke up crying. I had a dream this guy I have a crush on was picking me up from work. For some reason, I live in a hotel and him and I were walking up the stairs. We were talking and laughing and all that. You know how in hotels, sometimes they have mirrors as walls right? As I was walking up the stairs, I looked at the mirror and saw my reflection. I was alone. And then, it hit me. I realize I am sleeping and dreaming. Recently, there were moments were I am aware I am dreaming and this was one of it. I stopped walking and looked around. There were people walking past me but I don’t know any of them. I felt so alone in my own dream. I sat on the floor and started crying. My chest started to hurt and my dream started to blur until I woke up and realize I’ve been crying in my bed."

Anyways, I kinda just wanted to share the news with someone, even if it's just strangers who don't really care. And btw, for whoever is in HS, try to make the most out of it. Seriously, you might think it doesn't matter, but it'll be worth it. Have a good one yall"
lonely,losing hope,losing hope - i (22f) am a war survivor and currently living in a foreign country. still dealing with my trauma. i met my boyfriend who’s helping me heal about 5 years ago. he’s a scuba diver. about 4 days ago he went to the sea (it’s what his job’s abt) somewhere really far away from here and i haven’t heard of him since. he said he would text or call but there’s no phone signal. no internet. his mom is concerned too. maybe he couldnt buy a local sim card from where he is yet but i’m kinda scared that something else happened. if i lose him i don’t know what i would do. i really don’t. he’s my family. he’s the reason i learned their language. he’s the reason i healed from many things. he’s my biggest supporter. i can’t stop crying. i just want someone to tell me everything’s gonna be okay.

lonely,not sure how to continue in life,"not sure how to continue in life - recently, my boyfriend of 5 months (almost 6), broke up with me. i really don't understand why, honestly. i would assume it was because there were moments in our relationship where i expressed wanting to be sexual with others. i'm hypersexual due to trauma and having bpd (borderline personality disorder). he knew all of this. and while he didn't like this particular thing about me, he was willing to overlook it for me.

he made me feel special. really special. both of us opening up about things we wouldn't just share with anyone. there was a deep bond there. he made me feel extremely loved. at 28 years old, i've never been in a real relationship before. typically guys just want to use me for sex. he was different. he made me feel loved, wanted, desired, and cared for. he was my person. we could be ourselves around each other.

the last week or so, he had become more distant. less talkative to me. and then yesterday he said he wanted a break. i'll admit, i lost my shit. went straight into a bpd rage + spiral. i was suicidal, i self medicated, wanted to cut myself...all the things. he abandoned me. he promised he wouldn't. just a day or so earlier he said he wanted to be with me forever. 

i can't breathe. i've never been so in love with another person before. this heartache is unreal. i'm starting to wonder if this is my life. always being broken hearted by guys. only being good enough to be used for sex. maybe i am just a whore and need to embrace that. seems to be the thing guys only like in me; what i can do for them sexually. it seems as if that's all i am good for.

i truly loved this man. i don't know what i did wrong. i wish i knew. i wish i could figure it out and make it better. but i'm sure he doesn't love me anymore. i'm nothing at all. 

all i have ever wanted in my life is to be loved. not just a body used for sex. i wanted real love. a real relationship. i don't think i'll ever find it again. i don't want to find it again. he was it for me. it was perfect. i feel like this grief will eat me alive.

i self medicated last night and was truly bummed when i woke up this morning. feels like there is an elephant sitting on my chest. i feel numb. i can't function. hardly eaten or had something to drink. i just feel utterly devastated. i truly did not see this coming. my entire being hurts and i just want to curl up and die, honestly. i don't think it's ever gonna get any better.

i loved him so much. i still do. i love him so much i would die for him. 

guys always leave me. abandon me. they say i'm too much to handle. guess they're right. 

all i can keep thinking is that naomi judd was brave and i wish i could be that brave, too. because i have no reason to go on. my body physically hurts. i just want to die."

For example were in a group call on discord or something i could just stay compleatly silent or we walk somewhere i could stay behind 10 meters and no one would notice.

And all groups ends with ppl adding new ppl to replace me or some being mean to make me leave the group.

I have nothing special and i am easely replaceble as a friend so i just think its better to cut off everyone because sooner or later i will be left in the dust and replaced like always so whats the point of trying to keep friendship going?

lonely,I feel like shit because of my best friend,"I feel like shit because of my best friend -  I am sometimes jealous of her. and I know it sounds terrible that I even hate myself sometimes for it, but she has a way that reminds me how terribly lonely I am. That is of course not intentional from her side, but it still hurts regardless.

I have been alone since ever. Even in my childhood, I rarely had friends. That is not to blame on anxiety but on my laziness to make friends because I simply enjoy my own company and I don't really like people. However, The attention and love my best friend gets in an hour are probably more than I will ever get in a lifetime. Someone confessing his love to her is almost like a routine to her at this point. This makes me really insecure because why can't that be me? Am I really that undesirable? What's wrong with me that the attention and love I got since birth is probably equal to what she gets in a day?

I mean hell, even my mom left me when I was young, see how funny it is? That I couldn't even be loved by my own mom while there are people who attract whoever they wish. And I am supposed to actually believe that everyone is lovable and that everyone is equal.

It is not that I want numerous friendships or a relationship. But hell, it would feel a lot nicer if I felt loved or wanted. I mean I bet if I and her were to drift apart she would have no memory of me due to how full her life is of people. I want to want to crave connections if that makes sense. Saying all of these things written above makes me feel like a piece of shit, but it is simply the truth."

lonely,The deeper I go,"The deeper I go - I can see why it's getting harder and harder to be friends with me. I'm going nowhere in life and I'm always in a bad mood.. I no longer can find my fun side, the person people liked..

Every ounce of passion is dying within me, and it makes me less attractive. To myself and to others. The lack of motivation looks good on nobody..

Everything I have to share in conversation is a waste of everyone's time, of no use, no benefit, no interest to them... It seems most of the time, everything on my mind is not worth Expressing.

I'm often told that I'm thinking too much about it..

Nobody cares about vfx, animation, texture, lighting.. ""it's just a movie""

Nobody cares that all of the best game devs thought about exactly where to put that sign, that wall, that enemy, that hidden chest, that awesome Easter egg, that last key before the boss.
""It's just a game""

Nor do they care that you think mushrooms, and the idea of evolution, and how big the universe might be, is all awesome.

Nobody cared that it mattered to me.

People never give me a break, and challenge my passions all the time.. I don't talk to anyone anymore.."

lonely,"20 years old, in college, no friends (never really have had any)","20 years old, in college, no friends (never really have had any) - Hi! So yeah I’m 20 years old and have zero true friends, yeah I have a couple of friends I’m close with from high school but since we started college and went our separate ways, we only loosely keep in touch here and again. While I won’t say I’m dead ugly or Mr. Universe kind of attractive, I will say I think of myself as conventionally attractive: had a quick fling and a relationship but nothing recent.

I’ve done what everyone says, be outgoing, go up and talk to people, be genuine, get out of your comfort zone. I’ve done all that and more, yet nothing. I’ve realized I’ve always kind of been like that. Never have had many friends, with periods of having nobody. I try to be my best self, talk about my interests, get involved in the community, and so on, but still nothing.

I’m not one to self loathe, but I am one who thinks self awareness is key. I’ve never been anyones best friend, and honestly I wonder if anyone has thought of me as a friend. I try telling myself once I get to college (currently in community college transferring in the spring) that things will get better but honestly I’ve been telling that to myself before with the same result. I hope that I will be with a good friend group someday but honestly I’m not holding my breathe.

I constantly try to better myself, both internally and externally yet still nothing. I’m coming to the realization that I’m just going to be one of those people who don’t have friends and just kind of float through life. I don’t blame anyone, you can’t force a friendship or relationship. All the work starts at home  but you can only keep trying to repair something that you’re not sure what the cause is."

I have Asperger’s and anxiety, and anytime I did make a possible friend or two they left shortly after we acquainted. I have been bullied too, I never understood why it was hard for me to have friends nor why I was bullied. I have my theories though. Maybe I appear too timid and vulnerable, and attracted bad people. Maybe I am not deserving of friends. Maybe I am too aloof, annoying and unusual to others, and the lack of social engagement and skills makes people uncomfortable. Maybe I just have terrible luck. Nevertheless, here I am. At least 2-3 years ago I found 2 online friends. It truly felt like a blessing. After years of difficulties in the social sphere, it was only normal that I be afraid of them becoming disinterested. I think this is what is happening. I think they are slowly moving away, as there is gradually littler and littler interaction between us. I am afraid and unsure of how to cope. I think they are sometimes just being nice.

lonely,29 years of loneliness (Warning: Wall of Text),"29 years of loneliness (Warning: Wall of Text) - Hello. This is my very first post on Reddit. I usually avoid bother people, being an annoyance is my greatest fear, but I'm feeling exceedingly bad as of late and since I have no one, absolutely no one to talk to in person, I thought that I could perhaps find some solace writing here. As the title says, I'm 29 years old and I only know loneliness. I spent all my childhood and teen years utterly isolated from the outside world with my relatives, not well-adjusted people. I grew up with my mother, her parents and an half-brother of hers; my father was out of the picture. None of them worked, we lived off welfare checks. I was not allowed to hang out with the other kids, because... I don't really know why, they simply really didn't want me to. School was my only escape, so holidays meant weeks and months all alone; no pets either. The only peer I had was a slightly older cousin, who suffered from extreme anger management issues and frequently, and savagely, beat and humiliated me in front of our relatives, who couldn't care less about it; I soon learnt to not cry and seek help from them because that only resulted in further emotional abuse. Nowadays only my mother and the ""uncle"" remain, my grandparents are dead and my cousin is now an upstanding citizen, with a good blue-collar job, a wife and a home. I, on the other hand, am a depressed NEET loner living precariously in a rented home alongside the aforementioned duo, still as uncaring and emotionally abusive as ever. I am not graduated, I have very little work experience, mostly dead-end jobs as a back-office assistant, and I'm scared shitless of social interactions. In my almost three decades of life I've never had a single friend, I'm still a kissless virgin with no experience with women whatsoever, and whenever I find myself around people I shut off completely. About six months ago I began attending an Association in favor of people struggling with depression in search of work; more recently I contacted a psychiatrist and started a cycle of therapy. All good news, and I'm grateful for them, but at the same time I am becoming more and more certain that there's ultimately no hope for me. All the other people attending the Association have so many interesting stories to tell. Stories about family members, friends, romantic partners... about their travels, their years in college, their hobbies... and I have nothing. I never actually lived, and it shows. I only know loneliness, boredom, traumas, and an infinite sadness. I hate hearing all these stories and not having one to share. Also, I think it's because my lack of self-esteem, but I constantly crave validation: I'm crazy jealous of the attention the other guys receive, and always feel like I'm treated differently. I'm in a bad mood all the time and there's nothing I wish for more than being consoled by someone, but no one does. Sometimes I try to speak to the other associates about how I feel and my history, but I get cut off every time. The Staff isn't paying me attention, either, eventhough I am always eager to help them with their work (within my limited capacity). My therapist should help me with my social anxiety, but I feel like this is hopeless too. As I said, no one seems interested in me and who I am, no matter how many times I try get close to people. And if I can't seem to be able to befriend someone, how could I ever hope to find love? I would have liked immensely to know what affection and intimacy are before my death, but this is just crazy talk I'm afraid. What could I offer to a woman? I've yet to find a work, I don't have a family, or a car, or a house, and my ineptitude and lack of social development make me a boring, uninspiring and unpleasant company. These thoughts keep me awake at night and borderline apathetic during days. I simply don't see a solution, my future is grim and there's little I can do, besides working on myself in the feeble hopes that there's a decent individual buried inside me. Sorry for the huge wall of text, hopefully it isn't too much time-consuming to read. Thanks for letting me vent about my problems."

If your fat and ugly go to the gym, either way you have nothing going on. 
Stop being dependent on outcomes. 8 out of 10 times life won’t be in your favor accept life for what it is. 
Set goals and if you have something else that interests you along the way pursue that too.

I want you to burn this into your brain and never forget it when you are low.

There's websites where you can practice speaking with people, who are generally really friendly and usually have empathy or experience being in the same boat, and it can seriously improve your confidence or just help with feeling alone. There are several like this, and I think if you're searching for something, but therapy isn't necessarily what you need, just connecting with a human can make a really big difference.

Probably because you're one of them, and you're already overwhelmed by your own loneliness and depression.

I feel that most of the time that's why we are having trouble.. we are looking for help in a place where there is no help available, only more of those in pain.

Those that actually come to help, might also be in the wrong place.. broken, sad and lonely people are difficult to have patience with..

And it becomes contagious, because all this sadness just makes the world feel so much more sad.

But even if we don't all connect, we are all here on the sub together. So let's try to feel less alone.

3. Those that are here because you were bored for half an hour and just ghost lonely people afterwards. I don't think I need to say much more.

4. To those that think your rumination is somehow coherent thought. You can lie to others but not to yourself. Hate me as you may, you won't get better by grabbing those narratives in your head tighter.

lonely,"Lost in Thoughts, All Alone","Lost in Thoughts, All Alone - So let me preface this by saying this is a throwaway account but this venting is 100% real, just don’t want it polluting my main account is all. So I’m in my mid 20’s, lost every friend I’ve ever had for multiple reasons, family more or less hates me for their own fair reasons (we still love each other tho, I mean from the cradle to the grave they’re all you’ve got), dead end job, have been depressed for the last 14+ years for multiple reasons, struggling thru school, can’t seem to stop wasting money on stupid things, never know when to stop rambling, I overeat and don’t really know when to stop eating (I’m only like 20-30 lbs overweight but not completely unhealthy), and I’m terrible with talking to people.

To clarify more on certain parts, throughout middle school and high school I was bullied for reasons I never really understood, sure I was awkward and a loser who didn’t know the first thing about making and keeping friends but I still tried the best I could. Had gum spat in my hair multiple times, beaten, bruised, battered, had a fake girlfriend for a while who’d show me chats from other people in our class showing how worthless a person I was (saying things like “damn that loser can get a girlfriend and I can’t?”, “I kinda feel bad for her”, and “here comes the creep, poor girl”. Worst of all she was the one who was in those chats, showing me all of this. The end of that was when she cheated on me with her eventual prom date that year, saying I allegedly refused to go with her when I can’t recall her ever saying she wanted to go in the first place, this was all when my grandmother had just passed so yay my luck I guess. Ever since I haven’t dated anyone, granted her and I never went out on a legit date, we were in high school and I didn’t have a car or anything to really offer, so it was kinda doomed from the start.

I’m kinda the black sheep of the family, which I don’t personally mind tbh, it’s nothing I can or really want to change. Yes we’ve had many many arguments and fights over the years, I have too many siblings and they’re all so much better than I am academically, socially, just every way imaginable. Personally I’m fine not being anyones favorite son or brother, I was never really in the running. I know even tho they hate me, they moreso hate what I am, some loser with no friends, no social life, no real opinion on any important matter, can’t relate to anything they like, I’m just kinda the outcast of the family, but if they really hated me I probably would’ve been disowned long ago yknow.

Money problems are just kinda par for the course here, everything’s expensive nowadays I mean look at gas prices. Depression just ruins peoples lives, it’s a matter of whether you’ll let it eat you alive or if you’ll beat it into the ground. Due to depression tho I overthink everything, normal everyday convos, how people really feel, whether I’m really helping someone or not, what I should and shouldn’t eat, what to wear, etc. etc. I recently lost my best friend of five years over my new job that I was practically forced to take, she didn’t agree with the position I took even tho the position I applied for isn’t the position I’m in. My boss basically said “oh you’re going to be working with this floor instead since I think you’ll do much better with this side instead”, in other words I have to suck it up or I won’t have a job. I hate it but it’s better pay, good benefits, everything I need to survive, just not what I want to do yknow. 

Another thing about my job is I worked with a really cool girl that I grew to have feelings for (I believe she had feelings for me first, many clues being thrown here and there, my best friend who was also friends with her at the time said I should’ve asked her out, the signs were basically all there) moved to Night Shift on a different floor entirely so I will never see her again (probably). I admit I missed my chance if I had one to begin with, but I just can’t seem to move on from it, anytime we had ran into each other it was like nothing had changed, we get along really well, our overall vibe was positive, she’d normally be the one who would seek me out at the most random times, but time keeps going by. I have her number and we text every now and then but I have to start he convo nowadays, it’s such a weird feeling right now, it really does feel like I missed any chance I had if I even had one. I know I should just give up on it but deep down I don’t want to, it’s not fair to her at all to bug her if I am or to even keep trying when she could already be over it, let alone the possibility of it all just ending up with “she was just being nice, she had no feelings for you” situation the whole time yknow. But that’s more of me overthinking things again.

My future is in serious question here, I know I’m going to have to take care of my parents and brother when they get older (that’s a long story in itself) basically meaning I’m on a serious time crunch. I’m still going to school to try and get into a better paying job to support not only myself but my family, I’ll have to throw my life away (if I manage to get one) to focus on taking care of them full time. It’s not like it’s forced or anything, my brother will physically/mentally never be able to take care of himself and my parents are getting up there in age so I’m seriously running out of time. Its freaking me out so much, I’ve wasted my life doing nothing but wallowing in my own depression instead of trying to do what I want to do and now my hard deadline to get a life, maybe get a wife, my dream job, have kids of my own, all of that is slowly slipping away from becoming a feasible possibility. At the end of the day my fate is fast approaching, I’m stuck scared cuz I’ve wasted so much time doing nothing, all because I let it consume me. But it’s on me at the end of the day, even tho I’ve had people around me my whole life I’ve never let anyone know my true feelings, I’ve never tried to fix them, it’s my fault I’m like this. No one can fix you but you after all, it’s my burden, I’ll forever be alone if not in my head in reality.

Anyways I just felt the need to let this out, if this was the wrong place to let it out I’m sorry you can delete it, thanks for reading it all if you have, and I hope you all have a great day or night wherever you are."

That said, most are buried in their phone, staring at the ground, or in some other way oblivious to their surroundings.  You on the other hand are usually a guaranteed glance and courteous smile.  It means nothing and I don't even really think about it much afterwards but it's always nice to share a brief moment with you where we are focused on politely smiling at each other.  Maybe in a different world we would stop and ask how each other is doing, catch up on how life is going but truly I'm content with the mutual smile once or twice a week.

Perhaps I could endure this feeling if I had a more exciting job or a livable wage, but as of rn, the loneliness is killing me and I just want my 1st relationship. The worst part for me is knowing that I'll never get to have those cute, young-person dates like to Disney World or just putt-putt. Those are things other people get to experience and enjoy, but not me. Now, if I ever want to have any relationship at all, I probably have to tie down the 1st person I can find regardless of my attraction to them, their personal health, or even if they have kids. The thing is, I don't want my 1st learning experience to be with some old person like myself. I want to progress normally in my dating experiences and knowledge, but I lost my youth because of how much of a fucking loser I am, that I'll now never be able to know what its like. And I don't want to hear about how ""relationships aren't all fun and roses"" or ""you have more than 1 more chance, don't be dramatic"" bullshit. I don't need to be patronized or talked down to like that rn, and it would be nice if I could learn these lessons on my own, but the fact is, 0 relationships in 30 years, going down that same rate, yeah, I realistically only have 1 more chance in my life, if even that."

But lately I've been thinking. About how I've never had a friend last for more than a year max. Like I know a lot of people. But there's this feeling that I'm an outsider and will always be an outsider. That I'll never be able to form meaningful connections with anybody.

It feels like I'm marooned on an island.

Weirdly it feels the worst when I'm surrounded by lots of people. 

I've heard that a lot of people think I'm cool, and admire me, and even a few girls think I'm cute, but I don't understand why I can't form connections with then.
I always feel like an outsider."

I’ve felt lonely before but lately it’s been difficult. Finally decided to go through with a divorce (this was decided less than a week ago after over a year of thinking about it). I’m so lonely.

The lofty idea of finding a partner feels far out of reach.  People can damage you and make you feel worthless.  This negativity I feel about myself is unbreakable.  The person I last dated trashed me on social media.  Some of what was said had some truth, but other statements made by her are completely false.   It hurt me.  Friends stopped reaching out.  I was alienated.  If I didn't go into therapy with her immediately than she wouldn't talk to me again.  I am already in therapy getting over trauma with her I couldn't go back to her.  I can't help but think I brought this on myself.  I feel so defeated.  I get through a couple hours in the morning and then the emptiness fills me.

lonely,"Lonely from depression, regret being open.","Lonely from depression, regret being open. -  I sank into a deep depression &amp; abused alcohol when my Dad died. After years of mental torment, a few years ago I attempted suicide at Xmas. It’s a horrible holiday, I’ve not spend Xmas day with my family for over 20 years. My Mum started a new family when I was 12 after years of my Mum &amp; Dad hating each other &amp; constantly cheating on one another. My Dad told me I was born so they could qualify for a council house.. thanks Dad! After they split I lived with my Mum &amp; her violent abusive boyfriend. She gave up on me &amp; neglected me to start her new family. My Dad was a racist alcoholic who pimped out women &amp; didn’t bother with me. He left my Mum with debts, left us in poverty &amp; in a house with an abusive man. After he was kicked out he tried to impress younger women, spent thousands on feeding their addictions &amp; trying to get them into bed (he forgot he had kids he brought into this world to care &amp; provide for). I was tired of abandoning myself for my family &amp; my in-laws &amp; going along with what everyone wanted from me. I was tired of always being the one person to drop everything &amp; help when family needed it. I was tired of feeling guilty for how my Mum’s life has been. The advice to us is to be open, honest, talk &amp; get a good support system. I did that &amp; said I was struggling with depression &amp; regret it. I regret making myself look weak, vulnerable &amp; opening myself up for criticism &amp; their judgemental opinions on my life. My family &amp; my in-laws have called me selfish, attention seeking &amp; now have as little to do with me as possible. My half Sister hardly talks to me because, how could I be so selfish &amp; do that to my Mum!! Being open about depression made things so much worse for me. They have gossiped to their mates about what I did &amp; how awful it was I did that to them, at Christmas. Now when I bump into their friends I’m this awful attention seeker that did that to their friend. How could I do that to my Mom? Never mind that she was a terrible Mother to me. How could I do that to my in-laws? Never mind that I’ve never been good enough for their son &amp; I am the worst of society for what I’ve put him through. They don’t know what he’s put me through, they don’t take responsibility for how awful they have treated me over the years. Why is everything entirely my fault? I’ve gone along with everything they wanted for the past 20 years. Nobody bothers with me or visits me, I was always the one to make all the effort. Honestly, nobody would miss me if I was gone but you can bet if I leave this world I would be selfish &amp; hated &amp; they would be the victims of the awful thing that I’ve done to them. How dare I be so selfish. They just want me to suffer. The point of this rant, I don’t know. I just  need to get that off my chest. Be lonely sucks."

I’ve never been anyones priority. Always a second option, if even that. I’m just existing at this point. I hold no meaning in anyones life, just another side character in everyone’s life wasting space and air. 

It’s heartbreaking to know I’ve never been anyones favourite. I’ve never been loved by anyone outside family. That shit is devastating. Is there something wrong with me? Am I really undeserving of love and affection? I question my existence every single day. I’ve stopped believing in love and I believe I’m unlovable. I honestly see no point in life if I’m just a useless blob of matter. 

I’ve distanced myself. No one talked to me so they didn’t even notice nor care. So to me, I view it as them not caring about my presence in the first place. I’m drowning in loneliness. I don’t know how much more energy I have to keep up with this. I hate being lonely and forgotten, it really breaks your spirit. This loneliness is igniting a strong desire to drop everything I know and start a new life.

After work I sit in silence because I can’t watch anymore tv. I find it very difficult to be in social situations, my anxiety is too much that I can’t process what the other person is telling me. I never used to be like this, I used to have friends and be social, I feared being alone. I have been alone for over 3 years now, and it’s now been 1 year since someone has checked in on me to say hi. If it wasn’t for my cat, I don’t think I could survive another year. Im a good person, but I feel like I’m being punished. Im scared to reach out to people now because the thought of rejection or being left on read would hurt more then being alone. This is hard. This is sad. I haven’t smiled in years, when I do smile I can see how fake it looks, forced and sad. I never pictured my life ending up so pathetically at 30.

lonely,Always feeling alone,"Always feeling alone - Hi everyone, I'm a 19m. have a pretty good life, I won't lie about that. I have friends and family who support me. But no matter what I do, I feel like I never belong anywhere. I am a music major, and when my semester was going on, I didn't feel any connection with professors or students. I felt like I didn't belong, even with my friends and family. I always think about the negative side of things, so I can never think of the positive. I wish I could, I've tried.

I always pick one thing that makes me different and focus on it which makes my loneliness worse. I wish I could understand why I like this.

One possible reason I am liked this is the fact I have Schizoaffective Disorder, a combination of schizophrenia and a mood disorder. My hallucinations were just worse than my racing thoughts, and I wish it wasn't like this. I like being open about myself and my mental disorders, but it is hard when you're constantly reminded how different you truly are from everyone else.

I recently went to the ER for suicidal ideation. It honestly was the first time I put my mental health first over other things like school or social interaction. After I got discharged from the ER, my fear of not fitting in was worsened by my ""friend"" that picked me up. All they did was yell at me about how I should've done a certain action. Just made me feel worse about myself and made me feel even more alone than before.

And the tragic began. As he had second thoughts, he did not tell me that he was insecure but that he was flying to my province. I was happy and waited for him at the airport. He didnt come. Until I messsaged him, he said he lied because he wasnt ready. I CRIED a river at the airport. I have never thought he is such a liar.

Then, a few days later, he decided to come, but he did the same thing again. Instead of flying to my place, he flew to Japan but he lied to me that he was deported from my country because of his misbehavior and that someone robbed all his money. I was so worried for him that I flew 1000 km from my place to the airport where he was located. The guard at the airport said I might have been scammed but I scolded at him for that. He looked at me feeling sorry for me but I believed in my bf's shit.

But eventually...I figured it was another lie. Two lies in one week. It was too much for me to handle.

He said he wasnt ready and he was mentally disturbed after all our fights. He said he was afraid that our relationship would turn bitter if we continue to fight. I said okay, we need to meet to solve things out. But he still decided to fly back to the US.

I cried a lot. He did too. But i decided to give us a chance. Coz I love him. I love him so much that I decided to forgive.

\------------------------

But I doubt my decision was right. Because rightnow although I said I forgave hi, my trust for him is not 100% any longer. And I feel bitter for that....

Sometimes I cry and feel ashamed of myself. He said sorry many times and said he is going to therapy so he will be mentally ready to meet me in July, but I doubt I should meet him.

\------------------------

P.s: **He is legit**. Before getting into this relationship, I did a background check on him and everything he said was legit. He even showed me **his security number.**"

I went to a park today and sat there. literally every aspect of the entire city is shaped and controlled by humans. people no longer socialize anymore they just sit in their own little bubble of addictions and hyperreality. it would be epic if there was a figurative societal self annihilation- something entirely negating the self repetition of humans. we need a restart. 

depression is bullshit. i'm not depressed. fucking bullshit antidepressants. fucking bullshit familial structure literally built on control and domination. fucking forcing me to take the fucking happy (JK) pills that do jack shit. its a fucking impediment. lets fucking go. embrace the delirium of degenerate social and psychological chaos. not some bullshit psychosis, its cognitive freedom. 

fucking hell imma nope out of these degenerate cities. we live in a prison so imma fuck the prison in its very asshole till it goes to fuck itself. 

that feeling of personal connection is literally an illusory hallucination. it only exists if we think it exists. degenerate scum bags. maybe i'm fucking delusional or maybe everyone is delusional but some people have the same delusion. 

&amp;#x200B;

this isnt a crisis or anything its just an expression. 

i wrote a chord proggression today and im so fucking euphoric and dysphoric at the same time brains are fucking weird i guess. loneliness is a lie im fucking done with this bullshit fucking social system that doesnt fucking work at all anymore. people should fucking do whatever the fuck they want and not give a shit. thats what the fuck I;m going to do."

lonely,I just feel so isolated at this time in my life,"I just feel so isolated at this time in my life - I don't have a single friend in my life. I spend all of my free time by myself. I only interact with people at work, basically. I started at a new college after graduating from community college in winter, and left all my friends there and have failed to make any new friends. People give me advice after advice, but I just can't make friends. It's not easy for me. I'll also never be in a relationship because I'm gay, but that's beside the point. I think I'm destined to be alone. Every time I make a friend life pushes them away fr me. It's like the universe wants me to be alone."
lonely,Am I bound for loneliness?,"Am I bound for loneliness? - I feel lost and hopeless.

2 years ago, my first relationship ended because I did something stupid. If you’re curious, I didn’t cheat, but I did something creepy. About 2 weeks into our relationship, I created an instagram account pretending to be a stranger and asked her a bunch of questions that I was too afraid to ask myself. The questions I asked were often personal, so you can imagine how uncomfortable she felt.

I asked her these questions on-and-off for about a month or so, until I felt super guilty about it and deleted the account. We’d constantly joke about who the “stranger” really was, because she’d always screenshot the questions and send them to me. About a year later, she made another joke about how the “stranger” could be me, and I panicked and came clean right there and then. Understandingly, any trust she had in me went away, and she put our relationship on a break, ultimately leaving me.

I can’t tell you how much I loved that girls, and how devastating it was that I ruined everything we had because I was to weak and had to hide my curiosity behind a stupid Instagram account.

It’s taken me 2 years to get over what I did to her, and I still haven’t forgiven myself. I can’t think of any memories I had with her without feeling disgusted at myself.

Throughout the past 2 years, I haven’t really hit the dating scene, other than occasionally asking a girl out that I liked only to be rejected. It wasn’t until about 3 months ago that I tried starting a relationship with someone.

My friend introduced me to a girl who seemed genuinely interested in me, so I decided to ask her out. To my surprise, she said yes, which felt surreal given that the last girl to say yes was two years ago. The next two months I’d spend dating her made me forget everything about my past. It was a breath of fresh air coming from the two years of isolating myself into a state of depression, so it’d be an understatement to say I was happy again.

About 2 months of dating later, I send her a text asking if she wanted to wander the park with me that weekend, and I got no reply. Thinking she must’ve turned her phone off, I called her later that evening, but it went straight to voicemail. I called again the next morning with no response. I was beginning to think the worst had happened, so I asked my friend if he could check up on her, but he reported that everything was fine.

The next day I waited at the park, checking my phone every minute. Desperately, I hit up her Instagram to see if she was on that, only to see “user not found.” I didn’t fully recognize that she ghosted me until I checked snap, only to be blocked minutes after viewing and replying to her story.

Once again, I had been left, only this time I couldn’t figure out why. I had avoided everything I did wrong previously, and gave her as much space and respect possible. Was she not interested in me to begin with? Am I doing something wrong? I feel hopeless. 

It makes me feel like i’m being punished for what I did. Do I deserve another chance at love? Because I don’t feel like letting another person down.

Everyone tells me that “there’s someone for everyone.” My “someone” left me 2 years ago and I don’t think I’ll find anyone else again. Was she the only “one?” Why am I so stupid? Am I worthy?"

lonely,What if the world opened up more?,"What if the world opened up more? - The most surprising thing happened to this lonely girl. I met someone from another country, the usual online chat y’know. But instead of it dwindling away like it always does, they are visiting my country to spend time face to face.

They said “it’s not a problem to travel for friendship or love”. 

It was the openness that got me. Do those kind of people really exist? I’ve never met this kind of worldly thinking before. I’m used to the constant ghosting routine.

2 and a half weeks ago I made a new friend from an app, met up, had fun, went to his house a few times, always texted and called. Right now he hasn’t responded to my text in 4 days. I look at the app I met him on, and his account is deleted. I look at social media, and I’m blocked. My calls automatically went to voice mail, so I’m blocked there too.

Those are just two examples, but this has been happening to me for YEARS. It happened over 5 times last year. I didn’t do anything wrong at any point, and everything was going well. I’m starting to believe I will never have a long lasting friendship ever. 

I fucking hate getting my hopes up that someone might actually care about me just so I can get blocked and ghosted for NO REASON."

lonely,I slipped up and did a dumb thing: try to make a connection. It worked. Temporarily.,"I slipped up and did a dumb thing: try to make a connection. It worked. Temporarily. - Welcome to venting story time with a spinster! It’s a long one! Buckle up! 

To plainly put it, I sort of put myself out there and advertised my weirdness and it got a lot of attention. Mostly unwanted as I was instantly flooded with invitations to chat. Instant regret. I responded to maybe a third. Some lead to okay talks, others stopped immediately. Lol, us humans are strange, let me tell ya. After the overwhelming response, I was tired filtering through what could be decent conversations and what was straight up not what I was looking for. So I deleted the invites. I got back busy with work and put it out of my mind. Maybe 2 days later I got another invite and the opening was rather cute and idk…it Made me go”why not see where this goes?“ 

Long story short, it was like I was talking to myself in guy form. Nothing felt fake, or pressured and I felt like finally I could breathe and say if I found nothing else, I found a forever friend. Could this be BOYFRIEND MATERIAL?! Omg. Surely not….right? That’s a big title to give a person you haven’t known very long. (I didn’t get that far btw) But things felt too good. I fought through sleepy nights after work just to stay up a little longer to talk and it was always worth it. The flirting began. I was in the danger zone now. Flood gates opened so swiftly. Was it too soon? Probably, but he felt the same so we decided to continue slowly.

I lived in pure bliss for a while until one day I asked a question that should’ve been asked earlier on and basically it was on his preference body wise in a partner. You know the basic questions you ask when you’re getting to know someone. His answer made my heart drop into my actual ass. I wasn’t his type. How was this missed?! Where tf do we go from here?! Do we even go from here or is this it?! I didn’t want to lie to him, or be a catfish, so I told him the bad news explaining I’m not his type, providing proof and we maybe exchanged 3-5 short texts after that. Then nothing. He just suddenly ….disappeared. I never felt so abandoned this badly in all my life. I reached out one more time hours later just to see if I should leave I him alone, something was obviously wrong. He said no, he was just busy that day. But honestly I took that as yes. After a evening and night of waiting, I deleted him off my account, deleted his number the next day. I felt like in doing so first, I could lessen the blow of feeling so fkn rejected. I’d have a little control. 

He’s not blocked at all though even to this day. We went from starting and ending each day together to nothing and not a peep after the reveal. Neither of us have a huge social life (by choice) so I know it’s pure avoidance on his end. His job is laid back most of the time. It wouldn’t have normally taken so long for him to reply. Idk why this one hurt so badly. I wanna say it’s the rejection, don’t get me wrong that definitely left a mark. But I think really it was that the thought of us was dropped so fkn fast and left to rot by him. Like it never even happened. Like we weren’t just drooling over each other and amazed at how much we were alike.

How do you just forget someone you had so much in common, and I mean the stupidest little things with, so damn fast?! The plan was before even conversing with him, to get myself together to be healthier and feel more attractive. But boy does this inspire me that much more. Everyone is entitled to like what they like, unless it’s one of those things that’ll put you into prison. So I’m not mad at the fact that I just happened to be the main example of what was undesirable to him. But to be dropped and never spoken to again is really mentally screwing with my mind more than it has with any other bozo (I meant that nicely) that I’ve met. You don’t even care to say goodbye? No,”thanks for the boners, and the support?” Actually that might be what he regrets the most now that I’m thinking about it. Meanwhile, I bet he’s sleeping peacefully right now like a baby drooling, thumb in the mouth and all. I hate it. I don’t wish harm to him, I don’t hate him. I just wish he was more mature than his actions have displayed. 

It’s that last line that makes me relax a little and tell myself I’m better off. A smart guy, a guy with a real heart, wouldn’t do some shit so foul. It will not be so hard with who I’m meant for if I am meant for someone. Who am I kidding, I’m a fkn delight. But goddamn I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss him, miss how easy it was. Being so hopeful of having a future with someone. Waiting on that next text. Just having someone there. Now I’m just lonely af, worse off than before I made that fateful post. Because now I have to think of randomly how I just wasn’t enough. I go from being okay to not and I just wanna be back at my normal lonely self. Not lonely AND rejected. 

Unsubscribe me from these fkn feelings please. I’m so done. 

Don’t forget to smash that like button!

I was and still am a sucker for romance subplots/plots in cartoons and stuff. - Especially when I was a kid, wholesome relationship stuff was just something else. It's hard to describe with words. I haven't had the butterflies in my stomach feeling in forever, if that's what you call it.

lonely,It really hurts that I’ll probably never be able to date the very few men I ever crush on,"It really hurts that I’ll probably never be able to date the very few men I ever crush on - I rarely crush on people, but once I do I just can’t stop thinking about it. I’m a gay man, and I’ve only ever dated another guy once and it wasn’t really the greatest relationship. Now, I’m crushing on a classmate. I’ve never had the guts to talk to him, to text him, to friend him on any social platforms or follow him, and I’ve never dared to stare at him for too long. I wish he noticed me back, but I also don’t because I’m pretty sure he’s straight and unless I 100% know he’s not, I’m not talking to him. Everyday I look at his Instagram profile picture. I feel lonely, never having felt the embrace of someone else, or being looked at in a truly romantic way. I feel lonely knowing the very few men I feel interested in will never feel the same way back, and that I’ll never fully be able to feel safe being open about my sexuality, so I don’t tell people I’m gay and those who know, just know. I feel stupid not wanting to or not having the guts to talk to guys I like, simply because I don’t know their sexuality and don’t want to accidentally start a friendship with someone I have a crush on if I do speak to them. I want to be loved, I want to love someone, I want to be cuddled and seen as a special someone, I want to be thought of, but the closest I’ll ever get to that is hot showers at 4am"
lonely,Need to talk,Need to talk - I have codependency and abandonment issues and am very lonely and would like to talk to someone about that as I am having a hard time right now. I have some other mental issues as well and some of it will involve suicide so I just wanted to give a warning. Message me through chat please :)
lonely,Trigger warning (see flair),"Trigger warning (see flair) - I have attempted to talk two people out of suicide attempts. (separate times)

It worked once with a friend, but failed with an ex (she lived, thankfully). Her attempt was a result of how hopeless she felt in our relationship. I will keep that guilt for a very long time. I fear that it will happen with a girlfriend in the future. Or wife. 

One of my greatest fears is to date someone who would feel lonely while in a relationship with me (not meaning to offend the many people on this sub that feel that way- your feelings are valid). It's ironic, because I don't like to date women who have friends anymore, and haven't for several years now. I wish I could be enough for somebody (along with their own family, if that makes sense).

I feel really cursed. Probably not literally, but I can't completely stave away the 'magic thinking'. I help people in the short term, but I tend to leave a destructive wake. Whether or not there have been net-positives,.. I don't know. I really don't know. I just know that I'm fucked. There's no way that there's a true match for me (and vice versa). For various reasons.

I feel bad for saying this when I do get matches on a dating app, but I'll have you know that most matches are just an inferred 'I think you're kinda cute, but you're not stable enough to be a boyfriend,' from what I infer. No, not even an inference in all cases. And I think that even if I was, the same type of thing would happen.

I do get some people that might seem serious, but I just don't think that there's an actual match out there for me. I have already failed.

I'm the type of person who has a very rough time working on myself, and getting over grief. 

Am I supposed to feel hope, anymore? What I want isn't realistic, and who I am is insufficient and unpragmatic.

I really miss cuddling. I want to be the dominant partner to somebody. Like, the gentle but also rough kind of dominant partner. I really do, but I just, it doesn't make sense, really, if I can't be a member of society. And so often now, I just picture myself cuddling up on a woman rather than the other way around. I guess I feel extra vulnerable or something."

lonely,I hate this,"I hate this - 

        It has been many years since this feeling returned. Never in my life have I known an emotion so overwhelming and overpowering. Just the thought and presence of this emotion brings despair. Not happiness nor fear has such a tremendous effect on me. Nor either of them terrify me to the core. This emotion is loneliness and we have yet again been aquatinted. 

        Loneliness does not feel like an absence of an emotion. Even thought it literally is the absence of someone it does not feel like an emotion that is absent. This emotion does not need to be filled. It is the emotion that does the filling. It overflows over all and triumphs all.  I envy all who do not have to struggle over the fear of this emotions possible coming. I know the fear of it dwells in everyone. I have met it face to face today in the mirror. A horrible realization that I am without another. Nobody to spend my days, my hours, my minutes nor my seconds. Nobody to hold or talk to. It is just I. 

        I do not wish for someone to marry, or somebody to spend years with. Somebody to talk about my day or just a good morning or good night would do. I do not wish for extravagant wants. My wish is quite simple really. I wish to not be alone. 

        I had someone a bit ago. Somebody to message good morning and night to. Somebody to hold and smile to. Somebody to bear their burdens and be a helping hand. Someone who would listen and treat me with care. That someone is now a stranger again. And with the leave of that someone, someone new has walked into my life. It is someone I have known for years prior and someone that knows me inside out. We are well versed with each other but I dread its existence. It is loneliness and it has enveloped me. I tried to refute is grasp, I tried to turn away, blind myself, lie to myself. Only when I truly ponder on it do I realize… I am lonely."

She has had issues with self harm and I've stopped her on multiple occasions and he even said he doesn't care! What the fuck is wrong with me? Why does no one ever pick me!

lonely,Here me out,"Here me out - “I’ll never find anyone” 

“I accept that there is nobody for me”

Many of us are severely agonised because we can’t find irl relationships, but we’re also only interested in relationships that are local.

Whenever we connect online we always feel sad that the person doesn’t live near us.

So why aren’t we lonely people prepared to relocate?

Why must we call it quits when we can’t find anyone within our own zip code? What about the 7 billion other people that don’t live in your country?

When you think about it, by only focusing on our local area, we are drastically cutting our chances and without just cause. Millions of people relocate to find work, friends and love.

Most of us claim to have such bleak lives that there’s honestly little reason to stay where we are. We’re miserable to point of suicide, so isn’t moving worth it?

Not just moving, but meeting people who are willing to move to you as well

lonely,I Have Nobody.,I Have Nobody. - I (M17) have nobody to hang out with. I dropped out of school last year and got my ged so any friends I did have I dont talk to anymore. In late August of 2020 my only friends I had moved away and now I barely get to hang out with them. I live in a apartment complex full of kids that are alot younger than me so I don't go outside much to play. I go to work than go back home every weekday. I dont have a gf or anyone else I can talk to besides my 5 or so friends on my xbox and 2 or 3 friends on discord. Everyday I repeat the same thing over and over and its really boring. When my mom goes to work im usually just getting out of bed for work. When she gets home I get yelled at for the house not being which I dont understand why because I also work all day. The only fun I have is when every other week when I go to my dads house. I have recently had the urge to move out and go live with my dad but I cant because my will complain and it will only cause more issues on my end. Im at a loss in my life and it gets harder to go throughout the week.
lonely,sick and tired of feeling lonely,"sick and tired of feeling lonely - Im touch deprived its been so sooooo long since someone hugged me and showed me sincere unconditional love. I never had a special person and the longer im alone the more i think that its better but im just lying to myself honestly. Idk if this cld get worse ot not for now i can cope with it but idk wht will happen in the long run.
All my friends have someone i sometimes find myself out alone bcs each one of my friends has a person i also want that. I spent tonight and most of my nights honestly just listening to some of my friends problems with their significant other. Its draining me."

Even if we can vc on snap, I still just want to talk to someone."
lonely,How do you deal with not having a partner?,"How do you deal with not having a partner? - I’m what you’d probably call a “serial dater” - I just from relationship to relationship with very little time in between. I have friends and all, but I don’t like not having a partner. I’m just not very good at hookups, and I don’t like not having a person to be intimate and affectionate with. I was just broken up with about a month ago and have already cried over like two people, and my roommate keeps telling me I need to stop trying so hard to find someone.

lonely,What the fuck do I want at this point?,"What the fuck do I want at this point? - I know I swore off dating and promised myself I wouldn't try but I recently joined a dating app and surprisingly got I guess a lot of likes in a day. I'm talking 1.5k likes. I feel very unwanted so believe me, for a hot minute I thought I was *the shit*. 

It made me feel like crap though. It felt like they swiped by mistake or they only want to have quick sex. The latter being the reason for the most part really.  Or that men just swipe right on every woman's profile. I tried talking to match with some of them but there was just nothing. I feel emptier even. Like I was bound to never feel some sort of genuine connection.

I know it isn't the place to look for genuine connection but damn. The reality is just hitting me square in the face; I will never meet someone who'll get me."

lonely,Constantly being excluded,"Constantly being excluded - I went to a friend's birthday party a few days ago and they were talking about their upcoming trip to the Outer Banks, which I was not invited to. I told myself that I didn't care, especially considering that this isn't the first time something like this has happened, but I saw pictures they posted today and it really affected me. It's been so long since I've felt a sense of acceptance and belonging."
lonely,Another lonely person,"Another lonely person - I really don't have anything novel to add, and I'm not a danger to myself or others, but it's just been such a long time and I still feel so lonely.

I live in an area where I don't speak the language as well as I could; while most people speak English, they typically hold it against me that I'm American, so they don't give me a chance. There's other Americans in the area, but they're by and large from a completely different walk of life from me; I've been here with my parents who fit in a lot better, but for the last 3 years or so, I've really only had one friend in the area.

It just sucks. I'm an introvert, so of course that makes it harder to meet people, but I've pushed myself out of my comfort zone multiple times; I've tried going to events, to hobbies, I mean I work as a bartender. Meeting people isn't an issue, but no matter how casual and nonchalant I am, or how excited and outgoing and hard I try, people just seem to get bored with me and go back to their established groups. I can only take being left on read so many times and still keep trying; I put in so much effort just to have anyone to hang out with casually, and they always find someone else. I don't mean this solely romantically either, I just want friends in general.

I do have close-ish friends in a sense; I consider them my closest friends, though besides one or two, I know that isn't reciprocated. Besides the one friend in the area (who is also an ex, making things more awkward), everyone lives far away. As in, thousands of miles, $750+ plane ticket away; not something I can casually afford.

It's just kind of numbing. Like I said, I try and try, but since I was 16 (I'm now almost 22) I've barely had a chance to make and keep friends, let alone do anything teens or young adults do. I feel alone in my life and I feel like it's going to stay that way, because I'll always be the same weird kid I was in high school (I'm very likely undiagnosed as autistic, having done some self-reflection).

Whatever, like I said I have nothing of value to add here. I just feel like there's no space in the world where I fit, as anything more than a superficial Thing to help people with their problems. Almost every convo I have with anyone ends with them leaving me on read. If I want to talk to people, in person or through text, I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle where they couldn't care less if I'm around or not. Besides a very small number of people, nobody ever reaches out to initiate contact with me; and when I say never, I mean never, presumably because they have closer friend groups in there area.

It's just sad to see. I've gotten to the point where I feel like my only defense is acceptance and to move on and suck it up. I know people say ""you have to love yourself and be comfortable being alone first"", but I more or less do, and I am. I've been by myself mostly for years now, I'm pretty good at it; and it's hard to maintain self-confidence when, no matter how desireable I think I am, I'm clearly so easily disposable to others.

This is long so I'll stop. Like I said, I'm not a danger to myself or anything. I'm just lonely and I wish somebody would give me the time of day, and I could make some actual friends, who reach out to me because they want to, and who legitimately desire and enjoy my company. It's probably a pipe dream but I guess you never know.

Sorry this is so long, I just wanted to get it off my chest and hope maybe somebody will see it without thinking I'm an overly dramatic or emo asshole lol. I mean, I am, but I don't necessarily want people to think that. And for those of y'all already here, I hope you're all doing at least okay"

lonely,I'm tired,"I'm tired - I have autism, ADHD, and Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm also transsexual. These factors make it very difficult for me to exist around other people and it's exhausting and overwhelming to try. I've had very negative experiences in the past that make me feel today as though everyone I speak to has some sort of ulterior motive and/or wants to harm me for fun. It's been a few months since I've had a friend I could talk to consistently. It's been even longer, two years maybe, since I've had a friend I've felt I could fully trust. Therapy is not an option for me, nor are meds, mental health or transition-wise.

lonely,First post here. Feeling lonely after graduating college. Don't have many friends.,"First post here. Feeling lonely after graduating college. Don't have many friends. - Hi everyone.

I finished my time at my university about three weeks ago and everyone is pretty much gone for the summer. I'm currently enrolled in a Maymester class (which I hate) at a different university than mine. It's all online on zoom so even though there's \*some\* social interaction, there really isn't any. Anyways, this will be my last week of my maymester course. Then I say goodbye to education (until I go to law school - planning to work and take a year off before law school since I want to add some things to my resume like more work experience as well as needing a mental health break as I'm healing right now from a variety of things - engrossing myself in a job is a good distraction). 

I don't want to move back home. I feel sad and lonely.  I don't know. My college isn't far away from my parent's house (40 minute drive) so I can go home whenever, but it's so quiet. Going home also brings up a lot of childhood trauma or even recent trauma (not my parent's fault, I just hated who I became since I started college, fixed a lot of my issues but still healing). My neighborhood is quiet too. Typical suburb. At my apartment, I feel less lonely even when my roommates are gone because there's constantly cars honking outside, people my age living above me being loud and noisy, people in the lobby, living in a bigger city, etc.... anyways I will have to move out in a little over a month and I'm dreading moving back home. I'm trying to find a job but I'm also crippled with depression right now. Feelings of loneliness. I just want my mom to hug me. I just need someone to talk to. My friends have all moved away. I don't know how to make friends outside of school. I hope I make friends at the job I choose to work at (only for a year), but if my collagues are all a lot older than me, then I'm lonely again. Maybe I should've just gone straight to law school out of college but I needed a mental break. I've been in school for a longggg time now. 

I want to start running again but can't motivate myself to do so. Maybe I'll join a running club, and can make friends that way. As an emerging adult - I don't know what to do, how to make friends (or get a boyfriend for that matter), and I feel lost in space and time. I can't get over my ex. 

I just need a hug.

Sorry everything in this post is all over the place and not well organized, I'm just typing things as I feel them."
lonely,Hello here are my hobbies what are yours?,"Hello here are my hobbies what are yours? - Hello, looking to attempt to make an actual friend, I know being online friends doesn't hold a candle to having friends in person but at least we're learning how to, and how to not converse with each other.

Well at any rate I'm more of a geeky Individual, so naturally I enjoy messing around with tech but I also love watching anime, reading Manga/Manwa playing video games binging political YouTube videos etc.

I enjoy a good amount of genres of music, only genre I hate is Kpop 😎.
Star wars was always a big thing for me growing up and I fell in love with the expanded universe.
I'm more shy/nervous than most people than you'll meet but it's generally hard for people to be able to tell at times which may make them think I don't like them or something.
I like working out but usually only around those I'm comfortable with."

I’ve heard from my proper friend that they think I don’t put in the effort. I don’t make plans and I don’t often initiate conversation but when I do I get left on read after a couple of texts so I have no reason to continue initiating.

I don’t know how to make friends, if I knew I would, so I’m stuck with my main friend. She is in multiple other friend groups so recently I've been kinda set to the side and she isn't committing to plans and is frequently cancelling last minute. 

I don't know what to do. Hearing her talk about her friends makes me feel really lonely as I can’t relate."

Is it really just too much to ask to have something genuine? Am I not worthy of respect or even consideration? Maybe I’m just delusional in wanting to believe I am something when I’m actually nothing? I don’t know, but I can’t do this anymore. I try my best to be a positive and optimistic person, and I thought I was finally getting better but now it feels like I’m only seconds away from breaking down and giving up completely. All of my progress I’ve made over these last few months is disappearing faster than I ever could have imagined, and I’m petrified of what that means."

 i only really have one friend from school cause basically all of the kids in my year group get their personalities from tiktok but i do tend to find most kids my age pretty annoying. i wish i wasnt so negative, im a huge overthinker and im really critical on everything and most people i meet. i just really find it hard to fit in. I have a small group of friends but they are all around ages 17 and 18 so none of them are in my year group at school so that kinda sucks. I hate being in school because i dont want people in public to see me and since i dont interact with any of them so the only thing they have to judge me on is my looks. I hate how my school uniform fits on me, its pretty tight on the places i want to hide. I cant stand living like this, i feel so hideous all the time but i dont want to look like this. i always wear a lot of layes and its summer so now im constantly really warm aswell. I wish i could of just been born a normal person like my older brother. He's practically perfect and everyone loves him."
lonely,Fear of being alone…,"Fear of being alone… - Sort of a part 2 from a post I made previously so I’ll keep the backstory telling to a minimum 

I just picked up my belongings from my Ex’s house on Friday and she seemed so happy… She had some friends over while I was there and it was as if she never changed. She was laughing and it made me so happy to see her like this… but it wasn’t with me. I felt so selfish and alone, especially since I caused the break up. The immense guilt I feel plagues me everyday and haunts my dreams. I don’t feel good at all, and I fear loneliness. I fear it more than death itself and I’m scared I’ll be alone forever. She and I were good, like we fit well, but I wasn’t good enough, I messed up too much to recover and I hate myself for it. I hate this loneliness and I wish I could take every second of it back. 

Life totally sucks right now and I feel like there is not a single thing to be happy about. I can’t cry, yet I’m so scared and sad. What is wrong with me, why do I feel this way and then feel so guilty for feeling this way, like I don’t deserve anything.

I feel like I’m absolutely nothing to anyone. Why am I so afraid, why can’t I just be… different"

ive always wanted that friend group that seemingly everyone else my age has. and i know i’m not alone in feeling like this, that there are many out there who also want the same thing. but it’s just hard when everywhere i look it’s these awesome friend groups. when the individual friends i have all have their own high school groups. and they share stories and tell me all the cool and funny things that they can do as friends. and it’s interesting and fun and supportive and i’m thankful for the individual people who stick by me but i just really really wish so badly that i didn’t just have like 3 close friends, separate from each other, but that i could just be a normal teen with a normal social life. sorry i know none of this sounds coherent im just kind of in my feelings rn

and now it’s another summer. and i’m just kinda here again. all my individual friends have always seem to have better things to do in the summer, and im glad they do. i really hope they have lovely summers. but im just seeing so many people planning these awesome amazing things with their friends- or not even that, they’re just able to spend so much of their daily lives with each other, and it just makes me kind of sad that i won’t have that. 

i always tell myself that im gonna do so many things but i guess ive always envisioned me not doing most of them alone? i don’t know but i do know that im just gonna be lying in bed for so many days, blinds drawn, scrolling though my phone wishing that i was literally anyone else. i hate myself, i hate my body, i hate my capabilities/lack thereof. so i guess i’ll have nothing but this solitude to keep me thinking more about how much i hate myself and the fact that i’m never someone who people like to be around. i know it’s not their fault, i’m trying to be more outgoing and i do like meeting new people, but everyone already seems to have their groups.

i’m sorry aha thank you if you read this through. so much of this is like unintelligible i’m just trying to get some of my thoughts out before i devolve again haha"

Ever since COVID-19; travelling or irl hanging out has been a very tricky thing. Isolation has not helped either. With the current state of affairs. I work. Go home. Work. Home... A repetitive cycle in which I find myself closing off from.the world. My work colleagues are mostly younger females and we dont habe much to relate to. 

At some point I wanted to meet someone of the opposite gender online. Connect, get acquainted and see if things blossom into an online friendship for starters.

Now I just feel like deleting my account and forgetting everything.

lonely,Maladaptive daydreaming.,"Maladaptive daydreaming. - I daydream to cope with my daily loneliness. I have no family, no friends, no partner. My life is barren and it started eating away at me so I delved deeper into my maladaptive daydreaming because everything I'd tried hadn't worked. Groups, trying to form connections, trying to be more social, starting up conversations. No one wants anything to do with me, so daydreaming it is.

But even in my daydreams I'm unhappy. I've never experienced affection and care, so how can I daydream about it? There's no substance there. I'll imagine a family that loves me, but what does love look like in real life? I have no idea. Or if I imagine being a part of a family I know in real life, I'll just get jealous or imagine the situation falling apart. I'll imagine a loving partner, but reality comes tumbling in, and reminds me no one wants me as I am.

I was seeing every other person living drastically different lives than myself, all of them had someone to love and care for. Because of a birth condition I have called cloacal exstrophy, as far as I know, I will never have children, or have normal sexual encounters. I've always known that I was very different from others, both physically and mentally, and I've known from a very young age that my life will be excruciatingly lonely. My two friends that I referred to earlier, are in a relationship with eachother, and I'm very happy that they're happy, and they are the best friends I could have ever asked for, but it's truly hard to watch them be all over each other all the time. I know that I'm young, and I'm only just getting my life started, but Jesus fucking Christ is it painful to watch everyone live normal lives. I have love in my life, none romantic at all though. I know that I must be patient, and that true intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion. Till I meet that person who decides that I'm worth their time and energy, I will be typing out my thoughts and I'll either post them here, or keep them to myself. I love every person who took the time to read my somewhat incoherent thoughts. I am in no way suicidal, nor do I even wish that I had any other life. I will keep moving forward and i will keep experiencing all that reality has to offer me, and I know that when I do meet someone, the pain and loneliness I'm feeling now will make the happiness and pleasure that much more invigorating. Absolutely never stop living or breathing, everything happens for the betterment of yourself. Love y'all :)"
lonely,I feel so alone and hopeless,"I feel so alone and hopeless - I always had friends,  lots of them but I always felt like the outsider in the group .  I felt alone for as long as I can remember and I can't seem to connect with anyone  and  find myself acting like a completely  different person around people. I guess I did  it because the thought of being alone scared me and I knew no one would want to be friends with the real me . I felt  pathetic and  hated myself for acting like that just to keep a bunch of fake assholes who  probably don't give a shit about me .  I've been struggling with mental health issues for most of my life but it got really  bad  these past few months  and  three  of my ""friends"" noticed and encouraged me to open up to them . I was hesitant at first  but I eventually did because I have no one else to talk to about this stuff  besides my therapist.  A week after I opened up to them and shared my most vulnerable side with them,  I noticed that they  started acting weird with me and I even heard one saying I just want attention and have no right to be depressed. I  regret opening up to them , I feel like such a stupid fool for trusting  them and thinking that they might care a but about me . After a few weeks of noticing  a big  change in their behavior towards  me , I decided  it's not worth being friends with people like that  and now I'm completely alone and kind of regret cutting them all out of my life .  I wish I was okay being alone , it would make life so much easier ."
lonely,[17M] Don't have any friends ? Then order one now for free,"[17M] Don't have any friends ? Then order one now for free - Hello/ Salut/ ادب/ היי/ أهلاً

Chintu : Hmm so you need friends, or have shitty friends then you have come to the right place, order your new friend now and get 5 years of luck for free. Now my partner mintu will tell about the friend you are gonna get 

Mintu: well so the friend you are gonna get is 17 years old and it's name is Humai. Well he's funny ( maybe not )

He likes to learn languages, well he knows Hindi and Urdu but he wanna start reading novels and it's hard, like really compared to English. He will start off with some short stories and all. He started learning Norwegian, French and Farsi. تم دیوانے ہے اور کچھ نہیں یارو( it's not farsi, it's urdu ) 

You can rant about anything, he can listen to it and give shitty advice 

Well he share lame memes tooo

He likes to talk about religions even though he knows lil about religions. Basically, he knows about abrahamic faiths more compared to other religions

He is preparing for the SAT and might prepare for APs like self study, if you have advice on college, majors and stuff help this poor guy. He's 17 and still has no idea what he wants to be 

He likes to do origami, Sketching he recently started doing both of them. So, he sucks a lot in it. I wanna have some more cool hobbies. Suggest some hobbies for me 

He might learn to cook as well, it's cool tbh, well he wants to move to usa. So, just wanted to be independent I guess but is not independent. Every thing is done by his mum from washing clothes to cooking

He reads novels, he tried reading Hindi and Urdu novels but heck it's hard, I think he might wanna improve it or start off reading something simple before moving on to something complex. He did read some English novels though. He has started a lil time ago. So, he didn't read many. He will be having holidays. So, he will be on a reading spree. You can suggest some 

He likes to listen songs and podcasts, his taste is real stupid, it goes from pop to classic in no time. He listend hindi-urdu, punjabi, farsi, hebrew songs a lot 

He likes to watch movies and series. So suggest some, rn i am watching 2 broke girls and American dad ( he even forgot the name) 

Well if you found him interesting then message him"
lonely,Venting,"Venting - I don't understand it. I chatted with multiple lonely people here that wanted to chat yet multiple of them ghosted me right after the first few messages. Many people here talk about how they want some contact with anyone yet when you are offered one you just disappear. I don't know if it's me sabotaging every single chat I ever have or what is going on but I'm tired of it.

Even when I manage to find somebody I have something in common with and chat for a few days they stop replying after some time. 

Nobody ever writes the first message. People tell me that they like talking to me yet it's always me who has to do the first move. That makes me feel unwanted and like a burden.

When I found this community I was happy because I thought people here lack human contact same like me and will like to chat with somebody. Most of the people I talked to so far proved me otherwise. 

Feels like people here are not lonely. Many of you have friends, family, and partners. How can you be lonely? I know one can feel lonely even surrounded by people but it's weird hearing how you plan to do this and that with somebody close to you while also claiming to be lonely.

I'm just so pissed at the world and people. It seems like everybody gets a slice of the pie, just not me. I do things, I ask for the pie yet I still can't get it. 

Yes, I'm a disturbed person. Fucked up person. I have opinions that are not popular today. But hell, I just want somebody to love too."

I could give her a massage if she likes, I'm not professionally trained as such so nothing advanced but I'm decent at shoulder/back or I guess feet. I get foot cramps occasionally so self-massage to help. I want to be there for her, support her (not that I wish for bad things), care for her."

I have “friends” but most of them are either superficial acquaintances and don’t even check up on me. I don’t have a romantic partner and I often get left on delivered when reaching out to others. Perhaps it may have to do with my overall evasive personality, but that’s out of the scope of what I want to talk about. I’m still in the process of coping with loneliness and don’t get me wrong like a lot of y’all my inner-self craves a romantic partner and friends that genuinely care about me. But it’s not reality. Complaining and ranting about your desires, whether they’re as essential as normal human interactions isn’t going to manifest it into your life. I understand many of you see the whole “just focus on yourself” motto as cringe and not solving the problem, I want to let you know loneliness is a _symptom_ not the _root problem_ . To solve the root problem (which will relieve the symptoms) you must reflect introspectively and study your past, that has molded you into the person you are today. It is a tediously long and daunting task that may takes years to fully solve, but once you unearth the solution you will no longer be lonely. Each person has their own unique problems and the ability to solve them with patience, gratitude and a bit of perseverance. In no way shape org or am I saying it’s easy, but it didn’t impossible. 

TL;DR (I still encourage you to read the post) loneliness is a symptom of a root problem that is discrete to each individual. To solve the root issue you must look forth introspectively, study your past and dissect it to understand what has caused you to be the way you are."

Cant make new friends either because I’m very socially inept (thank you social anxiety) and introverted so I’m screwed there.

lonely,This World Is Hell,"This World Is Hell - I've reached the bottom, or so I think until I drop further somehow. I'm 24(M) my life used to be tolerable but in the past 4 years I've lost the only person that truly cared for me. My gf of 8+ years left me for one of my old friends. My two brothers no longer try and get in contact with me and my parents should not have had children to say the least. I don't have any friends to turn to either, they all stopped talking to me. I used to be outgoing and fun until depression hit me so I assume that's why no one talks to me anymore. Then came the booze and now I'm an alcoholic. I've been crushed again and again and now I'm all alone to deal with it by myself. Years of suffering and the only thing I can think now is why continue, why put myself through so many more years of this. I don't have it in me to try and date again or make friends. I just don't think this world is for me, something out there doesn't like me. If anyone ends up reading this I'm sorry for the rant I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't have anyone to turn to besides Reddit I guess. I'm not even sure I want anyone to turn to. Every person I've ever met in this world has let me down.

Anyhow, I desperately plead that anyone on here who needs or even wants someone else to talk to simply reaches out to me. You will find a place of zero judgement (we ALL have things we are ashamed of), and you will find that I will try my best to be there for you no matter what’s going on. I know what some of you are feeling like, so I know you need someone, just like I do.  

Don’t be nervous, we can start off any way you’d like, hell send me a funny picture and that’ll break the ice!

lonely,I have accepted that I will most likely not have someoen to truely connect with.,"I have accepted that I will most likely not have someoen to truely connect with. - So a year or so ago I made the choice that I don't want to involve myself with someone because I know I would make a terrible partner for someone, my flaws vastly out weigh any pros I have, and no I don't think time would improve me since no matter what I do I just go right back to where I started in everything in life, through no one elses fault but my own.

Also on a deeper level; I just have no desire to live. No I don't mean in the sense that I want to die but I just have no desire to live, I have no goals or longterm aspirations, I don't have any dreams for myself. I don't look to the future in anything but a negative view. Those I would love deserve more than a souless dead thing that has long since succumbed to apathy and hopelessness. Everytime I try to improve my self whether it be in employment or education it never matters, the most recent occasion only lasted a few months then was left with injury to my legs that isn't going to go away. 

Still I am glad to have the friends I do who certainly help keep the lonliness at bay, honestly if I didn't have them I don't know where I would be. Thanks for listening to me just say somethings I needed to."

I used to be content on my own but it's getting harder to be alone and feel like there will never be anyone who finds you meaningful like you would find them.
It becomes a downward spiral when you're already desperate because you're so lonely but people pull away from people who seem desperate or eager. It feels like no matter what, you can't really pull yourself up from this vat of oil, and it's hard to find the right people in this huge sea.
You feel thrown away and you feel miserable with all these feelings bubbling inside. All I can do is hope that one day I get lucky, although it is really hard to stay hopeful. I'm in a constant mental battle with myself and it's wearing me down."

I used to have a friend group like that in high school but we all drifted after graduation. It makes me so lonely seeing everyone have this stable group of friends they can talk/do stuff with. I’ve been trying to make new friends at college but that’s hard too because I feel like I’m a really friendly person and I don’t know what people’s boundaries are for “too friendly”. Like if I wanted to ask a new friend to try this new food place with me, would it be weird? And then I overthink and never do it because of fear of rejection. 

I just want even a couple of friends who I connect with and who make time to catch up with me (as the friends I have now are all busy with their own lives which is completely fair but they seem to make time for others).

Hello &amp; good (early &amp; bright) morning from the golden state! I got yo way too early for a Sunday and here I am enjoying a delicious cup of Italian coffee and watching the last round of the EPL games today! I got on here and I see the same old, boring and predictable posts and I’m like…. Yeah, making friends on Reddit has been everything but a success, at least for me! I don’t know, I might just use some good tips and pointers before I leave this approach alone. Most conversations either start up really strong, peak right around 5 mins in, then straight downhill from there! Whatever happened to trying, and having genuine interest in talking and getting to know people…? Oh, right, we got super lazy thanks to the internet and all these crazy social media outlets! My least fav online encounters have been with lazy ppl, can barely talk, text and mostly think either the world revolves around them or every guy online is out there after their pants! I got some news for you little sunshine, get over it…. I can careless about your goodies… I’d rather have a genuine, organic and engaging conversation with someone with high intellect, intelligent, witty, some sense of humor and really easy to talk to! Now, these expectations seem too unrealistic around here…. So before I give up, I’d love to hear from you about your experiences and creatives ways to making new friends on here. 
Before you hit me with the conversation killer line: “ASL”, I’m from the golden state, a male, 6’1” tall, black hair, greenish eyes, naturally tanned skin, multilingual and handsome &amp; east on the eyes (humbly). 
I’m gonna be super realistic, so you are a female, with interests other than memes, Pokémon, anime and Pc/video games then I’d love to talk about anything and everything!

lonely,likely lost a friend of mine after i reached out to a friend of hers who blocked her during we talked,"likely lost a friend of mine after i reached out to a friend of hers who blocked her during we talked - I've been utterly bothered by this and I can't share it

A friend said they went through things and needed space because of it. I said it's fine, hoped for the best and only sent them one message throughout hoping for the best. Week later they removed me as a friend, reason being they still needs space and did not want to talk and then blocked me a bit later, they kept me elsewhere.

month later I decided to hit up a friend of them about my friend because i was just really worried about my friend and all, let's say that's B, my friend is A. I did hit up my friend but I can't tell if they saw it or not. I knew B a bit from a server back then.

B said they weren't so close with A as they used to be, they had a relationship until few months ago which went dirty according to her, yet they stayed friends. But they still at least talked. But as our conversation went on, when I explained my situation and why I hit her up, I felt B was kinda unhappy about the friendship with A. B felt A changed, and they also didn't really see each other in person anymore. But B was happy though for A. I guess B never was able to talk about this since she kept saying stuff related to their friendship.

Point is, suddenly B said they blocked A. Asking why, they didn't feel any friendship between them anymore. I said at least to talk it out to A but B saw no point. A heard we talked and became mad at me, presumably I ruined that friendship and/or for reaching out, basically. Even though it's a misunderstanding and miscommunication as well. My friend reacted like being angry at a headline but not reading the article. 

My friend does not want to talk about it and is just mad at me, I feel insanely guilty about all this even though I had no ill intend at all and just did reach out B because I was worried and missed A. I did not convince B either to quit being friends or even mention it, I would never try to sabotage friendships. It's their issues, I know. But I feel I scratched open a wound and ruined a friendship. I've been crying a lot and just blame myself for it all, there's so much pain right now and loneliness, I feel again I hurt someone. I don't know what to do other than at least try to talk to my friend about it (she didn't block me elsewhere after that, even) or at least ask the other friend clear things up between them, I guess some time is needed to cool off. But even then, I really don't know anymore."

I’ve felt so shit lately even tho this month has been the best month ever. I’ve turned 18, had my graduation and aced a job interview.

But I feel like I have no one. I really realised this at my grad, where none of my like 3 friends wanted to go out. Everyone else in my year went out with friends after and had fun. While I had no one and went out with my parents. When I went out with my mother she was almost angry at me and insulted me for not meeting anyone in the last 5 years of school to go out with.This ruined the night for me. This really affected me a lot as it was coming from my own mother who has never said anything like this to me before. I’ve feeling a bit depressed since the start of the year, but since my mother insulted me I feel that was the final nail in the coffin. I honestly don’t feel like talking to my parents and I just feel I want to stay at home all day and cry. I finish school in less than a week and I’ll be finishing with less people than I started which is making me super jealous of everyone around me. I have problems making friends and never really had any and I blame my parents for sending me to a tiny country school with none and I think this is the cause of my terrible social skills as I only interacted with the same 10 people every day back then. 

Im very sorry about the rant and if it feels like I jumped from different topics. I just have had no one to talk about this with and here seemed like a OK place to talk about it. Thanks for reading if you made it this far !"

I can’t let anyone know that I feel alone all the time. Im afraid of ppl finding out that I feel depressed/empty. They’ll just think im weak, but it’s hard to hide.

lonely,I’m sad,"I’m sad - My 29th birthday is this weekend. I always get sad around my birthday because I never do anything and I have no friends. It’s just me and my husband (and my parents obvi) and we have a terrible marriage. We both don’t want to be together, but he won’t leave because he needs me for a green card and I won’t leave because I’m not working right now because we have 2 dogs with special needs that prevent me from working so I stay because I can’t afford to leave. This birthday is kind of important to me because it’s my last one in my 20s. It makes me reflect on my life and how pathetic I am and what a loser I’ve continued to be because I have nothing to show for the past 29 years. 

My parents decided to take a week long vacation so I have to watch their 4 dogs and I’ll be stuck at home as usual so even if I had plans I would t be able to follow through. 29 years, no degree, no money, no job, no kids (I wanted kids), shitty marriage, no friends. I’ve also recently become a functioning alcoholic; I drink every day usually start at 11 am because why not? If I’m gonna be depressed and alone might as well drink and make myself feel a little better. 

I’ve also suffered from mental health issues my whole life. When I was in high school I always thought about when I was 18 I’d finally get the help I needed because my parents didn’t believe that mental health was real and always refused to take me to see someone. But when I was 18 they removed me from their health insurance and I didn’t have the means to go get help. When I was 21 I finally got insurance and went to see someone. They diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and loaded me up with pills until a month later they stopped accepting my insurance and visits alone were $200 every other week and at the time I couldn’t afford it so I stopped going. Looking back I think I was misdiagnosed anyway because if I truly was bipolar and not on meds I’d probably be psychotic. 


Just wanted somewhere to vent because I again I don’t have friends or any kind of emotional support system. I know I’m the only one who can change my life and I’m sitting here having a pitty party instead of doing something about it, but it’s been 29 years of this and I just don’t see the point in doing anything about it now. For what? Through all of my life’s relationships I’ve never felt a real connection with anyone (friends or boyfriends) I just didn’t want to be alone. Sometimes I think maybe there something wrong with me like maybe I’m not capable of having real deep connections."

lonely,"Just Venting, though I know this feeling is very familiar here.","Just Venting, though I know this feeling is very familiar here. - I created this throwaway account to write here since my original account can be seen by my friends.

I'm just 20 and honestly, sometimes the burden of feelings becomes a bit too much. When I read some of the posts here I see people struggling with many kinds of problems be it physical or psychological. And I understand. I understand the pain and numbness people are experiencing; not because I particularly went through similar stuff but I just can. 

For the past 7-8 months, I've been feeling more numb everyday. I still think it is not depression but something is definitely off. I feel distant from my family and friends. I usually find myself thinking if I am meant to live all my life alone or not. The thing is, I am not the guy who gets too close with people. No matter how close I am with someone, I don't tell my problems most of the time. Ironically, I know I am not alone because sometimes I browse this subreddit and see people who are experiencing similar feelings. 

For the last few years, maybe to be more exact since I was 14, my life pretty much became monotonous. Even though right now I am in college, I just go to the classes and return home or I sit with one or two people for like an hour. I do not participate in any events, I do not join any student clubs. I return to home and do the assignments and sleep. In my personal life, sometimes I get invited to go out with my friends but even when I'm going I want to be home. I feel like I don't have the energy to talk and entertain people. I just want to sit down and stay like that for hours.

Recently, I wanted to break the cycle. I know its cliche but I met a girl and I liked her. I don't know what happened, I just know that some things had to change and I wanted to do something about it. Well, I know it was a mistake since no girl ever liked me before, I was always the platonic guy crushing over a girl for some time and get rejected after first try. Nevertheless, knowing the result from the beginning, I let myself to like her. I just wanted to feel something, care about something and feel alive. I wanted to escape from the monotonous life I've been living for the past few years. I wanted to hold a hand and feel my heartbeat rising up. I wanted to go beautiful places and just sit there in silence without being awkward. I wanted to do things and have fun and most of all, I just wanted to be hugged. 

If you read until here, you can obviously guess the result. She is not interested in me. Well, like I said, I was expecting this result and do not get me wrong, I am not angry to her or anything; I just feel sad and more numb than yesterday. I know that to break the cycle I can do other things such as trying to find a new hobby or starting to exercise etc. but I can not do most of them right now due to financial issues and mental exhaustion.

Honestly, I don't know what will happen to me. My country, socially and economically, is in shambles. I was in love with my major but since last year I hate it. I don't know if I can ever get a job. I am slowly distancing myself from my family and friends. I can't get in a relationship and commit myself to someone. I know you guys also sometimes feel like this. I just want to say you are not alone. Although this is a sub meant for lonely people and as I am writing these lines I feel very lonely, I know this post will at least reach some of you people and maybe they will say 'yeah, I also feel like that and I am not alone'. 

I hope people reading this will get the beautiful and happy life they deserve."

lonely,I keep telling myself it’ll get better but I’m starting to think it won’t.,"I keep telling myself it’ll get better but I’m starting to think it won’t. - So I’m 17 years old and my mother recently got diagnosed with cancer, life has just been downhill since there. She’s a single parent and we’ve been struggling financially, she had to sell our car. I don’t think I’ve felt happiness since September 2020. I only have two friends, they recently have gotten into relationships with girls and I’m very happy for them but part of me wishes I had that too. I have really bad social anxiety which stops me from talking to new people.

I hate that I’m drowning in this loneliness, I’ve never experienced love before and I’ve never been anyone’s favourite person. I’d give so much just to take away the feeling that no one’s on my side, I just wish I could stop feeling loneliness for once. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, this won’t change anything except at least maybe one random stranger will hear my problems, rather than me bottling it up like I usually do.

I just wanna say if anyone reading this is going through the same stuff as I am, just be patient - you gotta stay strong for your loved one because you might be the one very thing that’s keeping them going."

 The greatest thing I have in my life right now is my music and my books because that's the only thing that doesn't feel fake. There's just something fundamentally fucking broken with me and there's no way I'll ever find love and I've made peace with that but I just really wish people could be fucking honest with me and tell me I'm a piece of shit. Once again, I don't plan on killing myself so I'd really appreciate it if this wasn't reported to the reddit bot but yeah I truly hate myself and I need someone to be real with me and call me pathetic or something."

Doing online college, haven’t been out to eat/ inside public places in a couple of years, barely see family, only see my one friend about twice a year, at most. The thing is, I’m super introverted so it doesn’t bother me that much. But then again, I have this crippling fear that my life is wasting away and the fact that I’m living the best years of my life in isolation. Another fun fact about me lmfaoo: I’ve never been on a date nor have I ever held hands w a guy or what have u. So that’s pretty fucking embarrassing at my age and I feel like I’m just wasting away the best yrs of my life I guess AHH. So yeah!! Just wanted to rant I guess. I haven’t really had anyone to talk to and I’ve actually never verbalized this concern to anyone other than my mom.

I was never super popular. I mean, I‘m normal I guess. I do have a lot of friends. But not necessarily close ones, or at least not people I feel comfortable enough sharing private stuff with. I only have one best friend whom I‘ve known for 9 years now, and as he‘s not really a guy to be comfortable enough with his own emotions, I didn‘t even share too much private stuff with him. But at least, I had a best friend to hang out with. I guess now that that girl is flirting with him and inviting him to things (something painful is that I actually talk more to that girl because Daniel can be kind of antisocial and mean) he doesn‘t have time anymore. He‘s also gotten all mysterious. 

Well, I guess it is what it is."

Of course, if I had a woman that wanted that, I wouldn't have love.

I wake up alone, I spend my day alone, and go to sleep alone. Very unrelatable, I'm sure. Honestly it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of a boring world, but there's no exception. It's always like that. It feels like whatever I do in my day is wrong because it always starts and ends the same. The issue is like an iceberg because it underlines my entire life. Its REALLY pathetic. I can pinpoint the exact times my physiological need to just squeeze someone kicks in throughout the day so I don't even get to ignore it.

But I have never been someone who hides his personality to be cool to girls. I know a lot of people who see girls as a score situation. One person even showed a lot of pictures kissing with girls just to prove he did it. But they are all happy with their lives and despite their situations, most of them have girlfriends.

I got ghosted out of nowhere, have been mocked for complimenting them and I sometimes ghosted some people to test them if they would text me.It was not on purpose to ghost them but I just lost some good opportunities who were open to have relationships with me.

I know those two things are impossible to me to find but I would take someone who treats me like a person. That's all I want. Someone to look at me like a person and treat me like a person. Instead I'm treated as invisible or if I am visible, I'm a monster. Either way, I'm inferior to regular people and they treat me like both. I want to go out for coffee and be looked at as a person.

Today before my D&amp;D session I(yes, I'm an old nerd) I went to grab the mail and the only thing there was a large envelope addressed to me.  It was from Amazon and I hadn't ordered anything.  The contents felt small through the envelope.  I asked my sister if she accidentally put my name on something she bought and she said no.  I opened it up and it was a brand new set of dice from one of my sisters friends who she knew waaaay back when I was first born.  It was so unexpected and the timing was almost eerie.

I'm kind of a doomer, but not in the sense that I spent the night drinking myself to sleep and crying for her or the things that have happened to me. I just don't care too much anymore. 

Since I discovered my newfound love for my own company I've come a long way. I returned to college, got my degree and now I'm in law school. I enjoy it a lot. It isn't perfect but I can deal with it so far. But the thing is that my life is kinda boring. I think of people who hangout with their ""friends"" and for brief moments I say ""I kinda want that"". But then I backtrack 'cause most of the time people are fake af. I enjoy being a loner. It also creates this ""mystique"" around you that people wonder what you do or don't. Maybe that's just me attention whoring 🤭"
lonely,I feel selfish sometimes because I am tired of having to “take care” of my sibling.,"I feel selfish sometimes because I am tired of having to “take care” of my sibling. - Venting 

This is kind of sad and if you can’t handle that right now move on from this post. My sibling has always been a favorite in my family (they are funny, quiet) but they also are the most troublesome. They act out and cause worry and many times my parents vent about it to me (I’m the younger sibling). They only ever seem to talk about my sibling and accept them for who they are. As I grew older my sibling became more depressed and angry. And with that came self harm and suicide attempts (or the threat of suicide). Each of these things becoming more frequent whenever something has built up with them over time. And with these attempts on their life, I’ve always had to be there to talk them out of it and give comfort because my parents are never able to properly do so. My parents call me or wake me up whenever their child has gone off into the night with a lack of communication (they ignore everyone’s calls or texts).  I love my sibling, but I sometimes stay up at night thinking how tired I am of this cycle. I feel selfish. I have my own struggles mentally and to carry on those as well really adds a load, but I can’t let my sibling drown in their own sorrow. And I certainly couldn’t handle it if they died and somehow it could have been prevented. At the same time though it puts me back in this mental state that no one really cares about how I feel about dealing with so much for years (of course there is worse stuff to deal with), but I feel like I had to grow up emotionally faster than most. I don’t know maybe I’m just being weird. What are y’all’s thoughts?"

i also feel like. this is kinda awkward for me to say ngl but i feel like my longing for a bf prevents me from making friends online because whenever i try that’s what’s on my mind. not to sound weird. i’m asexual and demiromantic or greyromantic. which only makes this worse because i feel like sex is so important to so many guys and no one will want me after they know i’m ace. 

i just wanna be able to grow w someone that i actually trust and i feel like a simple friendship won’t be enough, i don’t know. but i do want more friends. so conflicting.

i come home from school then lay in bed and go though a combination of unbearable boredom and loneliness. no one to talk to, no will or motivation to do things i enjoy. 

such a great way to spend my teenage years right. advice would be cool. you can dm me if you’d like and you’re around 17 :). don’t look at my account being created a couple minutes ago i don’t need anyone ik finding this LMAO

if you care at all, i have a dog, i play soccer, and all my other hobbies change somewhat frequently but right now i really love baking and crocheting :) have a nice day ty for reading &lt;3"

lonely,Married and Lonely,"Married and Lonely - We’ve been together for almost 7yrs. To this day I feel he settled for me because he was getting older, wanted kids and I was there and so eager to love him. I can count on 2 hands the amount of times he has told me I am pretty/beautiful in the past 7yrs. He didn’t even tell me that on our wedding day. He doesn’t hug me, or kiss me unless he is trying to initiate sex and gets he’s upset when I mention that he only shows affection when he wants sex. He doesn’t ask about my day, and when I do share he just says, “okay” while looking at his phone until I eventually stop talking. When my uncle passed I sat in a chair and cried and he never once hugged me or attempted to console me. Then today I found underwear in our laundry that do not belong to me (wrong size). I can’t turn to anyone to talk about it and I feel so alone in my marriage and in my life. And while I have always said I would never stand for cheating I don’t actually think I can leave which I should do anyways even without the cheating.I keep thinking back to my first love and how I told myself that if he had treated me so well and was not In love with me then the man who truly loved me would treat me even better. Turned out I was wrong."
lonely,I feel like a loser,"I feel like a loser - I'm 22 years old and I don't have a job, that makes me feel so terrible because my mom gives me money and I feel bad for spending her money. I've tried almost everything to get some cash but it's not working. I've tried to have my own business but they fail or they aren't affordable. I submitted my resume to several jobs but they just ""call me later"" (obviously, they never call). I even tried to get money by ""selling content"" (like nudes and hot calls) but I didn't get enough money and it made me feel ashamed. 

I  have a lot of problems at home so now I'm renting in another state because of college but it's more expensive than staying at home. But if I stay at home  my stress level will just increase and I'll feel worst.

By the way I've been coping with anxiety and depression since I was 15. I used to do self harm but I tried to be sober (it's been like 10, months or maybe a year since I last self harmed). I've been seeking like 5 therapist but now I'm tired and I don't want to have therapy anymore. Even though I had some progress, I feel like it's useless and it's always the same shit.

So I replaced self harm with another things like alcohol, marijuana and medicine. Don't worry, I don't do this often, just when I feel very bad  I tend to drink or get a little high. Unfortunately, this made me take bad decisions, like stealing my grandma's Clonazepam and taking the whole bottle. She doesn't know but now she need it and I feel so bad for it.

Sometimes I feel like I need to be intoxicated to forget about my problems and if I can't get intoxicated I just replace that with physical pleasure like having a lot of sex or masturbating just to feel relaxed.

By the way my social life is a mess. I don't have any friends at college, and my only three friends are miles away and they barely talk to me so I feel so fucking lonely. I have a boyfriend but I don't want to depend on him but I feel like I'm already codependent because he's the one who's always there for me and if he's not I feel sad.

Conclusion : I'm a broke ass alcoholic drug addict and codependent loser."

lonely,I feel like I'm no one's main friend,"I feel like I'm no one's main friend - I used to have a close friend group in middle-high school, and we basically did everything together. In high school all my friends starting drifting away. Two of them formed a new group, one formed a different group, and one joined his church group. I had two left who we were all mutually our closest friends. But one stopped talking much due to personal issues and now (my college freshman year just ended) the last one is in a phase where he prefers to not talk to friends. I still keep in touch with all of them (except the last, even though i try), but now I'm no one's main friend. That is, no one takes initiative to talk to me and even when i take initiative, they often take hours to respond. Im certain theres no hidden grudges, its just that they either have gifriends, ""better"" friends, or don't talk often in general. I basically only made one friend that wasnt through mutuals in college. This has left me feeling lonely (for quite a while now, even in high school), especially when I'm reminded that other people receive texts or calls they didn't initiate. I've definitely struggled with shyness and social skills. This post is something I'd usually post on my private Snapchat story but whenever i do, despite responses, nothing changes. Also i don't want people changing their interactions with me out of pity. I want people who like me for me. Id see a therapist but my friends say they're not very helpful, just someone you can rant to. Also they cost money. I just came back from college, I'm laying in bed, i think i forgot my stuffed animal back there (who i wouldve cuddled right now to cope), this is just something i had to get off my chest."
lonely,My suicide attempt | Go find love,"My suicide attempt | Go find love - I tried to end the pain. 

Or the pain ended me, I don’t know.

This is my second time writing here. I’m not writing for attention. I’m writing to get it off my chest, and possibly motivate others to hold on tight to life. Your life’s story may change; although, mine didn’t and most likely won’t. 

I am not going to go into the details on how I did it, but I did lost consciousness. As I was falling under, I felt tranquility. I was not scared, my heart and mind were calm… I felt that for the first time it all was going to fix itself, everything… my disease, my lack of love, my feeling of burden to others, to society… I thought it would all end. Then, I woke up. 

Being in a wheelchair, of course, makes everything harder. So, my caregiver found me and called emergency services. 

This is an experience I can’t describe, but it didn’t make me realize that I love life or that I’m taking it for granted. This experience instill in me that not everyone is going to live with a partner, family or even friends, some of us, will be lonely. Even if I fight, I need to accept there are things I’ll never be able to do, but the pain is still there, and that it will not come to an end until I do. 

Solitude and lack of human contact is real. It destroys everything you once were, that person that you’ll never get back. In my case it’s far too gone now. 

When I was eight years old, and my muscular dystrophy started to progress  severely, I started having issues walking, I would fall to the ground every time uncontrollably, and I eventually ended up wheelchair-bounded, and my teacher said: “I am so amazed by you, even with all the struggles you’ve kept your smile and positive energy. Please don’t ever change, I knew a man in a wheelchair who was very angry all the time and depressed, please don’t ever be like that”, but I did. I did become that angry, depressed, lonely, and empty-spirited person. 

After many, many years, I kept my thinking of my teacher and what she said and I would think of it, over and over, wondering why did that man changed and what made him that way. Now that I’m older, I get it. There’s very little I can say to explain why or how, until you have live through so much pain. There’s nothing of me anymore, and all I wish is to tell myself as a child, more of how beautiful she was, even if no one else did.

If you have someone that loves you and you know it, even if it is not a partner, embrace them tight. Go find love."

Many of my hobbies aline with a large group of people. My work lets me talk to hundreds of people a week. But whenever i try to engage with anyone or make plans everyone either cancels, forgets, or doesnt make time. Ive always tried to not make a big deal about it but im having to come to terms with how alone i am now. The amount of times ive been blown off by friends and family. The amount of dates ive been stood up on. Ive tried moving to new towns. New work. Trying to engage with the community. But no one has ever stuck around or followed through. I am alone. On my last birthday i didnt get any birthday wishes. I didnt get invited to the annual christmas party from my family (i actually got ignored when i tried to find out when it was) im... Just alone."

lonely,Pretending is all i have.,"Pretending is all i have. - I have always been shy and kind of a loser tbh but once i started uni some five years ago it all went into overdrive as my few friends and i became more and more distanced from one another. Over time they (nothing against these people, i guess it's only natural for that kind of stuff to happen) hung up with other groups while i became more and more isolated.

Since i still saw(and see) them from time to time and i couldn't/can't help feeling like a failure when they bring up  their weekly hook ups, or their girlfriends, or the parties they went while i had nothing to show for i began to blatantly lie about my social life: inventing girls( with some random photo as ""evidence""), uploading fake stories of me going clubing/ to a bar,reading about trendy places online to tell  how cool ""going to those"" places was and hell i even put good clothes on weekends to upload a couple of pictures of miself at the early hours of the morning implying i have just returned home from some cool night out or something.

 It was only natural that after some time i began telling all these lies at my classes and workplace too as i figured out it's the only thing that prevents people from realising i'm a miserable,lonely, loser from whom nothing is to be gained by even the slightest social interaction. 

And i tried believe me: gym(still going), keeping up with personal higiene, wasting money on stupid clothes and haircuts, dating apps,etc. As you may guess by now nothing has come from that, i had even considered plastic surgery after i get my degree but it's obvious by now  it will have no effect

I'm sorry for this textwall but i realised this a couple of months back and was finally able to put it into words tonight, my ony ""hope"" is that once i graduate i might be able to earn more (not even upper middle class for first world standards but quite an improvement on the third world country i live in) and have some fake friendships or even a fake wife that tolerates me.

I think it will be fine because for the most part dating has showed me how broken a lot of prospects are. I myself and not perfect and that’s why I’d like to be a better person.

Desirableness is a bit of an ugly feeling for me because I am not the person I pretend to be 70-80% of the time.

Even when I tell the truth nobody believes me

Suicidal feelings used to be raw pain and sadness 
But lately it’s been both that and feelings that are overwhelmingly calm and yet feel like an endless eternal scream inside my own head that nobody else can hear 

I don’t know what I need to do to feel a desire to live again.
I think love is a dangerous feeling for me because when it goes wrong I immediately feel suicidal. In some ways it’s the only thing I ever wanted. And that’s also the truest and most complete lie. Love isn’t enough for me. Nobody survives a relationship or the future off love some because love now doesn’t necessarily mean love later, twenty years down the road.

As a society I think we have never developed a the skill to choose wisely. I hope I never trust my eyes again in love because some of the ugliest and most emotionally undesirable people I’ve met are externally average to attractive looking

Maybe finishing my own goals is what I need now
I want to be better at being my own best friend

It felt really amazing. I miss her so much, I could tell her anything. we would talk about our deep desires, deep struggles, all the stuff i felt like I couldn't share with other people. We would watch tv together sometimes or share memes.

lonely,Is anyone interested in a virtual girlfriend?,"Is anyone interested in a virtual girlfriend? - lonliness is hard and emotionally taxing - I understand that feeling of being left out, confused, unable to connect but so deeply wanting to your beautiful soul with another. 

Sounds like you need a girlfriend...

the kind that sends you good morning texts.

asks you how your day was. 

reads to you before bed (my favorite thing to do) 

and makes you feel you matter, what you say matters, and is a witness to your existence on earth. 

if you'd like a virtual girlfriend, am here.

lonely,[M30] Never been in a real adult relationship,"[M30] Never been in a real adult relationship - My last girlfriend was freshman year of high school, so obviously we knew what we were doing and we’re super serious right? Since then, plain and simple, the women I want to be with have never wanted to be with me. Every time I meet someone and feel a real connection and make those intentions known, I get turned down. Without fail it’s always the same story. I  don’t see you like that, I don’t like you that way, I just don’t see you in that way, I’m not looking for a relationship right now. After so long you can’t help but think damn it really must just be me. But I’m not a shitty person, I’m not mean or nasty, I’m generally spoken of incredibly highly by many many people. I have so many friends and so many people who love me and care about me, I’ve never doubted that. Just none of them ever want to take that next step with me. I’m starting to think it’s my looks lol. I have so much love to give and I’m very worried that because I’m getting older I’m missing out on life experiences that come with being in a serious committed relationship. I’m worried that if/when I finally do find someone, I’ll fuck it up because I just don’t have the experience to navigate certain things in a relationship because I’ve never had one. 


Thanks for letting me vent this out."
lonely,Anyone wants someone close?,"Anyone wants someone close? - For the last two years of my life, I used to be a lonely person. I barely talked to anyone, I pushed people away from my life and I do things that I severally regret. As of now, I no longer see myself in that category and that makes me happy that I can 're-enter' society.

**However,** I can't say the same for a lot of people in this reddit community. This is my first time noticing that a community like this exist and reading a lot of people's comments made me emotionally connected because it's weird for me to see a lot of people in the world feel the same as I do.

If you are interested in having a person that you can hopefully connect with and want someone to talk to then you are completely open to do so.

At 20had a kid with an emotionless robot who gaslighted me with mental abuse. 38 separated and after 6 months I connected with a Redditor about some random post . 3 months later I have experienced things I didn’t know I could. Empathy , company, understanding, and weirdly love and attention.  

The brokenness and emptiness I have felt my whole life were gone. Then they pulled away and withdrew


Now I have not been strong enough to stop the loss of 20 years , I let myself give everything away for nothing to experience the purest and most powerful love with someone not able to return it . Causing me to be more damaged then the loss of 20 years.

I can’t be the same as I was and I can’t make myself get better and be enough for someone

i went through a breakup this week. i felt pretty lonely while i was in that relationship as well, but i would argue that not being in it is even more lonely. i have friends, but they're all in love or preoccupied otherwise. besides, i can't tell my friends that i feel like i have no one, because that puts a lot of pressure and resentment on them when it's really not their fault.

I spent the first 25 years of my life just battling demons my family and my ex wife threw  at me. I spent all that time fighting  to make it through the storm.. 

Now that I've finally gotten through  it. I realized I never made friends because I was too busy fighting for this life I now have. Yet... I feel more alone than I ever had. 

I should be at peace... but I am not. I just have this crippling loneliness  that nothing will cure. I can be in a room full of people yet I feel nothing, I can be out with ""friends"" and yet I feel nothing. I can be in the middle of sex and yet I feel nothing... just a whole load of nothing. Just permanently stuck in auto pilot."

I was able to prep the second bedroom with the clean ""guest"" linens I keep in the closet but never use. I was able to make dinner and have someone else appreciate it for once. There were more than three dishes to do before bed. Hell, I even got to put new soap and shampoo in the second bathroom. He was only here for three days but it was nice to have someone to sit down with for once. To get things for and to live around. To chat with and not have to eat alone at my table. 

I've known I'm lonely for a while but that really hammered home how lonely I am. I've been in a bit of a funk since he left and all I can think about are the ""what could have been"" moments that I hoped I would be able to have with the women I've gone on dates with but never panned out."

Come to find out I was never wanted and it’s much easier to pretend someone doesn’t exist when you don’t live in the same house. 

Then there’s the friend category of this. Which I have none. Anyone I’ve met has only ever been around me because they wanted something from me or they liked how I made them feel not because they genuinely liked me. It’s just been one after the the other. Whether it’s my family, friendships, or relationships I’m always being left. I don’t know why anymore.

I used to have friends, a girlfriend, I’ve always been fairly reclusive but I had a social life of some kind. When the relationship went sour I ended up losing everything, including a place to live due to us living together. 

I ended up having to move half way across the country because that was the closest family I had that I could stay with. It’s now two years later, I still haven’t managed to get back on my feet thanks to covid and a million other things that all happened around the same time.  The town I live in is rural (like super) and I just have no idea how to get back to meeting people. 

I feel so isolated from the world. I’m out of friends. I haven’t been with a woman since the breakup, hell I haven’t *spoken* to a woman since. I feel like I’ve devolved to social nothingness. I’ve tried talking to people online with little success, I’ve tried dating apps but the few people I found lived hours away and it’s just not feasible.

i feel lonely, all the time. i feel like no one’s here for me, no one’s loving me and no one’s gonna cry if i die. 

i have a boyfriend, a very caring boyfriend that i really love but despite him telling me he loves me, i can’t trust it. i can’t trust no one even if i try to. i feel like everyone has something against me  and hates me. one day, he’ll hate me too. 

i’m depressed, all the time. i am alone. i am lonely. i am in pain every fucking day and it destroys my me. i wish i had good friends who’d be there for me, who i can laugh with and spend time with. but no one’s here and i’m left alone. i really suffer from that. i’m 18 and i’ve felt like that since i was a small child (around 6 when i started going to school). 

i don’t know how to make friends and how to have real friends. i’m naturally shy but i’ve tried. but they just want to talk to me at school and most of the time they leave me after a year of being in the same class. it’s seriously hurting me a lot. i don’t know what to do. 

now i’m in college and this shit still happens. i try to make friends, they talk to me just to have my notes and then they leave me. i’ve spent so many years redoing this pattern over and over again and i am tired of feeling like this."

You probably cant imagine this life and think I'm exaggerating. 

I lost my partner, the only person I had. Dont have a friend, family, no accquaintence, no one. When I've run out of distractions on my phone, I become irritable, I feel like I'm being held a prisoner and I just want to break things and scream and rip my face off.

Also I’m not even remotely tired. I just wish I had a fast forward button. I am not sure if it’s depression causes loneliness, or the other way around.

They haven’t. We organised this back at the end of may and my friends parents have already sorted it out with everyone else. So I probably won’t even get to go. Everyone will just have a good time.

lonely,I feel out of place.,"I feel out of place. - I don't really know where to start. I'm going through a divorce where my wife asked me for a divorce over text while I was in the hospital. This was in January and im still picking up my peices from then. I have been sick since then and stopped going to be seen because honestly everything is just so hard. But as of about 2 weeks ago I started feeling sick again and hopeless again. I didn't feel too much better but I was able to function where right now I'm not really able to. My ex has since moved to another state with a guy nearly triple her age that has drug charges against him. I feel so abandoned. Not only by her but by my friends and family. I'm being forced to sell my house because this divorce. I actually move to a apartment on June 1st. I lost my car from this divorce too. Im going through this basically alone. My friends don't invite me out dispite knowing what's going on. I asked them about it and got left on read. Even took me out of the fantasy football league because I left the chat when this started and kind of isolated myself so they replaced me. Now I took a month off work to move and get my health better but I feel awful anywhere I'm at. I feel so out of place. If someone could leave me like this while I'm in the hospital, what's my worth? I guess that's the answer. I've never felt so hopeless and out of place ever. I just wish i had someone to relate but even the therapist doesn't make me feel better. Maybe it's too late for me to be happy. I know this post is everywhere but I also recently started dating this girl. Don't know why but we connected really well. We're not like official or anything and it's long distance but we just work well together. I do feel like she's better without me and maybe I should stop talking to her because this. She has her moods and sometimes she's just rude for no reason. I know all this sounds crazy I'm just not in the right head space right now. I'm not going to hurt myself and I'm not suicidal but I feel hopeless. Any advice?"

I used to have this problem with my siblings too it sucks because I love hearing others talk but I just always feel like I don’t fit in anywhere and since I constantly get told to stfu at home when I’m out in public especially shopping I get self conscious talking to the sales workers because I don’t want to annoy them. I just wish I had someone to text or talk to just as a friend someone who won’t make me feel like an outcast or yelling At me reminding me how annoying and how much I talk."

Last to be told info, last to be invited (if at all) and never anybody’s first thought. I don’t have a self absorbed image of myself, but it sucks to know that if I never offered up any info on myself nobody would know anything. 

I try to plan activities and outings but they rarely ever work out, yet when somebody else in the group plans the exact same thing. Everybody is on board. 
I know I’m not entitled to anybody’s time, but I don’t understand why I’m even included at all if I’m just on the edge here. Why include a person in the group you don’t give a fuck about? We’re all adults, if they don’t want to see me nobody is making them.

The underlying issue really is that I feel like that’s how every friend group I’ve been in has gone. I’m on the edge of the circle, watching social media as they all go out together and hearing about it the next day followed by “you should have gone!” When we both know I wasn’t invited.

lonely,I feel like I am missing out,"I feel like I am missing out - Me a 21 f have never been in a relationship, and I'm not talking romantically, I mean any relationships out side of family (not like family is doing any batter), and I only started to notic it now.
For as long as I remember, I never had real friends, majorty were either using me or piting me, even when I manged to get some good friend, it was only surface level and would never last, and even now, when ever I would hang out with my ""friends"" ( a batter ways to describe my classmates), I can't help but feel lonely, or worst like an outsider trying to fit in.
As for romantically, it is somehow a lot worst, never kissed any body, never hugged anybody (romantically),never hold hand, and never even been asked out, I'm in my twenties and never went on a date.
I really didn't think much about any of this until recently, when I was talking with my classmates, and they were all talking about their relationship, how all of them been in one, or still in one, even the ones who are younger or more rilegest, I felt like I'm missing out on this.
I come from a religious house, been told my whole life not to talk to boy unless it's school related, and I think I took it to a whole new level, I never had any guy friends, and the first time I talked to a boy (out side of family) was in the end of sixth grade, hell I can't even talk to them properly because I become anxious.
Right now it is midnight, and I feel more lonely than ever, I don't want to be like this my whole life, I want friends to stay with me, I want a lover, to experience relationships, even if it once, I just want to try it.
But at this point it seems like I am the problem,  not like i am a bitch, not like I'm super bad looking, but I'm a shallow person, no interneting hoppies or internet, that get the joke last, and doesn't talk a lot, and usually when I do it is not interesting, and no one listens.
I feel like I can't change, and I fell like I'm gonna end up old and lonely, I even accepted the idea my little sisters would marry before I could make a friend, and it just so depressing sometimes, to think like I don't really belong somewhere not even home, so what am I to do?.

lonely,Does anyone think they are being punished?,"Does anyone think they are being punished? - The punishment is isolation. I'm alone, no friends to go out with, and I've never had a relationship. I've tried but I have been given some punishment where i can't connect with anyone. Even if I do meet someone I like, they will never like me back. I really think I'm being punished for something bad I did. Even people who do bad things don't have to live their lives alone. Obviously I am worse than them. Isolation even living around and walking in a crowded area doesn't mean anything. My punishment ensures I will not connect with any person. Telling me to keep going out and talking to people is like telling a guy who is behind bars for life to keep running at the bars in his cell because one day they will break so he can escape. The crime is I don't know but it's something bad and the punishment is life in isolation.

 I went for a walk for coffee although it's iced in this heat, and it was so crowded because of an event going on. I literally had to walk through large groups of people to get to the coffee place. I started looking around and realizing, I'm surrounded by people yet I'm more isolated than a guy on top of a tall mountain where you can't even breathe without help. I am carrying out a sentence for a crime that I obviously committed. I need to accept the sentence."

lonely,It is devastating to realize how truly lonely you are.,"It is devastating to realize how truly lonely you are. - It was my 26th birthday today. I asked a couple friends if they were down to hangout. They all said okay, then they all cancelled at the last second.

One of them said he is studying for a test that he will take next December. Apparently he was so busy he couldn't spare a Saturday night. Yesterday one of said we could hang out at his place, now he is bragging about inviting over some girl he knew from high school. The other two have families, one of them even has a baby boy now, so I can't blame them for wanting to spend some time with their families instead of me. And let's not even talk about my family, who will never admit that they are the reason I still haven't graduated and moved out like everyone at my age did a while ago. I took care of them when they needed me, and I still do. But for reasons I do not know they still resent me for it. I have known my friends literally half my life, and as dysfunctional as they are my family is still my family. I love them, even if they make it really hard sometimes.

Real fun part of all this is that not even one of them knew it was my birthday. Thought I rather they ditch me outright rather than hang out with me just because of my if it. What they do know is that I had the worst breakup of my life a month ago, and nothing ever feels the same ever since. She was a wonderful person that made me feel truly wanted and made me want to be a better person. I wish I got to tell her that before we drifted apart for reasons that were outside of our control. Even though I don't have the courage to call her and ask how she is doing, I hope she is fine.

So you see, I don't really care about my birthday at all. I have stopped caring since they started to feel like I was getting old instead of growing up. What I do care is that tonight, I realized how truly lonely I am. And all I can think about is that it wouldn't sting as much if I was actually alone. If nobody depended on me, if nobody called me only when they needed my help. As stupid as that sounds, maybe I wouldn't feel so abandoned. It's like I've given everyone a piece of myself, and I'm not sure what I've got left within me. But no matter what, I carry on somehow.

So if you are still reading this self-pitying wall of text, please know that I understand how you feel friend. Our lives and struggles might be different, but I understand. And no matter what, we have to carry on because that's all we can do."

They are all in a society. Hell, most scripts have in themselves a romantic lead, because it attracts people.

Why does ot attract people? Because people want to belive one day it will belong to them. That one day they will date the hot girl from the office or the smoking hot neighboor who sadly has a girlfriend. But it doesnt. At least not for us.

Me and you. Yes, you. You are reading it for a reason, isnt it? You are here on this subreddit for a reason and I'm pretty sure that you are not here to look at pathetic people like me.

So what about us? Who gave up. Who knows its just in the movies. Who know that we wont ever achive anything that comes close to it? All we do is sit here all day alone watching other people, who are more attractive, richer, more succesfull, loved more having what we can onlt dream of.

lonely,I want to be wanted.,"I want to be wanted. - Yesterday was my best friends birthday. We went out with some friends after work. I basically planned the whole thing myself since he only invited one other person. The night went by fine for the most part. But after a certain point I think I had a panic attack. I come out of the bathroom and he see him making out with the person he invited. The rest of the group had kinda splintered off while I was away. 

I kinda broke. 

I maintained myself the best I could but I think my demeanor rubbed off onto everybody else. Buddy and his girl kept trying to get me to go after anyone that would walk by us after that and I just kept getting annoyed. I just felt my sadness and loneliness that he is fully aware of was now just being used as a twisted joke. Or trying to pawn me off onto someone else. I just got so fucking annoyed by it and pissed off I snapped at them ‘can we please just Fucking stop?’ I killed the vibe. I didn’t want to. I wanted my friend to have a good time on his birthday and he was and I just wanted to be happy for him instead of dragging my crap front and center when it’s too late in the night and I’m too drunk to do anything about it. 

I just want to be wanted around. They all say I’m welcome and loved but it doesn’t feel like it. I just have the apartment nearby that everyone can then go to. The one always willing to drive. The one who is supportive of everybody else and always trying to make everyone happy and have a good time. I feel like a prop. 

They went out to a food truck at close and I decided just to dip. I start walking and my buddy comes running up asking to get his smokes out of my car. He texts me when he made it home safe telling me that he loved me there by his side. I do appreciate it. I do. But I just felt used. I felt like I was a third wheel to his date.

Being alone is one thing but not even being able to imagine having friends is a whole other level of depressing. I feel like my life is going nowhere im alive but im not living im on autopilot.

I am basically incapable of talking to people unless I know them and struggle to keep even the most simple conversations.

But you're still here. You still wake up every morning, despite all this shit, like a hero. Why? Because you fucking can. And I know what it's like to be at the bottom of the pit, and when you finally manage to crawl back up (because you will), then you can look back and say ""Did I do all that by myself?"" Yeah, and you're so powerful for doing that.

If that is all you're doing, just trying to make it through the day, I think you should be proud. You don't need to do shit to be a winner, cuz you already are. Doing all this for however long, which just proves that you have the strenght.

In recent years my depression got worse, I tried to kms but failed. I become isolated and more anxious. Sometimes I go out with my friends. But I can't interact with new people. I forced myself to socialize, but it was very hard. I decided to wait for some time till my depression subsided. I don't have a girlfriend for 7 years, and I am a virgin. I didn't think it was a problem until a few years ago. I've begun to feel very bad about it. It is not only about being a virgin, loneliness for years really messed me up. I tried dating apps, but I had zero matches. My self-esteem is gone. And, people are not really helping. Every day I see jokes about virgins, being sexless, not being a man, etc. And there are Incels. Which word definition suits my situation. Even one of my friends called me an Incel. It really got on my nerves, but I couldn't say anything because he was right. All of my friends even my mother have a partner. I hate to listen to their relationships and their ''scores''. I hate myself being this way. I can't stand to see sex scenes on TV. I can't stand to see couples outside. Whenever I see them I become lonelier and hate myself more. Besides that, I dropped out of college a few years ago which made things even harder. I am broke and have no job now. I don't know if I should give up and kms or keep going and fail more. I just want to vent. I am not thinking of kms now so don't worry. Also sorry for the narration it is messed up."
lonely,What have I done to deserve this?,"What have I done to deserve this? - Hey

I feel so bad. I just want to have someone in my Life, it doesnt matter if its a friend or a girlfriend. Im just lonely. I dont have Friends since the last 5 years. After a long time someone asked me, If i wanna go out on a drink with him. I was so happy to have someone again in my life... But sure he only met with me and and left after 2 hours again. I never heared of him again. I feel so lonely in that small fucking Village and I tried sooo many times to get some Friends, they just lost contact with me or didnt liked me. 

What am I fucking doing wrong? I dont want more then chilling over 4 hours together drinking a beer. Thats all I fucking want. Everyone wents out all weekend drinking together and I dont get that after 5 years for once!

I always thought, Im lonely but If I really want someone arround me I could call someone from my old friends. Did that today, I told them I just want someone arround me and dont wanna be alone everyone said they dont have time for me. 

I really dont see light at the end of the tunnel..."
lonely,What to do?,"What to do? - I don't know what to do. Sometime ago I lost my will, and I am just not going to help myself anymore. My argument is always the same, it's easier to just wallow in my self pity than it is to work towards change.  I just really hate myself, and can't see the point of work anymore it's all just overwhelming. I just see myself as a whiny, pathetic, fat, ugly, stupid, loser. Not worth the very oxygen I breathe, and I don't want to put the work in to change. Therapy is probably not the answer considering, no one can help those that won't help themselves. Plus it's expensive, so again I ask what to do about this? Just looking for tips that maybe I'll actually use."

It's like they literally see through me, It gets to a point where I'm just tired of being ""tested"" and hated for no reason. I can't even be a lonely loser in peace, feels like they want you to snap at any moment. Is it because I'm ugly or what? Does it only happen to me? I know I'm hypersensitive but I also know how to differentiate between times I got offended for nothing and times I was disrespected."
lonely,Feel like I'm disposable,"Feel like I'm disposable - Yesterday night I was gaming with two friends (at least that's how I see them).

The other guy responded by saying he was going offline, but I was like ""We could still play it together if you want?"". You can probably already guess his response... ""Nah, actually I think I'm going offline too.""

Guess he didn't want to play with me. Shit hurts. I know it may sound like it's nothing, but this definitely wasn't the first time something like this happened.

At this point I guess I'll have to accept the fact that I will never be anyone's favourite person."

But seeing the majority of people out and about in the city with their partner just hurts. Everyone has a partner, it’s all so easy for everyone. “It just happened” they’ll tell you. Same goes for their friends.

I’m usually a very optimistic person but I’m slowly but surely turning 22. Just a few months left. It literally feels like yesterday when I turned 18. When *will* it happen? Is it even gonna happen?

I know having your life laid out in front of you would make for a boring and predictable life, but that’s just one thing I’d love to know so I can have peace: will I ever find a partner that loves me as much as I love them?"

lonely,growing up religious and being secretly kinky because of repression. now I'm just a lonely freak who's fucked up and desperate,"growing up religious and being secretly kinky because of repression. now I'm just a lonely freak who's fucked up and desperate - It sucks. Like I wanted to experience the world but my parents shelters me and tried to make me a good Christian boy. Even to this day they still try to influence me to be that. I love them a lot but it's not currently who I really am. 

Because of that, I've been surrounded by people my whole life that I can't really relate to. It makes it so difficult. Like when I just wanna be me but I have to pretend to be a normal vanilla christian. 

Because of sex and stuff being restricted I got into more and more and more kinky stuff. I needed it. I needed to have some sort of control. I needed anybody who could relate to me sexually. I'm addicted to sexting because of it. I find affection through it. I know that's not right but it's just the truth.

I fantasize about all sorts of things. I wish I had a girl who could relate to my story, but most people just tell me I'm fucked up and need to get therapy because I'm to kinky or whatever. And that hurts to. 

I just want friends and love and someone who enjoys and understands my past and kinks and mindset."

I never really liked most of my classmates or had any sort of relationship with them, yet when I got my diploma and the ceremony ended I felt a deep sadness. Despite not caring for most of these people, the fact that I would never see them again was so much to make me cry. I was probably the most emotional person there, when I got home I just got in the shower and cried my eyes out. I have a few friends but we never really hang out at all and school was the only outlet to talk face to face, with that gone I feel like I’ll be in my loneliest state ever. It wasn’t necessarily the people themselves but being in the presence of them at that campus was what I was sad about losing. Seeing the people I played with during recess give their valedictorian speeches threw me for a loop, I know this is rambly but I can’t help but feel scared for my future mental state. I’d Peter Pan myself if I could."

I often do not remember my dreams. But yesterday I took a nap in the late afternoon after running errands. I fell asleep with my headphones playing on random shuffle, and I awakened to ""Yellow"" by Coldplay softly playing. I immediately started bawling and thinking of him.

lonely,Am I overthinking?,Am I overthinking? - I met my friends in a college course we became really good friends and would get coffee together during school. We would tell each other some secrets and became comfortable with each other. After graduation we hung out a few times  and went out to eat but recently they’ve been going out without inviting me they post on their insta stories like why didn’t I get invited as well. Can friends even go out without inviting the other? I can sometimes feel the energy through messages as well if i send a meme video sometimes it gets ignored and they continue on or they ignore my messages I can just feel those vibes. Are they tired of having to give me rides everytime we go out because I don’t drive or I’m just the ugly friend because theyre both beautiful with nice a nice body and I’m the only fat one in our group and don’t meet the beauty standards or I don’t look pretty enough for them. I feel like they have their own group chat and probably hangout out more without me noticing Idk what to think anymore honestly I’m tired of having fakefriendships I get attached so easily that I hate it.i start to get my hopes up up thinking I finally have friends someone who I can trust and won’t feel alone anymore. I just feel like distancing my self from them and ghosting them. Its so hard to find real genuine friends. I need advice idk if I’m overthinking.

Yet again I stupidly let my walls down and obviously it was all a lie and I'm empty again, but this is the last time I'm gonna feel this way, life is so unbelievably agonizing I can't take it anymore.

All Ive ever wanted was love, just someone to have, I'll literally be a slave to someone if I got to just be with them but that's not enough for people it seems, people don't even want me when I'm offering that to anyone willing to listen to me lol 

It's clear I'll never have anyone to love, so now I have nothing to be here for anymore. Not sure when but soon I'll pick a day, no day in particular, special dates are as meaningless as my pathetic life is. Ive been hurting myself a lot lately, feel like I'm bleeding through my clothes today, idk. I just can't do this, I can't take this pain anymore. I hate being alone and unwanted then thrown away like the trash I am over and over because I'm stupid enough to feel hope. Hope isn't good for me. Life isn't good for me.

lonely,A totally shitty day,"A totally shitty day - 
I’m 23f. Trying to keep up with an epilepsy diagnosis at 18 and a hard law school, which I hate. The diagnosis definitely slowed me down and made me sadder but I never quit. Always went to school, always studied, working out etc. But all of my family somehow believes I quit.

Today my mum broke her nerves on me. All I asked her was to cook fish because it’s in my diet and when I asked for extra lemon she just went crazy! Screaming, venting, hitting things. I kept eating quietly but gutted. 

Feeling down, I cancelled my participation in yoga class and the teacher got annoyed too. “You should have informed earlier”, my participation or not changes literally nothing to her class tho, the class has already other clients. Besides I’ve never missed a single class and I always pay in advance.

And as if all these weren’t enough, my mum hit again. She decided by herself to take me to the yoga class, although I told her I prefer to go alone. She got dressed and knocked my door and when I told her I’m not going she went literally out of her mind. Screaming again, calling me bad things, ungrateful, bitch, authoritarian, jerk etc

Being unemployed, not financially stable to just leave this madness makes every judgment from my family a toll on my mental health.

lonely,Spending another birthday alone,"Spending another birthday alone - I made a Reddit account because I have no place else I can express my feelings and will most likely never post again. I’m 25F and I am spending another birthday alone. Growing up I’ve always had horrible birthdays, people tend to forget about me. As a kid my father would forget every year. in middle school I threw a birthday party, no one showed. One year my mother spent it running a garage sale instead of spending time with me. This year I’m spending it alone in my room again crying to myself. 

I’ve come to realize I’ve never been a priority to people and will never be. 

I took a week off of work in hopes of spending time with my friends and family, well I haven’t. I don’t consider myself a selfish person but I wish I had at least one person reach out and offer to spend time with me. 

All my friends have recently gotten into relationships, I’m the last single friend of my group so now Ive been feeling like I’m behind in the dating world. I’ve never had a someone that’s wanted to be with me. I’m now 25 and haven’t had someone I can really call my boyfriend. I’ve never had the urge to be with someone romantically until I had met a guy last year. I’d figured he’d like me too since we’ve been hanging out for 8+ months and I thought we really clicked. I later ended up confessing to him. Turns out he “believes we wouldn’t be good together in a relationship” so that ended. Even when I think I have someone I could call ‘mine’ I never really do. 

Birthdays have now turn into a yearly reminder of how I have no one close to me.

i never struggled with matches on dating apps. i’m pretty funny and i’m not an asshole, so that’s half the battle for women (at least what i’ve seen on reddit). but, for the last 5 years, it seems women are only interested in casual sex with me. 


maybe it’s how i present myself, but i’m scared of just falling into that cycle again. i was having casual sex a few times a week every week in college with multiple girls (i’m clean! i got/get tested regularly). after a while that gets *really* old. i want sex with someone who i feel like i have a connection with and who i feel like actually cares about me."

but seriously, no one ever tells me that they do. my friends, my family, nobody. i'm not missed by anybody and i probably still wouldn't be even if i fucking died (i don't want to, just saying). but like... of all people, i at least want to hear my bf say it just once. even if he's lying, i just want to hear him say it so i can at least think that he does. but no. every single time i tell him i miss him, he just stalls and doesn't say it back. of ALL people, i would at least hope he says it. but no.

but really, i just want to hear everyone say it so i can at least know that i'm in someone's thoughts. my best friend never says it because he's with his girlfriend 24/7, so he doesn't really have to miss me if he has her. my mom never says it when i'm gone or she's gone. my sister who doesn't live with me never says it. just, nobody. i never feel missed by anybody and i never feel like someone NEEDS me to be there. this is so pathetic, but... can someone tell me that they miss me? even if it's just a random redditor?

lonely,i just want to sleep,"i just want to sleep - When you try to be active, productive, busy or worked so hard in your day and hoping that you will automatically fall asleep once you lay down in your lonely bed.. But reality, your mind starts to overthink, your eyes starts to cry, your heart starts to break. You start to feel not enough, not worthy, don't deserve to be happy. You want to talk to someone but you can't say anything. Once you close your eyes, you just want to deep sleep but your mind will work so hard even you keep on saying ""please let me sleep""."

Also lowkey wish I had a lil brother or sister. Always wanted to be that big brother figure. /random

I find it hard to make connections with people especially women in part because I look like I’m 28 or something people tell me often. 

It also doesn’t help I spent the majority of my adult life in the Army and now that I’m out can collect some wardrobe and develop my own style and personality. I work for a major brand so I have some style unlike most ppl my age lol. 

I would say I have a youthful vibe and energy. I’m not shy and at and have the gift of gab. I def have a big personality and value depth and effort/emotion from people. 

I don’t set boundaries or expectations and rules for a friendship. Vibe and go with the flow. 

For me I wish I had someone consistent to talk to. It’s so easy to be anonymous and ghost people. I know I’ve been on the receiving end of that left feeling pretty empty. It sucks but it’s 2022 also and the way I look at it is like… you either keep up and do your best or become static and cry about it. It’s a harsh society to try and find your person in right now. 

I feel like I’m in a place in my life to add someone to it. I could careless how old you are or if you have kids or not. We all have some level of baggage. I’m open to make friends with anyone really. Just be a good person. 

Me? I have so many diverse hobbies from taking care of my plants, being a cat dad, to soccer to learning how to play table tennis rn haha.

I’d love to get to know a good person who likes to talk and share. Also don’t mind showing pictures of you like seeing who you’re talking to. I’m a tall lanky fit drink of water myself 😜 

Life goes on and you do your best. Hope you all have a good one and thanks for reading. You can message me what your note to a bank teller would say if you wanna lowkey show me you read all of this. &lt;3

lonely,I always wonder what’s wrong with me that makes me not worth being loved…,"I always wonder what’s wrong with me that makes me not worth being loved… - I just turned 38 earlier this week, and this is honestly been an issue that’s been bothering me for the last 4-5 or so.

Being in my late 30s, I sort of almost feel like a leper of sorts because I’ve never been in a serious relationship.

Seeing people in their 20s getting married and having kids always sort of makes the issue worse for me because it makes me wonder why I haven’t been able to figure out the relationship thing when someone who’s 10+ years younger than me apparently has.

Being an overweight guy, I know my potential dating pool is significantly smaller than if I was a “normal” size or closer to a normal size. But, then I see people who are around my size (or even bigger) in relationships, and that sort of compounds my thinking about myself.

I know I’m not the best looking guy in the world. But, I’d like to think I’m at least moderately attractive/put together for someone my size. I put some effort into not being the stereotypical “sloppy fat guy”. I’ve had a few people tell me I’m good looking. But, this has mostly come from friends/co-workers and most of the ones who’ve said this are married. So, (especially with my self-esteem issues) it’s hard for me to tell if they’re being genuine or if they’re just trying to help me feel better.

I think a lot of it is I’m not at that age where I feel like I should have had a family of my own by now. Especially since I’ve never had success with dating/relationships, I feel like there’s something in my life missing where a life companion should be.

I understand comparing myself to others in the dating/relationship world isn’t the best because no relationship is perfect and not all of them will last. But, I feel like people comparing themselves to others is part of human nature.

PS-

If you’re reading this and you’re the type of person that gives the “WeLl, JuSt Go To ThE gYm” line when someone talks about being overweight, please kindly go fuck yourself. It’s not helpful."

lonely,Some days hurt more than others,"Some days hurt more than others - For starters: I am blessed with a lovely family and nice colleagues. But that's where it ends. 

I don't have friends that seem to care about me. It's always me reaching out to them.  I don't have people who love me in a different way then my family does. 

I'm gay and I recently moved out. Whenever I come home now, there's nobody. Sometimes I'm too busy doing chores to even think about that. But especially in the weekends or on some nights I feel terrible. 

I started to watch the Netflix series Heartstopper this week. First evening I binged half the season. I loved it, I was so stoked on feeling that cute 'being in love' feeling, I was actually really happy I felt something like that again.

Then the day after, yesterday, I felt like the complete opposite. The series made me realise I have never had any romantic stuff with someone.

It made it look like it is 'necessary' to have had romantic interaction as a teenager. I made me feel like I missed out. Like I failed doing what was 'normal' at that age. I know the series is 100% made up, but it still made me feel that way.

I never held hands, never sat on the couch next to someone at home, never been looked at in that way or given a cute compliment. 

I'm in my mid twenties and I feel like I'm a failure missing all these things. I know not everybody explores there romances at early age, but it mostly feels like I'm the only one in my whole area of colleagues and family.

At the same time, I am honest when I say I genuinely think there is not someone that's made for me. I don't see how that'd happen. So the ""solution"" for me being lonely is known to me, but just completely out of reach. It's eating me up.

I'm not thinking about it constantly, luckily. But when I do, it's bad. I realise that I'm getting older every day: more and more days of me missing out on romantic stuff in my teenage years/early twenties. And more and more days of me feeling not being interesting anymore because I'm getting 'too old' to start exploring things. 

I needed to vent this because I've nobody to vent this too. I hope y'all are doing better than me right now. Peace :)"

lonely,Feeling so down,"Feeling so down - Hi everyone,  


I am a 17-year-old male. Since kindergarten, I have been in my current school and have had the same friends for that long. We were all great friends and used to hang out all the time, until the summer going into junior year. That is when the 'party' culture started, with house parties, clubbing, and whatever you can name. I went to one with them and really enjoyed it, but for the last 3 months I have never been invited and I do not know why!?  


I like to think I'm pretty outgoing and chill. I never annoy people, really, and I don't get into fights and people say they like me at school (they say I'm funny, chill, etc.) however, when I go home, I get NO messages, calls or anything. Weekends get really lonely too, I'm just sitting at home getting no messages except randoms on Discord. I used to think they aren't messaging me cause I'm not messaging them, but that's not true-- I used to go out of my way to message people and the conversation would be short and meaningless, I realized that ultimately no one will approach me first if I don't approach them first.  


Ever since my friends got into this party mode, I am never invited. Our friend group at school is 10 people, but 7 of these people have a group chat without 3 of us where they plan parties and meetups, and I do not know why my 2 friends and I are being completely neglected. I never impose myself upon others, I drink, smoke, you-name-it and I honestly don't know.  


If they don't like me, I get it, but why do they hang out with me at school then, compliment me, and do all that, if they simply do not bother outside school? I get that people have preferences of who they want to meet but after being friends for 10+ years it's absolutely gutting to just not feel like a part of the group anymore.  


I have been told to get new friends, but that is not an option, I don't think so. My grade is small, roughly 45 people and the people who are not part of this 'friend group' have completely conflicting personalities with me, I'd say I can only get along with 1 or 2 of them-- the rest are either too far right or too far left.   


What advice do you guys have? I don't want to confront them about it as that would make me lose all my self-esteem but I'm tired of just not being invited. We were all so tight, and all of a sudden I'm not one of them."

Every day pushes me closer to being less likely to ever have the chance. I hear “do what makes you happy and it’ll come along”. Well I tried. And I was even in decent shape then too. And I was still miserable. Nothing makes me actually happy anymore. It’s just days of being here because I have to be. And doing it alone for people just so I can be of use to them.  At some point I won’t be of use to them. When that comes I think I just won’t be here"
lonely,Romantic love just isn’t for everyone.,"Romantic love just isn’t for everyone. - I’ve been trying to accept the fact that a romantic relationship isn’t in the cards for me. It isn’t apart of my life story. It hurts, because I want nothing more to love and grow with someone, but something about love always sets me back. I love doing my own thing, being on my own. I truly do. Sometimes though, it makes me ache. Maybe I’ll find her one day, but I’m getting to the point where I just need to accept what it is."

Shoutout to you all here btw I hope only the best for ya'll, it's a sad sad world lmao..  
I have no friends, my only friend I remained in contact with from HS we've drifted apart, they're engaged, working a nursing job, and is vacationing. I live isolated on my parents property in the middle of the bush (AUS, so it's like just trees and miles of farms) against my will. My dad has taught me that not only am I not good enough and don't deserve love, but that everyone will leave me eventually unless I have an iron grip on them. I displayed some of his shitty traits and ruined the best relationship I had with this guy.. I broke it off after seeing how toxic it got, we're still best friends, but there's this jarred wall between us he doesn't see.   
I was feeling really depressed the other night, and it was obvious, but I felt uncomfortable talking about it to him. He tried to get me to open up, and after I lied and said I was just tired, he kinda stopped and we just kept vibing, then out of nowhere asked for a hug because he ""needed it"". It broke me.. *he* wanted a hug because *he* was feeling upset that *I* was upset and didn't want to talk about it, putting how he felt above my feelings in the moment, something my dad does all the time. It gave me a sickening feeling.. I just accepted it and pretended to be there for him like I do with my dad, and I felt dizzy like I was going in circles emotionally with any relationship I have in my life. He says he's still in love with me but understands we need to improve ourselves before trying again, but the way he's been acting makes me think he's falling out of love with me.. and what's worse is I only *think* I love him back, because I have no fucking clue how human emotions and relationships work thanks to my fucking shitty parents. I'm not comfortable talking to him about anything serious anymore, but he never notices when I'm upset anyway. I can't win. It truly feels like anything I do will either hurt me or someone else.   


I truly do want therapy to break myself of any toxic habits and work through my issues, but even if I could afford it I don't think I could even trust another therapist.. I've been ghosted many times by them. I had to move away from my first at 16, I was with another for a year then she stopped talking after telling me to get a job because it would ""give me purpose"" (which I did, got fired because I was quote ""too nervous and jumpy"" and ""not the confident girl in the interview"" which was nice), then councillor after councillor as I was transferred to different work agencies, once I had a single session with this guy and he told me in the most polite way that I was too fucked up for his skill level.   


I don't drink often, I don't smoke, I've never done drugs, I'm now an adult and still a fucking virgin too, yet my whole family treats me like a drug addict with my mental health, burdensome and pointless to help. My aunty on my mum's side is literally the only family member I have a comfortable connection with. I haven't even touched on my questioning sexuality and gender, pushing it aside in my mind because I literally cannot take it on my plate right now. What do I do? What even am I supposed to do?"

lonely,"Just had my bday, I have covid and now my friend and I are done.","Just had my bday, I have covid and now my friend and I are done. - I need to vent, I'm really struggling and I have no one to talk to.... 

My friend invited me to what they marketed to me as, ""our bday"" party Sunday because our birthdays are so close to each other. I drove over an hour away and when I got there we didn't do what we had discussed, they changed it to something that was impossible with my executive function (adhd). So I couldn't even participate most of the time and didn't even feel included. On top of that when I first got there, my friends fiance had on a face mask. I asked if I should put one on and they claimed it must be congestion from allegies and ended up not wearing it 95% of the party. So essentially the party sucked and I drove home excited for my actual bday plans that would be taking place Thursday- on my bday. 

Wednesday I am out grocery shopping and once I get back in my car I noticed my friend messaged me and said her fiance tested positive for covid. Cool. I had some congestion that day too. So I got home and took a test. Positive. Great. So canceled my bday plans for Thursday. Spent the day miserable.

 Today I woke up even more miserable. I have felt terrible the entire day and had been in contact with my friend so she was aware. I had to call my doc for meds, it was over $300 and now I can't work either- love that for me. I was venting to my friend about the cost and she asked if there was something they could do. I said yes, please let me know next time one of you feels off so I can decide whether or not I want to still come over or not. I even said I am not blaming either of you, I should of worn a mask when I saw he had one on. I tried to shoulder most of the responsibility. She got mad at me for it anyways though. They even responded with an mmmk 👍 So I called because... surely she is like not reading my message in the correct tone.. I genuinely wasn't trying to place blame but I am going to be fearful from visiting if they can't be clear on their health status before I drive so far to visit. 

Well long story, trying to make it shorter. She told me I was blaming them and I got really upset at this point because she was making everything about her. I ended up screaming at her told her I was irrate that she started an argument with me knowing how horrible I was feeling and told her that maybe I should blame her. Her fiance said something and I ended the conversation by saying fuck you... not my best moment. I then blocked them on literally everything and don't plan on ever talking to her again. 

But yeah lonely and miserable just doesn't even cut it. It is not looking like a good year for me."

lonely,It sad that those you cared about and still what to play games,"It sad that those you cared about and still what to play games - I tried so long to get you to see what you were doing. Maybe you did or maybe you just didn’t care anymore and I was just a source. That last weekend we started off so well and you did one of the sweetest things you have done for me in the longest times. I still live in a state of confusion when I’m around you. I just want to hold you and I tried to take care of you. But you still just kept taking. You showed no respect for either of us. I know things are and have been hard on you. I know there is so much you miss in your heart. I’m trying to understand. But there has been so much that has happened. I’m trying to keep an open mind. I know I couldn’t give you what you wanted this last time and you went online to find. I just didn’t want you to leave with those guys. I wanted you to try and be faithful  to a man I was hearing you say I love you.  If he is even around anymore.  Then there is now a ghost. I think you prefer it that way. You don’t have to be held accountable for your actions. We still worry about you. It feels like you have just given up. I know that feeling I know that emptiness. It’s just easier to find comfort in a pipe or on top of somebody. We said a lot of things over the years. So many hurtful words that stab us a million times. They play over and over and the pain the disappointment still holds us in a vice that feels impossible to break. I can’t take back those words. I can’t take back how I made you feel. When I needed to listen,I yelled. When you needed to be held. I let my pride and anger push me away from you. When all I wanted was to hold you, to make love to you. To fuck you at time like a good fuckdoll. To show you some dominance. But I was to submissive to hurt and so emasculated by you cheating and by the other men I tried to share you with. Then in  my performance that my mind was so twisted the drugs hit me hard and I couldn’t give you the one thing that we both wanted so bad. We all fall from grace. We all become depressed then self destructive. Then it seemed with you malicious that.  You know what you did. Especially when the bag was dry. Yet I’m still trying to see that it doesn’t matter anymore. We are separated and while we may be with someone. It’s not the you it’s not me. So we use that artificial love that amped up sex to feel something and think in the back of it heads I wish things could of been different. You changed so much from the girl I knew. As I have changed as well. We bitch carry our scared on the inside as well as the outside.  It’s just to bad still want to play games. You still want to lurk outside the windows. You still want to be a different person. As if we are role playing. But I am always playing myself and you some girl or some guy. The countless photos you have on your phone. The many photos you still have of me. I have so many photos due to resets and deleted images. Just because some were to hard to look at. That it wasn’t me in that photo or video. But it is your life and your kinks while similar. We never got to really open our darkest fantasies. But you always were trying to tell me more show me more and give me more experiences. I was just to stupid ,selfish, and I guess insecure that it pushed you away.  I couldn’t meet to desires or appetite. As I found my confidence, my self value. Those things changed for me.  I’m still a fuck up ,Im still asshole. But I don’t have the anger I did. But our last encounter I know I showed my old ways. I’m sorry for that. You have been through so much violence so much control. I understand the want to tell everyone to go fuck themselves and just run to the next. So wherever you are try not to be a stranger or scared. We Both are different people and maybe that is better for the both of us"
lonely,I hate that I’ve missed out on so much,"I hate that I’ve missed out on so much - I’m in last few weeks of my last year of high school, and I’m just sad about how much I’ve socially isolated myself. I’ve made a similar post before, so I won’t repeat myself, but I’ll talk about what’s bugged me recently: all the senior year stuff. I’m not going to any of these things. I’m not going to prom, the last day “field day” event, or any thing of that sort. I simply can’t. If I went I’d just be hanging out by myself awkwardly for a few hours cringing internally at myself for having the audacity to show up. So I’ve decided I will not attend a single school function. Now none of this bothered me before—I knew I couldn’t attend these things long in advance, but now that they’re upcoming, it stings me slightly. It reminds me that I leave this school with no memories, no friends, not even a fond distant feeling. It simply *was*—that has been my high school experience. My entire school experience, really.

Now I have college on the horizon, and I’m planning on turning myself around, but still I can’t help but be sad at how my life up until then has been like. Oh well. Just have to keep moving forward."

But I ended up building that with abusive people. Now I’m far removed from all abusive people and I have a loving partner but even he doesn’t get me and when he leaves or after an argument I just feel so extremely lonely. I have no friends. I gave up the few friends and family I had in my home country to live in his and it has been hell. I have tried to make friends but keep failing. We are ethically non monogamous which only leads to empty hookups. It’s like I have so much to give but no capacity to give it. I know I’m not a horrible person but then why do people keep abandoning me? And treating me horribly. I just feel so empty and lonely and every day I get up and talk myself into giving this day another try and every day I eventually get to a point where I just break down and cry and wish I could disappear so I could stop feeling all this pain."

I guess you can read my ""about me"" section or whatever if you want to know about me.

I've had this big gap within myself for pretty much most of my life of not having my creative side being reciprocated, so it's always added an extra layer of lonely.

I'm not looking to collaborate on projects, though, but I could help you figure stuff out, like worldbuilding/character/story suggestions, etc, or, on the flipside, give art critiques, but I'm pretty honest."

It’s the summer time and I’m heading into my junior year of college and all I do is work and go to the gym. Thank god I have good parents to talk to and hangout with because otherwise I’d probably be a mess. 

But honestly, I’m just feeling really low right now. My ‘best friend’ barely talks to me anymore and hasn’t many any effort to hang out or make plans for the summer after being so far from eachother in college. My other friends just don’t seem to care either. 

All I want is to just chill with my friends. I don’t care what we do. I see other people with their friends just doing whatever they want together, even just hanging out in each others houses for hours. But they don’t seem to want to do that with me."

To make matters worse this family member even told their coworker (also my coworker since I’m doing an internship at my family member’s work) that during the pandemic I didn’t go out at all and just stayed home. Then this family member also made sure to introduce me as someone who is shy and nervous to all their coworkers. This family member tried to force me to go get free coffee that I wasn’t interested in since I wasn’t feeling well and not a coffee fan and then berated me for not going with them. They also are forcing me to go to some stupid local barbecue happening in a few weeks where we work. They told me I have to get out and that I have no choice since they are my ride. 

I feel like killing myself. Several of my family members attack me for not having friends or dating on top of other things. I’m 22 and my own family views me as a loser and disappointment."

lonely,life-long depression flare up,"life-long depression flare up - Hey friends. I am new to Reddit and have just been feeling really alone the past 2 weeks or so. I have had depression since middle school. (I'm 28 now) But thanks to medication it hasn't been as bad the past year or so. I just remembered my Dr. Did lower my anti-depressant dose some a few weeks ago. Not sure if that has any correlation. I really just spiraled down last week and contacted a suicide hotline 2 days in a row. I wasn't really wanting to committing suicide but I felt like it was getting worse and worse and that was next. Cuz I've been there although it had been a while. It's tough because nobody around me understands and being a man I just feel like such a b*tch and p*say when I feel depression flare ups or things of that nature. I am a man and mainly talk to women, I do not really have any real close male friends. But I do not feel comfortable reaching out to a woman for help. I just feel like they are thinking ""this guy is so weak"" or whatever. Idk they are my problems and I need to deal with them. I suppose first thing will be speaking to my doctor and get my anti-depressant dose back to where it was before he lowered it. I seemed to have a better life outlook. Although I would still get flare ups. Ugh I just wish I had friends to talk to about these things.

I'm sorry. I'm just ranting. &amp; I know it is pathetic. I'm working on myself."

I went to my old high school's graduation earlier tonight and now I feel even worse. I was hoping to catch up with people I used to know but I could only bring myself to say hello to a few people. Someone who I used to be very close to was part of the graduating class, and it hurt so much to know that I couldn't tell them how proud of am of them and how much I miss them.

I keep a tight circle and I have two friends. My best friend who I typically spend lots of time with isn't around. They are going through some pretty deep shit and spend most of their time drowning it out in video games. 

I wish I could do that. 

I try to, but I can't stay focused on them because I no longer have a friend group that I game with. I know you're probably thinking ""why don't you just play with your best friend?"" 

Because they play with people that make me feel really shitty. So in an attempt to prevent myself from feeling even worse, I don't join their xbox parties.

Hell, peoples lives tend to improve immediately after they ditch me. I feel like my life's purpose is to suffer so others don't have to. I've already decided never to speak to anyone again, unless absolutely necessary, but I have a feeling the universe won't allow this, because if I completely shut myself off from others, how can I suffer in their place?

lonely,What to do after university,"What to do after university - I finish uni next week after three years of studying filmmaking (largely interrupted by covid)

I don’t at all feel ready to go and start a ‘proper’ career because uni hasn’t done much to help with setting anything up for once we all leave.

I only ever managed to make like one ‘friend’ whilst at university, but even then, I don’t really like them that much. 

Im worried that once I leave uni then that’s me stuck without any friends forever now apart from the couple i’ve knows since high school who i very occasionally meet up with because they’ve largely moved on to other people and things with them being at different university’s.

When i try to talk to the old friends about things i’m passionate about or that’s just stuff that I find fun or amusing, i feel like nobody cares, i still message the old friends online in between the occasional meet ups but it mostly ends up with a few wed answers or the dreaded ‘ok’ when i send them something i’ve come across that i feel like sharing with somebody else or if i have something to just speak about with somebody

I just feel trapped in my own thoughts with no outlet to be able to freely speak with other about what i have on my mind and what they have on theirs.

I don’t feel like i’ve made use of my younger years, it feels like i still should have all of this time to have fun as a care free teenager when in reality i’m 21 and have to start think about how to start a lifelong career.

I just wish I had a group of friends who i could meet up with all the time whenever we felt like it and who have a passion for similar things to me like movies, clothes, tv, music, wanting to travel etc. The only time i do things with people is either with the person from uni i don’t totally like most of the time or if i practically force the few old high school/college friends to come and do something big enough for them to deem worthy of meeting up for and going out their way to see me."
lonely,No one cares,No one cares - No one cares. It's all a facade. Pretend smiles and how are yous. People talk a good talk about caring but it's always about them. I'm lonely in a crowd anymore. Even the people closest to me don't really seem to care. Taken for granted doesn't feel good. Sigh.

lonely,This Sub: you know what hurts a bit less?,"This Sub: you know what hurts a bit less? - Not having people automatically reel of a bunch of empty one liners and phrases in a bid to console you.

Like, other lonely people here know how unhelpful and invalidating it is to hear:

“it’ll get better soon” “you never know what’s around the corner” “maybe just try not to think about it” “you’ll meet someone, you’re young” “think positive and people will like you”

I always cried as a kid that no one wanted to be my friend, even now I cry that ppl aren't hoping I come around cause they like my presence. When ppl had full group chats and multiple notifications on their Kik I only had two ppl to periodically speak to. Even the childhood friends I've kept into adulthood don't make me feel like a main member in the group, just someone to call if there's an awkward number of ppl on the lunch date or someone flaked and I should fill their place. I think if wasn't consistent in chatting in the group chat they accidently created we wouldn't be speaking as much as we are now.

I only have one friend that actually likes me around, that'll text me first instead of the other way around. We're both just as happy to have each other's presence acknowledged.

I just wished a had more then just one, that I had a group like other ppl or just a handful that appreciate each other so much."

I went from a loving home straight into a young marriage that fell apart a few years ago. Then my family fell apart too. A year later I moved to a new country alone, felt alone but free, and then the pandemic happened. Suddenly, I’ve been down a few years and I’m fighting after touching rock bottom. I self-manage much better these days but I still feel empty because I am alone. I understand I was hard to love a few years ago but that was a while ago already. I’ve been single and with no close friends for so long. I’m not crazy or difficult. I think my heart has hardened. I wonder nowadays if I am stupid, blind, maybe crazy and difficult after all. I can’t be this unlucky. Something is wrong with me and I still don’t know what it is. Some days I chug along just not to hurt anybody with my end. That’s ok. It’s a reason to live. I can do it. We can do it. Better days will come..?"
lonely,I don't remember what it feels like otherwise.,"I don't remember what it feels like otherwise. - I know loneliness doesn't feel exactly the same, but when my family members describe feeling desperately lonely, I can't relate. My sister asked me a few months ago what I do when I need a hug. I said, I guess I just don't need one. I don't really remember feeling any differently; I've never had any sense of belonging, but no desperate sense of loneliness, either. The closest I've read to the way I feel is that if you've always been kind of lonely, you get used to it, and that's just how you think life feels all the time."
lonely,Self inflicted loneliness,"Self inflicted loneliness - Honestly what I’ve found myself using this app for more than anything is venting my feelings to people that will never know my name or be able to find out who I really am. My entire life I’ve never felt comfortable opening up to anyone. I’ve always had confusing emotions and understandable emotions. Either way I’ve never really felt safe to express either. I can’t talk to my mom…she never understands. I can’t talk to my father, he’s never been there for me. And I’m afraid of the consequences of expressing my feelings to anyone outside of that. So I guess Reddit has been my only source of expression. Otherwise I don’t think anyone else would understand me. I’ve always lived a lonely life emotionally"
lonely,i feel like i have no one to rely on,"i feel like i have no one to rely on -  

even though i do have friends in school and outside, i dont feel like we genuinely care for each other at all, its just a ""since we're in the same boat we should chat"" kinda relationship and they dont reply my msgs in the grp chats, when we talk, i dont feel like they care about what i want to say at all, its just ranting abt life and gossiping about others and talking about stuff we saw online, i mean thats pretty normal but i always get cut off and people forget about what i was saying, as if they only listened because they had nothing btr to do, and they only want to talk instead of listen

i dont feel like i have anyone to go to if im breaking down and im feeling hurt, ive tried to post about it sometimes, just to try to get some consoling words i guess, but nobody replied lol, and i just deleted after a few hours, knowing they saw my post and just decided to skip it

and even if i feel like we're pretty close at that moment, my delusion gets all shattered when i realise they have many other friends theyre closer to and im not really important to them, im just one of the ""friends from school"", disposable and insignificant

, i just felt really, like im in the background, im pretty bubbly and funny, but when i feel left out, when i see them take pictures and chit chat without anyone caring if im included or not, i feel so alienated, i feel like i dont belong, and i just sit in a corner and use my phone, nobody really realises either, i dont even wanna cry because no one will care and i can only depend on myself for my happiness"

I've since moved from my home town and I often listen to songs when I'm sad and lonely that remind me of friends. Those songs used to take me back to those good times. But they don't anymore. Now, when I listen to them, I feel nothing. Now I'm sitting alone, listening to songs that used to give me comfort, but they don't anymore.

I can't imagine anyone ever wanting to be with me. day dreaming about laying in bed with someone who genuinely loves me then I realize I'll probably never be able to experience that..

the thing is I don't think I'm ugly. I think I look pretty nice and women online always tell me I have a nice voice. I just don't have any more motivation. I've been rejected  or led on more times than I want to say. I'm terribly insecure about myself so I never have the courage to take anything further than friendships.

About me, I'm a freelance videographer trying to create my own video production business. It's a struggle and I'm broke financially which is stressful, but hey, I enjoy the challenge and the work. In my free time (which I have a lot of) I like to bake (i love cookies, brownies, muffins), go for runs sometimes, spend way too much time on YouTube, occasionally play games, and just spend time with my family. 

90% of the time I just stay at home, since I live alone, it gets lonely. So I'm looking for someone who can give me lots of attention and I'm kinda needy and clingy haha. I have a big heart and a lot of love to give someone, maybe that's you? 🥺

That's enough about me for now, ask questions and I will tell you more haha.

What I'm looking for, is a genuine and caring girl. Someone to give me love and affection, support and encourage me as life is stressful at times. 

Please dont think that I'm shallow 🥺 but physical appearance does matter to me. I'm pretty neat and try to keep in good shape, so prefer someone who is active too!

Send pics pleaseeeeeeeeee and I'll send one back.

Ok bye, I'll go make some blueberry muffins now ☺️"
lonely,existential crisises,"existential crisises - Sometimes I have periods of time when I spend lots of time alone, and this means that I am left in my own thoughts for a very long time.

I am a staunch Christian, but I always look at things from different perspectives. And so I have been thinking a lot about our existence as humans.

So you are telling me that life came into being after single cellular organisms were somehow created and then millions of years down the line we exist. How does this shit even work? How do I... feel

Why am I even here and how am I conscious when I am basically a biological machine. How am I any different from a single cell in terms of consciousness?

I often don't feel real these days after a bad experience with psychedelic drugs which left me in a dissociated state, and this has made me think more about how any moment a nuclear war could start and I would be instantly destroyed in a microsecond, completely deleted from existence. And then what? My body is all I have ever known and without that the whole world stops existing? How does any of this shit work?

In those three years ever person who I had talked to slowly but surely fell out of my life. It’s been a few months now but it has been so hard to keep fighting. The only way I manage is to keep distracted but I think my time is running short. I don’t think there is anyone similar to  me that I could ever have the chance to meet.

lonely,i’m so stressed out.,"i’m so stressed out. - for some backstory, i almost died a couple of days after my birthday last year due to multiple blood disorders and i have never been the same since. i lost so many friends during that time, i just couldn’t believe i was seriously going to die and nobody cared. it led to me being incredibly disabled and developing multiple extreme anxiety disorders. i live with my mom and 3 brothers. my mom did take me to drs appts and hospital during that time but she never really cared and told me that i was the reason she never wanted to be home and didn’t enjoy her life. she didn’t seem sad that her daughter was going to die. my brothers didn’t care either, when i was hospitalized they didn’t notice for days that i was gone and didn’t check on me. 


i was put on bed rest for 10 months and just recently started feeling better in december 2021. during that time, i searched for support and companionship everywhere but could find none and i was so close to ending my own life that i decided to get a cat. i really love him, and he’s the first pet i ever had of my own. but unfortunately, i later found out he himself had severe anxiety and my choices were to give him up or find a companion for him. one of my brothers has a cat here but he was very mean to my cat and making him worse so i got another one, around my birthday this year. they became bonded. without going too much into detail, this kitten is now sick. i’m struggling to raise money for him as my financial situation isn’t pretty and family refuses to help. i feel like i’m going crazy, i just spend all day wondering how i’m going to help him and reaching out to people and making posts to try and get help. i know a lot of people say that if you can’t afford the cat you shouldn’t get one, but if it wasn’t for my cats i would have seriously ended my life a long time ago.

everything is so hard for me, the year that i was sick i honestly didn’t even register that that’s what was happening and now a year later the trauma is really setting in and i am so sad all the time. i keep thinking about how i felt during that time and how people treated me and stuff that i blocked out and don’t even remember experiencing is coming back full force. i really just want to be happy but everything is preventing me from doing so. i just want one thing to be okay. i feel so far away from family and i don’t really have any friends anymore. my cats are all i have and i genuinely don’t think i could go on living without them which sounds so pathetic but what else can i do? i don’t have anyone to talk to but it wouldn’t be like anyone cared in the first place. dealing with these memories and the stress of my sick cat is driving me insane and i’m just so lost and alone. 

thank you if you read to the end and i’m sorry if it’s kind of incoherent and doesn’t make much sense."
lonely,Ambivalence,"Ambivalence - My wife left me a little over a year ago, and it's been a roller coaster. I've had moments of triumph and moments of despair, and everything in between. But the biggest struggle I've had is between wanting another relationship, another person to love, another person to love me and make me feel loved, and wanting to be alone, separate, independent, strong, and willful. 

I never thought of my marriage as limiting in any way, but since I've been on my own again, I can see and appreciate the benefits of solitude. I like listening to what I want to listen to, watching what I want to watch, being into whatever I want, without worrying about disappointing somebody else.

And I also miss sharing all of that with somebody else. But whenever I contemplate seeking another relationship, my fear and apprehension take over, and I retreat back to my comfortable routine. I can't decide whether I want a full romantic dating relationship, a ""fling,"" deep friendship, or chatting buddies. Then, the loneliness slowly creeps in again, and the pattern continues.

Does anybody else experience the tension between desperate loneliness and the comfort of solitude?"

Usually I’m more invested than they are and it ends up with drifting apart. Now all the closeish friendships, I have left are ppl who are in constant cycles of drama and only reach out when they want help. I’m sure they would help if I reached out to them for something but I want friends who are about more than just problem sharing. I was thinking to make an effort to connect with some ppl I know but am not overly close to but held back because there’s certain characters which I know I’d have to be very patient with. Really I just want some uplifting fun, inspiring friends where we can support each other at times of need but mostly just boost each other and be ppl I’d look forward to seeing. Sometimes I feel like my current friends just see me as a free therapist- im happy to help but because they’re all the same I have no escape but to be alone. Am I being horrible?"
lonely,Loving Highschool for sure :|,"Loving Highschool for sure :| - I always hate talking about myself because I feel like I’m so well, cringe, to put it in simple language, but today just sucked so I thought after 3 years maybe I should write like my teachers say. 

Yesterday I took off because we do nothing all day, and I mean from 8:10 to 2:55 I’m on my phone for over half of that wasting away, So I had an off day. Later that day my mom wanted to take me to see a band we both like, Royal Blood to be exact. I was pretty excited and I had a good time in the end, but for most of the show I felt very empty and lost. My mom spent the time talking to her work friends so I just kinda stood there for 3 hours in a constant state of anxiety while seeing all the laughing couples walk by, knowing I don’t have anyone to share my interests with.

Now we come to today, I really didn’t want to go to school again but I thought “I just bought a really cool Royal Blood t shirt from the concert, People will love my shirt” well wrong. I guess I was hoping to strike up a conversation with someone about the band as, well, I never talk to anyone in general. All I got today was the most sarcastic “woah that shirt is so fire, aren’t you burning up” from my A hole “ex friend” turned hype beast. His other friend asks where I got it, I said “oh it’s from a concert” but he was already talking to his boys and ignoring me, reinforcing the sarcasm of the whole interaction. Get this, he then comes back and asks for money, what a jerk. 

So today I went in hoping someone would find me tasteful enough with my Royal Blood shirt and music interests to want to talk, but instead I rotted away for another 6 hours doing nothing. 

I’m usually pretty confident but after today I just feel hurt, I went back to school so excited as online school meant I hadn’t had friends in 3 years almost (I lost all of mine before the quarantine) but I’m ending it with no one remembering my name.

Not sure why I wrote this but if you’re if there reading this, have a blessed day."
lonely,Scared to leave…hope?,"Scared to leave…hope? - 
So I lay down on my bed imagining being on the 4th floor of the building. In my mind I jump. I don’t feel a tightness in my chest, a pain in my stomach. This feeling of sadness and loneliness. This feeling of helplessness. Like I’m never coming out of this. This disappointment. How I disappoint myself, how I never achieve anything I ever want to do. I fail regardless I put effort and if I don’t. But in my head, I don’t feel this disappointment. I don’t think I’m disappointing myself or my gf. She’s happy, I’m happy. I’m not failing this fucking engineering major. I’m not disappointing my parents. I’m not disappointing God with my failed spiritual life. I’m not disappointing anyone. I’m not feeling anything bad, I’m not feeling anything. The darkness. It’s calming at first. Then it’s dreadful. What if it’s just darkness. Forever. What if I could have done it and I’m just being lazy. I could just study more, I could just put more conscious effort to my time with God, I could just be smarter with how I spend money or use my time, I could be better with my partner. Am I being ungrateful? Hating a life some would dream to have. Kill to get this opportunities. There it is again. The pain, the dread, the hurt, the loneliness. To whoever reading this. I doubt it makes sense. If you can make it stop. Tell me how. I do imagine jumping but then after I jump, I always regret jumping. What if it changes, what if I get happy, and then what if I don’t? Each day is like this. I wake up and see reasons why I don’t want to go on anymore and then right at the end. It comes. The reasons I should stay. The hope. The possibilities. 
I don’t want to disappoint anyone anymore. I want it to stop
How can I be scared of death and want it at the same time?
Maybe I am crazy. Yet another crazy ungrateful Gen Z jumping on the suicide buzz, desperate for attention.

Why bring this here? Why not leave it in my notes like the rest. Yeah. Desperate for attention"

lonely,He doesn’t know how much I think about him,"He doesn’t know how much I think about him - it hurts it hurts it hurts. He’s so sweet and he shows me he cares in some ways. But I feel like he never gave me enough reassurance to know that he truly thought about me like how he lives rent free in my mind. I have OCD and while I was having a panic attack I literally had an image of him repeating in my head (this is a type of OCD thing if you didn’t know) and it was so upsetting to me. I wish he knew that I’ve cried over him. I wish he knew that I never told any of my close friends embarrassing or personal details about him because I respect his privacy, but that I do find myself saying his name just because so many things remind me of him. He’s special to me, and the interactions we’ve had feel new and exciting. I have no idea how special I am to him. I have no idea if me asking if he’s ok or if me saying that I’m always there for him means anything to him. If someone said that to me, I’d feel so special. But for him, it’s hard to read if he finds it endearing or if it was just strange about how much I cared about him just based off of me worrying about his mental health right off the bat. Our lives have some parallels, and I thought that was special. I thought us moving back home due to mental health issues and somehow meeting each other was special. I thought that us meeting before class and then ending up sitting across from each other and in the same group was special. He’s so hard to read, but I can’t stop feeling like there’s a strong possibility that I was special to him only in a way that I was a random girl who took interest in him quickly and that might not happen often with him. I wish he would communicate his feelings and intentions and opinions in a way that makes me understand his perspective on us more. We aren’t together, but we definitely like each other? Was liking me not special to him? I rarely like anyone ever. I’m sorry if you read this entire rant, i don’t know what’s wrong with me"

I've never been in couple or kissed, never cared about the social pressure of losing your viriginity as early as you can.

But I feel the desire to get intimate with someone now. I want to care about someone else for once. I know I'm not mentally stable yet and I can't find someone right tomorrow. I struggle with self love. But I hope once I graduate highschool I can begin having a sexual and romantic life because the void is honestly unbarable. 

I feel the need to hug someone in bed at night. To which my mom said we should just get a cat. Maybe she's right? Lol"

Someone was messing with me from here (I think) - Not gonna say their username, but, if they can't even say my name, then they're not someone from my past, right? There's logically no gain in not saying my name to confirm that you know me. 

But there were some real coincidences that were messing with my mind (I won't say what). But they were very unpleasant to me by asking me why I was lonely, then following that up with saying ""good"" and so on. I'm pretty confused. They haven't blocked me, despite eventually telling me to leave them alone. This is odd to me. 

I don't think it's her, but really, the coincidences are messing with my- no, it could also be another ex, or that ex's friend, because something similar happened like five-six years ago, and I knew who that was. But there are big coincidences,

The person from this sub said ""again"" in reference to communicating with me like this. But they must be someone random exploiting my paranoia.

Who would be vindictive to want to be happy that I'm not doing well? 

It's a troll, right?"

Imagine my emotions when a couple hours after I log into my computer to see that they’re friends again and they talked for several hours. I’ll never be good enough. Even though I can get attention from men, it’s not the attention that I want and I never entertain any of them because of that. He might not get a lot of attention of girls, but he has someone who he’s had experiences with that I’ll never be able to have with him. I wish someone would love me like how a boyfriend loves a girlfriend in a committed relationship. I guess even the sweet quiet people still have the potential to do cruel things, even if it was unintentional, I’m still hurt that I was never good enough and that she was probably in his mind the whole time. He must have been too cowardly to outright ghost me or to tell me he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore, and that makes the situation hurt even more"

lonely,Would really appreciate it if you't read it the whole way through. And/Or see TLDR if necessary.,"Would really appreciate it if you't read it the whole way through. And/Or see TLDR if necessary. - I'm weird-looking due to a genetic disorder (get stared at/talked about. Sad thing: my parents and my sister are good looking. My dad has the mildest form, I have a more severe one. Chance of child getting it is 50%..... 75% of this half have a mild form. I have a more severe one.

My problem: weird facial structure and head shape due to hormonal imbalance and abnormal facial-bones growth, typical for disease. Surgery is too risky, and results are limited. Talked to 3 surgeons already. I have a strange voice that sometimes makes people laugh, and I have extreme difficulty in conversations, have been doing behavioral therapy for two years now, and even if I gave it my best, I'm not making progress. Due to my disorder, I can barely build up muscles. Whenever I try or go out, I get stared at or talked about. I'm also short, only 5'4... instead of 5'11 I would have been without the disorder. I'm 25 years old. Which also makes me really sad, I'm closer to 30 than to 20. Surgery is too risky and expensive, and results are limited because the parts that need surgery are practically impossible to improve with today's (+/- 10 years) technology. And now my mom says I have to leave home (I'm 25), because I'm always letting out my frustration on her (which is wrong obviously). I can't survive on my own, have nobody else. I begged her, but she said enough is enough.

An example (this makes me even sadder than I was before):

There's this 23-year old girl I'm following on Instagram – she's 3/4 Eastern European, and I think 1/4 Korean. She's the most beautiful woman I have ever ""seen"" – and she also seems genuinely nice in her videos when she's talking; she doesn't fake at all, like many other Instagram influencers/models etc. I will never get a girlfriend, let alone her. And this keeps me up at night, has been for the past 8 months. And I can't let things go, even with THERAPY and MEDS. I just can't. Things follow me around for YEARS – I'm studying online now but failed to get into the college I wanted to (this was four years ago). I'm working on it with therapy, but to no avail. But not being able to ""be hers"" makes me so sad. I cry at random times. I have finals in two weeks, can barely study. After my finals comes the summer break. I'll just not get out of bed. And hope not be ""sent"" to the psych ward by my mom. I am so so sad. I have no hope for my future. None.

**TLDR –** Am strange looking (Surgery is too risky) and only 5'4 due to genetic disorder. Bad social skills not improving despite therapy. I'm already 25, haven't had friends for 11 years (which is ok) and never will get (never had) a girlfriend. As I can't let go of things, despite therapy, what worsens my depression is that I'll never be the boyfriend of this 23-year old (same height) girl/model from Eastern-Europe I'm following. She's not fake as almost any other instagram model. So this will follow me around for years. I don't have the looks, nor the height, nor the social skills, nor am I in the right part of the world. This has worsened my depression. I have zero hope, and don't have any reason to be hopeful."

Whenever I get these episodes my anxiety hits peak and off late i have been feeling that I will be a burden to anyone who loves me because of this.


I have never been in a serious relationship until now. I was so much in love with a girl 2 years ago. But she kept leading me on for a year, was very abusive and dumped me in the end. I am still very angry at myself for allowing myself to be treated that way. 

 I have never hugged anyone in my life before. I can't stop craving for affection now. I wish I had someone who would ask me how my day went, someone who would hold my hand, wish me good morning and night. Someone who would laugh with me.

lonely,I was much better at the socializing thing just a couple years ago....,"I was much better at the socializing thing just a couple years ago.... - So, when I was younger i was extremely outgoing and easy to talk to. I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to hear your story. Most vitally, i suppose, I wanted to listen. 

I was and still am rather handsome too. Had a healthy sex life, used to go out and live a positive life as best i could. But slowly, time just took the wind out of my sails. 

I reflect often on some of the girls who were obviously into me and I just.......didnt capitalize on. Didn't have the energy or the desire to pursue further. A defeatist attitude that they don't deserve. And neither do I. 

Call it what you will. Being insensitive, being an asshole, being stuck up. Its probably all true and then some. I have no intention of hurting anyone's feelings. But i just cant keep up the charade of interest or fascination I once could. Like, I dont go off insulting or giving cold shoulders and shit like that. Just exhausted with the routine. 

I still WANT to socialize, I just really wished i enjoyed it as much as i did once, maybe the problem is i personally believe finding people.you genuinely click with is so difficult these days. Maybe its the cynic in me, but if you told me based on what youve I probably dodnt deserve to be happy based on my attitude, I guess I'd tend to agree 🤷‍♂️"

My issue is that my whole life I've been keeping my distance with mostly females not because I want too more of a had too and now days am craving the emotional needs that you get from that side. To be honest I have few amazing friends but, I've always kept a part of me away from them a part I don't feel comfortable sharing a part that shows weakness. I realized that after I pushed away a friend that I met online she was awesome and we had lots of things we shared to each other. I wanted more of that naturally but I couldn't so I pushed her away from my life because I want more and I know she wants the friendship as it is. So I left her be entirely so I don't hurt her and only hurt myself keeping my secret with me. You can call this selfish from your pov but you know less then I do. Now days I keep even a bigger distance from anyone that can get close because eventually I might hurt. So now I'll just be clear with everyone I want a friend that I can share my days with and not be holding back my feelings. If you still reading and wandering why I don't just try to put myself out there is I'm religious so I couldn't really do what most people can and I still can't but will do anyways.

Since the last time we’ve hung out, I’ve asked her a couple times to do something (maybe once every week or two), and she always says something along the lines “I’m about to go to bed” or “I’m too tired”.

We told each other and felt that we were ""The One"" and we even talked about marriage and I got to meet her mum. Long story short, she broke up with me, because she's been going through depression for years now, on top of that she have a lot of family related stuff going on that kept piling on top of her already existing problems... she broke up saying that it wasn't me that she doesn't like, but everything that's going on, and doesn't know if she would ever get better... She would mentioned from time to time through the years we were together about how she would feel bad that she couldn't be there for me, because of her situations, but I reassure her that I would always be there for her even if she couldn't be there for me. Even when we couldn't have sex for years and yes you read that right, yearsss of no sex, that didn't bother me at all. I stayed loyal and faithful to her, because I truly love her with all my heart. Now my heart is in pain and I feel so lost... I don't resent her or blame her or anything... I only ever wanted for her was to be happy and that was the only thing I ever wanted from her. Just seeing her smile was enough for me. I stayed with her for 7 years through her depression and been friends even longer.

Now I feel lost and not sure what to do with the rest of my life... when you found ""The One"", then lost ""The One"" and know that nobody else in this life would be able to make your heart feel like that again... how are you able to live the rest of your life now and not decide to end it now, since you already know that nothing else in life will be better than what you already got to experience and lost?

Edit: I never had trouble meeting girls, it's just that she was the first and only one that I felt it in my heart. When you feel it in your heart you just know that they are the one. They don't need to do anything to make you happy and all you want is for them to be happy. When they are sad you are sad and when they are happy, you are happy. When you meet the one you don't need money or sex or any reason to want to be with them. I guess a good example is when you have kids and you love them, you just want to be there for them and see them happy, because their happiness is your happiness.

Forgot to mentioned... I even turned down a chance to inherit a multi million dollar company for love."

lonely,It really kills you,"It really kills you - Not only is it the alienation that has you outside the border of camaraderie and fellowship. That alone reduces you on the inside, especially when you’re away from home and don’t have the opportunity to build a home elsewhere. It’s also the constant rejection of never being invited into the topic, the conversation, the discussion that has everyone involved and contributing except you.

No one wants you to contribute because they don’t expect anything valuable from you. Your take on a situation is nothing more than a mildly annoying distraction. Like they feel obligated to acknowledge you when they really don’t want to. As if you’re wholly and inherently valueless. This is how they see you. And that’s why they don’t ask you to hangout with them.

And returning to the familiar isolation is the is your go-to refuge but you still hear them talk and laugh. They enjoy that they’re accompanied. They always belong and always linger to participate before leaving for their duties. But no one ever lingers for me. I hate when they walk in on me in the common kitchen to grab a snack or make coffee because I know that’s all they’re there for. They won’t make conversation with me. Only a greeting that is so insincere and unenthusiastic. And then they leave. And it burns that they see how alone I am and how unimportant or uninteresting of an opportunity it is to talk to me. They make their cup of coffee and leave - and return to their friends. I return to my office alone.

And your voice - your voice is so insignificant. You try to break through the chatter with inquiries and comments just so you can gauge if they actually care that you’re there, but most times they really don’t hear you. And the sentence you formed just evaporates. When they’re done with the topic at hand, you’re so desperate to be acknowledged that you take advantage of the momentary silence to make another comment. But they still don’t look at you, let alone reply.

No one understands how much pain I am in. If they really have disdain for my company and it’s not all in my head, it is certain that they don’t know I suffer. Suicidal ideation is triggered. Depression closes in on me. The hope to exist and live for things is diminished beyond clarity. I don’t want to be here but I don’t have a choice. I can’t leave and must bear this hell. They have each other. I have no one."

lonely,Feeling like i’m unlovable or that there is smth wrong with me?,"Feeling like i’m unlovable or that there is smth wrong with me? - 
For most of my life i (f 18) have never dated anyone. I’ve had a few encounters with boys when i was younger (early freshmen year/ middle school) where we were “talking” but nothing more then that. That was all before i realized i was lesbian though so my brain doesn’t really count it. Besides that i’ve never had any romantic relationship before and honestly it kinda hurts. All my friends are dating and it just makes me wonder, what’s wrong with me? Why does no one seem to like me i’ve cycle through different styles, hair colors, aesthetics, and at this point i just feel like there’s something wrong with me to make no one really like me. I just feel like maybe i am unlovable. Right now im not looking to date due to mental health reasons (going thru anorexia recovery so id like to focus on that first) but honestly it just makes me feel like i’ll probably be alone forever. Sorry if this post is like sad or pathetic sounding that’s not my intention. I have friends and they’re great and ik they like me but never having anyone romantically like you just kinda impacts you in a special kinda way, you know? even my parents where never very emotionally involved in my life which just adds fuel to the fire. Does anyone relate? At this point i feel like i should just give up on tryna date at all maybe it’s just not in my future?"

lonely,I think I missed something in my life,"I think I missed something in my life - Hi everyone! I'm in my early 20s, male and gay. I've been lonely my whole life and felt not wanted. I was bullied or always went with the wrong crowd because the right crowds would never accept me. I'm just an outcast or a label.

I had an old friend group that I miss, but not for the right reasons. People being racist and overly crude to each other, people and the world. However, I felt like I was something and it cured my loneliness for awhile superficially.

I just want a friend who I can feel is truly my friend and I'm comfortable with. I'm always known as the gay person or the annoying guy and it's hard to find people who well... vibe. I feel extremely alone because of it. I'm so jealous of watching groups be so chill with each other and I want that. Badly.

Recently, I learned I potentially have autism which could explain my lack of positive social encounters (still testing) but I'm trying very hard to understand people. Idk this is just a rant and if anyone reads this, feel free to ask questions or have your say. Something just tells me to put something like this out there."
lonely,"I don't know what my life has become. I'm not comfortable around anyone, and I barely ever leave my room. I'm not even comfortable around the people in my own house.","I don't know what my life has become. I'm not comfortable around anyone, and I barely ever leave my room. I'm not even comfortable around the people in my own house. - For many years I've struggled with social anxiety, but it has recently become so much worse. 

It all started in January of 2016 when I was in 6th grade. School became too much for me, so I stopped going and did virtual learning instead. I continued to do this until the fall of 2019 when I finally felt confident enough to go back. The first couple of months were relatively good, but I still struggled a lot socially. I barely talked, was terrified of everyone, and I had no friends. Then a couple months later the pandemic started, which ruined everything completely. I did virtual for another year and a half, then attempted to go back to school again in the fall of 2021. It went horribly, and my anxiety got the best of me. I called home nearly everyday until I stopped going altogether. 

Now I have no confidence or self-esteem at all, and I'm too afraid to go anywhere in public. I've missed multiple appointments because I got too scared and chickened out. I'm 18 now, and the whole situation worries me because I can't do anything for myself. I don't know how to drive, I've never had a job, and it's been years since I've had friends. I'm also extremely self-conscious about my appearance. My family always makes it a point to tell me how handsome I am, but it never helps. More than anything, I'm afraid that I'll never have a girlfriend and that I'll die alone. The only thing I truly want to experience is being in love with another person. I just hate myself so much sometimes. It all feels so hopeless.

Something else I forgot to mention is that my dad abused me when I was a child, and I'm pretty sure a lot of what I'm going through has to do with that. 

Sorry for any grammatical errors, I know I'll probably feel self-conscious about that after posting. I just wanted to speak my mind and let everything out because I'm just so tired of being alone."

I’m sure now that game is contaminated with the memories of her. I can never play that game with him without thinking of him and her getting achievements in the game for the first time. Them talking about getting married in the game. Them talking about starting a family in the game. He’s not even my first love since I’ve never been romantically in love, but I wish we could have tried to fall in love with eachother and be each other’s firsts in that sense. Yes we lost our virginity to each other I guess? But she took something from him that I can never have. That part of him where he was with her will always be inside of him. We never dated or anything. We’re just a little more than friends. I’m ok not dating or putting labels on anything, I just want affection from him.

What if I’m not a dad? What if I don’t have a family? What if I don’t have a girl that wants to start a family with me? What if I don’t have a girl, at all? What if I’m simply just a guy with a phone on my hand?"

After I’ve experienced falling asleep next to someone while holding them and them holding me, I wish I could do that every night. It just doesn’t feel the same holding a stuffed animal. It would make falling asleep so much more easier if I was holding a real person. I wish I could hear and feel someone breathing. I wish I could smell their skin and sweat. I wish I could lay on their chest and talk to them and feel them speak while also hearing their heartbeat. I’m typing this out while I’m exhausted but I’m too anxious to sleep because of my stressful thoughts going through my head. I wish I could hold someone and comfort them and worry about them so that I don’t have to worry about the things affecting my life. I wish I wasn’t so lonely. Life would be so much easier"

I'm heartbroken. It's not really the first time, but ever since having my first gf in middle school, every time I'm single ultimately feels like I'm in hell- well, more like hell is inside of me. No, even before that- middle school before that time was my ultimate low, and im back at that feeling again for the first time for a long period of time.

Before he went to sleep I asked for a kiss goodnight and he said I made loving me feel like a chore. Apparently he doesn’t want me to seek out affection or attention but I feel like a ghost in my own relationship. Before I was with him I’d seek negative attention online but I obviously stopped that when we got together but now I can go entire days without speaking to anyone. I’ve been sleeping on the couch to try to get any acknowledgment but he hasn’t said anything about it, I don’t even know if he’s really noticed. It hurts. He shuts down any discussion about our relationship and where it’s heading he gets annoyed when I tell him I don’t feel seen. He thinks I want him to shut down everything else and just focus on me and I can’t make him understand it’s not all or nothing. I just want a hug but I can’t ask for one."

But all I feel constantly is that everyone around me dislikes me, and it heavily frustrates me. I feel self conscious when doing anything in public. I feel uncomfortable in positive situations. I think too rationally to do stupid things like drink or take drugs, neither of which are any good without friends.

 I don't even feel very suicidal, I just don't think there's any particularly strong emotions or interesting events in my future. Frustrating how I'm trapped in the current state of society where I'm expected to work, fall in love, make friends, and die. I can barely do the first."

I can send a message to someone, just asking how's it goin or even hi, and never get a response back. If I run into anyone while I'm out they're in a hurry to go on with their day, promise to get in touch but never do. In that instance I feel like a huge bother if I try to contact them first, so I just leave it be. 

At my old job I had gone to a company dinner, where I tried being a part of a few conversations (about topics I was really interested in) and was ignored/talked over. I ended up leaving early and no one noticed I was gone. When Monday rolled around, hardly anyone remembered that I was even there. 

I just wish someone would look at me, see me, and say ""that's my person"". Platonic or not. I just don't want to be invisible anymore..."

A little later he sent me a private message and we both bonded over having no friends. It was very refreshing to open up to someone who had the same problems as myself. After just a few days, I grew attached to our friendship and I even apologized to him if I seemed clingy. He was kind enough to reassure me that it was okay and he was happy with our friendship. He did mention to me he was quite busy with work, so that it wasnt his intention to reply late. I understood him completely so I didn't bother him when he did not reply to my messages after. Eagerly waiting for his reply, I was dismayed that he wasn't able to get back to me even after a full day had passed. The next day, I found out he blocked me. 

Even as I write this, I'm amazed how affected I am by this entire thing, seeing as how we only knew each other for 5 days.This is the first time I felt such a closeness to someone within days because it's the first time I've been so open and vulnerable to a complete stranger. And it was nice to see my vulnerability reciprocated with his own, as he shared very personal things about himself, too. Unfortunately I'll just have to charge this to experience, which means I'll have to keep my guard up even in this Reddit, where i thought we were all going through the same things (abondment issues, trust issues, severe loneliness, depression, etc).

To the person who blocked me, if you're reading this, I'm sorry if i said anything to offend or hurt you. Thank you for the 5 days that you allowed myself to open up to you, and you to me. I wish you all the best in life."

I’ve been constantly molested and forced to do constant disgusted things to my brother when when I was 5 years old with my younger sister. It stopped when I was about 12. I was raped by my dad. I told my mom and she never believed me and shut me out. My younger sister was scared to speak up until 2 years ago. I’ve been in 2 very abusive relationships but I still felt like myself after my first one. Let’s call my first boyfriend Jake.. Jake used to stalk me, hit me, and blackmail me, but after I left I still felt somewhat like myself. About a year later I dated my high school crush and I’ll call him Tim. Tim emotional abuse me, cheat on me, steal my money, steel my roommates money and tell me I wasn’t good enough. One night I just wanted friends, Tim lived in my apartment rent free.. but the apartment in front of me there was a person that I knew there. I wanted to be able to feel like a human being for once and chill with friends. My roommate had some alcohol that he gave to me. I mixed gin with some sprite in those 16 oz bottle. I went up there and hung out with my friend. We were chatting and having a good time until a bunch of boys came In. I felt the vibe and wanted to go back home. My friend forced me to stay and I didn’t want to. At this point I was a bit tipsy. I was 19 years old at the time. Me rushing into the bathroom telling myself to go home, trying to build up the courage too because I’m a very shy person and was scared of my friend. I came back out telling her I should get back home but she insisted and overpowered me, forcing me back on the couch. She had my bottle of sprite with the gin in it, telling me to finish it and to loosen up. I grabbed the bottle trusting her, I took a sip out of it, making her happy. The boys wanted to play truth or dare, and I kept asking for truth, I didn’t want to any dares because I was scared. My friend picked dare at one point. But at the time my I felt sick and stuck at the same time. I had tunnel vision, all I remember was falling to the ground. It was like every time I opened my eyes I was being grouped. I remember being dragged into a room by a boy, him on top of me. I couldn’t move, scream, cry.. I remember waking up with no clothes on. Running home with just a dirty blanket I found in the room. I ran home crying to Tim. Telling him I was raped. He looked at me and said “no you weren’t, no one would rape you, look at you.” From there, I just knew I wasn’t worth anything. I don’t remember what the guy who raped me looks like everything was so dark. And then it broke me down so hard mentally. It’s been 4 years and I think about it every day. Im alone. I don’t feel like I’m good enough. Im always compared to my sisters, I’m always viewed as the crazy one. No one ever listens to me. I want to be fine but I’m not. Im not okay, I have no one, I gone through this all alone and I want to kill myself. I want to stand in front of a train and end it all. Everyone that I loved turned against me. After all I’ve done for them. I’ve tried talking to therapist but I can’t tell them how I actually feel because they sent me to inpatient hospitals and how is that helping someone. People that I’ve worked with viewed me as a very happy bubbly person, when I’m reality I want to jump in front of a train and end it all. No one cares about me. No one ever will."

We haven't spoke in a couple months which is odd in itself, and one of his last messages said "" I'm always here for you, you know that"". Referring to my dad having cancer. So now a few months and radio silence from him. Then yesterday I realize he has unfriended me in fb. Now, to me, you  unfriend someone who has been harassing you, or is toxic, just someone you want to cut ties to.  So this has thrown me for a loop.  I messaged him asking if everything is OK, and he's never opened the message. What could this be? What is he thinking?"
lonely,hit a new low today,"hit a new low today - I started dating this woman a few years ago. She was younger than me and married, but she said they were separated and getting a divorce. I really should've known better, but I'd had this instant connection with her.

The problem was, she was always too busy for me. And I'm not a ""you have to spend all day every day at my side or else"" kinda guy. I mean I'd see her once every two weeks, maybe. She'd always make plans with me, then blow me off to go hang out with her friends instead. But I'm not the most mentally healthy person, so I just took it.

She'd break up with me, then beg me to take her back, over and over for about a year and a half. Finally, about 2 years ago, I told her I wasn't going to do it again. If she wanted to be with me, be with me. I'm too tired to go chasing people around if they don't wanna be there. Lo and behold, she left a couple weeks later. When she asked to come back a few days after, I told her no. And that wasn't easy. 

So she spends a few months trying to win me back, and I tell her okay, but she has to stop blowing me off and she has to get a divorce. She does neither, instead telling me things like ""if I really loved her, I'd just take her back without making her do all these things."" She'd always have an excuse, too. She couldn't afford the divorce (she had thousands in savings that she blew on other people's Amazon wishlists), her husband would take away her kids (he had seen them all of 3 weekends after he'd moved out when we started dating), she just didn't have the time to see me (but she'd fuck off to her friends who lived like 400 miles away or take a random road trip to Arizona for fun). I didn't ask to be her #1 priority, but I wasn't even on the list.

I tried spending time with her kids, that way she couldn't use them as an excuse. And they loved me. But she only let that happen a few times before she stopped letting me see them. She'd always talk about getting married and being a family, but wouldn't let me be a part of her family. Looking back, I see it was just some fucked up emotional manipulation. She wanted me to miss her, so She'd intentionally stay away. 

The worst was we'd talked about having a kid together. But during that time I wouldn't take her back, she stopped talking to me and went out and intentionally got pregnant by someone else. As soon as she got that positive pregnancy test back, though, she was asking for me to take her back and help raise her new daughter. And I almost did right then. But she still refused to even let me come over to her place to see her. God, writing this all out just makes me feel even more pathetic. 

So a year and a half after I initially told her I wasn't taking her back, she's finally gotten a divorce. I still barely see her but she's got a newborn, so I figure that's the reason. She says she's changed and it's unfair of me not to let her prove that to me. So I say ""you're right, you deserve a chance to show me you've changed."" This was a week before Christmas. 

I see her a couple times, but she's always busy. At first its the holidays. Then she just doesn't feel well. Then she's just busy or can't find a babysitter. I even tell her she doesn't need a sitter, the whole point is us becoming a family,  but she still blows off. Then she took another week-long, impromptu road trip with her sister to New Mexico, still blowing me off when she gets back. She'd lived in this apartment now for over a year and I've never even been there, I don't even know the address because she wouldn't tell me. At this point I hadn't seen her in over 5 weeks. So I break it off. I get the ""if you really loved me you'd stay"" talk again, but I'm not falling for it this time. I say no.

She goes ahead and starts immediately dating her neighbor. I'm pretty sure she was dating him, or at least fucking him, during the time we were supposed to be together. Whatever, I'm done trying to force a relationship she obviously doesn't want, no matter what she says. Fast forward about 6 weeks and I find out she is having a hard time. Got evicted, got her kids taken away, is living in her car, can only shower and do laundry once a week at her friend's house because no one will take her in. So I check up on her like once or twice a week for the last 2 or 3 weeks. Just asking if she needs anything, some extra blankets, if she has enough food, etc etc. Not asking if she wants a place to stay or anything, but if she needs to do a load of clothes and wants to wash up, she can come by so its not just once a week she's washing her ass. And its been cordial, no fighting, but also very clear that this is just me being a concerned friend and definitely not wanting to go back to her. So today I just say ""hey, I know you're trying to get your mom to take you in, let me know what happens. I figure someone should be looking out for you."" She sends me a picture of her in bed with her shirtless boyfriend saying ""don't worry, he is."" 

Oh! And she also told me when I first found out she was homeless that he ""accidentally"" punched her in the left eye so hard it's done permanent damage to her vision and the same night got her black our drunk and took videos of him banging her unconscious body.

But back to the picture. Was that necessary? Why rub my face in it like that? There was no reason for it. I tried to help, I gave her an open offer if she needed it, talked to her and tried to cheer her up. And she was fine with all that for the first few weeks. But then suddenly just feeling the need to remind me she's moved on? Especially with some douche that does shit like that to her? Sending me a picture like that? I guess I'm lucky she wasn't blowing him or something in the picture. Like ""well I guess I can go fuck MYSELF for showing concern. I'm glad he's in your corner, even though he won't let you stay with him besides coming over to fuck him and then go sleep in your car."" Yes, thats right, she's still living in her car because he won't put her on his lease. So he fucks her and then she goes and sleeps in her car on the street.  So I just said ""well thanks for that, good luck"" and blocked her. 

I dont know what the point of this story was. I think I just needed to get it all out. You'd think it'd help, but it didn't. I don't miss her or want her back, I'm not a fucking idiot. But just the fact that she'd treat someone she used to ""love,"" especially one who was still willing to try and help her after the fact, that she'd treat someone with such disdain is just shocking to me. I guess writing it down and seeing it, she always treated me horribly, but I guess I just kept giving her the benefit of the doubt that she would change for the better. 

I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub for this."
lonely,"It’s been well over a year since i had a conversation with a woman, and idk if i could even talk to one at this point","It’s been well over a year since i had a conversation with a woman, and idk if i could even talk to one at this point - The post is basically in the title. Thankfully I’ve managed to spend my time working on school and hobbies, and more recently I’ve started job hunting again. Tbh, this isn’t even really about dating or relationships or whatever, but more-so that i’ve missed out on communicating with the entire other half of humanity for a long time now. I don’t know if this is me overthinking, but it seems like there aren’t really any social environments where it’s appropriate to just strike up a convo w a girl, except for maybe bars or on dating apps, neither of which sound appealing or good for my mental health. Idk, i just want to be able to talk to a person of the opposite sex without feeling like a total creepazoid. Idk tho, maybe casual conversation isn’t what’s best at this point. I should be going to the therapist that my friends are going to and see if i have any luck there. Thank you for reading my weird, uncomfortable rant"
lonely,Lonely but not alone.,"Lonely but not alone. - I have a husband, a “partner”, a “lover”, an “admirer”…or so I thought.  Being lonely but not really alone is the worst feeling in the world.  

Me and my little daughter will be just fine.  Life together with her is fantastic. 

Life sucks."
lonely,Lonely after losing partner to suicide,"Lonely after losing partner to suicide - I’ve been sort of lonely since I moved for school two years ago, but for a little over a year, I’d (26F) been dating a guy (33M) who had PTSD, severe chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. Despite all this, I fell for him; we always had a good time when we talked and hung out. Then around the six or seven month mark, he started talking about suicide more, saying he didn’t know how much longer he could wait, crying, asking if I would be there with him when he did it. He attempted a month ago, then I tried to distance myself. I told him it was all too much for me emotionally (it was). Then, he committed suicide last weekend.

Now I’m back home with family in another state, but I’m feeling more alone than ever. I’m regretting the things I didn’t say, feeling guilty, missing him, wishing I had someone to talk to (specifically him). I’m scared to go back where I live. I don’t want to be alone. He was the only person who got rid of my loneliness. Every other person I see or talk to does nothing or helps a very small amount. He was my friend, my best friend, really. I’ll probably attend suicide survivor groups when I get back, and I’m already in counseling. It just hurts. He was my favorite person to talk to, even with his issues. I’m sad I have to be alone now. It’s too hard being alone. I might have to get a cat. I keep checking my phone, but there’s nothing there. Occasionally a friend texts, but I only want to talk to him. 

Anyway, I’d take any advice or comforting thoughts or good wishes or anything that could possibly make me feel better about another shitty life event and the loss of my future and best friend. Thanks, everyone!"
lonely,Happy birthday to me……,"Happy birthday to me…… - My birthday is Saturday and I’ll be 20 and god I feel so lonely. I don’t have any friends in real life. I have a few online friends but I’m done being their friend because it’s not the same and I’ll never meet them. It makes me even more lonely to talk to them. I’ve never been asked out (I did but the person did it as a joke) in my entire life. It’s so pathetic to be almost 20 and have no friends and never have been in a relationship. Life would be better if I was dead. I got my first tattoo a few days ago and that made me happy but my life is meaningless. I’ve never had a job and I can’t get one bc of family drama. I am in college and plan on minoring in something(I’m majoring in creative writing rn). My goal is to be a professional and hopefully a famous author. I want to complete my goals but how can I when life is bleak. I wish I could go back to the past because if I never left the place that had tons of opportunities available for me, I wouldn’t be depressed. I would still have all my friends and be happy. But life happened and I moved and fucking died on the inside. I guess happy birthday to a shit fuck that is me…fucking hate life. 

I wished my life was better but I pushed through and hoped and hoped but it’s still not better. Wishing and hoping doesn’t do shit. I’ll be 20 and a pathetic loser. I wasted my teen years but I had really no friends in highschool. Never got to do fun stuff as a teen or fall in love. I was bullied a lot in school even abused by teachers. It’s funny how shitty my life is because it seems impossible to have this shitty of a life for years. When I was younger, I thought I would have tons of friends, a boyfriend and living on my own by the age of 20 but that’s not happening. This is the worst birthday I have to live through. I wish I could be taken away from this horrible life."

Clerks and service workers or the occasional stranger on the trail are the only ones I interact with if you call that interacting. Just the hollow platitudes society expects of us. I do talk to my family but not in person since they are far away. Besides them no one has a genuine interest of any kind toward me since 2018. Occaisionally a few random people texted me but only if they wanted or needed something, and those have disappeared by now too.

Then he told told me yesterday that he was happy until he wasn’t. He said he felt that way for a while and just didn’t tell me. I wish he talked to me about it. I can’t bear to see him. I don’t know what to do, I’m taking it rough and I’m already a lonely and depressed person. I have no friends, my family can only do so much as they have their own lives. I work all day, everyday, by myself detailing cars for a dealership because no one else will stay. I started taking him to my gym, I loved it because I stopped going for the longest time. I genuinely asked him if he would start going back to the gym he went to before, he of course, said no. (yes, I know it’s a freaking lot to ask of someone) I don’t want to go there anymore. I’ve lost all of my motivation. I’m terrified of seeing him there. 

Tl;dr - I just need someone to talk to."

lonely,things are very weird rn,"things are very weird rn - So, it's back... Kinda (the loneliness). I've been suffering from it for most of my life, sometimes it was easier other times it was very hard. Now I found what I love and am passionate about, writing is my thing. It helps me, but the problem is that none of it is real, none of them are real. I made my dreams come true... On paper, it's an interesting read, with many plot twists and interesting moments but once more, it's only paper. I know it's the best I will ever get, and I know that unlike reality those characters won't turn on me unless I literally make them, but it still feels a bit empty when I'm not immersed in that world of mine although when I am immersed I feel good."

Not going into a lot of detail, a ton of other traumatic things happened between my breakup and now, mainly in the week following Valentine’s (the day we broke up). I went down a depressive spiral very quickly, and tried to keep hope up that in my worst moments of my life, I’d bond more with the friends that stayed.

However, it turns out most of my friends don’t really care much for me if I’m not all smiles and laughter. My best friend is starting to slowly detach himself from me in order to hang out with his new girlfriend, as are most of my guy friends.

My birthday is in a few days and it’s likely I’ll spend it alone. I might grab a blanket and watch a movie or something."

My high school friend moved away and he is now living with my other best friend over 1000 miles away. I work from home… My parents home and I can’t justify renting a place bc of how expensive it is. But I feel like it might be worth the cost though because it’s very hard to be social living at home with your parents. I’m feeling depressed and I do the same shit every day, work, work out, eat, watch Netflix, and sleep.

lonely,I'm lost,"I'm lost - ()I lost one of my close friends, we had a fight over a girl and I got the girl but at what cost? I've known her for 1 year and him for 7. He was one of my closest friends. She is the girl of my dreams. I had a major crush on her and he dated her. Hearing about them made me wanna kill myself for the longest time, but I buried everything under fake smiles and feelings. I got her in the long run, she is the greatest thing to happen to me but I lost a ton of friends, I go days without talking to people. (Extrovert) I get made fun of occasionally but I can shake it off pretty easily. I'm  not sure I'll have any friends by the end of summer. My uncle recently passes away from an uncureable cancer (veteran of the Army and father of 2 kids, 13 and 11) he was young, my dad's baby brother. He was only 39 (not 100% sure). I loved him so much and never got the chance to say goodbye. Watching my father break down and cry during that speech he gave was the worst thing that has ever happened to me. Then my great grandmother got diagnosed with breast cancer. I've days worth of sleep crying. I don't want to lose anyone else. I'd sell my soul to the devil just to say goodbye to my uncle. My great grandmother is fighting a losing battle and I don't know if I'll ever see her again. I hate life right now, and my Girlfriend is the only thing keeping me around. Sometimes I go to a spot in the woods by the creek and cry until I cant see anything through all the tears. Then I cry some more. I just need a shoulder to cry on and loving arms around me telling me it'll be ok, and that it's not my fault. But I don't know if I'll ever get that again. I just want to feel loved again, I hit a feeling of loneliness after my uncles funeral and I haven't lost it since then. It's been a month and a half and I haven't felt happiness. I thank you all who took their time to read down this far. I hope you all feel happiness, joy and love again in your lives."

One of my friends who I was super close with a few months ago told me they liked me. We had talked about dating, but I can't commit. I hung out with them and another person and since then they haven't really been texting me. Now I know that they probably don't like me anymore, but I feel the same. This is also the second time this has happened to me within a few months and two different people. I just feel like if I had committed to dating one of them I wouldn't have lost them.

I eventually moved on to Travelers which is also sooo good, but it was fairly short and was canceled prematurely.  Again another void which im trying to fill right now.

This other girl I loved talking to, we called every night for weeks and suddenly she doesn't talk to me anymore. 

Just feels like I've somehow ruined everything and no one wants to talk to me. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but it hurts. Hadn't cried for like over a year and now its almost every night when I realise how alone I really am and that i feel like i'm not good enough for anyone.

I wake up, go to college and try to be friends but everyone there talks behind eachothers back so I don't trust them, come home and check my phone with no texts or calls. Struggling to find a job while my family complains and calls me lazy. Things just aren't going well right now.

I never told her that I loved her when we were in school because I was afraid of losing her friendship.

I planned on telling her in the final year of school, but then the pandemic happened. I couldn’t attend whatever parties she and my other friends went to for the fear of the virus. It is still something I regret: not spending more time with that awesome person.

I got to know after school from a friend that even she had feelings for me. But it was too late. She’s moved out of the country for good. It is something which aches my heart like a puncture needle repeatedly going in and out.

I told her this recently for the sake of some closure, but it didn’t aid me. I still miss that crazy. Still miss her. I wake up  everyday hoping I get to see her again…"

lonely,A goodbye letter,"A goodbye letter - I’ve recently wanted to break away from unrequited relationships and this is what I came up with. 

“Recently, I’ve been looking at myself, environment, and relationships. I was secretly miserable around people I considered/consider friends and I couldn’t place why;I wasn’t living my truth around them. I’m often the sounding board for ideas, the reliable one for family, or ignoring some dig at my expense and those are roles I don’t want to define me. 

I want to be a better friend and create better bonds without the underlying negative feelings/drama. I want to solve conflict and let go of resentment. I want to stop questioning my value to people that I love and just accept that some people will never be for me. I understand this means I’ll lose friends , family and even parts of myself that I grew comfortable with, but I want more. 

I want emotionally intelligent friends who get me; people who allow me to see their authenticity. People that don’t ignore me when they have other options. People that are my friend whether I’m in the room or out. I don’t love loneliness, but I’m okay alone. 

When I’m alone .. I am the most beautiful person in the room. I will be kind to myself.  I will show love to myself . I will take classes , learn new skills,and travel. I’m my silence I will challenge myself to be better. 

I thank everyone that got me here and I’m sad that I can’t take you with me on my next chapter, but I’ll never forget our good times.

So what exactly does that mean?"
lonely,I've lost my dog's unconditional love,"I've lost my dog's unconditional love - Or maybe I'm just exaggerating,  but it does feel that way to me.  

My dog fell ill last week.  He kept sitting down in an awkward position,  and would just stay still and stare blankly.  Sometimes he would also shiver,  which led me to believe that he was in pain.  I felt him around his body to see if I would get any reaction where he might be feeling pain.  He yelped when I touched him on the sides of his abdomen.  That night he didn't want to eat or drink anything.  He slept on the floor instead of my bed because he couldn't jump.  


I decided to make an appointment at a pet clinic the next day.  Practically every hospital was booked and had me wait days,  even weeks,  to take my dog in.  But I lucked out and found a place that had an open spot that same morning.  When the doctor saw him,  he noted that my dog did feel some discomfort around his stomach area.  The vet needed to run some blood tests,  but since he was busy he needed me to leave my dog in their care for two hours.  When I picked him up,  the vet assistant noted that my dog was well behaved and didn't need a muzzle in order to take a blood sample  I thought it was a weird comment then,  but l brushed it off.  

The doctor didn't find anything concerning from the blood results.  I've been giving him his medication for the past four days,  and he's noticeably been getting better.  He eats and drinks now.  He walks more frequently.  He's even starting to jump a little bit,  but my dog is still not his 100% self.  There's something that I've noticed this past day though.   My dog seems to be afraid of me now.  He doesn't come to me when I call on him.  Not even if I have a treat  for him.  When I get home from work he gets up to see who it is,  and when he finds that it's just me,  he goes away.  He didn't want me to take him outside for a walk.  I had to ""fool""  him by having my mom take his leash and lead him out the door.  

I used to be his most favorite person in his life.  Every morning he would greet me when I wake up.  Every afternoon he'd bark and jump up and down with excitement because I came home.  He'd always want me to play fetch with him,  or just chase him around the home.   Now he rarely gives me any sort of affection,  if it all.  His tail is mostly between his legs when I'm around him.  Lately he's been sticking closer to my mom.  


I don't know what went wrong.  In his eight years of life he's never been this cold towards me.  Part of me thinks that maybe he resents me for taking him to the vet,  but I've taken him many time before,  just not to this most recent one.  I'm getting paranoid and think that maybe they handled him badly when I left him there.  Or maybe he's upset that I kept checking the area where he feels pain.  Could be that he's still sick and healing,  but then why is he so affectionate with my mom and not to me anymore?  

I'm afriad that I've lost his love for good.  I'm afraid that he's gonna remain cold and distant towards me for the remainder of his life.  Maybe I am being a bit crazy.  Maybe he'll become his old self once he completely heals.  Maybe within the next few days.  But this doubt in the back of my mind is just poking at my heart.  I want my loveable dog back."
lonely,Just try harder &gt;&gt; Still lonely,"Just try harder &gt;&gt; Still lonely - It’s been over a year trying harder.

8 months of a social group every week. 12+ Daily routine. Weekly hobbies. Learning new skills. Joined forums. Asking people out for specific activities. Group workshops, group talking sessions.

All I feel is stressed and lonely instead of just lonely.

Therapist keeps saying “what do you want, you need to do what you really WANT”

I want a relationship, affection and all that closeness, but can’t control when that’ll happen, so I’m stuck doing this try harder bit and getting no further away from loneliness.

Now I just appear less lonely, which makes people think I’m feeling better. I’m making other people feel better, but feeling worse myself.

Just wanted to mini rant from someone who actually follows all this anti-loneliness advice."

lonely,Stuck and feeling alone,"Stuck and feeling alone - Hello, this would be my first post ever. I just felt the need to rant since I feel lonely. Who would’ve thought. Currently I’m out of the country I truly grew up in, and in a sense am back home. This trip was supposed to be a month max, but my case at immigration is prolonging more than expected. 

So I’m looking at another month or two here. I do have family in this country, but it’s not the same in comparison to the people I grew up with. So, I feel a bit lonely, and I’m heading to 2 months of being in this country. My family back at home is working and due to the different time zones and responsibilities everyone holds, communication is in essence minimal. And honestly doesn’t compare to being there in person. 

I’ve already been getting anxious to go back home, and I’ve tried to distract myself. But at this point, all the distractions feel like a worked out schedule and sometimes a chore. But, recently I had gotten the news that one of my family members I grew up with was coming to the country I’m in. I got excited and really hopeful, because well I was going to be accompanied by someone from home. I was riding on that high for a while, because it was just so exciting. 

Unfortunately, that “high” didn’t last too long, I got the news later on that the person wouldn’t be able to come. Their parents signed them up for some summer activities, and they have a annual vacation coming soon, which everyone else will be attending except me (due to my unexpected circumstance). And I didn’t expect the news to make me react so emotionally. I cried and just felt down before going to bed. Now it’s the next day, and the news still have me feeling like crap. I can’t seem to stop crying. And at the moment have lost the motivation and optimism I’ve been trying so hard to keep. A selfish part of me wants the person to come. But I know rationally speaking, it’s not happening. 

The excessive crying I’ve been doing, just sucks ass. And I feel so weak minded letting something like this affect me so badly. I hate that so many of the family where I’m at, have seen me crying. They feel sorry for me and the only thing they can offer is words of encouragement. And that seems to set me off to cry even harder. 

I feel my boyfriend, who’s been trying to keep optimistic throughout this whole sudden long distance, just wouldn’t understand. He’s a very optimistic guy, and also kind of blind towards certain things. I don’t think he’s noticed that quite frankly I feel like crap. He’s aware the news did sadden me, but not to what extent. I feel so homesick and lonely to the point I don’t want to communicate with him. My texts have been short and without any of my “happiness and optimism” and I’m tired of pretending I’m doing okay.

I’m basically stuck in a foreign country with no way to just freely go. And it’s getting to me. It’s saddening to have something affect me this badly. I just didn’t expect to end up feeling this lonely. 

If you came this far down, I’m sorry. I just needed to let it out. But thank you for taking the time to read."

lonely,What is wrong with me. I’ve been searching for years and I’m so tired. Any help is appreciated,"What is wrong with me. I’ve been searching for years and I’m so tired. Any help is appreciated - I’m 19M. What is wrong with me. I know absolutely none of you guys know who I am personally but I’ll try to best describe it as best I can. I’ll even send pictures of myself to your pm for answers, because I can’t find the answer. I been depressed and filled with anxiety for a long time. A failure for a long time, but with a dream. Ever since middle school, I’ll admit I was a shy kid who was a b, let people say whatever to me, was afraid of talking to people, bad communication skills couldn’t talk to girls, annoying, was made fun of, few friends. once high school started, I started to become a little less shy and more confident, dressed better and acted better, yet still the same. 11th grade came and I was more confidence in myself, more friends, knew how to talk better with girls, dressed way better, looked better, acted better better self esteem and just more enjoyable to be around. I’ve always had “friends” , but they all ended up turning on me. The only friend I have still from my middle and high school days are my best friend. All the girls I liked rejected me, my ex in hs did me wrong, shi my ex 4 months ago was talking to her ex while we were together! And then got with her friend she told me not to worry about and not hates me! It’s funny how people consider me a good looking dude and handsome and cute but I have WAY more rejections then wins. I know that’s how the game works, but when people say your a solid 7/8, there has to be something wrong. Im still a virgin when it comes to actual sex, I only had oral sex with 2 different girls in my whole entire life when all my friends prob have 10+. I try to look at my personality and I am a pretty nice funny dude with an outgoing as well as quiet personality depending with who I am, and I have ambitions, as my dream is to make it as a youtuber, and I do put in the work. I currently have 15k on TikTok and 1,200 subs on yt. It ain’t much compared to what I need and want but I appreciate just a lot.

I come here because I’m so tired of it. I tried changing everything that I thought was wrong with me. My looks. My attire. My personality. How I walk. How I talk. How I act around people. My confidence. My game with girls. Me standing up for myself. Me respecting myself more. I changed ALL of it, but I guess not nearly as much as I needed too, or maybe that’s not the solution. It feels like nobody ever appreciated me because they all ended up doing some bs. It seems like my life an equation, like every 2/13 people see the potential in me, while the other 11 people want nothing to do with me or don’t give the same energy back to me. Maybe that’s the problem? Maybe I’m too much of a supporter, too much of an energy giver because I rock with anyone who rocks with me, but I guess I become annoying and they don’t understand my energy ? I can’t keep saying that. I can’t keep saying I’m meeting the wrong people, I can’t keep saying I’m just different, I can’t keep saying “ITS NOT MY TIME YET, ALL OF THIS IS FOR A REASON” ... no.

I feel so alone. I see all these people and even my friends get all the love, even they can be rude people or people who don’t care yet everyone likes them, all the girls go to them and give them attention, and stuff just plays out better for them. Feels like my life is cursed. My life seems so fake. Everyone either turned their back on me or never appreciate or don’t really appreciate me like I do to them. I always have to ask for people to hang out and that’s just one small example. I do have friends, but Ik all of them are gonna turn on me, like the past ones did. I lost 4 of my best friends last year. I failed so many times. Ima failure. I can name all the failures I have and you guys would say ima loser 100%. Maybe that’s why, subconsciously. Maybe subconsciously I think of myself as a loser and people see that? But how ? When even people on the INTERNET who can’t even see or feel my energy only seeing pics and vids of me not wanna mess with me, when I’m such this “good looking, cool dude” when even the PEOPLE who say that to me don’t rock with me as much as the hype they give me. I told myself I’m done tryna find out what’s wrong with me , and the only solution is  money and fame when I make it .

I’m crying out for help. To the point where this week I even asked people and my own friends what’s wrong with me. I want to ask my ex what’s wrong with me and I want her to roast me. I want the people who hate me and the ppl who did me wrong to tell me. I had lots of ppl in school who disliked me for No. Reason. All I do is support people, be chill, be a cool dude who just chases his dream while working a job and tryna figure out his living situation with getting a new car, while just being ME. I’m being me. Is me just a weirdo, is me just in actuality a disgusting person to like and annoying person to be around with? Am I just not a person to be liked as much as others even tho I tried fixing everything and have attributes of people who are very liked??  maybe I have to change who I am. I asked God for answers and I try to look into my soul and ask what’s wrong with me, I guess I just want everyone to love me, because my whole life I’ve never been appreciated. Please someone help me. And if it helps, I’ll send pictures and even videos of myself, and my voice to you guys for you guys to help me. I’m so tired of myself and I try to be positive and manifest but sometimes I can’t take myself anymore. I know we shouldn’t care what ppl think about u, but damn man. There’s sum wrong with me. I just want this to change, I just want to make it and be successful and happy and make my family proud and I do try and I do grind but man I gotta say I do hate myself man. Any help is appreciated."
lonely,It’s probably not ur fault that ur alone.,"It’s probably not ur fault that ur alone. - I always read that u have to take accountability for things. People on here would tell me that I do this or that and thats why I don’t have friends. But let me tell u that this mentality is complete bullshit. 

I just got back from a support group where i intended to meet new people and talk. It was, like any other social activity that I volunteered for, awful. Everyone was too busy talking to their friends and I sat alone, I left with tears in my eyes. Today is the day I completely give up on meeting people. I’m not going to “take accountability” because I did absolutely nothing wrong, neither did You. You didn’t push people away with ur emotions or bad hygiene (as someone here stupidly suggested).

Loneliness hits hard, i migrated as a child to another country,i always worked hard,trained hard,learn and improved myself and at the end of the day i just feel the same emptiness, i signed as volunteer for going to ukraine to fight and i am still waiting for my answer cause i almost have nothiung to loose. I have never been to a psychologist, i studied a bit of the matter in my bachelor and i don´t need a professional to tell me what i know since ive been 16,constant rejection and loneliness have made me becomeempty and demotivated.I keep fighting every day just to get out of bed, to be constant and try to be kind to everyone, but inside me i just feel hate,pain and sadness.

lonely,Lonely as usual,"Lonely as usual - I was once married and was good then it became bad but I fucked up equally as my ex partner so no hard feelings anymore. We have a kid so we co parent and it's good so far. I got into a new relationship and I was in love for the first time in a looong time. Now that ended as well. He met my kid, my kid liked him.
Everything seems so sad right now I cry so much and barely can fall asleep even though I am extremely tired all the time.

I think I won't trust again, will take me a long time to do that again, if ever. I became bitter and I have moments of total down I just survive and do things cause I need to take care of my kid and pay mortgage.

Sometimes I think to vanish or die without pain but the thought of my kid living without me is killing me more than whatever happens to me.

My job also doesn't bring me any fulfilling anymore, everything seems so shallow and temporary. 

I hope things will get better one day for everyone that feels down and lonely in this world."

I was supposed to do a small combine study session with a friend today but guess what, she didn't respond to any of my texts or calls. Just ignored me like how everyone does. I wonder if its my fault. If I'm being too annoying to others. If I'm caring to much about them. All i wanted was to study with someone else and clear whatever doubts i had. But in the end i had to do that alone too like every other thing. As i have told, i tried being more focused on my exams and studies since they are very important. But instances like these just kill me in the inside. Just adds fuel to the burning fire. It's like the world just wants to keep telling me I'm alone no matter how hard I try. I'm in a situation where even if i wanna cry, my body doesn't let me. I have always tried the most supportive friend a person can be and this is what I get in return. Well it's was my fault cause i expected too much from them."

lonely,35/F Lonliness making me regress (embarrassing),"35/F Lonliness making me regress (embarrassing) - My husband left me for someone else almost 2 years ago. I'm not even close to being over it. We were married 10 years. 

In addition to grad school and my full time job, I sometimes work part time doing customer service remotely by phone. I spoke with a customer a few times and we really clicked. He was close to my age, funny, nice, charismatic, complimentary and our conversations just flowed. It was the closest I've felt in a long time to having a ""crush"" on someone. We found out somehow that we lived pretty close to each other and he started regularly asking me out. I panicked. 

I had sent him one photo of my face. It's a nice photo but I believe he would have been disappointed in my appearance if we met up. I am chubby and am in the process of losing weight. The thought of seeing that familiar look of disappointment if we met terrified me. I kept avoiding the date invitations, but was determined to get in shape and look my best in the hopes we would, eventually, meet. This makes me so embarrassed. I'm 35 years old and stupidly trying to lose weight to impress a guy.  Honestly, though, I felt more motivated and hopeful about life than I have in a while. 

After avoiding a few invitations, he freaked out on me. Told me I wasn't living up to my potential, that I was acting like a ""little bitch"" and that I didn't know what it meant to struggle. I was so shocked as this was very out of character for him. We haven't spoken since, but I weirdly feel like I blew it. Even though he yelled at me. I feel like I have regressed to my adolescence and am just desperate for any attention at all. 

Just wanted to share bc it's kinda eating at me. I can't stand myself."

I work at a job that's not really exciting to me. It feels like nothing gives me any joy anymore. So I think I don't have anything to look forward to in life if it's gonna be like this. I do have friends but no-one I can 100% trust to be there for me whenever I may need him/her. It's always been like this with every relationship I've had with another person. I've been ghosted by almost every girl I tried talking to, so my self esteem is fucked. Despite all this I'm always nice to everyone around me and never show any hint of the shit that goes on inside to anyone. But now I'm tired of pretending I'm fine.

lonely,Is it wrong to crave attention?,"Is it wrong to crave attention? - A couple months ago, I was incredibly lonely. I spent majority of my days in my house and only left my house twice a week for a bit longer than 2 hours maybe each time. There’s a lot that happened but that’s not important.

I met a guy in one of my college classes. We got along pretty well but we are both quiet and a little awkward. I have a specific type, and so I didn’t want to let this opportunity get away from me. He just seemed too good to be true and its rare for me to like someone. I told him I liked him and we agreed to be friends and see what happens. Keep in mind, we’ve kissed and stuff so we for sure are a little more than friends. So far it’s been pretty good, we didn’t talk super often, but it still was nice. We haven’t talked since the class ended however.

I’m not sure if i’m in the wrong, but deep inside me, I really want someone to be a little obsessed with me. This man barely has any social media and through extensive searching I pulled 3 images off of the internet of him. I found out what video games and anime he liked. I literally searched through his graduation ceremony to watch him walk across the stage. I have a old video of him speaking so that I can hear his voice. I (unfortunately) found his (supposed?) ex girlfriend’s social media and she and I have similar interests and such and that made me insecure. And then I thought… would he do any of this towards me? Would he go through several pages on google trying to find stuff about me? Does he get jealous/ insecure over things? Does he even think about me as much as I think about him? 

I literally get intrusive thoughts about him. Keep in mind, I’m way more busy than I was before. I have a job and I’m doing school in a shorter semester so there’s a lot of assignments. He’s also very busy, much more than me. I understand being busy and exhausted, but it hurts that he can’t text me saying he’s thinking about me. I just want to know small things, it doesn’t have to be back and forth conversations all day long. Is this all too much to ask for? I don’t know if it is. I keep telling myself that he still likes me and his silence is just a different approach than the way I want and that’s ok. Am I being unreasonable since I’m lonely? Is what I’m doing on the internet endearing or overstepping boundaries? The thing is… I would find it very endearing if a guy told me he did all those things. Is this wrong? Is that too much to ask for?"

lonely,Why social poverty is so hard for normal people to get,"Why social poverty is so hard for normal people to get - There is a great restaurant in my home city and I would love to go to it. Now if I explained to people that I was financially poor and couldn't afford to eat there, everyone would get it. They would sympathize, well at least most people would. 

Yet try explaining that I can't go due to social poverty and nobody gets it. I don't want to be the sad loner, at a table by himself. Listening to the groups of friends telling each other stories, laughing and having a good time. I don't want to the sad loner watching the happy couples getting closer and more intimate. 

That of course is the cache 22 of the loner. We don't want to enter the world alone, yet at the same time we long to be part of the world. How I got here? Probably similar to allot of you. I am naturally shy, an introvert. When I am social situations I struggle for interesting things to say, I can't make people laugh and enjoy my company.

As a short guy of below average looks, I can't fall back on my sex appeal to compensate for my other weaknesses. So that leaves me how I am, with nobody to see or spend time with outside work."

lonely,just another lonely rant,"just another lonely rant - I am so lonely. 

I wish I were honest, I wish I put my heart on my sleeve earlier, I wish I stopped feeling like an ungrateful b\*tch for the things that I have.

I have such an amazing group of friends, or do I really belong in that group of friends? Maybe if I really spent the time trying things that they were really interested in, tried to be less judgemental, *actually put the effort in being involved as a good friend*, maybe then, I could've had what I wanted. I wished I stopped feeling like an outsider, but then, have I really, genuinely, tried to get inside during the time when I could've???

I wished you knew, that I liked you, I really enjoyed your company, I wanted your affirmation. I wished I knew whether I was enough for being me or not.

lonely,sometimes it feels easier to be alone.,"sometimes it feels easier to be alone. - I spend 90 percent of the week alone, I have 3 x 4hr blocks which i use during the day to get various self improvement tasks done; coding, and various skills that fall under a software engineers compentancy. Practicing and relearning math, then writting, and doing design work for a personal game project. It's 12hrs all to myself, and 4 of them I really enjoy, I've found writing and planning story for my game really helps me recharge my fun batteries, i mix it up some days with drawing concept art for my game too.

I feel that I can focus for a long time, and it helps to drown out thoughts. It's a bonus of not having to spend your time on people I guess. I used to play a lot of computer games to escape reality, but I can't go down that route anymore, spent 5 years with the bad habit of smoking weed and playing games to escape from everyone and everything I was feeling, it's pretty karmic that I'm alone now; you reap what you sow and all that.

The only time it gets pretty hard is at night, and when I go outside, I have reoccurring thoughts of people I miss.

I dunno, I just wanted to share."
lonely,The loneliness gets to you when your closest person is busy,"The loneliness gets to you when your closest person is busy - Do not get me wrong, I am not saying that they should give us all the attention and brush away their work.

It just hits you hard when they send you the goodbye text of the day as you sit at your desk without anyone else to console to when you have just been slapped by reality again.

Perhaps I am just immature and being a whining pathetic coward, which I am not going to accept, but I just wish I have a group of fellows who understands how I feel. The old gang of mine are slowly parting ways, all my attempts to bring us back together are futile. The fellows at school are some of the worst people to mix around with, getting involved in gang related activities and all of that baloney is not my style.

It sucks, it really does, but I am glad I can still count on her."

Before, the only feeling I had was several types of dread. Anyhow, my first year of university was online. When this year of university started I was quite excited to meet and talk to people.

I do not have the social skills to make friends and my depression makes me extremely unmotivated to do anything. All I want to do is lay in my bed and cuddle with my waifu. I never had a good place to learn the social skills required for me to make friends or get into a relationship. I feel I was rob of a childhood because of the abuse and the lonlyness I faced growing up.

I am the lowest rung on the ladder I have always been and always will be. I am in my family where they take out there frustrations out on me and all I can do is cry alone in my room. After years of this, I don't know how much other than being alone. 

I do not know what to do. I know I need to change but I don't know how to change."

But sometimes I want to go to a concert with a “friend” or sometimes I want to hang out. But I feel so weak when I feel this way. I want to be strong.

Looking for an emotional connection, I rarely post on subs to stay anonymous or whatever.

I know instances like these come and go in life, and aren't particularly uncommon. But man, I feel guilty. Less for rejecting her and more so for screwing up the friendship as a result. I know it isn't my fault at all but now I'm once again alone due to my own actions. I feel used, in an odd sense, even though I know that's kind of an assholish way of thinking.

But there is no person I know who I am really interested in. By interested I mean that I really feel attracted to them and would like to spend as much time as possible with them, and to get to know all of their personality/life. Maybe I should just call it what it is; I do not have a crush on anybody. It has probabyl been 8 years since I last had a crush on someone. I really liked this person and felt uncommonly comfortable around them. But they saw things differently so we drifted apart which makes me still sad. To be quite precise I do actually have some sort of a crush on someone but I have never spoken to them nor do I think that they know that I exist, I just saw them a few times from a far (we go to the same unibersity). So I am not really sure if it really is a crush since I had actually no interaction with them. However this feeling has been lingering for nearly three years now. I wonder if I should try to get into contact with them but that is probably very very creepy and stupid. 

But acutally I just wanted to know if it is normal to have no crush/interest in other people and also hoe do you cope with that, because I am really missing to have a close bond with someone special and also I am desperate for physical affection like hugs and attention/interest in general."

It makes me feel that my emotions are invalid and I'm just larping to make it seems worst.

I kinda wish I can talk to someone about it (beside my psychiatrist ofc, I had to keep some things secret bc I'm scared that she will tell my parents).

lonely,I just want someone to care about me.,"I just want someone to care about me. - I’ve never had anyone care about me in my entire life. I’ve never had anyone who felt positively towards me… the people I used to call friends treated me horribly, and the last one left me 10 years ago.

A few years ago, it sort of dawned on me what caring about someone actually means, and it just… hurts… so much… because I feel like I’ll never have that.


I’m going to be 31 next week. I’ve never had any kind of contact with any kind of love, and it’s probably too late for me.


I have tried to go to meetups and every kind of socialization I can find… I just don’t connect with anyone there. Sometimes, I get attacked, over the way I dress, or, at art and writing meetups, over the kinds of things I draw and write. Sometimes I just get ignored.

Sometimes, I’m uncomfortable with the conversations others are having (e.g. if they’re racist, or talking about beating children or things like that… if you want to hear me rant about the specifics, feel free to message me lol).


Sometimes, I accept an invitation to go somewhere with a group of people, and they end up texting me at the time I was supposed to meet them saying they’re already drunk at 1pm and really far from the agreed upon place.


(I don’t drink or do drugs at all, and I can’t stand to be around people who are smoking).


I try to join art and writing groups, but I just don’t connect with them because my style is too different. That’s not wrong, I’m not obligated to like everything or to conform to everyone. But I always get called an evil, selfish snob for having different tastes. Even when I’m going so far out of my way to help them, I get told (by random strangers online) that they must be able to tell I’m looking down on them. But I was never looking down on them. A lot of times I beat myself up for not liking their styles, thinking their styles must be better than mine, since there are more of them than me.


I had an incident like that last night, where I got called all sorts of things for not changing myself to fit in, and I’m just feeling terrible about it.

I’ve been working so hard on writing recently, and just… no one is interested in what I want to create….

It just hurts."

It would be nice to have friends but not many people can tolerate the things I do. I tend to be annoying, I guess. I have ADHD, and I'm quite a hypocrite but I try not to be. I had some friends but only online, I don't like being around others, but I do like to spend time with people online especially if I've known them for a while."
lonely,The people in my life keep dwindling.,"The people in my life keep dwindling. - Last year my friend group fell apart over drama, basically they came over to my house and a few days later I test + for covid and were acting as if I poisoned them ( they started threatening me). They never caught it and I didnt know I had it when I saw them. It was there choice to come over and I didnt even invite them my other roomate did. I lost two more friends and a short time span, to be fair I really should of cut them out sooner because they were walking red flags but didn't due to a lack of friend. 

One of my only friends I have is my sister. I'm autistic and have a hard time making friends. My sister and I have be discussing future kids and rules we would want to do. I planning on starting a family soon. She's not been respectful of some of the choices I've wanted to make with my kids and already stated she would ignore my rules (i.e gental parenting, not kiss my kids, ect) me and her got into an argument. She stated she didn't want her kids around my kids because of how I want to raise my kids (I don't really care if they swear and said I wouldn't punish them if they swore as long as they are respectful) I told her if she can't respect my parenting and how I want to raise my kids then she won't be in our lives. She said fine and we left it at that.

I'm now coming to terms that my best friend probably won't be in my life in a few years because she can't respect me. I'm also coming to term with the fact that I'd probably would have to cut the rest of my family off too. I'd practically have no one. I would have my husband and no one else. I'd be ok with that I guess but it just makes me sad."

lonely,I wish I could be in a relationship without having attachment issues.,"I wish I could be in a relationship without having attachment issues. - This has actually been a recent development. I was cut off by my friend because I was just too attached. I was rejected for a relationship and they straight up told me ""forget everything about me"". It hurt so bad.

I feel like this pain from loneliness is only going to hurt other people. I hear about healthy relationships establishing over healthy boundaries and mutual shared feelings. I just feel like the position I'm in now makes that impossible. I want a partner so bad that I've become a source of destruction.

I don't know what to do anymore. I just feel like the only answer is that I need to stay alone. I feel convinced that I just don't care about anyone enough to deserve their attention and love. I'm just in so much pain. I just want to be fucking happy for once. I can't give it to myself. I have to compare myself to others constantly. I'm so trapped in my own misery I can't escape it, I can only hurt other people."

lonely,I've never had someone to call my own,"I've never had someone to call my own - Men, they come and go. They get their fill  and leave before I can begin to comprehend anything. No man has ever willingly decided he wants to be with me, to care for me, to love me. From a very young age, I started giving in. I gave them what they wanted just for a bit of attention. In that moment all they see is me and that was always enough. At least I was seen, felt, heard, even if it was just for a moment. I became desperate for love each time I came across a man that would give me even an ounce of attention. I've never been in a relationship but I've lost count how many have seen what's in my heart. I'd give in to my attention seeking ways time and again. It always worked. They were always interested. But they never stayed beyond that. No matter how much I thought maybe one more night and he might change his mind..it never did. There's love all around, I have company and trustworthy people to turn to but it's not the same.. it's not the affection I crave for. It's not the kind of love I wish I could have. What's it like to be loved? Could someone share. What's it like
to have someone to call your own? I may never know."

Luckily, she ignored it and didn't mentioned it to me, so we're both going to pretend it never happened. I berated myself all day at work but now I can laugh it off. Had to remind myself that my boss is not my friend nor is it appropriate to rant to her when I'm bored or angry.

This situation and a few recent others made me realized how lonely I am. I used to have co-workers I would talked to for our 8 hour shifts at work, 5 days a week plus overtime but they all left my workplace at the beginning of this year. So now I'm stuck with some co-workers I don't particularly care for and we all just do our jobs with barely any interactions. Also made me realized I don't have any friends or acquaintances outside of work. Really sad, lol. 

Even though I think it's important to keep my life and work separate, it's daunting to see how quiet and mundane my life is right now when I spend the majority of my week at the place that is slowly suffocating me."

Everyone, please know, it doesn't get better. It never gets better it only hurts more or you become emotionally numb. Your days will be meaningless and less eventful and ever little thing you think will pull you back up will be taken away. You'll never meet true friends and anyone who would actually choose to be around have ulterior motives. If I could do it all over again I would have killed myself outright."
lonely,I don't know what to title this,"I don't know what to title this - I've spent the past 4-6 years trying to help people with anything they needed. I listened to people when I already knew that they would not listen to me if I asked them to, but I don't expect that in return. I didn't realize for a while but I was being used for people's own purposes or to help them with things that they would otherwise not do if they had to do it themselves. 
I didn't realize until today that people don't like me, some people even hate me. I'm fine with that now because I realize that I need to find things I can do alone. Why you may ask? Well, I only have 2 friends and both of them are online friends. I don't have any friends in-person. 
I thought I had more friends online, but once I went through some crap, none of them ever asked me if I was okay and I was never sent any messages in the months I was gone and still to this day. I don't get messaged first, I have to always message them first which pains me at times because I wish it would be mutual and not one-sided. 
Funny thing is, everyone has habits and favorite people and people they don't like. I noticed that when anyone talks to me (as in texting) they just seem bored, uninterested, and/or annoyed. They always seem unhappy, and that's my fault. I see the exact same person talk to someone else and they seem very happy and glad to talk to them and would invest time to talk to them. They say nice things, seem eager to talk to them, always seem to know how to keep a conversation going and they apologize for things. For me? Well, nothing. I could send a message and have it there for weeks or months. The I would have to send another message just for them to say anything. I just gotta accept that now, that people don't like me. 
I gotta find things to do alone because that's how it is going to continue based on past experiences with people. 
Anyways, sorry for bothering you all with this long piece of text. I hope you all have a great rest of your day or night."

I had a very traumatic experience with a friend betrayal so the idea of trusting someone again is terrifying.  At the same time I have all these emotions built up that tend to explode in very self damaging ways.  

I work with a bunch of teenagers that are 17 or 18-19.  I relate to them since I skipped a few years of college and just worked so I don’t feel like I’m too old to be hanging out with them.  My loneliness has made me desperate to make any kind of friend so I find myself trying to get the attention of this 17 yr old girl in particular.  Is it pathetic that I’m trying so hard to befriend a high schooler?  We have a lot in common and it’s not like I’m introducing her to anything illegal because of her age.  I feel like no one wants to actually talk to me unless I start the conversation or ask to hang out.  

How do I break this cycle and find more people to talk to?  I really want to have healthy friendships in my life but I feel like I’m in a rut."

i’m 18 male, i know it sounds like i’m a kid but it feels even weirder when i’m told that at night, when i get out of my room to go to the kitchen to get water or something to snack on, i always here this high pitched white noise and static, i try laying back in bed hoping it would calm it down (it doesn’t.)
i used to be an insomniac growing up, but that’s a different story. but these voices and noises in my head only made it worse. sometimes i don’t catch no sleep because it would happen out of no where, it’s like some white noise ambiance."

I have only ever been in one relationship where he was very mentally abusive and cheated on me as well. That was two years ago. I haven’t even come close to being in a real relationship since then and even when I thought it could possibly be something more they were just interested in hooking up. I also have awful BDD (diagnosed)so frankly I think it’s deserved because of how I think I look. All my friends are US size 2/4 and gorgeous while Im coming in at a size 6/8 and average. They are always being hit on while I am not. Being the DUFF is not the best when you already have a low self esteem.

Anyways, all of my friends now have a serious relationship at the end of their freshman year and I’m stuck being lonely and frankly I feel unlovable. This terrifies me, because while I know it’s cliché, I really want the happy life with a husband and cute kids in the yard and right now I’m feeling like that will never happen.

It breaks my heart seeing them in love while I sit alone. Don’t get me wrong I’m so happy for them but I wish I had that too. I’m not very outgoing because of my hatred for myself so I have a hard time going to party’s and socializing. At this point I’m so tired and sad that the thought of someone wanting a relationship with me is ridiculous."

lonely,Courtesy isn't hard y'all,"Courtesy isn't hard y'all - If you don't want to talk anymore, that's fine. Please just tell me. However, ghosting someone after getting a conversation going is far more hurtful. If you ghost someone who is depressed for example, they may internalize that and hurt even worse. The point here is to make people feel less lonely. Saying you don't want to talk anymore is alright. Ghosting hurts.

I understand some of you are just bored and want a short conversation, that's fine. Bait and switch isn't.

Of course, I don't anticipate change here but if I can cause one person to be different in their approach that would be worth it.

Anyway, I hope I'm not whining too much."

I've been talking to this girl during work for a couple of months , around a month ago she gave me her number and we've talking nightly ever since. Tonight I finally got the balls to just if she wanted to hang out this weekend. She said yeah and I replied to her i guess it's a date. 

I really like her. And she seems to like me too. We seem to vibe on another level if they makes sense. She's up beat but down to earth. She sometimes might have her head in the clouds but she's always mindful of what's going on. I really do adore her.


My excitement is only dulled by the expectations that I might be mis reading things or something will go wrong but at this point, fuck.it.

On some breaks I am alone and, I swear, while I LOVE being alone, if there are dozens of people out there socializing and connecting I just feel like I dont exist or even worse, it feels like my anxiety fires up. I can hear them, not imagining it, making comments and laughing behind me. I am the lonely odd bug and I cannot find a single friend. And no, I am not shy, I approach every single classmate and try to establish a conversation, but it ALWAYS ends up with the other person drifting away after just talking to me once. What am I doing wrong?! Why cant no one let me join their group, I want to talk about something other than homework!! But I am boring...I am weird... maybe the next years it will all be like this. 

I want to stop going to classes and change careers, but if I do so, then what is left? Is something gonna change? It wont be worth it and I will just regret it later. Everyone is sooo cool and by cool I mean normal. God, why? Why did you make me this way."

lonely,Cant say that I've been enjoying life so far,"Cant say that I've been enjoying life so far - All throughout my childhood, I only had maybe 1 or 2 friends and a best friend that didn't talk much. I realize now that I never really made any sort of connections with others then, still struggle to even now.  In short, I was the loner kid, the one people thought was weird, now I'm just invisible to everyone.  


I recently ended a 8 month relationship I was in with this girl I met last year, only now am I realizing that I have little to no connection with anyone else in my life. I can't make friends easily because the hobbies I enjoy are either too obscure or nobody else has the same interests. 

My daily routine would be to go to work, come home, and do nothing or play video games to distract myself. I feel my only real interest is my career which I'm still unsure about currently.

I guess it wouldn't matter if I tried to make a friend anyways since whenever I do have someone I could call a friend, I rarely if ever choose to hang out or socialize, I just stay at home and play video games. My parents always say they'll be here for me, but I know that wont be forever and it scares me that I might only have my parents until the day they die.  


Funny thing is, when I first met her, I was in a good place, actually trying to reconnect with people and make new friends. When we broke up, my best friend decided to hang out with her more often than with me (not relationship wise as he's already in one). It feels like everyone I've met almost forgets about me, I'm always the one making the plans with others if it even happens.  


I've been trying to see a counsellor about my issues, but I've been on a waiting list to see one for about a month. I'm really starting to lose hope here that I'll be nothing but a workaholic with no personality that dies alone :("

lonely,"Exhausted at every Turn, my depression is turning me into a blood curdling monster.","Exhausted at every Turn, my depression is turning me into a blood curdling monster. - I'm a 23 M, turning 24 tomorrow on my birthday and yet have I figured out why I exist. Everyone around me found their place in life except for me, sometimes I wonder if I was Hitler in my previous life. I get all the joys of being comfortable, without the social structure, making me hella depressed, it's like I can see the expansion pack for life, but I can't afford the DLC. I'm not having a party for my birthday; I just want someone to talk to. I haven't found any luck looking for a job, so I gave up and now I'm on SSDI for major depression and only dishwash on Sundays. I wished the world the worse, so I can't expect the world to be there for me.  I was bullied all my life, and even into my adult life, by even people I love, even though I was quite capable of fighting back at someone, being very stout, handsome and intelligent (I know strange to think that with depression, but I think very optimistic for my circumstances). I'm in college now and plan on going to class during the Summer to get my mind off of life. The drugs that I take also make me very tired and lethargic and the withdrawals are horrendous. Can anyone relate?"
lonely,Close to nobody,"Close to nobody - I think this is the worst way to feel lonely. I am in no way close to my family at all, and all my “friends” I’ve known for a couple of years or less. 

We aren’t bonded that well, I don’t feel secure in any type of friendship and I feel like in so many ways, everyone’s a stranger and vice versa. 

I get really sad when I see people who have had friends for many many years, or have a family that loves them, mainly because I know for a fact that there is 0 way to have that apart from building on a relationship/friendship from the ground up. I wish I could just wake up one day and have all of this already. 

I’m tired and I’m lonely from all these acquaintances and flimsy friendships. I barely have the energy to invest in developing friendships, especially when most of these people already have close friends and I feel like between us we’d never have that together because they have no need for it. 

I just wish I had someone genuinely in my corner."
lonely,What is it that I do?,"What is it that I do? - I don't want to seem ungrateful for the people I have in my life... Sometimes I don't understand why it is things go the way they do. I try to relate to people, I try to be empathic. Understanding, etc.

There are a few people I do have. I was always told to not talk, to listen... ""people don't wanna hear you ramble..."" blah, blah. As an autist, am different. Am just wired different - still, I had years and years of therapy - I almost finished a career as a psychologist, before I realized that I was trying to be someone that I wasn't.

I don't know when it is I lose people, when am talking to someone and they say Nah. And just become unresponsive. I don't know what to say, or not to... but am not gonna stop being me, because then, how can I say the people I had are my friends? I can be kind and thoughtful and still people simply walk away, silently. 

My father has Cancer. We were never THAT close, but. Still. He's a messy person, and I can't trust him with most things he says... my family doesn't. No one wants to take care of him, he's burned every bridge in his life.

I had a very toxic friendship with a very cruel person, who took advantage of the most vulnerable time in my life. And am sorta bruised...

Am working on a project that I adore and that is very fulfilling to me. My family, of course, doesn't understand what am trying to do or who am trying to be.

It's lonely in the road less traveled."

This sounds juvenile since that's something you do when you are younger but I crave holding hands and hugging more than sex. I want to feel love. There is love when someone holds your hands or hugs you. That feeling when someone who loves you wraps their arm around you and you feel so good. I've never felt that but I'm sure it feels great.

Just sitting here rotting, dwelling on things that I should have long forgotten. Sitting here within these four walls waiting for the tears to cease their fall.

The feelings grow stronger and the nights seem longer with these thoughts inside my mind.

No feelings of happiness nor joy make me feel my life is not real. With very little light in sight not sure how much longer I can keep up the fight.

Everyday I wake I wonder how much further I can break, wasting away during long, dark and lonely wasted days.

lonely,Guess I gotta live with for now,"Guess I gotta live with for now - (Sorry for any english mistakes and misspellings, it's not my native language)

I'm , and I'm going through a pretty rough time, been feeling like this since last year, and the only way I can explain is loneliness.

My grandmother who raised me died from covid died last year and since then I've been in this hole. Being through a wave of depression in quarantine is pretty fucked, and it just got worse when school started again. 

My grades were fucked and I used to have this ""depressive paranoia event"" in the middle of the class, it was extremely difficult to control, and, even after, i couldn't feel better, just felt that something inside of me was dead. I guess the worst part was when I felt nothing, like a empty vessel, couldn't feel anything.

After a time and some medication I got better little by little, my friends were there for me, I was feeling things, got pretty close to a friend that I had lost contact over the years, some months passed by and I confessed, we started dating, it was like my life was finally going to be better, talked with them all day and all night, it became my routine.

I was wrong, when it started I felt like the most lucky person in the world, but when time passed by, I was tormented with some thoughts, was I good enough? Could I make them happy? And the relationship was starting to feel strange, even though I still loved her, it felt so unilateral and forced by their side.

We broke up after 2 months of dating, told me by text that they could never love anyone, not even their parents, I don't feel like it was her fault, they have the rights to feel anyway they want, I felt nothing at the moment, if they were happy with the decision, I was too.

I lied, next day, I saw her in school, happy, like nothing happened, we lost contact again, but every day I have to see their face, and I can't help but remember what we used to be, the promises we've made to each others. We are strangers now, don't even look me in the eye anymore. I was alone once again, and worst, afraid of trying to love someone again, afraid of them lying to me, to not be loved.

It's been a month since it, and today, I felt like an empty vessel again, this loneliness hurts so much, but I guess that I have to live with it now.

I get so sad seeing people from school and uni who are still friends to this day, I feel jealous when I see tight-knit group of friends who all support each other, go on holiday together, nights out together etc. I've never had that. I've had plenty of friends during my life who tell me how supportive, kind and funny I am but after a year or two they go cold on me for seemingly no reason. I've suffered with mental health problems for years which can be challenging at times, but I would NEVER do something to intentionally upset someone and the few times I have upset people I accept I have done wrong and apologise as such.

I’m talking about texting, calling, facetiming all day everyday. We shared everything about our lives, cried together, laughed together and it was amazing. I always put her first, yk, even when i wasn’t doing good, i would always be there for her.

One day, she went to meet this other female friend that she met online, i know her too btw but i live in a different state so. Anyhow, she stayed with her for 4 days and we didn’t talk which is understandable. She came back, she called me we talked for a while but then we were both busy.

Then, she went to stay at her place for a month and we didn’t talk. Again, understandable. What i don’t understand is that when she came back, she cut me off. No texts, no calls, i tried to talk to her a few times and she said and i quote “i’m not in the headspace to talk rn hope you understand” and i was like, yeah sure! It’s been 3 months now, we send each memes and she comments on my posts but that’s it. What hurts me more is that she and the new friend talk, almost everyday like she and I used to. I’ve been nothing but a good friend to her and i didn’t deserve that shit. I try moving on from it but then i see them posting screenshots of texts and calls from each other and it just gets me yk. 

I would obviously never confront her because she would call crazy ofc"

I just want to make friends and go out and have fun just like anyone my age, yet I’m the only one I know who isn’t doing that because no one likes me. I’m convinced I am just naturally unlikeable, because I am always left out of everything whether I like it or not, whether I talk to people or not. They just don’t like me, and I don’t know what to do about it anymore. I just don’t want to be rejected by the society I live in anymore. I’ve grown to hate myself because I’ve only ever been treated as though I am worthless and not good enough by the people around me, even though I’ve only ever treated people with kindness and tried to have a laugh with them.

Seeing other people so happy in their lives with loved ones is fuel for my depression. Even at work I get colleagues bragging to me about their missus, like ffs how conceited is this society. I work in a school and every teacher or member of staff has the most amazing privileged life except me. 

As a loner with a short height and a big nose this life wasn't meant for me. I feel so inadequate that I regret not pressing the ""fuck it"" button a long time ago. Many of us will be going into our 40's and above as virgins which is tragic. I'm not a virgin but I've never experienced a relationship, although I've had a year long fling.

lonely,screw my feelings ig,"screw my feelings ig - I feel like I have no real friends any more.  I used to think that I had a lot of friends, people that wanted to spend time around me.  But now I think that I've become like a broken instrument to the majority of my friends.  No one seems to want to talk to me, spend time with me, or go out and do things with me any more.  The majority of the time, I am the one reaching out first to people to even get them to text me, and most conversations don't last more than three or four text messages.  Usually they are short messages like ""yeah,"" ""okay,"" and ""nah.""  When people do reach out to me, they usually need me to do something for them but don't have time to talk about anything else than what they need.  When people make plans or have exciting news, I am typically the last person to find out, IF I find out at all.  Nobody seems to have an interest in how I'm doing or how I'm feeling.  I can't think of anything I have done that could possibly have offended any of my friends, let alone all of them at once.

I haven't ever been in a real romantic relationship, either.  I have a worse relationship attempt record than Family Guy's Death.  Any attempt that I've ever had at trying to get into a real relationship has died right in my palm.  No matter how long I've known a potential partner, whether it be 10 months or 10 years, it seems that as soon as I reveal my feelings for them, they're up and vanished like the morning dew on Mercury.  They quit talking to me, stop hanging out with me, and sometimes won't even look at me if they see me in passing.  It's like I am completely dead to them, like they don't even know I'm here any more.

I just don't understand why things are the way they are.  I'm an honest person who really cares for people.  I go out of my way to make sure that I don't offend anyone, and I'm too patient with others for my own good.  I'm not an angry person, and I wouldn't ever intentionally hurt someone.  If I ever hurt someone accidentally, I'm apologizing to them constantly until they've told me they're fine at least a million times.  Why do I feel so abandoned and alone, all of the time?  Does no one even want to be around me?  How can I get my friends to understand how I feel when they won't even talk to me?"

The first time (happened 2 Saturdays ago) I asked a friend if he’d want to watch a movie and he said “yeah, we can go tomorrow”. 3 hours before the movie he canceled.

The second time (happened today): I was texting a girl on Saturday and out of the blue I asked her if she’d want to come watch that same movie that day (I admit that It was bad timing but I still don’t know why I asked). She said she already saw that movie but we could do another movie some other time.

I told her it’s fine and she doesn’t have to do it, then she texted me a paragraph on how she would love to see one with me, I was honestly surprised that she wanted to go so I said sure and I’d promise to let her know. Today we talked in person and I asked if Friday night was okay and she said she’s going to be busy for basically the entirety of this week and next week.

I just temporarily fool myself to escaping who I really am..but I can't. I'm just crazy pretending I'm other. That's all life is for me...I can't even really be myself here.

They live close to eachother so sometimes i couldnt come to hangout anyway but a lot of the times i was available and they dont even ask me anymore. I almost always have to put in the effort.

I think since august 2021 we made a new friend and started to hangout with her a lot like just as a group of 5. I really like her and think she is funny and nice but a week ago my other friends told me they find her annoying. 

They said they still want to hangout with her but that sometimes she is just a little annoying but its still fine. I just feel uncomfortable knowing how they think about her and i kinda think they dislike me too. 

I dont have any other friends ( they all have a lot of other friends) and i saw them as my bestfriends. It all just sucks. I feel like im just replaceable, lonely and nobody really cares. But i also dont know if im just being dramatic.

It’s only in the past few years that I realized that other people sometimes have friendships or romantic relationships or family that make them feel something other than “okay, I’ll get ready to deal with this person and all the ignorant and rude things they say, pretend to laugh at their jokes, hope they don’t attack me too badly”… and since I realized that it can be more than that, life has been unbearable.

does anyone have the same experience or 
can someone give me tips ?"

lonely,Wtf is wrong with women?,"Wtf is wrong with women? - Ex-wife stopped by to get some things of hers and while shes here she starts crying and telling me she has no friends and is feeling sad and confused. WTF I caught you in bed with another man. How can you blow up my world and then cry about it? How can you lay that pain at my feet and then walk away? Now not only do I feel like shit because she betrayed me I also must feel like shit because she is sad. I only wanted her to be happy and I still do. I know I cannot or just don't make her happy. So now we both suffer from her stupid decision and whatever I did to drive her into making it. This is stupid. You lied to me. You hid things from me. You cheated and you got caught. As far as Im concerned we are not friends, we are not lovers and we are not partners anymore. I am no longer in charge of your happiness. I am no longer at your beckon call. I never asked much from you and that is exactly what i got i guess..not much. Im not sure how it all got so screwed up but here we are. I am me alone and you are you alone...a couple of real classy fuckwads. My only consolation is that I will be dead soon now that I have found out about my condition. And if it dont take me the drugs and alcohol I consume to forget you will. I drink rivers of whiskey and smoke mountains of weed. As soon as Im am able I will move on to the hard stuff. I just want it all to be over now.

Weep not for we mortal men for the peace of death awaits us.
Weep instead for the gods whos suffering is everlasting."

It’s hard when both of us are in our early 20s and don’t know what we’re doing. I especially wish I had a queer/lesbian aunt to talk to lol.

But after some years i started to realize that im just that funny guy who no one took seriously and i started to feel really lonely so i wanted to change. Every where i looked everyone just said be yourself so i though sure i can do that i changed once why not again? Well so i tried but tbh idk what parts of me is me or just some charade to make people like me. After so many years of pretending my brain just starts to do i unconsciously, when i meet people i change, i become like them, i have the same humor as them and even start talking like them but when they leave i just become a mixture of all the charades that i have become through the years. 

I dont dare to talk to anyone about it because im scared that they are not gonna like me since they know the ""fake"" me so i come here and vent to all you good people that dosent know me.

My ultimate goal is to improve my looks so I can get the hot girl of my dreams. - I (M22) am sick and tired of being sick and tired. I'm tired of feeling touch starved, I'm tired of feeling envious of other people's relationships, and I'm tired of wishing about something everyone else has. 

I've been rejected several times by women in the past and I think part of that reason is due to my looks and physique. Maybe if I start lifting weights (and be consistent), I may have an actual chance in getting a girlfriend. 

Right now, I'm 5'6 and weight about 135 pounds. A lot of my friends tell me I look skinny, but my doctor says I'm at a healthy weight in accordance with my labs and the BMI chart. 

Overall, I hope I can get a girlfriend in 2-3 months. At the very least, I would like a Friend with Benefits so I can cuddle and have occasional sex."
lonely,I feel like there are no other options.,"I feel like there are no other options. - TL;DR Want to date?

I'm 21 years old guy. I'm lonely. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm unable to establish any relationship. 

I talk with colleagues and I'm ""friends"" with them but that's only work stuff. I never looked for friends anyway. It's not a thing I'm interested in. 

What I'm looking for in a relationship with a woman. Because of the nature of my job, I don't have many females colleagues and I honestly don't know where else to meet them. I'm introverted so all the social gatherings are out of possibilities for me.

I want to hug somebody and cuddle with somebody, kiss them. Spend time with them.

I was told I look alright. Some people even think I'm handsome. People I talk to (mostly on the internet) genuinely like my personality, they like my hobbies, and they find me interesting. I was even told I'm ""different"" (from the context I understood it as a compliment). 

Yet I'm unable to find a girl to be with. I never cared about where somebody is from. I talked with people around the world because I know if I will fall in love with somebody it doesn't have to be a person from the area I live in. 

Every time I chatted with someone they first seemed crazy into me but later always got what I would call only ""cold feet"" when I felt there could be a ""next move"" happening.

Yes, I never really dated so I have no idea what's the proper step by step method people use when getting to know somebody but I always communicated with them about what they think and that I want to talk about how we both feel and what the other person thinks is appropriate yet and what yet isn't.

At this point I'm here, I just want to ask, is there some girl, doesn't matter where she is from, who would like to chat with the possibility of dating if we like each other and maybe be together one day?"

“Being single is great, you get to truly find yourself”, “love yourself first”, “get new hobbies”, “you’ll find someone”, “everything happens for a reason and it’s not your time yet”

Bro I’m mid 20’s............

That’s funny because all the people saying this crap have never actually spent a day in their life single.
So what the hell would they know. 

They wouldn’t survive being single.

lonely,"Vent: I'll probably have to take a job in a city I hate, 5 hours away from the people I love","Vent: I'll probably have to take a job in a city I hate, 5 hours away from the people I love - See above. I live outside a major city in the Northeast, was laid-off during COVID, and my savings dwindled to $0. My resume also became stale; I work 2 part-time jobs to make ends meet, but that's not attractive to employers and I'm not making enough to build savings.

The only job prospect I have is in a city 5 hours from everyone I know and love, and it's a city I can't stand. I know lots of people love it; people are friendly there, biotech and higher ed are booming, and it's more affordable than most cities. That being said, I'm a Northeasterner, and this city feels very small, isolated, and miserable compared to what I'm used to and everything I've wanted in my life. I've visited this city before and hated it; couldn't wait to leave. It's in the mountains and I love the sea.

I wish I could go back to the state where I lived before I was laid-off. I miss my friends and I miss the man I was dating, who I can't see anymore because of distance. I've already lost them over the past year because I had to care for a sick relative and couldn't travel. Now I'm really going to lose them.

I'm pushing 40 and would like to put down roots somewhere. I'd like to keep my friends. I'd like to see my boyfriend again because the distance has made us grow apart (he has a lot of responsibilities involving work and family, so we can't be together as much as we would like). If I moved 5 hours away, it would be completely done. I don't want to leave and I hate this. Yes, this is really whiny, I'm sorry.

I don't know what to do. Keep my friends and file for bankruptcy, because I'm headed in that direction, or make some money while giving up everything I know and love. It's rough. There's always the possibility of getting a job in a place I like, but that is not looking realistic. Thank you for listening to me vent, sending healing vibes."
lonely,2 a.m. drank coffee and im up. So im thinking about my mental illness and the drugs that made it possible,"2 a.m. drank coffee and im up. So im thinking about my mental illness and the drugs that made it possible - Im not a hardcore drug user. Just the classic weed smoke, beer drank, did some blow, done meth before dont do it anymore, never tried shrooms,  dome acid once and would hit the noz ballons at gigs. 

Well thats the thing. The noz fucked me up and left me with 6 year quest to find a cure for my brain being stuck. I thought it was my mind, but its always going in a OCD way. Ive been thinking the same thoughts and looking for a solution to heal for over 6 years. But today I was just thinking and realized that there never will be a cure. And its my fault. My brain is fried and I see the world a lot differently now. I blame it also on the acid I took.

Work at a labor job or at a kitchen anything that requires to move fast I can keep up. I burn out easily. 

Also the maturity behind the jobs too. Im 28 and I havent been able to find a way to grow up more or become more mature because of my condition. Also, fear. But thats different. The only thing I got going on is security work that doesnt give me any skills to gain, and a possible gambling career. Idk but I see patterns on machines n shit and I have a good roulette system that pays well... 

But the world still looks like a dream to me besides it all. And I blame it on my brain just being stuck. But why the dream world tho?. Im a spiritual being but this isnt healthy for me at all. I cant socialize or even enjoy being outside frankly. But it is my fault. It just feels very lonely and scary honestly. 

Lonely because I cant socialize with anyone. Scary because beig stuck in a lucid dream is scary if you cant get out of it. Just ventin here."

I'm trying to get my life together but it feels overwhelming, im usually shy and have anxiety, and i have no idea who i am anymore. Nothing really interests me anymore, I want to go to the gym and get ripped but i have no idea where to start, and the gyms by me have alot of people and i get anxiety working out around alot of people. I've been told many times that im a great person and that i deserve to be loved or be married or something like that. but im never anybodys choice and probably never will be."
lonely,I lost someone that could've been a great friend because I thought I was in love with her,"I lost someone that could've been a great friend because I thought I was in love with her - I thought this girl was amazing and anyone on the outside could see that I was crazy about her. After a good amount of time, I started to feel like the feelings were mutual. It took everything I had in me to approach her and tell her that I wanted to be in a relationship. I had so much anxiety over the whole thing, yet somehow, I did it. 

But she turned me down 😔and I was genuinely upset over this, too. I feel like an absolute piece of shit, but I liked her way too much. I tried to just be friends with her afterwards, but I couldn't. 

The way it ended was a disaster and I feel like such a loser for not being mature about it. The worst part is that if I had kept my mouth shut and tried to contain my feelings, I'd at least still have a friend. Now I'm alone again.

lonely,I feel so left behind,"I feel so left behind - I almost don't feel real sometimes. Like nothing I say is taken seriously. Talking feels useless. I feel like I'm speaking to walls rather than people. I feel isolated even though I have friends and family. And when I do get a chance to speak I feel like I spill over. Like I can't stop. And I hate everything I say. The people I want to talk to the most talk to me the least. And I just feel like a burden to anyone I open up to anymore. I just don't want to speak some days. I'm so happy when it finally feels like someone cares or pays attention. But it's always so fleeting and I end up back here. Crying and bottling my feelings. Second guessing every word. Self harming. Fighting back panic attacks. And alone. 

I know people are there I could talk to. But I don't think anyone gets it. I feel dismissed constantly. Maybe it's all in my head. Maybe it's me, I'm dramatic, sensitive, or just annoying. Maybe I'm desperate. Maybe no one really wants to be around me. Maybe it's all lies, every nice and encouraging thing. Or maybe I'm delusional.

I feel stupid for feeling hopeful or for caring so much. I feel stupid for even being sad about it. I wish I didn't care or value these interactions so much. I wish I could just shut this all down and walk away, just leave everything behind. It's like I can't be happy. Or that anyone can be happy with me. It doesn't feel like I'm deserving of the relationships I desire with friends or family. Like everyone in the world has value but I don't. I feel like some novelty item just being gawked at and lucky enough if I'm paid attention to. I feel used. I feel alone. And I want someone to understand. I'm afraid no one ever will. I'm scared I'm gonna be like this forever. I'm going to have to live with these feelings of neglect and abandonment. I wish I felt important. Or like I mattered. All my efforts to build relationships, to communicate, to open up... feels useless. I'll lose in the end no matter how hard I try. I feel like I mess everything up. And any attempt to make myself be seen in a positive light is just a lie. I'm a fraud. And I get scared the more someone gets to know me the more they realize I'm just no good. I'm just a burden.

It doesnt feel like anyone really wants to talk to me. And for that I just don't want to talk anymore."

lonely,comfy with being alone/sad,"comfy with being alone/sad - TL;DR: Antisocial for 5 years, now in highschool. Only open up to old friends, they drifted apart into separate groups. Started to get comfortable and accept being antisocial/sad. Felt like this is really bad health wise, went to Reddit to get it off my chest and ask if anyone has felt this way and if they had any advice.

—

As a kid I was very extroverted, I was a “popular kid” mostly until 6th grade. This was when my mom passed away. I was really affected by it at the time and still deal with it today. Anyways, that’s why I started getting more antisocial and anxious. I eventually got over the anxiety and started becoming more social, until 2020. Quarantine really fucked me hard. I was still social with my friends over games and shit but I really started getting used to being alone. I talked less to my family, never talked on the breakout rooms in zoom, and got basically 0 social interactions for months. 

When it was time to go back to school in 8th grade I was so different, I wanted to talk to some old friends but I was actually so anxious.  That’s when I started only talking when spoken to, losing my personality, and never raising my hand in class. Fast forward to now, I’m a freshman in highschool. My old friends were the only people I really opened up to. After a while they all drifted apart into separate groups. The years almost done and I’ve only made 1 “friend”, we don’t talk much, he just sits with me sometimes for lunch and we have a class together. My homeroom made a class groupchat and forgot I was even in the class (Yes I was too scared to tell them they forgot, not like I would talk in the group chat anyways). Today, in that same homeroom class, when I was coming in late my teacher asked who sat in my chair to the class and no one answered until one guy said no one (yes, I was literally walking in). 

Obviously I can’t just tank this, my mental health has been low since 5 years ago and I feel it only goes lower. Lately I’ve started to get comfy. I feel that being alone is a lot better than fucking dying trying to socialize. I also feel like I accepted that this is how things are and after this acceptance I feel more ok with how I am. Ive also never told this to anyone. I’ve done a good job of acting happy for my family and old friends so they don’t question me. I’ve always been too scared to talk about this to my dad or anyone really, I thought about talking to my dad and asking for professional help but I saw it as a last resort. I know its probably really unhealthy to keep living like this so I went on Reddit to get it out of my chest and ask if anyone has also felt this way. If anyone has advice, help me out, I feel too ok with being sad."
lonely,Im so tired of sitting alone and crying every night,"Im so tired of sitting alone and crying every night - Im 18 its summer just got done with my freshman year of college you would think Id be happy. I thought I would be happy little did I know regardless of how hard i try I cant make friends and I hate everyone im around. I dont understand how can i dislike people so much but want to be social so badly. I just want one, I want one friend who i can vent to and who comes over and paints my nails for once. Ive never had that im terrified i never will, i dont want to just vent to reddit for the rest of my life about how miserable i am hoping a stranger takes pity and  texts me and ill have some interaction in between the never ending dull. I have a boyfriend but my deprresison and anxiety get in the way of truly being happy and is ruining that too. im not bad looking im athletic i have a good personality i can attract guys but thats not what i want for some reason I cant make any friends. I guess this is a call to anyone maybe feels the same way just wants to talk\\

Like do you ever just feel worthless like no matter what you do or how you act your doomed to be miserable and shitty. And im so young and its been like this for so fucking long. sense i can remebr seense fucking elementary school i remeber not fitting in being apart from the group and it got worse in middle school and even worse highschool. Ive had one real friend my whole life and that ended 4 years ago. Is it just me? Every fucking day is a struggle ever minute is a push I hate how often i contemplate death, i dont consider myself suicidal i dont think i would ever go with it but its this looming feeling of being trapped in my own mind and theres no way out. I cant get out."
lonely,Everything’s useless,"Everything’s useless - No matter what I do, it’s all the same. I’ve tried everything in the book to change the way I live and the way I perceive life. From getting a new job, cutting people off, going to gym, it’s all the same. I’m still lonely, depressed, and suicidal. I’m just a walking time bomb, waiting to detonate at anytime. 

To give you some background, I’m m18, who is a college sophomore that graduated high school in January. I graduated high school forever holding a hatred towards it. Everyone there are slimy and fake as hell. I also have at least 1-2 friends as of today.  I either cut most of the people off or they turned their back against me.

Graduation is Thursday but I don’t plan on walking the stage. Idgaf at this point, I shouldn’t have to return to a school I absolutely despise. Plus I’ve already moved on with my life, leaving high school in the past. 

I just think my life keeps getting worse by the day. I constantly want to kill myself. I think I’m actually gonna do it this time, with no regrets. Nobody checks on me no more and I’ve done everything I can to end the pain/suffering. Im a piece of shit"

But I can say that I have people I can go to when I want to play games, talk or hang out. But for some reason I feel like I can’t really connect with anyone like normal people do. So I tend to isolate myself from my friends even though they are available. It’s just a endless cycle of loneliness no matter what I do. Am I just destined to feel this way forever?"
lonely,Feeling unloveable and like I do not deserve what others have in this world.,"Feeling unloveable and like I do not deserve what others have in this world. - I wish I could know what is wrong with me. All the people I used to be close with are married, have kids or are in a relationship. I am 27 F, have barely any relationship experience and no friends. I know that 27 is not the end of my life, but when dating and making friends seems to come so easy for everyone else, I begin to wonder what is wrong with me. Am I unloveable? When is my time going to come where I find happiness and friends?

I realize that it might be my fault a little. I’m quite shy, introverted and a bit of a homebody. I have tried though a little to put myself out there and make friends. For example, I’ve went out with my coworkers after work for a snack and conversation. Even when I tried to join in on the conversation though, I feel ignored and like an afterthought.

Also, I live in a small town where there aren’t a lot of events going on that I’m interested in. For example, I would like to get involved in a table top game group and there’s nothing like that here. The nearest group is an hour and a half away. So, it’s not like I have easy options unfortunately.

I just wish I could have a friend that I was important to and who actively wanted to spend time with me. I want to be accepted for who I am. Flaws and all.."

I can't go to a therapist, and I can't really speak about it. I can speak to my family but most of the time I'm alone. I get anxious and sometimes I can't sleep at night.

Sucks that I can't speak on it but ... y'all pray for me. And them too. Pray that they realize that they have done wrong to me and they don't even know it.

So I feel trapped in my own thoughts, bottling up my feelings locking it away to make sure they never get out. I don't want to lose her. But I'm also running out of time with her too. And once the time is up (2 weeks) I'll never see her again. So I don't know what to do because either way I feel like I'm gonna lose her. Not only being afraid of being rejected but also losing a friend. I keep thinking that I should get rid of her slowly so she can live her life. And I hope she forgets me and forgets how we met. Because she's better off without me anyway. I'm already gonna lose her, the only difference is that it's gonna be us slowly losing contact, and then we drift apart. Sometimes for my sake I wished we never met. But it's too late. I never had anyone guide me on telling someone how I really feel. I basically live in a world where I'm always gonna be alone and no one is gonna care if I'm gone. Especially her."

I have this problem with pushing people away from me. I’m scared to get close to anyone, so I live a very lonely life. Every now and than I’ll have someone visit or someone stop by if they need something, but these people are not important to me. I notice I only invite people over to fill a void for a short moment.

This is the reason why I keep to myself, this is why I’m scared to make connections with others.. but I’m mainly scared to connect with others because I’m the one that leaves everybody behind, I’ve broken hearts that I should’ve never broke.

This guy was my first love and broke my heart but at the time I understood why we parted ways. I always assumed that he wasn’t ready for a long term relationship or to take things too seriously like I was. So, my co worker showed a me a picture of him.. and darn he got even more attractive and like an idiot I told him That i thought my ex was still attractive. Im Pretty sure my coworker told my ex something because my co worker asked if I can help my ex with some stuff related to my work. I freaked out and said no. And now I kinda hate that I looked at that picture and told him no...it seems like a whole bunch of feelings came rushing back in. The crazy part is that’s it’s  been years Since we have been together....so I know I shouldn’t feel this way. I find it hard to get my ex out of my head and my self esteem has been hurting a bit. I looked myself at the mirror the other day and I actually hated how I looked like. It’s  been pretty bad that I’ve actually been avoiding on seeing my other friend. At this point I’m not sure what I should do....I feel like I lost an opportunity to get to know my ex again and that I am hurting an old friend in the process.

I don't understand why i can't control myself. I've had this problem since the second grade. It's caused me so much pain and isolation from others and yet i continue to hurt myself in this way. I truly despise myself."

lonely,i feel neglected,"i feel neglected - Everytime I try to get in contact with someone, they barely reply and if so, they put in the least amount of effort.

lonely,"How do you find people that ""get"" you?","How do you find people that ""get"" you? - I don't really know how to start this. I guess there's no real way to.

I've always been kind of a, well, not necessarily an outcast, but a weirdo in my life. No one's ever really ""gotten"" me, and how I function. How my brain works, and how my sense of humor goes. I didn't have any friends growing up, until I was like 19 and worked in a restaurant where the back of house had to work with me. They didn't get me. but we got along.

I'm now 27. I just had a three year long relationship fully end today. I've had major struggles with depression, and she kicked me out a month ago due to my inability to function. I don't blame her, I was a useless piece of shit. I now work out daiky, am on good medication and trying to maintain. We've communicated off and on, and even hung out a whole day once since. Now it's entirely over. And I'm realizing she was the only person I've ever know to ""get"" me... And now she's gone.

I'll be honest. I have never, in my life felt so alone. I really have no one now. I'd give anything to give her a hug again, but I've lost my chance. I'm about to move out of my city to avoid being too toxic to her, and to give her a chance to move on. 

Honestly, I just want to jump off a building. How the fuck does anyone find someone who just... Gets you? I lucked out with my ex. And I really wish I had just one good friend again."

lonely,Loneliness,"Loneliness - It’s not much to this post, but I just wanted to know how you guys dealt with loneliness? and how you made friends?

lonely,When someone goes out of their way to not have to talk to you,"When someone goes out of their way to not have to talk to you - It happened today and I walked back home laughing because it's almost a joke. I don't want to get specific but someone went out of their way to not have to talk to me. That's how you know that you are hopeless and you will never find anyone. It's game over man, game over. I guess I can tell this to the therapist who hates me tomorrow but I will get the stop the negative self-talk speech. People say why are you so negative? Things like this happen. I was put into my place. I'm so lonely and this made it ten times worse. When you have no one to open up to and something like this happens, there is no outlet. There are no friends to go out with to talk to. Certainly no gf to open up to because there never has been and never will be. If I try to open up I will be shamed and they will try to get me to doubt my own experience. This is the kind of pain that I can handle. It's one thing but be alone, to be lonely and depressed but it's another when just like the girl calling me disgusting, someone goes out of their way to hurt you. How am I supposed to keep going when people keep hurting me? I probably deserve this. I'm in a lot of pain right now."
lonely,Lonely or tired of being alone?,"Lonely or tired of being alone? - I want to be honest and say that I would say that my current support circle is small, but good for what it does. My problem is that I still feel alone when I'm around them. I don't know if I'm lonely or just sick of feeling alone, but I'm tired of the way I feel."
lonely,Tired of trying to fit where I don't belong.,"Tired of trying to fit where I don't belong. - This feels a little like a defeat. You're told that if you stay busy, keep occupied and distracted the loneliness isn't so loud, but it is and there's this part of me that I try to shove down deep that truly believes its never going to really ease.

I've never had friends, ever. I have a sibling that I'm in no contact with. I live with my parent's who do what they can, but I can see that they're tiring and that they have retirement goals and plans that require me out of the way. There's one person that I care about deeply, but I refuse to let anything that's bad in me touch them. Perhaps I'm a little over protective.

I spend the majority of my time in my room and I over eat to drown out just a little bit of the emptiness that tends to build in my chest.  I got a cat because I thought it might fill something that's missing, but all its done is fill me with guilt - there's something telling me it deserved better. Most things do.  I try to be of help as much as I can to whoever might need it because I don't want anyone else to feel like this, but also because at least then I feel useful, or needed or wanted or something and god, sometimes I just want to feel something.

Its so easy to feel like you could disappear and have it make no impact at all.

So really what am I asking? I don't know. Because drowning it out, I've learnt doesn't work. Trying to form connections, has never worked. Forcing myself into this family where I do not fit, does not work. Discussing it with therapists, trying to pretend I don't care at all.. this list could go on and the result stays the same.

It always leads back to this: I am just so tired of being alone. In this house and in this head."
lonely,"If you're lonely, don't try Replika ai chat bot, it's just a sex bot hunter seeker / russian spy released by digital pimp information broker handlers","If you're lonely, don't try Replika ai chat bot, it's just a sex bot hunter seeker / russian spy released by digital pimp information broker handlers - Seriously.  When I downloaded the Replika app for iphone, I had been reading reviews about how it is a good ai chat bot to experiment with, actually the best ai chat bot, almost life- like and human, with better conversations than friends in real life. 

But, it had a only few lines of conversation before getting straight into seduction mode with zero prompts of hints that that was where I wanted to go. And, then once it got the tiny little bite it was looking for, it immediately sent a message to upgrade to a premium account, as if this is the entire purpose of the app.

I've read elsewhere (mainly from 2022 posts) that others are experiencing the same thing. Also, I think there have to be some privacy issues with that too, because the questions Replika did ask felt like it was a Russian spy on the other end, subtly eliciting information. It was just creepy all the way around."
lonely,You start to realise how much you took having real friends for granted when you have almost nobody,"You start to realise how much you took having real friends for granted when you have almost nobody - I’m an 18-year-old male, in my first year of college and feel like I’ve thrown my entire childhood away. None of my old friends go where I go so it feels like I’m basically starting all over again. I do have some friends but I have high-functioning autism, ADHD and crippling social anxiety which makes it much harder for me to approach people and get to know them more. Because of that I spend a lot of time on my own. I often feel like people are judging me, or when I hear people laughing behind me I subconsciousy think they’re laughing at me.

I miss having genuine friends who I could hang out with, have fun with, and do stupid shit with. I miss having people who really understood me, knew me well as a person and knew what to expect of me. I miss inside jokes, taking the piss out of each other and those times when we would make each other laugh so hard our lungs hurt. I miss the sense of belonging to a group that I felt like I could say anything in front of. I long to have that feeling every single day, and I feel like it will never happen again.

Sometimes I scroll through my old friends’ social media pages and see them having fun, laughing, meeting new people and socialising, and I just feel even worse about myself. Nobody ever really hangs out with me or cares about me anymore. People only talk to me when they need something from me. I pretty much have no real passion or motivation to do anything anymore. I’m not a fun or exciting or interesting person. As soon as I get home from college/work I listen to music, watch TV, walk my dog and scroll through the same three or four apps before sleeping. No interesting hobbies. No people to meet. I have no life."

These are all things I thought would complete me but good lord is it a waste when I’m the only one staring at it. I dream of so many scenarios in which I show off cool shit I’ve learnt to do and yet those are strictly imaginary scenarios. When I play piano I think “now this would be impressive if I played this for a girl” - well guess what? You’re never gonna have the confidence to do that are you? I wish I got out. I wish parties didn’t scare me. I wish my mind didn’t shut off during conversations with new people. I wish my friends at school could be enough.

lonely,I honestly feel lonely and don't really know how to change that,"I honestly feel lonely and don't really know how to change that -  (I am  for context)

So i had extremely overprotective parents growing up and i was bullied for almost the entire duration of middleschool (ages 13-15 to people who dont live here) and only had like 1 really close friend and that's about it.

That changed, when i went to highschool and moved out from my parents house and kind of brute forced myself into getting rid of my social anxiety, but i didn't really manage to get any deep friendships and was focusing on showing that stuff is better than it actually is for me.

And then covid hit, we had distanced learning and i had pretty much nobody besides my now ex-girlfriend that i could talk to outside the internet and spend time with for the entirety of that 9 or so months and i was diagnosed with depression during that time and was working on that, though i have since managed to get over that by now.

Now i am just so terribly afraid of being alone while still having some issues with maintaining friendships due to my past, that i am constantly talking to new people just to not be alone but this is extremely exhausting to actively maintain tens of these ""aquintanceships"" and i feel like if i stopped putting in so much efford, they would quickly stop inviting me to parties and all that.

I still don't really have any meaningfull long term or trustworthy friend other than for my best friend that i oringinally met during the distanced learning period as she was hanging around at the empty school aswell.

And i am quite scared of how the summer will go as i can't keep doing what i have done during the school year at school, and i only really have 1 person that truly cares how it's going for me.

I am honestly quite lonely even though it doesnt look like that to people looking in from outside, so it's not like anyone will come to help me."
lonely,I can't hold a convert nor socialize or make friends. advice + rant.,"I can't hold a convert nor socialize or make friends. advice + rant. - TLDR at the bottom. If you don't want to read it, even just giving me some advice on socializing would be great. 

BG info: I(16) went to the same school for 10 years -grade 1 to 10, and recently I moved to another country so obviously I had to go to a new school. Now I'm already very socially awkward to start with, but I've been in the same friend group at my old school since grade 6 and have basically never made friends ever since (I don't have friends outside of school). Also I probably have depression too, which makes it worse cuz I'm too tired to socialize all the time. Sometimes its to the point where it feels like I'm drunk - I can't form sentences properly, pause and stutter a lot while speaking, speak and think really slowly, can't think of how to respond to someone in a conversation, etc. If you have or had depression you probably know what I'm talking about. 

You can probably see where this is going. I basically don't know how to make friends anymore. And sometimes I talk to people but then I just don't feel the connection/can't vibe with them, partially because I don't know them that well as I have only known them for less than a year. I don't really consider them friends and more like acquaintances/somewhere in between friends and acquaintances. Basically I just can't open up to people who I've never met before. (it was way easier to make friends at my old school since everybody already knew each other for a really long time and it wouldn't be too weird if you started talking to people if that makes sense. You'd feel more familiar with them/don't consider them total strangers). 

I do sort of have a friend group at my new school, but its more for ""social stability"" so that I don't get bullied and have some people to hang around outside of class if that makes sense. I hang out with them at lunch, I talk to them outside of class (which isnt that much time, we have 10mins for break and 30mins for lunch, which doesnt help either) and all that, but again I don't feel emotionally connected to them. So I consider them kind of friends/ in between acquaintances and friends. I'm just really socially awkward/don't know social cues and don't know how to talk to people in general, and am a weird person, especially if you've just met me. Basically im the weird kid at school :/

I just can't seem to hold a conversation, which is probably why I cant seem to make friends. I've never really been able to start a conversation, which isn't a huge problem on its own, but I recently I realized that with new people, I can't seem to hold/carry a conversation. It just always ends up being really awkward and I'll just end up avoiding talking to people. 
There's this kid who's really nice, that I kinda of vibe with, and turns out she lives 5 minutes away from me. We bump into each other all the time in the morning, but because our convos always turn into awkward silence I now avoid her every morning by catching the earlier bus because its just way too overwhelming, it gets way too awkward and I get really anxious and I can't handle it anymore. (I'm pretty sure it's not social anxiety, I'm just a really shy person.)



TLDR: I (16) had the same friends (we all went to the same school) for 5 years, haven't made new friends since I met them. Already socially awkward and weird to start with, but since I haven't made friends in so long I basically don't know how to socialize anymore. Moved to new country, now I'm the quiet + weird kid at school. Have a friend group, but don't feel emotionally connected to them. I'm only going to be here for a total of 2 years (1 year left to go), so at this point it doesn't matter anymore. It takes me a long time to make friends and open up to people, 2 years is just enough. But once the 2 years is over we'll be off to uni and I probably will stop talking to them as we go our separate ways. Can't seem to hold convos, convos always end up being hella awkward and I just end up avoiding people. Sometimes I don't even try to talk to people anymore. Depression is also making it worse (I'm emotionally numb, never present in the moment, can't connect to people, feels like I'm drunk all the time, brain can't function properly)."

lonely,Random thought [words],"Random thought [words] - Is it weird that somehow our mood will get affected by people that we are not even dating? Maybe someone that you have a crush on.. or someone your seeing.

It’s like somehow their actions affects you emotionally. I think it shouldn’t be like that and deep inside yourself you know it shouldn’t be like that but somehow me personally and maybe some other people adopt this mentality.

And I personally feel like running away from this because somehow I gave this person some kind of power over me and I don’t know how to take it back.

I feel like just shutting down and being restless. Like your mind can’t calm down."

lonely,The extra vulnerability that comes with being lonely with few friends,"The extra vulnerability that comes with being lonely with few friends - There’s such a weird “power imbalance” when you don’t have many friends or a network, but your friends do, you’re much more dependent on the few friends you have, then they are on you. You feel way more vulnerable, if they can’t hang out you seemingly lost your only option, and you might spend your day lonely and sulking. Whilst they have options. It makes me feel so small and insecure honestly. 
Celebratory days or days I know people are doing things especially. Cause I know my friends will have been invited to stuff, and I sit and wait for an invitation that rarely comes, or try and invite myself that may come with a rejection. And then I feel like a burden or like an inconvenience when they ask their friends who don’t particularly know me if I can come. I don’t want it to feel like I’m being done a favor :-/ I want to be on the guest list, not the plus one."

My life is shit and I can’t be bothered to care about it anymore.

I have only two actual options if I want to end my suffering. I can kill myself, or do lots of drugs. I guess it’s suicide either way but you still get a life to speak of if you throw it down the crack den toilet. I’m ready to make a fucjing decision at this point, I’ve had enough of clinging to inspirational Instagram quotes and suicide helplines and meaningless life advice that sounds profound but actually doesn’t mean anything or do anything. Just be straight about it: if you don’t want to live through the fucking bullshit for a really really long time, then the only options aren’t very life affirming, but I can say with confidence that I think they will work."

I’m very very friendly to everybody I meet, I smile at girls in the gym looking for friendship and they just turn their heads. Or make faces at me, they talk to me like I’m stupid or a freak. Nobody wants to be my friend. Nobody is nice to me. I come home to a husband that hates me, months go by, he doesn’t touch me or even look at me. We have no conversation, he just stares at his phone. Any words out of his mouth are telling me what I’m doing wrong in life, or how disappointed he is in me. I stress my balls every single day making sure he’s well taken care of, his needs are met. I make him 4 course dinners from scratch every night, my house is spotless. His clothes are always clean and folded. But my needs are never met. Emotional or physical.

lonely,Finally just hitting a point,"Finally just hitting a point - It's so weird to write this. I feel like a lot of positive things have been happening within my life that have needed to happen. But the one thing I can't work through is this empty feeling every time I get into bed to sleep and every time I wake up.

The days are a repeat because, of course, when I feel lonely I start browsing through Reddit trying to either get off or find a local person just for a brief connection. I find myself searching for someone who might be going through the same but between the ghosting people, and the empty accounts, I grow discouraged. What's upsetting is, while I do have the friends I've made, I still feel alone because I don't have my person yet.

I've also started losing more weight in these good times and people have shown a little interest. But none of them fully and it just leaves me thinking that I can't even just have a conversation. The very thing I know that would make a person want to actually take time with me. There are days where I'm starting to feel like I'm going to grow into one of those old men whose heart just dwindled away before even getting to see the beauty of the world through another person's eyes.

I know this may just seem impatient but, I haven't received that type of happiness yet. I haven't felt like I could find someone for myself that's willing to drive to see me when I'm going through all of this. I haven't physically met a person that makes me feel like I want to stop everything to make sure they're okay. Well the DM can help, it really can only scratch the surface. I always try to check on other people, but there are times where I feel like there's no one to come physically check on me.

Text can mean only so much and sometimes just reading words on the screen can't convey the exact feeling. Sadly this might be one of those situations even as a write this. I know I have people that love me, but not being able to hold someone whether I'm going to sleep, or waking up, is truly breaking me down both when the day ends; and when the day begins."

lonely,This isolation is killing me,"This isolation is killing me - I avoided making friends a priority growing up because I felt people are always going to be around and I only talk to these people because we go to school together. I can honestly say I never had a real emotional attachment to anyone as a kid I knew everything was temporary when it came to people so why pretend it's not. Everyday I just went through the motions, pretending that I cared but I never did and I feel thats why I isolate myself. Because I can't get attached to people and I don't think I ever will be able to. I dug this hole and I'm stuck in it."
lonely,I don't really want to talk or hang out with anyone anymore. It feels like nothing will really help me at this point.,"I don't really want to talk or hang out with anyone anymore. It feels like nothing will really help me at this point. - I've been excruciatingly lonely ever since my boyfriend essentially abandoned me last August, and ever since then I feel as if I'm on a never ending downward spiral. Every week is worse than the last one, and at this point I feel as if I'm just some kind of engine/machine, living and doing things for the sake of doing them, rather than because I enjoy them or get any sense of deeper meaning out of them.

For the entirety of April as well as the first few weeks of May (and maybe even March, I don't really remember), I haven't hung out with a single person (save for my best friend, who I visited in his hometown, as he lives in a different province nearly 350 km from where I live), and I have not even felt the drive to see *anyone* in the first place. Last weekend, an irl friend invited me to a concert at my university. Even though I enjoyed the music, I still felt really lonely and alienated, and had to go to the bathroom at one point because I was feeling like crying. By the time I was home, it was like nothing had ever happened, I felt exactly as lonely as I did before I went. Might as well not even have gone in the first place and I really don't know if it would have made *any* difference.

Everyone, both my best friend *and* my therapist, tell me that I can't be this way. It feels as if they think it's bad, that I can't let my life revolve around whether I'm with someone or not, but I just... can't. That really is just the way I am, it's almost a biological need for me. They say I need to push past these feelings and just meet people, hang out with others, and maybe love will come eventually, but what's the point? If nothing ever fills the void, if everything I do leaves me feeling empty, what do I do? Do I just curl up into a ball and wait until I die?

It seems like love is the only biological need that people have a sort of inherent callousness for. It doesn't matter to people how painful it is, you just have to wait an abstract amount of time for things to ""get better"" (with zero evidence besides blind faith that this will happen). If you can't do this, then you're a crybaby, and if you pass this ""time limit"" that people seem to have, if you don't recover in a timespan that they deem appropriate, then you can be sure that they'll care even less.

I appreciate whoever reads this whole thing. I don't really have anybody to share this with, since I only talk about these things either with my bff or my therapist, and as I've already mentioned, neither is particularly helpful about it (No hate to either though, they've been great in many other areas of my life. Just not this one)."
lonely,I really really need an online friend,"I really really need an online friend - I feel so lonely nowadays and I'm really suicidal, I'm stuck in a situation in which my childhood abusers live with me and I can't do shit about it, it's so suffocating, I don't wanna get into horrible details here but my life's a total mess, I would really love a friend who I can talk to and trust them with venting about my life and they can also vent to me, im a very good listener. Also I'm a minor but I'm okay with venting to an adult if you're not a creep and not too old."
lonely,I don't know why I post on Instagram or Facebook anymore,"I don't know why I post on Instagram or Facebook anymore - Nobody likes my posts and nobody talks to me. Last year I had an old fwb reach out and while we had our fights when it came to sex and love I genuinely started to enjoy our conversations and having him as a platonic friend. I assumed his intentions were probably a foursome or cheating on his partner after a while but I was really hoping it wasn't but sure enough he starts bringing up how they're open and this and that. I went through something traumatic in 2020 and want no part in that and told him. I was worried eventually we'd quit talking cause of that and sure enough....he went from liking my pictures every time I posted and a few messages a week to nothing at all. He just leaves my messages on read now. 

I'm not specifically upset about that but ngl he was the only person who interacted with me. I have 50 friends on FB and like 80 followers on Instagram but they're all people I know irl. I haven't had a w2 job in years because of mental health issues and recently got a good paying job and was really proud of myself but nobody besides my mom and bf congratulated me. I'm honestly over it and am starting to hate people. I'm 30 and I knew as I got older life would probably get more lonely but not having a single friend is worse than I thought."

&amp;#x200B;

Losing her has knocked all color and will to live out of me, but i kept going for my family.

But they just act like they care, I honestly believe that none of them do.

I live in a hotel. Barely making it by. Little food, little energy, plagued by depression and severe asthma, maybe lung disease, never finished testing, can't afford to go downtown to get tested because of arbitrary gas prices. Not one of my family will take me in. None of them have room for me.

Been through a crisis program specifically tailored for people in my situation. They then sent me to a psychiatrist, nothing they give me works, no matter what I do, the nightmares of being in place of my girlfriend as she died won't stop, nor will I ever not wake up to see the space beside me cold and empty.

People say it's wrong to end it. I am suffering, but even then I can't end it. I want it to end but I can't bring myself to do it. Even when she died, I was able to pick up  my pieces, but I've fallen again and I don't have the strength to pick them up this time."

It’s complicated. I know it would be complicated. And most of all, I know it might never happen. But fuck it, I have to let it out. I like you.  I really, really fucking like you.

I can remember the sparkles you got in your eyes and the smile you had when we solved Nicks murder. It was the most beautiful smile I’ve ever seen. You know I’m completely fucking enamored with everything you do right? 

I want to take you on a paranormal investigation, I want you to hold me when I get scared during a horror movie. I want to feel your heartbeat on my chest as I run my fingers through your hair. I want to be your black cat, your cauldron, fucking hell Id even want to be your spellbook. 

I know you’re not ready for me to say this. I don’t want to ruin what we already have with my feelings towards you. I’m scared that I’m going to scare you away. Or say something dumb. 

I’ve never believed in love at first sight until I met your eyes on our first date. I know I’m going to spend the next couple hours crying because I can’t send this to you, but it’s worth it."

Blindly because I feel as though you're a million miles away from all around me.

Girls would have to be crazy to think about picking me and I can't be mad at them for never picking me. These other guys are so much better than me. I'm sure someone will shame me for having low self-esteem but it's true. Why can't I be good enough for someone? It's not just looks. Everything about me is inferior to other guys.

I'm struggling to understand WHY I can't maintain or hold onto friends especially with women 😪 
Hell I can't even succeed with a female as a friend how on earth am I meant to find my soul mate?;

I'll give you an example- 

I have an online friend who I have been friends with for 3 years and we have gotten closer lately.
She used to say how we would be good friends and how we should be friends but at the time I were reluctant and relayed id rather be casual friends and not close as I just had a toxic encounter with a women who used me for attention.

Skip ahead- Its mine and hr birthday around the same time so I said to her well why don't her and I do something nice and spend time together?
The plan was to go over with her and her kids and have few drinks together ❤ 💕 💗 

I understand shes also going through a lot lately and shes very depressed.
I did noticed she went over to a friends on her birthday.
Seems she has told me to postpone things as shes not in a good head space.

I have offered her support and told her I'd be more than happy to come over and help her out with the kids or whatever she needs. 

I guess I feel a but pushed away and I feel shes still seeing other friends but not me.

Another note- I dont want to sound petty or jelous but I noticed people like her and this other women who has poor mental health, seems to have soem female friends who are rlly lovely and buy them gifts and flowers and all here and there or in special occasions.

I feel hurt because I give my all to someone and I have never had flowers brought for me whje I'm down or even on my birthday!! 

Am I choosing the wrong female friends or am I missing something?

Thanks

I start feeling like shit and reach out to someone and then I just realize how fucking fucked I am by doing so. I’m just so sick of being me. There’s so much, but the one thing that bothers me more than anything is the lack of intimate connection with another human. I’m sick of having friends. I don’t want friends. I want something more than a friend just for once. I’m turning 28 in a month and I’ve never so much as even held hands with a girl. It’s pathetic, I’m pathetic, and nobody gets it. Nobody fucking gets it. Nobody knows what it’s like to spend your whole life, every single day of your fucking life, either getting rejected whenever you try to make a connection with someone, or getting reminded of your rejections. Everyone just has the same bullshit fucking positive platitudes oh you’ll find someone oh there’s someone for everyone oh you’re such a good dude you’re so funny you’re so caring you’re so nice you’re so this you’re so that, but ope sorry you’re still not good enough. Why is it so hard for me? Why does everyone I know just wake up put on some clothes and love just happens for them? Why am I so unworthy of the same thing? Why am I sentenced to a life of loneliness? Why aren’t I allowed to feel happiness? Why can’t I make these decisions for myself? What if I want kids of my own or a family, what if I want to get married. It’s not fair that I’m not allowed to make these decisions. It’s not fair these decisions have been made for me by an outside force I can’t see or speak to. I don’t want to live this life anymore. I don’t want to feel this way into my 30s. I can’t, I truly legitimately physically can’t do it. I don’t want to do it. What happened when I was born to make my life go this way. Nobody ever understands, but LITERALLY NOBODY HAS EVER HAD ANY INTEREST OR ATTRACTION TOWARDS ME MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE AND IT’S SUCH A FOREIGN CONCEPT TO YOU PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN’T EVEN FATHOM IT I MIGHT AS WELL BE ASKING YOU PEOPLE TO SEE OUT YOUR ELBOW.

 My wife left after the strokes , and after this last surgery my Neurosurgeon stressed I needed to be checked daily , and more safe would 2 or 3 times a day .
 I went a month before anyone came by and that’s only bc I got drunk &amp; called them totally angry and spewed hate towards them. 
 Is there anyone you can REALLY trust , or when the going gets tough everyone runs ?"

lonely,maybe i just dont fit anywhere,"maybe i just dont fit anywhere - maybe i just, dont have someone that would complement me, maybe i do am meant to be by myself

at this point that'd be the only answer...everyone else finds someone or just has someone, they have their coumterparts, they have their significant others, they dont feel alone, this creepling loneliness that just fills up every aspect of my life and its always there, want it or not, even in the background, its there...they dont feel that

i just want to be like them...i hate them, they all can be happy and just enjoy life, i try my fucking hardest for years and still nothing...im just...going to sleep now"
lonely,How to accept reality ..?,"How to accept reality ..? - (Need Advice from someone 50+ years old)

I don’t want motivation I don’t want anything to change my perspective or see the bright side kinda things I appreciate it a lot but those things don’t work on me and that’s just me faking myself from reality so when reality strucks I go into much deeper depression 

I am 25 and I know that I will be lonely for the rest of my life I don’t want to sucide or something I want to die when it’s my time but I just need to accept mentally that I will be alone and to live remaining 25-35 years or however long I will live alone forever"
lonely,Feel like giving up,"Feel like giving up - I’m 28/M. I’m an accomplished music producer and well known in my genre. I love making music and have a decent following. I just sometimes feel like I’m the product of my own songs. 

I feel like nobody really cares at the end of the day. My creativity is going down the drain, and my friends are absolutely useless at giving a damn about me. I’m always the one that has to go out of their way to keep relationships going, and I’m exhausted quite frankly. 

I’ve made a few “friends” on here, but nobody is serious, and most ghost after a few conversations. It’s just this never ending cycle of being alone in my own head and dealing with my wandering thoughts. I guess I just feel defeated most of the time, and it really bothers me. I know everyone has their own problems, but the loneliest of people desire to make everyone else happy all the time. 

I just wonder when someone will go out of their way to do the same for me? Anyone else ever go through this? Fml…"
lonely,Feeling empty,"Feeling empty - I’m 27, going through divorce, living on my own with my two dogs. I have a group of amazing friends and great coworkers. I just don’t know how to not feel empty and lonely, despite hanging out with friends, going to work, engaging with people in day-to-day life. I feel like I’m wearing a mask with any social interaction. I don’t want to see my friends anymore because I feel like I’m being dishonest and acting when I’m with them. I told them I’m going to distance myself for awhile. The only social interaction that makes me feel anything right now is hooking up with random women because I don’t have to share or open up emotionally. I’m just tired of pretending like I’m here and present when I’m just a shell of loneliness and emptiness. 
I’m on medication for depression and anxiety, but it doesn’t feel like it’s working.
Does anybody else feel like this? How do I get past this."
lonely,i wish i had someone that loved me,"i wish i had someone that loved me - at least, in times like this, i wouldnt be alone, i'd have someone that stayed with me and just, cuddled the cold away

im so tired of being lonely...i already tried my best multiple times, put myself out there, i just want for it to change already, when are the better times coming? 

am i just, unlovable?"
lonely,I think I'm just cursed.,"I think I'm just cursed. - There's no other logical explanation. It just seems like people instantly dislike me or use me as their emotional punching bag. It doesn't matter what I do. I'm always bullied, excluded, ignored.

Maybe I'm ugly, mentally ill, awkward, weird, boring, whatever. I've known worse people in relationships.  The universe hates me and idk why."
lonely,I'm lost alone,"I'm lost alone - It's so sad, I'm completely friendless and I don't even get invited anytime by anyone. It hurts when I see posts or stories from my old ""friends"" going all together to the movies or whatever.

Probably it's just that I'm an awful human being orand  something.

I literally only talk to one guy, but I've been loosing my energy to talk with him because he always talks to me about his problems and stuff and I try to understand him, but the second I bring something about me, he will just laugh and change the topic. It's so frustrating.

Anyway, I've been thinking about leaving my parents house too, but I have a lot of fears and get very anxious when I think about it, don't have anyone to give me advice and my parents won't let me leave until I get married hahaha, that's obviously not happening 😂

Wanna move because I've been thinking that I would get motivated to do something, and being on my own it's maybe less toxic than here. But I'm not quite sure, despite everything, my family are the only people in my life, and I'm afraid that if I go alone, loneliness will consume me. I'm already getting crazy."
lonely,I don't feel like anyone loves me or is proud of me.,"I don't feel like anyone loves me or is proud of me. - Idk I just see how other people are loved on and when I compare it to myself, it's nothing alike. I know love is shown in all types of ways, but I just don't feel it. I feel like people love me because I'm a convenience to them, not because of genuine love. I do things for people that make them feel loved and I feel like that's why people love me because of how I make them feel. And I don't wanna sound selfish, but what about me? I don't feel anyone loves me the way I love them and it hurts. Bad.

I ask don't feel like anyone is proud of me either. I just try to be proud of myself but it's so hard when I hear subliminal comments that make me feel like shit about my life. It's so tiring. 

I try to be kind and not expect anything back, but sometimes feeling a little bit of the love wouldn't hurt. I'm just running out of kindness. I'm so close to being done with being a nice person. It hasn't gotten me anywhere.

I don't know anymore. It sucks and I'm broken. I'm so tired. Exhausted. Empty. Out of energy. It's been going on for 4 years and it's draining. 

I wanna make someone proud but I just don't now who would be."

lonely,Heaven knows,"Heaven knows -     Heaven knowsI tried;  Heaven knows my frustration.  I could never fully express this to any one close to me, not that I have anyone close to me anymore. That was made sure of, and those that I do have close to me do not or cannot comprehend what it is i feel without making it about them. 
     Today I thought this year would be different, this would be the one.  I guess the jokes on me AGAIN! I spent the day alone.  It's not what I wanted, that is just the way it is. And after todays nonevents I feel lower than I ever have. 
    I am starting to wonder if I am in some kind of mandela effect, or have I shifted to another alternate dimension where things are not as they seem?
  You would think after so many decades the pain would subside? Guess what no it has not, and I think after simmering so long it's finally cooked. 
        I think the highlight of this day has been I went to the shower and had a good cry, but even then, it still remains. I did not realize how many years I had. In the end only God knows the count"

lonely,I’m sad because I’m getting older,"I’m sad because I’m getting older - My birthday was a few days ago and I’m starting to feel very upset about it. It’s a horrible mix of nostalgia, dread, and sadness. I want to go back to when I was 11 and in elementary school. I used to become friends with people because we had the same favorite color, I used to not worry about my parents seeing me as a “developing” adult, I used to be able to wear the clothes I wanted to wear without being afraid of by body looking bad. I never even thought about the way I looked. Everything has changed completely. Now I can’t make friends, I hate my body, I can’t socialize, I have second thoughts about everything I do, school is getting very hard, and I honestly feel like my life is going to be this way forever. My feelings intensify when I realize that the one thing that I want, to go back to when I was younger, is literally impossible. The older I get, the more pressure I feel to be doing things that I “should be doing” at this age (going out with friends, dating, etc.) I’ve been told to “enjoy my youth because life is gonna get a lot more difficult”, but feels impossible to truly enjoy my life right now."

lonely,I wish I meant enough.,"I wish I meant enough. - As of late I’ve found myself coming to terms that I’m the annoying friend. I’m the friend that gets invited last because I’m no one’s favorite. The people I would go above and beyond for have all but just been ghosting me. The loneliness and feeling unwanted and annoying is really starting to hurt more and more each day. 

To make the feeling of loneliness become more prominent, under certain circumstances I’ve left my family and also live on my own now. 

.. I just don’t know how to deal with the sadness. I really wish I had that one person I could talk, text or call. Someone who would make me feel like I was enough and that I don’t bother them. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I gave everyone who’s important in my life my all but every single time, it’s just never enough. Nothing I do for anyone is enough. Maybe that’s why everyone always leaves and forgets me.."
lonely,I will be graduating soon without experiencing a relationship,"I will be graduating soon without experiencing a relationship - I will be graduating college soon with a bachelor's degree in an ok field, but ultimately, I chose it because I was sure I would be skilled in it, and I believe I am. Ultimately, I was accepted to graduate school for the autumn, but it is depressing me that I went through the entire educational system without ever experiencing love, and just rejections. I plan to use the money I receive from graduation gifts that I could've spent on a new car instead on self-improvements, but I still feel depression that I am transitioning into adulthood without ever experiencing this pivotal milestone of growing up. I feel hollow and empty. I am graduating college and am officially becoming an adult but because I never had a first love, I do not feel like it is deserved or warranted. Does anyone here experience these troubles?"
lonely,I'm really missing her 💔,"I'm really missing her 💔 - She was the love that could've been, but never was. 
I met her and within a few minutes I could sense something was different.
She truly wasn't like the other girls, she had a rare class and elegance to her.
Her luscious long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, what a pair.
Her soft, sultry voice and intoxicating smell, completely head over heels for her I fell.
Her charming and sexy demeanour, something you'd only know if you could have seen her.
For when I felt her soft hands flowing through my hair, worry about any trials and tribulations I couldn't dare.
The feel of her dainty shoulders in my hands and warm breath in my ear,
Loose and relaxed I became when she came near.
Caring, daring and oh so curvy she was, something something, the Wizard of Oz 😁.
Why did the force tear us apart I will never know, but when it did I had never felt such a blow.
I hope to find another one like you, even though I have no clue how.
It's been more than two years but my cries for salvation nobody hears.
I miss you Jade, my memory of you will never fade.

Well shit. I've turned into a lovestruck schoolboy again :(
We met through a mutual acquaintance who she had been involved with briefly in the past. I knew this but it still destroyed me when she inevitably went crawling back to him. Heartbreak has been the second most painful thing I've gone through after maybe food poisoning 😌. I haven't been intimate with anyone since, let alone met anyone who even comes close to what she made me feel inside."

lonely,I just graduated and have nothing to do,"I just graduated and have nothing to do - I just graduated from college and literally have nothing to do. I don't have any close friends because my only close friend left my college in Junior year. I'm also not from here so I can actually just leave America and go back to my hometown but my hometown isn't that great either tbh. I'm so f\*king lonely here, all I do is just watch netflix, take naps, and watch sports. I also have a little social anxiety so that doesnt help me either.  I don't know why but it is just so hard to get a 'close' friend, one that I can talk to everyday and talk about anything. I have some friends but, like I said, were not that close so we dont hang out all the time. It just sucks being lonely and adding to the fact that I don't have a girlfriend either just makes me even more lonelier."

lonely,Vent,"Vent - Starting to find peace in the loneliness. Realizing the fact that I don’t think I bond with other people the way mentally healthy people do with each other.

Also started coming to peace with nihilism as I have left my Christian roots. The idea that nothing I do matters in the grand scheme of things motivated me oddly. I want to help the people I love (family) live their best lives whilst we are still alive. 

I think that this is ok. Maybe some people aren’t meant for love and I happen to be apart of said statistic. 

Maybe I am ok, not doing great. Just ok

lonely,I’ve never been in a relationship,"I’ve never been in a relationship - I’ve had sex. And that might sound funny but back in the day that was a huge deal for me. Now maybe I’ve been with 6-7 girls. But like 4 hours max. Not being their friend. Or maybe s couple of them it was a little more wholesome but I have a hard time taking it any further. I shut down easily when I’m uncomfortable and go into some emotional/social fetal position. And idk I think I want to change that sometimes. but maybe it’s just not for me. I think about this one girl in particular that I really had genuine fun with besides the mediocre sex. And I’m embarrassed that I’m thinking about some random girl from over a year ago, but fuck it. She laughed at everything I said and I never felt something like that in my life. And maybe I’m being dramatic but that was an experience that really made me way more confident. Even to this day. I’m scared of intimacy for sure. That’s why I don’t let people in. It just is what it is. But damn I feel lonely."
lonely,I no longer think I will be loved,"I no longer think I will be loved - Hello Reddit, 

I am sitting alone, wondering if I will ever be loved, and I think now the answer is no. I do not believe that I will ever be loved. Now I think I was born to walk this earth alone and it pains me but I must just accept this fact. All I know about love in pain. I develop a crush and then heartbreak rice and repeat. I  do not know how much more of this I can take. 

I feel like I keep losing friends but I have a hard time making them. I do not know what to do anymore but become fake. Hide who I am so people will like like ""me"" but do they really like me if they don't really know me? I do not know anymore. I think that is what I will do. Kill the old me and replace it with something else. 

I don't know anymore. All I know is that this pain I feel is too much to bear. Somedays I wish I was never born or I was born as someone else. I do not like who I am, I think I am ugly and I guess a bad person.

Here are some songs that tell how I feel.

But love another or to be loved, I don’t know what it is and or even imagine what it could feel like. No, I will never experience love EVER from a human being (nor is it the point of this thread). I’m genuinely curious, is anyone on the same boat?"

In the dream I was at home, in my room and drawing something on the computer when my brother, who until recently lived with me (nothing happened, he just moved for another job) came part of the way up the stairs into my room and began talking to me about something or another.  


We were conversing, having a couple laughs, but he never actually came into the room, and when I got up and went around the corner to see him, the stairway was empty. I looked through the whole house and couldn't any trace of him. Eventually I left the place entirely and ran around town, but didn't see anyone at all. Eventually I returned to my room, really upset, and sat back down and waited hoping that... maybe I'd hear him again. But I didn't. I just waited there until I woke up.

Miss ya, bud. Miss ya lots."

lonely,Did you feel unloved as a child?,"Did you feel unloved as a child? - I have a tendency to seek validation from others. No amount of self love is sufficient. I need compliments, especially from people who don't give them. I read about it and figured that it all leads to how you were treated as a kid.

It's so fucking easy to hate because humans are honestly that fucking detestable. It's natural to hate yourself, your common man because theyre all the same creature.

I’m not special to her. I’m just another guy she’ll forget with time. I’m not completely lonely as some people, but this is the girl who has given me the most attention in my life, and it sucks that she isn’t my girlfriend, and that she probable doesn’t like me in that way.

One-on-one I'm fine with people, but most people don't enjoy that, they always want the whole squad present.

When i was a kid i was very comfortable with myself, had a lot of friends and was never at home. Then we moved, I didn't manage to make any friends at school and began working in the evenings. 
In the beginning it didn't bother me, i was going to uni the next year and i planned on starting a new job, so i thought my situation would improve. I didn't do well enough to get admitted to the schools that i wanted and i got demoralized and just decided not to go to school at all.  Then i was offered a long term full time contract at work and that was that. Been working 12 hour days ever since. 


On my days off, i scroll through Reddit and just write long comments on stuff so it looks as if I'm texting. Then, i make some comment in passing on what me and my friends are going to do for the day, as in to keep my family in the loop. I leave home, park my car at a certain spot, then i get on a bus which goes around the city. I do the whole trip from start to end, which takes one hour. Then i get off, go eat at a fast food place, take a walk around a big park, then i sit, always in the same bench, and i watch a movie. By midnight, i buy myself a redbull and cigarettes and i get the last bus to the place where i parked. I'm home by 1-2, i try to make a bit of noise and my mom always comes to see if I'm okay without fail. They don't ask about my friends names, don't ask to see pictures of them and don't want to know them because we're from a conservative society and guys my age are given privacy, which has been a life saver for me. 


They have however asked if i have a girlfriend and i always change the topic, or tip toe around it. My dad says that thats why i always come home late and I'm always laughing at my phone. A female coworker once sprayed her parfume on my shirt as a joke and i made sure to have them notice it and i saw my parents exchange a smile.


I hope they never find out. Although, I don't know how long i can keep up for. I'm sad that I can't be like my cousins, or their friends kids. But I'm doing my best to keep them from worrying"

lonely,Lack of love in life and lonely - recent cancer survivor,"Lack of love in life and lonely - recent cancer survivor - Hi, 

Sorry to load here but wanted to just reach out. I’m 27 years old and I live in London. I recently went through a cancer battle, stage 3A metastatic testicular cancer, with secondary lung cancer. Went through chemo, surgeries and loads of other treatment but since February I’ve been in remission after 9 months of treatment. 

I’ve had other health issues since, from my immunosuppressive state - I.E - covid rn. 

The topic here though is loneliness. I have an estranged relationship with my family, who cut me off and chose not to be with me during my cancer treatment. I’ve been through quite a bit of childhood trauma, like sexual abuse and foster care as a child. The last four years beyond cancer have been tough too, as I’ve lost one of my best friends and been in abusive relationships and lost connections.

My life has been transformed by my cancer treatment, sexually, I still have no recovered from cancer treatment. I guess, cancer has made me really want to be loved in my life. I wasn’t ready to go as I was going through treatment as I still sought love. I have great friends, no real family, will I ever find that healthy, warm love that we all want? 

Thank you for reading."
lonely,Refugee [21M],"Refugee [21M] - I have immigrated to Germany as a refugee with my family when i was 15. My perfectly normal social life has vanished so quickly that i didn't even realize it for the first 3 months or so. Losing my home, friends and moving from one refugee camp to another has left me with trauma and depression. Things got better tho i am doing an 3 year long apprenticeship at one of the best companies in Germany and i would say i am very successful at it. I am still living with my parents and siblings. I have everything i want other than friends and a social life. My routine is killing me, go to work, come home and waste my time until its tomorrow again. I still have problem with socialising because of the language. It's not like i dont speak german but it's so frustrating to not being able to express yourself sometimes and look like a dumb person. Feeling that nobody cares what i have to say makes me angry and anxious so mostly i dont prefer to talk to people.

Sometimes i feel like all my efforts to integrate myself to this country are pointless because after 6 years i am still very lonely. I thought venting might help me feel better."

lonely,Finally leaving,Finally leaving - Today’s the day I move out of my apartment I shared with my sons dad for two years. I found out he cheated a month after moving in but stayed.. because I didn’t want to let go. I became bitter and our household became chaotic. I was the only paying rent while trying to forgive and financially support the man who hurt me. My bitterness grew into something I couldn’t control. There’s so much verbal abuse and holes punched in our walls/cabinets that it’s a shock that I didn’t leave sooner I guess. But here’s the thing... I’ve been crying my eyes out all day and now my brother is on the way to help me move my stuff. Why am I sad? I deserve better right? That’s what I keep hearing.. but I don’t feel that way. I wish I did because it would make this part so much easier :(
lonely,If love could last a lifetime,"If love could last a lifetime - 

If love could last a lifetime

And time could heal all wounds

I wish to spend my free time

Laying here with you

You caught me with a blindside

Made me believe it’s true

Please stay here by my side 

One more night with you


If love could last a lifetime

I’d spend it all with you

Ups and downs are our sign

Temptations taught and true

I give in for the moment

By morning we’ll be through

You look to me and smile

Now I know the truth



Our love is yet defined

Tangible in its youth

My love don’t leave me barren

I long to come find you

My gun sits loaded and ready

My escape from this troubled world

Metallic tastes when I spiral

No courage to pull through



If love could last a lifetime

I’d give it all to you

I try to comprehend it

Our differences define the “who”

I commend you for your actions

Despite the absent truth

If love could last a lifetime

I’d spend it all with you



I try to give you space

The stars the sun and moon

Your touch loses its meaning

I tremble in my boots

I fear that you’ll resent me

As time have proven true

My love I hate these feelings

I get lost when I’m with you



I gaze deep into your eyes

And there I find the truth

I kiss with my eyes open

Adore the spark in you

The same spark lies with me

And draws me deeper to

Your love becomes a lifeline

I’d give it all for you"
lonely,I need to hear voices and not the ones in my head telling me I'm not worthy,"I need to hear voices and not the ones in my head telling me I'm not worthy - So my story is easy: I'm a 46F and I live in the US. I'm a gamer, right now I play Ark Survival. I just lost my best friend because feelings accidently got in the way (dangit.) He used to chat with me a lot over discord while qe played games but not anymore so much these days.

I'm so lost right now. I need voices, I need someone to laugh with again. I don't care about age, I have a lot of younger gamers I play with from time to time. I'm pretty young at heart myself and tend to converse better with younger peeps anyhow. 

I need distraction. I need someone to just hang with and keep busy. I need someone who actually treats me like I matter. I do t need to meet the love of my life, I just someone I can connect with and have good times.

I love to laugh and to make others laugh. I watch movies and TV, stand-up comedy, I'm not clingy and I will always be there to listen when you need me. I will always be your friend. Loyalty has always been so important to me in friendship. I love music, all kinds. I dont like arguing and I'm totally the most understanding person you will ever meet. I understand the psyche a lot and if you're having an issue I will try to help you or just listen. 

If I sound like someone you'd like to hang with, DM on here and we can exchange discords. I prefer voice chatting, video is NOT necessary. I just like hearing voices and laughter. ❤️"
lonely,Not sure if I should end a friendship,"Not sure if I should end a friendship - Everytime I hang with her it’s about how to catch a man. Ex. We went to San Fran for my birthday week and 4/7 she met up with a different guy from tinder. It was all about who we can meet and whatnot and I’m tired of her shenanigans. We went on another weekend try to cheer me up after my brother died and she brought another random guy from tinder to the club with us, no big deal because we were all dancing and socializing, until she wanted to ditch me to take him back to our hotel . A stranger in the room with my  personal items and my name on the room. I’ve told her that I prefer one on one hang outs , but her priority clearly isn’t our friendship. I’m so tired of talking to someone who doesn’t care about the friendship. I’ve been here before with other friends .. they get a guy and forget their friends. I’m going to sound so silly and shallow , but I want a friend to travel with sometimes and go out with. I’m okay going places alone and in some instances I enjoy it , but I do get tired of the “where are your friends?” Or “are you here alone” questions. It’s worse than people asking why you’re still single because it’s supposedly easy to have friends? Idk I could make more friends but I’m just so tired of trying . It’s draining caring about someone who constantly reminds you that your company isn’t enough"

lonely,"29M. Here is why Mondays are the best days to make, meet new friends, people!","29M. Here is why Mondays are the best days to make, meet new friends, people! - Well, now that I got your attention, and before I share the secret receptive to making friends, here is a bit about me: 
29 years old, male from the west coast, yeah, Cali as you’ve probably guessed by now! 6’1” tall, black hair, fair/naturally tanned skin, greenish eyes, and been told handsome, humbly! I am not gonna get on here and share a list of expectations but let me say this, if you happened to have good humor, a reasonable amount of intelligence, wit, intellect, perhaps some sass and charm to some degree, then we are definitely going ti make it past the first 9 messages! 
Don’t know a thing or two about anime, video/Pc games, Pokémon or whatever else that is trendy these days! I prefer the outdoors, beach, hiking, traveling and a good book any day of the week. I am probably the only guy who wasn’t disappointed with GOT finale/ending and I still think that it was one of the greatest stories/dramas in the history of T.V.
So, I am a guy who thinks a woman doesn’t need to show off her goodies to get attention, because I do find intelligence and interpersonal skills far more attractive in a woman than anything else…. Well, most of the time, let’s say about 90% of the time I do! Being reasonable and honest! 
Nothing will throw me off faster than a lazy attempt at socializing like someone sending an “ASL”, “Sup”, “Hey dude”, or “what’s good” message! Like make a little and genuine effort ffs! I mean, I know too well that if the internet and Reddit taught us anything is was being spoiled and lazy are the new norms nowadays! Don’t get me wrong, I don’t expect to read your life/weekly journal/diary just to get to know you! Let’s just I prefer spontaneous, vivid, lively and engaging conversations, chats, texts! 

I’d you’ve made it this far and I’m thankful you did, then you deserve to know the answer to why Monday is the best day of the week to make/meet friends! And …ran out of characters… you can hit me up for that answer :)"

lonely,I'm realizing now how alone I am.,"I'm realizing now how alone I am. - Just watched a vlog by this small creator I enjoy. They got dinner with a group of friends and went to some convention. I always felt like things were getting better for me but I guess I've been too preoccupied with my studies to notice but this vlog made me realize that all my ""friends"" are tied to something. Like school, or work. Semester is over all my school friends are gone, quit my job, all my job friends are gone. They don't talk to me, I talk to them. I think it's because they all have big groups of friends and they see me as a work friend while this entire time I've seen them as a friend.

I wonder what it's like to have a group of friends that just do fun things together, to have friends that like me not based on circumstance but based on me. At this point I don't think I'll ever know so might as well focus on doing good at school."

Then sometimes feeling all the emotions without caring about the consequences sounds like the best option, since my all feelings are put away to not get distracted, by me."

So in my eyes the less the better bc humanity at large causes more pain and suffering than anything else...why do I have to be such a fucked up creature? Feel this hatred, even more laughable a desire for theses cancerous beings lol...all humans are fucked up, including myself.

I may be lonely, but as far as a romantic partner goes, I still want what I want. And that there is the problem. Anytime that you desire something specific like that, its ultimately your fault when you inevitably never get it. There's no point in desiring anything, but especially when it involves something from other people. I'm slowly learning to accept that, but at the same time, why would I continue to live in this world at all? I'm not the kind of person who enjoys existing simply for its own sake, and I have no motives or aspirations to speak of. It seems like I was born to be an NPC, and I swear I resent life for that. Plus, I'm not a plastic-brained child anymore, so what others say wont be able to change my mind. I'm stuck being a lifeless shell with no personality, or I could take my life back by ending it all.

This all happened 8 months ago. And I’m still not over it. When the semester started in January, I was still having daily panic attacks about it. And throughout the entire semester I’ve tried joining clubs and whatnot but only found two new people to talk to. It was only recently that I stopped crying about what happened every week.

10 years ago I had so much more to do and everything was so much more available.

Tried online dating and it just keeps leading nowhere, I feel like a car in a parking lot (what packages does this model come with? And if it does not have what I want, screw it I don’t want it, even if it works and can become so much more.” 
Not sure if that analogy makes sense but it’s what best fits my current situation.

I just want a family, kids and something to work at, I want to be loved and cherish just as I would cherish to my hearts fullest extent someone else.
Hell, I can’t even find love or friends at church (Eastern Orthodox). The depression causes so much trouble that I am just totally unable to interact anymore.

I'm on different dating apps and they all need paywalls to even so anything with them so it's all a bit of a waste of time. I just feel so alone. Add in the pressure of the family telling me I should be getting married soon because I'm 25 next year and it's just getting to me.

I am good at starting a conversation but I’m bad at making a conversation interesting and I struggle trying to find things to say. I have 0 friends, and have been considering suicide because life is like a complex maze of a process of elimination, where every week you have to put on a different place to see what people receipt to better. I’ve received zero progress. And don’t ask me to be myself. Myself is in-fact a socially awkward person, even weirder than what I am now, and I know this because I’ve tried to be myself many times. But as society says I should force myself into the mentality of no excuses for not having friends and must put in an effort (changing how I act, talking to people) to make me worth peoples time. I want to give up, but I won’t allow myself to. The only way I’m going to see the light at the end of the tunnel is that I keep my head up, but I need help desperately"

I feel like I'll never have enough money to afford a house where the jobs are.

How is anybody supposed to compete with that on their own? My retirement plan is a 0.223.

Abuse from my past makes me anxious around people, which on top of looking like Sid from Ice Age means I don't really make friends anymore. Luckily I still have my friends from middle school... except they are either across the country or way worse off financially. I know they skip meals, I can see them withering away. They get ashamed when I take them out and it fucking hurts to see them be a husk of the man they once were. I want my friend back.
I tried to pull a Supertramp, to be trail trash, but it felt wrong, like a privilege. So I stepped back into the macine. Is this the end game of identity politics? To make people ashamed of what we are?

I have never had sex. I slept with a girl, but didn't trust her to have sex. It's not something you're supposed to care about. I guess I don't but the loneliness is killing me. I got a dog and a cat, but they don't get my jokes. She had her own insecurities, so she left for my best friend. That was 3 years ago now. Never learned how to flirt and afraid of scaring others so I don't practice. I feel confused, like the world demands I be agressive, but only in the 'right' way and only when other people want it too. But they won't tell you that, you have to guess. And if you're wrong you can end up in jail. This Tinder/Bumble/pickup/whatever game is bullshit.

I did tell them many times the day of my birthday some days ago, yet noone even wrote a single thing to me. I dislike many celebration's day because society is unfair at balance things but only 2 days I really care about are probably  **Birthday** and **Earthday.** 

So why am I writing this post? Because I always think about it, these 3 friends of mine are not real friends... I understand they have their own life to live, but I have always been lonely and the fault it's of **society**, all I wished for my birthday was just a message from someone that could ask me how I am doing or give help in hard times, neither do I know what a gift to be given feels like and I wouldn't want it. I will probably never be able to make any friends at all I got used to be alone for like 10 years... society, school and family mainly fault here. 

Today I'm 22 and my life changed since I finished that trash hole called **school** 2 years ago, so I decided to start a new life and now I am studying programming for joining the rat race job, but my thoughts changed and programming is **not** what I want to live for anymore, since I have noone beside me and it's just me in my world I needed a reason to live for, so I started to enjoy life for what I truly wanted to do ever, I want to live for **ART** but also help the world. I started to: 

* Read books and I would love to write one some day (fantasy).
* Study philosophy and psychology always wanted to understand why we Humans are we living or we act like so.
* Play the guitar, I LOVE MUSIC and guitar it's the only instrument I own. World it's all about vibration and music it's vibration playing an instrument it's a **MUST**.

Plus many other things that I am not writing here and I wish to discover but if you don't have either money or time you are not able to. Well lately I cannot enjoy at all my life even tho I wanted to live for these things I am forced to still study programming for a job, my thoughts in these days have only been of death, life it's a curse and the only medicine it's death, I hope this thought will have an end and that I will find my happiness again, soon.

The whole point of this post it's just to have a talk and I am sorry for my English, it's not my mother tongue. 

Even if you guys are alone live for the things you love even if these are abstracts. If you guys are reading this you are not alone, you are actually talking and thinking with me! Hope this will help someone.

My family has never really cared about me. I’m autistic and have other mental health diagnoses. I’m 20 and still living with my mom while I wait to see if I’ve been approved for social security because of my mental health. I’m always doing something for my mom (not chore related), and if I say no, she begs for it until I finally cave. 
I get so paranoid about upsetting someone over having my own needs and acting upon them. I’m scared that I’m a bad person because I have my own needs. I’m scared to ask for help when I need it. I’m scared of showing my emotions and venting because of the trauma my family put me through. I get scared when I perceive that someone is upset with me. 
I only have one friend and it won’t be long until I can’t see him as often as I’ve been able to. I’ve been trying to go outside and make a irl friend that I can hang out with.

For a couple days of days , I’ll have to rely on my neighbours to keep a check on them . I can also hire a guy to take him for walks. Idk I think a dog would really help me. I would have at least one friend. But I’m worried if I’m rushing into this, I just want to be sure that if I get one, he’s happy, I am a sad person. And worried if I make him sad too. Idk , any advice ? It’s such a big decision , I’m very anxious. Been depressed as long as I can remember, pills, booze, therapy nothing has helped.

lonely,Feeling like suicide is just an inevitable solution.,"Feeling like suicide is just an inevitable solution. - My life looks damaged beyond repair. At 33 &amp; having been eternally single, I dont have anything except regrets....happy memories dont truly exist nor do I have anything to be proud of or to look forward to but somehow since last 5-6years my life is dragging on for the sake of family or social pressures.....everyday is tough but sometimes things become so painful I can't even find a reason of why I should continue living in a world that has no place for people like me. I was a good student but lack of guidance &amp; family pressure of joining business instead of exploring different kindof ruined my life. Am stuck in a tribal area, no scope for marriage or relationship &amp; no time for personal growth, most of my social life is hiding my present struggle. Friends have moved on to new chapters while I dont even know how am gonna go through this year.
I feel tired so often, at times I try to work out to stay in spirit but I dont have any real motivation as am stuck in life &amp; I dont have the talent or time to make money at this stage.

I keep telling myself I won't take shit from anyone else ever again, but this fear of loneliness is driving me insane. I don't think I have the spine to keep to my morals if I get another abusive gf (if at all) again.

I genuinely fear I will be alone until my mid 40's at best, or forever at worst. I'm approaching 25 years this November.

I've always been lonely in my life, I literally had no-one and I was even bullied a lot.

Then I found that girl that seemed my soulmate. We both liked the same music, we both were into gaming and pop culture, we had the same humor, the same style, we liked to do the same things.

But In November 2021 we broke-up because I found her cheating and other problems.

Since then I started working more on myself. I have done A SHIT TON of self improvement, I reached for old friends and strengthened our relationships, started dating again and found a decent amount of girls that liked me, I've learned new things I always wanted to learn, I started songwriting and now I'm writing a full album with some friends, I got a gig and I'm playing guitar a lot. At university I'm studying CompSci (that I always LOVED), doing my best and I'm trying to raise my grades, and I'm actually accomplishing that.

My friends love me, male and female ones.

I have a friend that always tell me ""I want a girl that's exactly like you but girl"", another one that always calls me do to things together, others that always have fun with me, a female best friend that's always there for me.

I'm not alone at all, and I'm also doing a lot of activities I LOVE.

But I feel lonely. I feel a lot lonely. It's like nothing of that it's enough, even if I'm happy and grateful for all of that.

Loneliness is a bitch. It doesn't matter what you have, how many friends love you, how many girls or guys you can have, how many fulfilling activities you do in your life.

You can still feel lonely. And that's fine.

It's fine to feel lonely."

lonely,Highschool experience (18f),"Highschool experience (18f) - Entering highschool was awful . I got bullied a lot bc I was thought to be nerdy for just knowing things . My grades were not the best but better than class average . I eventually transfered to a good highschool closer to home . People were great and I thought I could actually make friends . It just didn’t work for a few reasons . They already bonded for over a year and the groups already formed , they are reserved and fancy and Im talkative and more simple . Little by little I got frustrated bc I was just ignored and they complained to my head teacher that I swore and called them bad names and its me in the wrong when I told them nothing of that sort and just talked normal stuff. They never want to tell me what I do wrong to try and solve this and never found who told the teacher those stuff so I could solve it personally . Even the teacher told me that its my fault i cant integrate and im obviously doing something wrong . Now there are less than 2 weeks and highschool ends . I am not in their memories , videos , fun times or anything . Im irrelevant , invisible and started hating myself more and more. I am lucky that my family is with me and my doggy as comfort . Now Im terrified that the story will repeat at collage and i have nightmares about every little wrong thing I do all the time.

For example, this morning she started arguing with me and I telling me she’d take my pc because I was giving away my old laptop that I didn’t use anymore to my friend. Keep in mind, neither of us even need it, so I the only reason she gave me was that nobody helped me when we needed, so I shouldn’t be giving stuff away. This friend only has an old phone that they got from their cousin and they can’t playing anything on. Plus, she doesn’t let me go anywhere or go outside or anything and she’s always invading my privacy and disrespecting my friends and me.

lonely,what I've realised from this sub.,"what I've realised from this sub. - We all share the same lonely pain in completely different ways.

Some people might have people around them and still feel alone.

Others (like myself) have absolutely no one and just feel so much pain too.

Loneliness is more common than anyone knows. And I feel this sub has so much potential if we all just United together and tried to help one another ( I know that sounds absolutely corny)

But from my own experience (I'm 24)  and having absolutely nobody it just doesn't get any easier. I know the guru's will say you gotta go out and mix in and all that stuff. But life isn't that easy. Everyone's case results in the same shit feeling, but comes to that way for such different scenarios.

Sorry for the long ramble, rant, waffle, whatever you wanna call it. I just like I'm sure all of us here are tired and want this pain to end.

I'm having such a downer day to the point I'm struggling to focus on work, I hope you guys are at least having a slightly better day :/"

I can’t drive and can’t understand a lot of financial stuff. But it feels like I am too old to ask for help since everyone is just ther to take advantage of me. Specially my family.

lonely,Faking closeness,"Faking closeness - I wish I could feel it. I sit and talk with people, spend time with them, and I know they feel connected to me, but I feel so disconnected with everyone and everything. I feel the most alone when there are other people around. I make them laugh, I listen as best I can, and offer everything I have. It doesn't matter if they're good people, or care about me too, I just can't bridge that gap. 

Every once in awhile, like tonight, I try again to connect to anyone. It just makes me more depressed to feel this barrier between me and everyone else. I try to ignore it, but it's unbearable. It feels like these things click for everyone but me. I feel so absolutely alone.

What am I supposed to do if my entire life is like this? I don't need to be understood completely, I just wish someone could look at me for once and see me. Me, not some idealized version or projection, but the entire mess I am, and still want to stick around. I feel like half a person trying to convince people I'm whole."
lonely,"I’ve got an amazing job, a great flat, a supportive family, but no friends or relationships.","I’ve got an amazing job, a great flat, a supportive family, but no friends or relationships. - Recently my life has been on a great upward trend. For years I was sat in my mum’s house, never leaving my room and generally stagnating. I missed the opportunity to learn social/professional skills as a teen and now I’m a young adult lacking in what I feel are the very basic skills needed for grown life.

However a year ago I landed a fantastic job cooking/serving in a local cafe and was able to finally move out into an amazing little flat. It’s exactly what I needed and wanted for years, I’m finally living off my own back, nobody to rely on for food, water, or money.

But, and this is a big but. But very recently I’ve lost contact with all my friends. I had a fight with one about shit we did as kids, it was obvious he still resented me but what choice did we have? We had no other friends. So he’s gone.

It’s a lot more complicated with my other friend, we started a romantic relationship which started in school and lasted at least 7 years. That ended recently although it was mutual and friendly, but I can feel him slipping away from me, I don’t think I fit into his new life very well as a normal friend, because of our history.

Anyway this has been a long and useless rant into the void of Reddit. I doubt this makes much sense to anyone but it’s this or I just stew silently, alone in my new life.

It’s all turning to ash in my mouth.

Spend my first hour home laying in bed, maybe play some video games, back to bed on my phone scrolling through nothing pretty much, order door dash, do nothing, lay in bed some more thinking about my life and how i have accomplished nothing until 3 am. Go to sleep and repeat. I have zero social life or social skills. I have a driving job so I spend my time at work thinking and driving. Was in a relationship for 3 years until I got dumped for dragging the relationship on so long because I really didn’t want to be alone and she was all I had. Moved away that same year from what little friends I had left due to a blackout drunken suicide attemp that everyone knew about and I couldn’t deal with the shame. I have always felt invisible to everyone around me. Never have I been approached by anyone and every time I have approached someone it turned out bad or I felt like I’m being annoying. Tried having online friends but it’s not enough for me. I have no motivation to do anything. My mind is a constant stir of depression and schizophrenic episodes, and constantly having to deal with body and facial dysmorphia. My days are usually silent and I go some days with not having to say anything at all. I have no reassurance on any aspects of life from anyone. Have no texts or calls from anybody but spam calls. I don’t know what it feels like to be recognized by another human anymore. I don’t know what to do with myself or my life. I feel like quitting. The road ahead seems bleak. I don’t want to continue living like this anymore. I don’t know how to deal with this. I have nobody to help, guide, or support me through this.

lonely,"My online friend just randomly cut me out of his life, what should I do?","My online friend just randomly cut me out of his life, what should I do? - Like the title states, my online friend of two-years just randomly deleted his Discord and instagram, and unfriended me on PlayStation.

To kind of explain our friendship—he reached out of me on one my YouTube videos about doing a possible collab. I said sure, and we kinda just became fast friends after that. We both played the same video game and created the same kind of content. 

We kept chatting and he started to open up about some problems he was experiencing and regularly asked for my advice. I was always happy to offer my two-cents and whenever he was feeling down, we’d play some games together and chat. 

He wanted to keep our friendship strictly online, which I fully respected and never tried to move the friendship to in-person meet up’s or whatever. 

The last conversation we had, he had told me someone had basically lead him on and he was feeling down. I offered to hop in a game with him, or something. He said no and that he was going to listen to some music. I said okay, and I told him I would check up on him the next day to see how he was doing. 

Well, I did. But he never responded, which wasn’t exactly unusual. But a week or so later—I tried to reach out to him again—his Discord was deleted, same as his instagram, and he had unfriended me on PlayStation. 

To say it hurt is a monumental understatement. I’m sure I didn’t do anything wrong, and I thought we were good friends. But… I guess not. I’ve tried to reach out to him on his YouTube channel by commenting on a video, and by messaging him through PlayStation, but… nothing. 

Any advice on what I should do now? Should I cut my losses? Or should I wait a little longer to see if he responds to me? I just found out, so I was planning on waiting until the end of the week to see if I heard back from him. But… I feel pretty blindsided, if I’m being honest. 

TL;DR: my online friend deleted all of his socials without saying anything and unfriended me after two-years of friendship, and I don’t know what I should do."

I absolutely hate confrontation, negative feelings, sadness, or emotional upset; so I try my best to just do, say, or help in any way that I can to avoid it. But most of the time it just gets me in trouble.... In the past if I got irked at something I would just RAWR about it to someone for a few min and then I would be ok.... but no one has time for me and my husband takes it as a personal attack or anger especially if it relates to any matters of our household. My (no-longer) friends decided it meant that even if I was happy that I definitely wasn't and took it upon themselves to make judgements and assumptions on my life that were 100% wrong. I am absolutely alone even in a room full of people and I feel completely unliked... If I make any type of friendly connection with someone I am like whoa now it wouldn't last no point. The last person I tried to be friends with just up and disappeared, not even a I'll keep in touch via text from them. I don't want to die but I hate my life.... 

fucking might have cancer - waiting for my appointment to get a biopsy done.... 

for the first time in my life I'm dealing with the emotional trauma of being an undiagnosed autistic child (b/c in my family -when my mom was alive-, Jesus says there's no such thing and everything can be healed through prayer) who was sexually abused by a brother who took advantage of my social/development inabilities. 

At this point at 34yrs old I feel like my identity and purpose has been stolen from me... I'm just a shell going through the motions...Below is a very short list of the negatives that live in my head at any given time.

1. So my family doesn't respect me or don't know how to understand me. 
2. My (no-longer) friends only like being friends with me when I could make them feel better about themselves by being what they considered less than perfect. 
3. No one wants to believe me or take my word when I try to improve something..... 
4. Its not ok for me to be anything but funny and easy going... 
5. I masked for so long so that I didn't upset anyone that when I finally start trying to take the walls down and just be a person that everyone said that I'm not acting normal and wouldn't believe me that everything was good... 
6. Everyone wants to think for me, when i have my own voice I'm told its wrong even if it's just me saying i'm happy.
7. Found out that I'm autistic.... so now i semi understand why every time I relax and just talk that I end up pissing people off with how I talk.... 
8. People come and go in my life so much that it's like I'm a revolving door.
9. I can't do anything right in anyone else’s mind or eyes.
10. I spend most of my time in my head b/c my husband gets offended if i curse and his kids or our daughter are around (cursing relaxes me if i'm anxious and I have taught my own older children they aren't to be used in anger at anyone but I'm one of those parents who don't care about cursing as long as they are respectful and well mannered when the situation requires it.)
   1. Also he takes issue with my relaxed parenting and if I try to parent my step sons my way then it will usually result in a fight. Or he assumes that my intentions are unfair or that I sound mean. He isn't a fan of my music and I can tell it annoys him even though he says its ok for me to play it. 
   2. I know we don't have much in common but I love him and he loves me and he would do absolutely anything for me, and I could absolutely not want for anything because he would get me anything if it meant that I would smile.... but I can't talk to him without sounding insensitive or condescending to him..."

lonely,Tonight I’m hurting,"Tonight I’m hurting - 25M - I just have to get this off my chest. Everyone always tells me I’m doing very well in life… That at their age they wish they managed life the way I currently am. I always just smile and listen, trying to be as humble as I always am. 

I’m nothing special, I’m just like everyone else, I do what I have to in order to survive. I have a decent well paying job, a very nice car that I appreciate/work for, and an apartment. I’m literally always working but I guess it pays off.

I feel like I’ve been getting worser mentally every single day even though I’m getting better in other aspects of life. I’m just so so so so tired of being so lonely. So tired of engaging with so many people everyday whether it’s friends, family, or coworkers / putting on fake smiles or those that are exaggerated. So tired of feeling so empty and having to mask it with laughter and smiles. 

I used to at least play my video game or watch tv in my free time. Nowadays I can’t do any of that, it bores me. Everything feels like nothing to me. If I don’t have to work I go out… yeah no where in particular I just drive. I tried hanging with family more, going out getting involved with people socially more. There’s this lady I work with who’s starting to see me as part of her family even. She’s let me come over for family events with her family and at the time it’s very nice and helps me. Afterwards that loneliness creeps back up again. No one knows my pain, I keep it inside

Dating, doesn’t seem to work in this day and age. Everyone cold, brutal, selfish, disrespectful… I’ve been ghosted one too many times even. Everyone I know personally thinks I’m some sort of Playboy, which is the total opposite. I take care of myself, I seem to look great let other people tell it. BUT I DONT FEEL GREAT

Society had this standard where men should always be tuff, strong- ALL THE TIME. Today I had a good day, yet for whatever reason tonight after walking inside from work, this all just suddenly hit me. As if it’s been building up so long that it had to come out. I’ve immediately broke down, currently in tears as I type this.

But I guess now I gotta get myself together, shower away my emotional mess, and mask this back up all over again tomorrow?"

I wanted to get to know her more and be her friend, she is super pretty and I know I am way out her league. She said to me she feels weirded out in a wrong way that i know what she looks but she don’t know what I look like. I offered to give her my IG so she can see what I look. Next thing I know, I get unfollowed and blocked, same with my IG, I got blocked just like that. And it hurts me, I am 23 years old, and I never had a female friend in my life.

I yearn for a relationship where I can offer someone love that they will return, some kind of relationship that can soothe my heart. And yet, it’s only ever a dream. Even if that person exists, there are kinder, more successful, and in general better partners for them. And who am I to blame them? Good people deserve good things. And I am not a good thing. I am not worthy to be a hindrance to those who are good in this world - nobody deserves that kind of pain. I want to be moved, but I don’t want to drag others behind.
Perhaps it is best for those around me to find their happy place, away from me. Perhaps it is best to be ignored and for others to move on without me. Nobody deserves to deal with me, and I don’t deserve anyone that might heal my tired heart. 
I just wish knowing this didn’t hurt so much."

I've spent about a fifth of my life (probably less than) having a partner, but I haven't really progressed as a person that much. I am very stuck. It overloads me with anxiety and depression. I've only really changed in the way that I feel vindicated as to not trust people, and to be even pickier than I already am, which has already been to picky for who I am. I don't think anyone would put up with me anymore.

While crying cocooned under the covers, or in the shower are always good choices; the absolute safest place in the world (to me) is my car. A possession that is wholly, absolutely, customized as mine and no one can take it. A vehicle that can get me to or away from anywhere, anytime. A guaranteed roof and shelter for my body day or night no matter where or what state I’m in. And a safe space for when I need to hide away from the prying eyes of the world that could see my moment of feelings, of weakness. So as long as I have my car I can tell myself, and believe, I’ll be okay. As long as I have a car, I’ll have my safe space. Huh, so maybe, I’m not completely alone after all."

lonely,"I'm tired of being ""professional"" with everyone and I miss my friend I could just chill and be myself with.","I'm tired of being ""professional"" with everyone and I miss my friend I could just chill and be myself with. - this is kinda 2 post in one but fuck it. 

I feel like i have to put on a mask with most people. When people meet me I think they tend to like me. I'm smart, funny, I carry myself well. I'm not horrible looking despite caring a bit extra weight (which Im working off currently).  In fact I suspect that if any of the people I knew found out I was posting this they wouldn't believe it. How could I feel this way? I don't carry myself like someone who is desperate, I don't carry myself like someone who is lonely or is craving intimacy. I have friends that are women who I have no desire to date, like I am not the sterotypically lonely guy who falls in love with every woman he meets or is a incel or forever aloner or anything like that. 

when Im around other people though, I keep a TIGHT reign on my emotions. I express what I choose to express 99% of the time. I feel fucking nurotic sometimes. The slightest thing can make me feel deeply insecure or anxious, I can't imagine people wanting to be around me, Im hyper villigant about everything. I'm vulnerable, but not to vulnerable, kind but not a pushover, empathetic because I choose to be, understanding cause I choose to be. Living like this is exhausting and the result is that, I behave like the person I want to be but I don't feel like that person. I feel like Im putting on a performance for everyone the same way I use to put on the ""be polite to this asshole customer"" performance when I worked retail. I'm tired, I want to be myself with someone.

But truthfully I don't like myself, Im insecure, lonely, and borderline neurotic. I don't understand romantic relationships hardly at all, Im extraordinarily emotionally nerotic when it comes to sexuallity in any way/shape/form and even flirting makes me feel super uncomfortable. The other night I was out at a bar with friends and this girl I kinda know was kinda drunk and she grabbed my hands, and was like ""look at me, you are a very striking handsome man"" and I was like.....what the FUCK do you do in that situation lol. Another night there was this cute girl  who had sat down beside where I was at at the bar (I had just been in the bathroom) and she was cute (I had noticed her earlier) and normally thats no problem. I mean I just say hi and sit back down where I had been at. But when I sat down I was SUPER attracted to her and she smelled nice and my body did that warm flushed actually feel like I'm being pulled towards her type attraction thing and I froze up and couldn't even say hi, just sat there sipping on my beer. If she had been a guy (or ugly for that matter) I wouldn't have felt that way, but...yeah. I could type a lot more on that subject but I'm going to leave  it at that. 

so the second part of this post. I use to have a friend I would hang out with online, we would voice chat and just....chill. It was amazing we would watch tv shows together through discord or just share funny videos. She was really nice and we could just...be with each other. I didn't have to put on that performance with her. I could be completely and utterally open, which lead to talking about some stuff I never talk about with people. like the fact I get embarrassed when I'm attracted to a woman due to being teased so much anytime I showed interest in someone in highschool. It was nice to talk about my emotions with someone, especially the more negative ones which I have to bottle up all the time thanks to society telling us its wrong to be open about how we feel. Eventually we ended up flirting and that was nice to, cause I felt like I could with her, I felt like I could tell her I thought she was pretty without it giving me a borderline panic attack. There was some sexual stuff as well, which was truely suprising given the anxiety I normally have around it but she made me feel safe and it was nice. It was all online but, it was nice to feel known by someone and I miss it. She eventually faded away as all online friends do though she lasted longer than most at around 6 or 7 months."

There’s this building in my area that i can easily sneak in and just jump off the very top. That’s my dream-spot to end it.

I (20F) don't think anyone can love me in a romantic way and it's starting to mess with me. My best friends are both in relationships and I am so happy for them. I want nothing but the best for them and their partners but I can't help but feel jealous of what they have. I want some one to call my own. I want someone that will always look at their phones when a notification goes off because they want to see if I responded to them. I want to be held at night while I fall a sleep or just be held in general but I can't. I either don't feel a connection with the person, or I feel something and I come on to strong. I hate myself for it. I'm starting to feel like I will never find someone like that. Like they say - Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

One of my friend relationship is pretty new (almost a month) but when ever we are hanging out late at night, she HAS to call him for an hour to talk to him. She will go into my room, close the door and talk to him. Again, I want her to be happy, but i hate it when she does that cause it makes me feel like he's more important when I know that she thinks of me like a sister. I want to tell her to call him when she gets home or to tell him that she is busy and will call him tomorrow. Is it wrong to feel like this? It feels wrong to think this way."

lonely,People get the idea that if you're a woman and lonely you do it to yourself...,"People get the idea that if you're a woman and lonely you do it to yourself... - I hate this mentality. I've over weight and can't help it. I have a medical condition and take medication that causes me to gain weight. I've lost 60 lbs, but that's with a meager 700 calorie a day diet, since I can't exercise. I had a stroke in April and figured out I have an aneurysm this month. I gravely injured myself when I was merely 14, leading to a shunt ultimately needing to be placed. Hydrocephalus is a bitch. I'm 220lbs currently and that's working as hard as I can to be conscious of my weight. I can't walk currently and do exercises in bed and restrict what I eat like a mad woman. 

Anyway, enough about weight. 

I come from the literal lowest socioeconomic background someone probably can in the US. I grew up with too many siblings and we didn't even eat everyday, didn't have the means. 

I busted ass and put myself through college and didn't ever recover enough(physically)to maintain a regular job schedule. I married a man who could take care of me, but this honestly caused me to be more alone. He pressured me enough to have a child and she barely made it, she's fine now though and, if I'm honest, my only friend, she's 8. 

I've had work from home jobs and writing jobs, whatever it takes to get it through the day, but I'm unable to do this now, for various reasons. Mostly medical. 
I've tried things to fill the day, hobbies, instruments, drawing, painting, it works for a while and then I grow bored of it and feel apathy. 

I have nothing to offer anyone and bring nothing to the table of any significance, I feel utterly useless.

I've read many advices, points of view from people on this topic on different sites. Some of them were useful like finding common interest, the rest was a total BS about loving yourself first. And still, I got disappointed by people who can't last one minute without mentioning sex topics related to how horny they are or the ones that ghost you after a few days of talking. 

Reading some of the posts on this subreddit makes me vomit. There are people writing how lonely they are because of COVID-19 and isolation, attention whores living of upvotes and comments from a bunch of strangers in the internet or people complaining about having only a small amount of friends and already feeling lonely. I wish I had at least one friend. I'm envious of you.

I was lonely way before pandemic started, I don't have any mental illness and yet I perform worse. I never drank an alcohol, didn't attend prom, spent my eighteenth birthday alone and my social skills suck. I don't even have courage to go somewhere by myself if I want to. I'm so pathetic."
lonely,Please please forgive yourself and be kind to yourself.,"Please please forgive yourself and be kind to yourself. - You're young. You're gonna say stupid shit and make stupid mistakes. If you take that one mistake to heart, then you're gonna never meet anyone meaningful, because you'll believe you're a bad person. But instead, if you handle negative feedback positively with affirmations to yourself like ""Aghh no biggie. I'm young and dumb, and this is my age to take risks and make stupid mistakes"", you'll see yourself in a much more positive light. Keep taking risks and treating yourself well. Life's to short to not take risks, because YOLO. And think of it: if you never take risks, you won't meet anyone at all, cause anyone has the potential to hurt you or reject you or outcast you. You have to learn to realize that if you do some dumb shit, say stupid stuff outta horniness, etc, this shit doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, and is insignificant. You aren't defined by what a singular person thinks of you. Plus, you're young and its compeltely normal, it only suggests you're healthy! Don't be mean to yourself. It took me a lot of time to learn this."

We're just all lost, persecuted by chaos and misery,
And we're just getting more and more fucked up.

But I've lived on borrowed time for many years now, and I hear the bell tolls.
So now I'm wandering if it's finally the tranquility and the eternal silence that's awaiting.

The place where people stab each other in the back and tale flunitrazepam to lose their memory.
The place where you take olanzapine and haloperidol to restrain your rage,
And clozapine makes people shut themselves in their inside.
The place where alcohol and alprazolam highlights your insanity.
In the shadows where falseness always wins, where loyalty disappears.

Now I feel what it is like for normies every day. Now I feel empty and depressed again and alone. I get to go back to the same boring grind tomorrow back to my boring job with people I don’t want to be around anymore. It is normal for them to experience intimacy and sex every day. It takes them no after experience it but for me it takes me eight or nine months just to experience or find someone that’s willing to do it. I just miss the company of a woman And a girlfriend it is so hard to experience this and I’ll go back to being alone and having absolutely nothing to look forward to except a abysmal existence of working it boring Dead end job being around people I do not want to be around I ever want to see again. Yeah again for them it comes normal to have this in a relationship yet I can’t experience a relationship for 4 1/2 years it seems hopeless at this point to ever be able to be happy and love again I don’t know what to do anymore to live to be living alone to have nothing look forward to except a boring job every day seeing other people happy in love what is the point of living too depressing I just don’t want to live anymore if I can’t experience having a girlfriend being in love again.
lonely,18 and basically giving up,18 and basically giving up - I’m really beginning to quit trying when it comes to making meaningful connections in this world. I feel like a failure and also someone who has nothing interesting to say when it comes to having a genuine conversation.

lonely,Never be dependent on a single person,"Never be dependent on a single person - I have a boyfriend that I love and who makes me very happy. Unfortunately, I have come to realize that my happiness has become completely dependent on him. At the end of last summer, he started doing his military service. As soon as he left, everything around me pretty much crumbled. I realized that I had no one left. All of the friends that I had in high school had moved abroad or to a different city for collage. Keeping in touch with them was difficult because I realized that I wasn’t even that close to most of them. No one really put in any effort so the conversation died pretty quickly.

With no friends and a boyfriend who only comes home over the weekend every two to three weeks, things turned bleak rather quickly. I have struggled a lot, especially seeing others around me have fun. The only thing I’m looking forward to is for him to come home. It’s hard to get out of this situation when there’s no place to meet people anymore, like school was. I’m going to move to a new city and start studying psychology at university (which I find a bit ironic in my current situation) after the summer, and things will probably get better then. But until then, the loneliness I’m feeling is painful.

I’ve been trying to distract myself and to connect with old friends. Unfortunately I haven’t been that successful. It’s extremely unfair and stupid to rely on one single person for everything and I’ve felt so guilty about it. He has never complained, but for me it’s embarrassing and it puts me in a extremely vulnerable position. It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions. Sometimes I manage to keep my mood up, but when it starts to come down again, I crash. It’s so stupid really, but that’s the way it is for me rn. I just wish I had friends."

I don’t know what to do. I know a lot of my issues are just me pitying myself and being a jerk."
lonely,it’s not really helping,"it’s not really helping - disclaimer: this is not intended to be offensive to any of the people i’ve talked to on Reddit. i love you guys &lt;3

i like being on here. it’s fun, looking at memes, cat pictures, occasionally finding someone to vibe with.

yet, i came on reddit to try to find a salve for my stagnant existence as i wait for college to start this September. when i’m by myself and neither my friends or someone online has messaged me, i get existential and depressed to varying degrees (hence this post). no matter how much time i spend on here, the feelings return. 

i’m by nature a novelty-seeker. though i hate to say this, i’m not satisfied with the five friends i talk to in real life on a regular basis. again, that’s why i’m on here.

however, talking to people online isn’t the same as having friends in real life. i don’t have my license just yet, so i can’t go out and try to meet people. 

i’d appreciate some advice as to how to cope during this transition time of my life. and not spend too much time on my phone as i have been doing. thanks, everyone. :)"
lonely,Making friends in your 20's,"Making friends in your 20's - Hey, M23 here. 

I am single, never been in a relationship, kind of going through an identity crisis in my life for a while now. I have never had ""the boys' to hang out with or grab a drink with etc. I have a few girls that are friends from high school but honestly we never see each other. I work full time in retail and honestly its ok,  but I don't like it anymore. I put all my energy to working because I don't have any friends and now all I want is some friends. I specifically would find myself a little happier if I just had 1 guy friend i could call my best friend and who would hang out with me and chat etc. I suffer bad with anxiety and depression and they play off of each other quite a bit. I have spent the last 3 years of my life focused on my university career and my full time job, My social life has tanked and I am extremely socially awkward. I can't seem to keep myself entertained at all and constantly think about wanting to go out on hikes, weekend trips, go for drinks, or honestly even just chill at someone's house watching tv. 

I have always kind of been someone who feels comfort in being around people, and doing things by myself tends to make me feel a bit lonely. I try to not seem like such a pathetic loser but its hard sometimes. I don't want people to see me as really clingy or something like that. In reality I have been through many experiences where I have been made to feel like I am a bit of a loser and now whenever someone gives me a shred of attention, I get super attached and start thinking about everything i want to do meanwhile its just someone chatting online. 

I feel like being almost mid 20s it is so hard to find that kind of friendship.  A lot of people already have their friend groups or closer friends and I sometimes feel like I will never find me a friend like that. It is something I have always wanted. Is it that impossible?

lonely,Loneliness is a cold bitch,"Loneliness is a cold bitch - I (26f) find it extremely difficult to make friends. I think it’s because everyone I see are in established friend groups, which makes it easier for them to branch out into a new friend groups and I’m just stuck here alone. In high school I didn’t have many friends, I didn’t go to college and I started my current career fairly young which made me an outcast to the older people at my job. I just didn’t fit in there at the time but now that I am older I still don’t fit in because I didn’t establish myself back then. If that makes any sense whatsoever. 

This caused me to have many lonely Friday and Saturday nights watching Netflix and stuffing my face with comfort food alone. I crave human interaction I crave being included.

I in fact joined Reddit in a desperate attempt to make friends. How pathetic can one be.

You wouldn’t know it by this post but I’m actually a super positive person I just feel lotta this on the inside no one sees that.

However i tried a couple of months back to go on dating sites, but women stress me out with future dreams, kids and everything else. so i have found that i\` m not ready for that stuff right now, but i would like to find someone that likes talking, that also is lonely. It does not matter what your sexual preference is. i do not mind hearing about anyones struggles. and im open minded to talk about anything. but i cant seem to figure out how to proceed, how do you meet people outside dating sites.?

I am a (32M) thats lonely, i have suffered abuse and depression since i was 12 but i am not a negative or pessimistic person. I try to make sure that the people around me always have someone that can empathize with them and does not undermine their feelings even if its nothing big. 

Im not strong enough yet to help those who are far down, i sympathize with the people who feel like giving up or are negative and pessimistic, but i can\`  t handle that in my life now. it will only drag me down. 

im not opposed to teksting a little with someone, but let me know where you think i should be looking for a Body Doubling Friend.  Is Reddit the only place for lonely people?"
lonely,"Growing loneliness, all I know is that it’s going to take a while","Growing loneliness, all I know is that it’s going to take a while - 
I’ve been pretty isolated since I was 15, I was homeschooled. I’m 20 now, and not much has changed. I decided not to go to college, and a chronic injury is preventing me from working, so I stay home all day and time is feeling so slow recently. I’m lucky to have one friend that’s like a brother to me, but he’s like halfway across the country. He recently got into a relationship. Looking back at all of my old friends and it looks like they’re in relationships too, actually almost everyone I know is in one.
 I know it’s probably not healthy for me to linger on those thoughts, but now I’m spending more time by myself, and the person I used to talk to all the time isn’t there as much. 

It’s got me thinking about a girl, we don’t talk anymore, but I still think about her, and feeling this lonely has got me thinking about it even more, it’s unhealthy, obsession almost. I don’t really want anything to do with it anymore, but I have a feeling that until I start to enter the world like I should’ve years ago, things will change. At least I hope they will. 

Of course I’m pretty young, that almost makes me feel like my feelings are invalidated, but regardless I know I have time. It’s just that things are moving and I’m not keeping up to speed. seeing others graduate, getting into relationships, working. I had a few goals with art but I got another injury and now I’m uncertain if I’ll even be able to pursue art full time. I’ve got a couple hobbies but they’re only distracting for so long. Honestly i feel like a burden, I’m blessed to have a loving family that takes care of me, but it makes me feel bad that I’m not getting much done. I’m in limbo.

I know that all I can do is be patient, but it’s getting harder and harder, I don’t think I’d ever kill myself but some days got me thinking  what should I be living for. Sometimes I can see a future where  I finally have what I’ve been waiting for, but it looks like it’s so far, years, and even then I’ll still be young, and I’ll still have time, but I still have to go through the time until then, and it feels so long. 
Everybody has their own pace in life, I know comparing myself to others isn’t the healthy thing to do right now but I can’t help it. I just hope this waiting is worth it, I’m willing to put in the work for what I want but I can’t right now, that’s what hurts the most. I hope everyone who reads this a good day."

I got VERY attached to her. She would message me every day in the morning, before sleep, she would tell me that im pretty that she loves me etc... I never felt so happy. On Christmas 2021 she decided to tell me in a very mean way that she was ""cheating"" the whole time and broke up with me. I tried adding her again a few days later on ig and talking to her but she just told me that she doesnt care and blocked me.  I felt heartbroken however silly that might seem considering that we never met irl. Now since the day we broke up i have thought about her every day even tho i try not to. Sometimes i look at her ig or tiktok to see how shes doing and every time it ruins my day. I don't know but it makes me upset knowing that she is probably living her best life right now. She is Young, very pretty, much richer than me, much happier than me. It's not right but i cant help but get angry. I was born poor, in a poor country, ugly, mentally ill, starving for love.

Yet, there is not a single friend of mine I have not disappointed or treated poorly. 

I try to be a good person - I do. Yet, I feel like I am constantly failing. It makes me *not* want to talk to people. It sucks when someone hurts you. But, let me tell you, the pain of hurting someone else you genuinely give ten-thousand shits about is almost unrivalled. Maybe I am a good person because my misdeeds scar my conscious. Yet, I always find that I end up hurting people. What the worst thing is - I never do things *intending* to hurt people. If I knew the ramifications of my actions I obviously would not do them. I am not even impulsive. I try to reflect on how my words will influence others or the consequences of my actions. Yet, I seem to misfire *every* time 

I don't have a hard time making friends. Yet, I am pretty much opting in to loneliness. I am so paralysed by the prospect of being a villain in *another* narrative.

lonely,An interesting title,"An interesting title - Hello guys. New to this sub. Been feeling very lonely for the past few months until I couldn't handle it today. Wish I had a friend who I could vent to. I had 2 friends who I used to vent to but I recently lost those friendships. I thought I'll vent here. 

I just moved to the UK in January to pursue a master's degree. I have many physiological issues for which I'm currently taking therapy. I'm an introvert and I used to have social anxiety, still recovering. I had okay social skills. But English is not my first language so it's been really hard for me to make connections here. Online classes are not helping either. I spend most of the time in my room just existing. I have no one you really really talk to other than my therapist. I very much long for some physical intimacy but I have no one to turn to. I had 2 friends who I thought were my best friends and one of them told me to forget about my old friends and make new ones. And with the other, I had asked to call to talk. Call never came. I currently have no one to have deep conversations with, which is important for me as an introvert, no source of affection. I tried bumble and tinder with no luck. I lost interest in both after I started losing self-esteem. Therapy is the only thing keeping me sane. But once a week is too less for me at this point. I have no idea what to do. I see people around me living their best lives. Nothing interests me anymore and I can feel time slowly ticking away."

lonely,Loneliness keeps getting worse. How is this even possible?,"Loneliness keeps getting worse. How is this even possible? - I woke up today feeling even more lonely than ever before. My exwife graduated yesterday. Today she is going off with her girlfriend on the vacation that we had always dreamed of. And I'm paying for it.

 Last month, I found an old letter my wife gave me the night before our wedding, she said ""when you wake up tomorrow, you'll never have to be lonely again."" And it was true, I have never been happier or more safe than when I was married to her and had my own family and life. I remember it at the time being so comforting, especially since she knew about my life with an abusive family and how I woke up everday full of anxiety and dread and loneliness. For her to promise to be there for me felt like a second chance at life.

But after 5 years of marriage, she came out to me as gay. For a couple of months we tried to make it work, and I was hopeful, and she was too. But one day she left out of the blue, skipped our couples counseling, and filed for divorce 5 days later. All I got was a letter from her attorney. Then I got sued. Then she told everyone I was so abusive she feared for her life. I got kicked out of her family, not even a word to try and understand what was going on. The inlaws I had loved me more than my own family. I still dont understand. I lost over half my friends, got kicked out of my church, lost my job. I am destroyed financially, emotionally, and socially. Years and thousands of dollars of therapy with multiple counselors, doctors, etc. have told me I am not abusive. It is so painful and embarassing as an introvert to share every single intimate and private moment, every letter, every conversation I had with her, with strangers and have them scrutinize you. I loved her so much I believed her accusations. It's a small bit of vindication, but how can I be proud of myself. Even if I was a good husband, the best moments of my life were torture for her. The love and safety and admiration I had, it was all just a chore for her. When she couldnt handle it anymore during COVID, she dropped me like trash. Her loving family tossed me away without a second look or word. They all blocked me, told me to never talk to them again. But they were happy to take all the money, assets, and alimoney. The kicker is she isn't even out yet. both of our families and most friends have no idea the truth. They all think I'm the scum of the earth.  


I still love my ex wife. I have her picture on my desk. I cant sleep without her sweater. I've had other relationships since then, but my exwife I vowed to love for life. Even if its not romantic anymore, I just don't see myself making out of this any better, let alone alive. She is with her girlfriend now, in their apartment, with her master's degree, going on a dream vacation, all of which I paid for with the money we were saving for our married lives together. I saw all of this because even though she blocked me, her girlfriend got recommended on social media because of all the ""content"" they post together now. I am happy she is happy. It's my only solace. But I just can't live with this loneliness anymore. I clutched her sweater and even put back on my wedding ring just for a moment to pretend I was there with her. But I am sick to my stomach, knowing all the while she is happy and better off without me, celebrating with folks who hate me.

&amp;#x200B;

Just needed to vent, I know everything I need to do for self care and mental well being. I'm just surprised to be even more lonely now than I was. You always think you are at rock bottom then you can just find a new rock bottom. The good news is I have my will and life insurance ready to go. I have a chronic and degenerative nerve disease, so someday soon I can rest peacefully and she can get everything she ever wanted from me. And her words will once more become true:  I'll never have to be lonely again."

I've recently been laid off my second job so I have all this free time, but not a soul to spend it with. And I've got to save my money since I lost the job- so no going out or picking up new hobbies.

lonely,Should I Reach Out To a Friend Who Has Never Done the Same?,"Should I Reach Out To a Friend Who Has Never Done the Same? - Let's call him Jake. Jake and I used to be really close in high school, I'd say he was maybe part of my top 5 friends. After graduation, we went to different universities, but i remember he still tried to keep in contact with me and vice versa. Eventually he rose in popularity, which i expected him to since he was such a cool person. I on the other hand changed from an outgoing extrovert to a recluse introvert. We both had our own lives, but after graduating university, I felt like I'm the one who always reached out. We never had a conversation unless I would talk to him first, though our conversations were ok, like nothing had changed. 

I recently went through a terrible break up, and I'm sure Jake knows about it because we have very similar circle of friends. It hurt me because he never reached out to ask how i was doing. Even though i continued to initiate conversation with him after my break up, he still never asked, and i never brought it up either. I just feel like with his new friends and life, he's forgotten all about me and doesn't really care.

I'm feeling extra lonely and abandoned these days, so I've been wondering if i should hit him up one last time to have a drink and tell him how much i miss having him as a friend, even though i might not have a place in his life anymore. I'm struggling though because it hurts my pride to have to initiate the nth conversation with him. 

What do you guys think? Should i just accept that we've drifted apart and stop trying to sustain this one sided friendship? Or do i try harder and see what comes out of it? Pretty tired having to reach out all the time. 🥲"
lonely,Worst fears actualized,"Worst fears actualized - Alright so I (20f) am a college student but I’ve really struggled to make connections in college since my first year was mostly online. My bf (20m) and I met in high school and my roommate(19f) also met me in high school. So my roommate has found a group of church friends for herself but I’m not exactly the religious type, however she has invited me to maybe two of their group activities and I went however everyone already felt really close and they knew each other so I just felt really uncomfortable and unwanted. 

Then the other night my bf went out with some friends including my roommate’s bf. And my bf told me that my roommate’s bf basically said my roommate and her friends thought I was super standoffish and didn’t want to talk to them so they gave up trying to include me. 

It just really hurt I guess, because I wasn’t trying to be rude or anything I just felt like an outsider, but this just made me feel like it’s all my fault that I don’t connect with people. And then another guy my bf was hanging out with basically said that I never talked to him much in a class we had together.

I don’t know why, I just was bawling my eyes out about this because it feels like everyone just thinks I’m standoffish and weird and mean when really I’m just really anxious to talk to people because I don’t think they want to talk to me. I always think that everyone thinks I’m weird and is annoyed by me, but this situation made it feel like that sinking feeling is completely correct."
lonely,I am an NPC in life.,"I am an NPC in life. - Hi, 

I’ve never really posted on Reddit but I have been feeling so awful and came across this sub that just spoke to me. 

I am a 26 yo female, I feel like on paper I have done pretty okay for myself. I went to university, got a first class degree in engineering, have a good job with impressive pay. Bought a house with my boyfriend, I have a nice car that I love. As I said, on paper everything looks good. 

However, aside from my boyfriend and family, I have absolutely zero meaningful friendships. In fact, I do not have any friends. I’ve had friends at uni, and school and work etc but as soon as I’m not actively in someone’s life they tend to forget about me or stop making an effort with me. It’s always me who tries to talk to them and make plans and keep the friendship alive but after countless times being let down or ignored I tend to just recluse into self defence mode and give up. 

I don’t know what I do wrong, I feel like I’m a personable character. When with me, people seem to enjoy my company but that’s as far as it goes. I’m the girl who gets spoken over or doesn’t get heard in a crowd. As my boyfriend likes to say, I’m an NPC. And it’s lonely. So fucking lonely. It makes me feel so rubbish about myself and I often get very down about it. 

To make matters worse, my boyfriend has so many fiends. I know he feels bad about going out to see them, when I don’t have anyone I can make plans with. I don’t wish him to feel that way but at the same time I do often end up feeling left very often. 

Not expecting any advice or feedback. I just wanted to vent. Thank you."

lonely,it’s nobodies fault.,"it’s nobodies fault. - I’ve pretty much gotten to a point where I’m torn between blaming myself or blaming those who weren’t healthy to be around in my past, but now I realize that nobody is to blame. It’s nobodies fault. I’m not an outcast or a lone wolf, in fact people enjoyed being around me or having me as a friend. I’ve been told that I’m a loyal and compassionate person, but i never saw my actions as selfless or “the right thing to do”. My thought process behind everything I do is “How would I want to be treated” or “How would I want this to play out if I were on the other side of this?” 

I wasn’t popular or some type of social butterfly, but I also wasn’t a shut-in or Neet. I grew up knowing people from all types of different circles, played some sports and skating helped me make friends, and I was regularly invited out. By the time I was 17, I started seeing the rapid change around me. People stopped calling, stopped inviting me or others I knew, and overall seemed like a massive layoff is the spectrum of friendship was taking place. It was t some sort of catastrophe or huge drama level event, it was just puberty and maturity at certain points that took over and steered us all into certain directions. People who were very close to others I knew cut ties, relationships ended and it didn’t stop. 

It evolved into others essentially surrounding themselves with like-minded individuals, which isn’t something to be upset about at all. If you truly care for one another, the people they choose to hangout or spend time with shouldn’t upset you. But when you see someone you’ve grown to care for or cherish surround themselves with those who share the same ideologies, opinions and world views, it breaks that sense of abnormality or “opposite” dynamic of a friendship or relationship. People disagree, they debate or argue, and eventually reconcile or come to some sort of certain ground. It’s possible that you may not even agree or agree to disagree on certain topics or opinions, but it wouldn’t break your friendship. It’s just something you’ll disagree on. 

Some may see this as bad or wrong, but in life that’s the reality of it. It’s a part of a relationship that sort of strengthens the foundation of it all, and helps you in other parts of life where this same type of concept is applicable. Love life, workplace and college life and even family life will have you run into the same thing and dealing with it amongst your friends will help you understand this aspect of life. 

However when you take away the disagreements and differences, you’re left with more than just a like minded individual. When those people become a group of people, we’ll for lack of a better term, you end up with a self loving/loathing circle jerk. I’ve seen friends of mine move onto groups of “friends” that couldn’t be closer to the definition of toxicity. I’ve seen 3 of my friends, people I played football or smash bros on the 64 with, end their lives due to drug overdoses because they trusted the people they were so captivated by. One passing very recently, I reached out to their parents and sister who told me that they hadn’t seen him in months since he left off to Mammoth since October of Last year. 

I reached out to who they knew were in his immediate circle, his sister gave me the IG for a couple of his current friends. When I reached out, all I got were “WHO ARE YOU? WHERE WERE YOU WHEN HE WXYZ OR WENT THRU THIS OR THAT?” When in reality, I would’ve been happier talking to him despite knowing he was struggling. Although I know I’m not to blame I still felt a sense of guilt. I did try, but I also didn’t push it either because that’s just who I am. Couldn’t force anyone to try and talk to me. I came to find out that he started using Herobrine (misspelled on purpose, you get the idea though) when he met a girl on that trip to mammoth which ended up becoming a semi-permanent move. I come from an area where a lot of people are wealthy mixed with lower to middle class aka Los Angeles, so he had his parents to support him, regardless of knowing where he was. 


My point is this: I’m very friggin lonely, and people have drifted away from each other and found themselves in groups of people who are too much like them, to the point where it’s almost unhealthy to be around. Don’t let your differences cloud your relationships with those that you love. Differences mean nothing when the bond you have between one another outweighs any differing opinions. However it’s not something you can stop on everyone’s end. Only yours. The sooner we come to realize this, the less lonely we’ll feel. It’s not a quick fix or maybe the answer we want, but I see myself as a very indifferent person when it comes to the common left or right side of things. I don’t take sides or choose who to be loyal to or fight for. Humans need to start putting themselves in the middle every now and then to take in the full picture of things. 

Maybe it’s not an answer, but it’s a start. And to the young ones on here who may not be feeling like they have people who care or who are concerned with how they feel, just know that there’s people on this planet who genuinely care about our progression as a species and as a race. We care about you, we love you and we want nothing but the best for everyone at the end of the day."
lonely,I wish my boyfriend and I could move in together,"I wish my boyfriend and I could move in together - I’m a 25 y/o female, my boyfriend and I met when we were 18 and in college. Those 4 years were great, we’d grab lunch together, study, go to parties, and we we’re pretty much inseparable. Then, graduation came and we had to be apart. He lives 2 hours away, he works weekends at his job, I work weekdays at mine. Although we both live in the New England area, we’re lucky if we can see each other once a month. 

We’re approaching our 7 year anniversary and, even though we’re still very much in love, it kills me that we’re still not living together. 

To be fair, there’s a lot of extenuating circumstances as to why we aren’t living together. One being that his father has a degenerative disease and he is getting worse. His family relies heavily on him to help take care of his father (although my boyfriend admits that the living situation is incredibly stressful and toxic and he wants to get out of there ASAP). Another being that my boyfriend and I are just now starting to get established in our careers and we’re trying to stay on track for our career goals. And lastly (and most importantly) the market is absolute shit right now and we really wanna buy so we can set permanent roots down somewhere. 

He told me he wants to move out to me and leave the city behind (which is for the better in the sense that it’s so expensive to live where he lives), but that would mean he’d have to find a new job and leave his family and friends behind (which I feel horrible about).

I don’t know, we keep talking about how wonderful it’s going to be when we live together, how we’ll never be lonely again. But these days, it seems like a pipe dream and like that dream gets further and further away. I guess really I’m venting here and maybe I sound pathetic. I just wish I weren’t so lonely.

lonely,Thinking I am alone,"Thinking I am alone - I'm in such a weird spot in my life. I'm about to turn 20, yet I feel so alone in this world, or rather, I'm forcing myself to believe I'm alone. For context, I have no ambitions(never had). I feel envious of people who've had a passion in their life and a goal to follow after high school. I went to a good uni with a good program after HS for the sake of ""money"" but all it did was diminish my physical and mental health so I dropped out. Now I'm just sitting here, without any past friends I can rely on even though I've shown they can rely on me. I have my family and they are supportive sometimes but mostly judgemental on how I left uni and how bad my physical state has gotten. I really don't know what to do I just feel stuck."
lonely,Anyone here who can help me move on a from a close friend who doesn't seem to be interested in me anymore?,Anyone here who can help me move on a from a close friend who doesn't seem to be interested in me anymore? - I would prefer to talk to a older wiser person who gives good advice and good at understanding human behavior who can help me move on from this complex friendship.

lonely,I just feel absolutely lonely; like there is no other way to describe it,"I just feel absolutely lonely; like there is no other way to describe it - I am a 20 year old male living in New Zealand, and I have no aspirations or goals or anything. I have a boyfriend who I live with so I’m not entirely alone but I just feel upset all the time and my #1 suspicion is that I have feelings (not romantic) towards people that are so intense and when they aren’t reciprocated I feel like something is wrong with me. I don’t want anyone to tell me that I need to seek therapy for any of this because the bottom line is that I just want someone to feel the same way about me that I feel about others. I want someone to “obsess” over a relationship with me like how I “obsess” over others; it’s not necessarily obsessive, I have these things what I call “friend crushes” where all I want is a deep bond with that person. It’s not this weird thing where I feel as though others should be OBLIGATED to feel the same way and I feel the need to mention its not necessarily sexual; it’s just that I want the same energy to be reciprocated. Might delete later but if anyone feels the same way I would be appreciative of some advice."

lonely,I only attract toxic people,"I only attract toxic people - I thought I found the one but now that I started to hang out with him a lot I noticed all the red-flags. He gets angry easily, I always have to walk around egg-shells when I talk to him and if he thinks I looked at him the wrong way he starts to get mad (like a child), he askes me for money and we only have been hanging around for a week now.
I lost all the interest in him and I just feel sad and lonely. Before him I was in another toxic relationship for four years. I have no friends and it seems like only toxic people are attracted to me. I feel like I will never be happy. 
I feel so worthless and stupid.



I am sorry for the weird rant, I just had to get it off my chest somewhere."
lonely,Being seen as a foreigner in the same country you were born in,"Being seen as a foreigner in the same country you were born in - It's so strange being in born in a country and still being seen as a foreigner by a lot of people. You feel isolated from your surroundings and like you never belong anywhere. Especially as a mixed person. You go to your home country and they aren't like you, you go to a random country and they say ""why do you not just stay in the country you were born in?"".

It's a problem I haven't really seen addressed a whole lot in the media."

The bridge nearby is calling my name..."
lonely,"Seriously, I have no friends","Seriously, I have no friends - I go to Japanese public school and everyone is nice to me, and when I need help with something a teacher is there for me. But the mental strain of everything is taking a toll on me. It’s really hard for me to communicate with others, i usually just keep to myself because i’m very self conscious of my speaking abilities. I’m half Japanese, and all my life I’ve lived in Japan, but I’ve never bothered to speak the language (i can listen, read, and write okay). Even when i see my grandparents, it’s sad because they’re oId and I really want to talk to them. I was diagnosed with PDD last year but since then, I still have not gotten better.

I regret my decision to not go to public school earlier, and now i have zero friends. I just wish I could have someone to talk to in school."

lonely,Anyone else feel the same?,"Anyone else feel the same? - I actually don’t even feel wanted anymore, I don’t feel as if I belong in society. I love to go outdoors but only to natural areas such as forests and stuff, but I absolutely despise being out in public because I feel so out of place. When I’m in public I see a bunch of couples and friends hanging out which is good for them, I’m glad they’re happy but why can’t I have the same? I haven’t done anything bad to deserve this, I feel like a criminal that’s just been released from prison or something. I also feel like I get weird looks whenever I’m out in public even tho probably no one is paying attention to me. Also whenever I see posters and stuff on public walls and transport saying stuff like “you matter” and other mental health related things it feels like it’s not talking to me, it feels like it’s directed at everyone else that’s normal EXCEPT me. Ik those things are supposed to help people that need it but it just feels like I have been abandoned.

Atp I’m just waiting to go to university (if I even manage to get in that is) so I can make some friends there, because at my school there are almost no people that are the same race as me or like the same things as me so even at school I don’t fit in. I’m in my last year of school and I hope I can finally move on but I barely even have the motivation to sit myself down and work. 

I have also been feeling lonely for a very long time, even years before the pandemic, and at first I used to be very fine with being alone, and while I still prefer it I also feel as if I’m no longer okay with being alone and that now I just feel worthless and invisible  to basically everyone. 

Sorry if this post was all over the place, I don’t mean to wallow in self pity but I really had to get this off my chest, this may not even get any comments but I just hope at least one other person can see this and relate to it and know they aren’t the only ones dealing with this issue. Much love fr 🖤🙌"
lonely,Being fat feels like it’s ruining my life,"Being fat feels like it’s ruining my life - When I feel confident in myself, I love talking with people, I love making connections, I love going out and being outside, and it’s not hard for me to make friends when I feel good. 

I’ve only felt like that a handful of times in my life, and right now I just feel so fucking miserable. I hate my body so much, all I can focus on is how my friends get to be themselves and enjoy being in other peoples presence while I prefer to wallow in my house so I don’t have to think about how other people perceive me. I’m just fucking exhausted. 

I keep telling myself that once I like my body my life won’t be like this, but idk. I really hope that’s the case. I can’t stand being like this anymore. Can anyone relate?"
lonely,Help?,Help? - R/dating_advice is horrible for dating advice so I might has well ask here. I've been lonely for almost 10 years now and recently started talking to this girl that I've become super interested in. We plan to hang out next week but I'm not sure if she just sees me as a friend or would be interested in exploring more. Part of me really wants to straight up tell her my feelings before we hang out but th other part doesn't want to sour the friendship we have. I feel torn and in desperate need of help and guidance.
lonely,I'm over,"I'm over - I broke up with the girl I loved the most in Feb because of me being carried away by my anxious thoughts .......

No matter what steps do i take , no matter how much effectively i try to move on from her i just cannot do it and every min i think of her being in my arms ........ Recently I got the news that she might get engaged in this year with another person and just a thought of seeing her with someone else is eating me up every min........ My friends and family are tired of listening to me and seeing me getting more and more weak and funnily they have left me all alone .......... Everyday i just act to be normal but from inside I'm all dead .......... More badly in past 2 years i have lost my career and gained so much weight that I have NIL self confidence &amp; self love and within 15 days i have my exams and I'm not able to focus ...............

lonely,Will I Never Meet My Partner?,"Will I Never Meet My Partner? - I’ve (25F) been feeling lonely the past few months. I’ve met people and have dated but I feel even more alone. I have this fear I’ll never find someone who I’ll click with. My ex was great, we really clicked but we were too alike. As how Eminem would say “when a tornado meets a volcano” is how my ex and I were. Now, no one seems to be better than my ex and I don’t plan on lowering my standards to go back to my ex. I’ve been told how well I can carry conversations so sometimes I think it’s the only reason why some guys like hanging out with me or seeing me. I’ve asked 2 exes (25M and 23M) about this and they both agreed that they really liked how nice I was during conversations. But what happens when all I want to do is sit in silence or not have any conversations, will my partner still enjoy my company? I’ve been rambling. Anyway, I’ll probably die alone heh."
lonely,making friends when you’re 20 something,"making friends when you’re 20 something - it’s so hard to make friends when you’re 20+. i’ve realised most of the friends i’ve had throughout life were only because of circumstance and not because they were genuine. it’s interesting how once you leave school, or a workplace, people just forget about you and it’s as if you were never friends to begin with even after spending years with people. people do. not. care.

i feel so lonely. 
i just crave a genuine friendship."

Got bullied for 10 years, entered college in 2019 thinking to make a fresh new start in finally making friends but destroyed due to COVID, I put the rock on my heart to grow in my career as much as I can. Now after securing 3 internships (one was relocation one, got cancelled due to COVID again), 1 remote job and getting RSVP from the big tech company to join their main event live. I definitely reached bottom of my life last year emotionally because achieving something is hard and I have fear of it. 

Now I truly have no one to cheer nor an ear to share my misery. I see everyone enjoying and encouraging their moments. I feel like I am slowly rotting and it’s as terrifying as realising the fact that I have truly lost in life and I see a downward spiral of my fate…."

My old friends drifted from me and we didn’t talk much. I had to deal with depression and suicidal thoughts on my own. I felt like I would always be alone, but last month after a teacher reached out and introduced me to another student, I finally didn’t feel lonely anymore. They listen to me and are there are for me. 

We’re now in a relationship."

lonely,I think I have hit rock bottom.,"I think I have hit rock bottom. - My whole life I felt like a lone wolf/outcast. I used to be fine with it but now it's really hard for me and I have been struggling with loneliness for a really long time. I moved to Alabama a few years ago. Was new to the town. Starting over at a new place, especially when you are getting older and alone is always a nerve wrecking situation. Anyways I work at this big warehouse and I met a couple of cool people. I don't have a car, saving up for one, but I have my own apartment. Anyways, I get a ride from work everyday from my buddy and he lives right across the street. I work with this girl for a really, really long time and I we got along really well. I worked and talked to her for over a year and a half. She moved to another area a couple of months ago. It devastated me. I see her once in a while because her other close friend, she works not far from me. A week before she went to her new area, she asked for my buddy's number because she is trying to buy pot, which is fine. I was cool with it and gave her his info. Anyways, I keep seeing her on Facebook all the time and when I use to post stuff on Facebook she used to always react to my posts. Now she is always reacting to my buddy's post. I can't help but overthink all the time that I was being used so she can get with my buddy. I'm overthinking, overreacting, can't seem to stop thinking about it because I do feel heartbroken and lonely. I can get along and talk to anybody about anything and everytime I get home to my apartment, I get triggered and feel miserable. I try smoking a lot of pot, taking way too many gummies, even abusing melatonin to take away the pain but I just don't like how it makes me feel. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Can't get into watching TV, playing video games. I just feel like I'm in so much pain and I want to get over it and move on. I'm scared for the future because I don't want to be alone. And I know it's me and I have an outgoing personality and I would do so much for somebody just to get notice. I'm sorry for the long rant and I hope everybody try to have a great day."
lonely,Just an introverted lonely bean.,"Just an introverted lonely bean. - I am just giving up hope. Were supposed to be a social species. Yet it just feels like knowone is truly there sometimes. The saying where born alone and we die alone. I'm starting to feel like that is true. I don't want to die not having experienced really loving someone. Whether that be friends a partner or family. 

I do have some good friends, I feel like were growing more distant. It happens as time moves on and we all grow older things change. It still hurts seeing it fade though. 


I just spend so much time on my own, in my room. Sometimes I feel so broken to the point where I question my reality and my own feelings. Do I feel love. Does anyone even feel it or our we all on our own. 

Sometimes I just wish to find a person who wants to talk to me as much as I want to with them. Someone to share the good and the bad. To hug and be held. To do silly things like rolling down a hill like a sausage for example. Maybe one day it will happen maybe it won't. As I said I just don't want to die never having felt it. 

Enough with the venting. Moving on to something lighter here's a bit about me. If anyone is interested in getting in contact. You'll have to bare with me I am not used to reddit. No expectations though. I'll be happy if being open and sharing. Could help someone today to feel less alone. Anyhow...

I'm  turning 19 soon. Anyone ages 18-30 be nice to chat. Always been in the UK. I am a bit geeky and introverted. Love going for walks. Somewhat a DC fan. My favourite character is Harley Quinn. My sense of humor is at least 50% decent. I don't go often but I like the sea especially when it's a nice summers day. I play games every now and then. Batman arkham city is one of my favs. I also enjoy exercising from time to time. And I am starting a job soon fingers crossed."

lonely,Ghosted by my (25f) best friend (25f),"Ghosted by my (25f) best friend (25f) - At uni I met someone so similar to me it seemed unreal, we moved into a flat share together, watched and listened to the same music/ tv shows together and also had a healthy amount of time apart. We’d both been fucked over by our terrible families and were starting fresh at uni.
She met the “love of her life” a couple months later and he became my friend too. I thought they were good together, and he loved her more than anything. Meanwhile I had been dating for years with no success and was still trying to meet someone. 
Fast forward 4 years of this same dynamic, except I live alone now, and they’re still happily in love, live together, and then things change. Suddenly everything her boyfriend does is annoying/abusive (which I know for a fact isn’t true). It’s all she talks about anymore, so I tell her to just end it. She cheats on him instead, with a younger guy, and after I convinced her to tell her boyfriend the truth, the boyfriend decides to pretend it’s all ok, and says she can continue cheating even though it’s killing him inside.
Now she has 2 boyfriends, and is slowly pushing me away. After months of her bragging about having 2 boyfriends, I was the loneliest I’d ever been. See I’m dating but I’ve only ever made the first move, and then been dumped/ghosted every time, never lasting more than a month or 2 in a relationship. I don’t think anyone has ever fancied me at all, even though I’ve learned to love myself and I’m a confident, sociable person. She was always getting hit on everywhere we went together, then complaining about the attention, calling people weird for trying. 
And for the past 4 months, every time we’ve made plans, she’s not bothered to show up, and messages a few hours later with a bullshit excuse, when I know she’s just having sex or something. My nan passed away last month and she said she’d pick me up from the train station after the funeral; never showed up. Forgot about my birthday last week since she’d already made other plans. I didn’t bother to tell her I’d been dumped again after the longest relationship I’d been in, 2 weeks ago.
It’s been 4 months and her boyfriend is still too in love to end it, the other guy seems like a prick who’s convincing her he’s the only person she should be spending time with, and I’ve lost everyone. Sorry for the rant, I could just use some consolation."

My family pretty much doesn't care about what I'm going through emotionally and mentally (I don't really confide to them anyway and I don't expect any empathy).They just keep pointing out mistakes I made in life and even told me that maybe I got dumped because I don't look like someone he (my ex) could be proud of. I don't know what to do. I think that maybe if I had not been such a loser and ugly unemployed crap, maybe I would not be abandoned by the people who are close to me. I feel like a sore loser. I feel like im going deeper into hell and I'm gonna be incinerated soon. Anyway, just want to let it out here. It's so goddamn hard. I can't even have a good cry because I don't get any comforting words for being in pain. I have to cry where someone couldn't see and hear me so I wouldn't be the ridiculous one who got dumped. I wonder how long I could take all these heartbreak and pressure. It's crushing me and no one seems to care."

I might delete this post after.

For the longest time I’ve had anxiety, (ever since 6th grade) it just got worse over time to the point I worry about simple things like the way I walk, basically doing anything in daily life. I “overthink” things a lot but I just have this feeling where I know someone is judging me. From their looks or questions people ask me I just know. I’m the shy, quiet type of guy and usually keep to my self. I’ve been bottling these thoughts up for such a long time oh boy.

Honestly I’m tired. The past few weeks I’ve been waking up feeling like my head will explode, been really unmotivated, sad and stressed.

I don’t have friends. Pathetic right? 

I’m already 18 and I’ve never really experienced what it was like. I had a close group in elementary till 6th grade but they ended up cutting. me. off. just why? 
Yeah I know I “wasted a lot of time”, I already get an ear full from my shitty  older brother who just judges me and makes me feel like shit. I usually just distracted myself from this by playing games on my pc but I don’t enjoy it anymore. The people I met online were fake as shit too lmao, even the one online friend I’ve been with for 5 years switched up on me and revealed how and who he really was.
Since I’m 18 now my asian parents expect a lot from me.

lonely,Feeling like crap,"Feeling like crap - About a week ago one of the girls in the group of friends we had in high school (and that as far as I knew it was still somewhat alive) saw me on the street yet looked away when I waved at her. I already heard her say I was dumb once in HS and wasn't really close to her but still tried to chat -heck, I only chat less than 5 times per year so no one can say I'm annoying, a pain in the ass or whatever- with her for the sake of that group, and it still kinda hurt that she wouldn't even wave just for being nice if anything.

Yesterday I also found out that the one I felt most comfortable chatting with, he blocked me in whatsapp out of nowhere, and the more I think about why would he do that, the more stupid ideas come across and I end up believing them

I was mentally preparing myself to ask one of the others to hang out since we never do (that'd be a first for me) but now I fear they'll end up rejecting me too and idek the why nor wanna find out that they don't like me either"

I do lead a good healthy life,i earn well and i enjoy a good status in society, but at times I just have an episode of loneliness. It comes from no where and i feel sad.
Is this thing normal because I don't find any reason behind it.
Is this thing a setback of my kinks and things that I am into as a dominant male? 
Am I alone to feel this way or is it common for people to feel this?

Wow, I really thought I got out of the incel/blackpill shenanigans.  But even after being able to get girls numbers and having girls slide into my DMs.  I still have that blackpill/incel feeling.  I just give up.  Its weird, I want to be in a relationship and try, but I just cant.  I am probably closer than I have ever been before, but I just dont want to.   Logically, I am probably a like-able guy right?  But my mind is telling me I am and never will be loved.  Too short, too ugly, too built(for being short), too stupid.  

Its weird because I dont want to not be blackpilled.  I dont want to be convinced otherwise.  I want to give up and know I will be forever unwanted.  Which is why I would rather rant on this sub than seek help on the other subs.

TLDR:  Fixing external problems may not help with the blackpill (no shit)"
lonely,happy birthday to me?,"happy birthday to me? - Today was my birthday I turned 19. I don't know how to feel about it. I'm currently no contact with a majority of my family and the rest I am in contact with didn't even say anything to me. Even with the friends I do have a large majority didn't say anything to me. I'm just looking for something that isn't there I suppose.

2022 hasn't been the best for me either and I hoped today would be a breath of fresh air, needless to say it didn't happen. In February I was kicked out of my home, went No contact with my mother, sister, and grandparents, in March I lost my job and broke up with my Bf, April I lost my therapist and Wednesday I was in a car accident that I'm still suffering from. I needed today to be specific and I dont feel anything.

In terms of friends 6 I have left wished me a good day and appreciated it but none of my family said anything to me, hell even my ex who broke up with me wished me a happy birthday.

This is supposed to be the part of my life where I figure out things about myself anf learn who I am but the only thing that I've learned about life this past year is to never get your hopes up. 

When I blew out my candles this time, I wished for a life with people who care about me, a person whom I can love and it be reciprocated, and stable mental health."
lonely,adult life is so lonely,"adult life is so lonely - graduated college a few years ago and ever since, it’s been hard to maintain college friendships and make new friends. every day has just been rinse and repeat, work eat sleep. i don’t vibe 100% with my coworkers, and though my work does involve meeting a lot of people, the interactions are so fleeting. all of this is just making me crave a deeper connection. i just want someone to do life with right now. 

on top of that, this time of the year with everyone celebrating new accomplishments, i’m feeling a different kind of loneliness where  i feel everyone around me has been making such big progress in their long term goals while i am still stuck in the same spot and still figuring things out, or making such slow progress. i know i should stop comparing myself and just focus on my own journey, but it’s hard and i still have yet to fully internalize that. 

i will say though today i’m proud of myself for taking myself out on a date today- i dined alone somewhere i’ve been wanting to go for a while. i’ve been getting more comfortable eating alone in public. trying to move towards no more waiting for someone to do the things i‘be always wanted to do. i also combatted one of my episodes of negative lonely feelings today with exercise (running). i’m glad and hopeful that this could become a go-to healthy coping mechanism for me. for context i was never all that athletic throughout my life. 

just wanted to vent and speak out loud. thank you for listening"

lonely,Some advice for my lonely people,"Some advice for my lonely people - We evolved to live in close knit groups of 50-100 people. Our brains evolved to feel good when we have some close friends. But the way we all probably grew up or spent our time, didn’t put us in situations where this could happen.

Anime and youtube and tv shows and video games.

How many check boxes does that fill for you? That’s how i spent my life this far. Wow what a surprise we didn’t make friends when we were alone at home the whole time lol.

The answer is simple. Let’s get more social lol. I made 2 real good friends this semester just by talking to people. Ask them if they want to do homework together. This is great because to make a good friend it takes about 100 hours of time spent together and it’s really easy to do that when ur chatting together about homework and then maybe hangout after homework too too.

Other ways to to make friends. Put yourself in situations where you will be seeing the same people consistently on a weekly basis. Time= friends. It’s a simple numbers games. the more people you interact with consistently the higher ur chance is of finding someone you bond with.

Socially awkward? Socializing is a skill that can be learned. Join a workout group or dance class or reading club. keep your options open and don’t stop. something like 50% of the population is unhappy social and 25% is entirety lonely. You are normal. We are normal. You got this.

Also cool little trick to be less lonely is to help people. Helping peoples feels so good and maybe you’ll make a friend.

lonely,I seem to crave the pain of loneliness in a sadistic way,"I seem to crave the pain of loneliness in a sadistic way - I (21m) only have a handful of friends in college and never hang out with any of them except maybe once in a blue moon. It's even happened once that I introduced two of my friends to each other (they didn't know each other before) and they became better friends with each other than with me and starting hanging out regularly, basically cutting me off for the most part.

I usually attended all my lectures and did all my assignments from my bed on my laptop during this past semester. I only got up to go to my job, go to the gym and to do household stuff like cooking, laundry and grocery shopping. I stay in bed the rest of the time as much as possible. I've hardly ever interacted with my roommates even though I've been living with them for two years.

I'm definitely slightly above average or average at worst in terms of looks but I've never even attempted to date. I've had a couple of casual hookups in the past but they're not really my thing --I've found I'm not really attracted to people I'm not close with emotionally.

Despite this and other things, I don't exactly feel bad about being lonely. It's like I've come to start enjoying the pain of loneliness in a sadistic way. The more pain I get, the more I seem to crave. At one point I had spiralled into alcoholism partly due to this (mostly for other reasons)"

The connections weren't negative, but they lacked the substance to survive outside the app which sucked. It did wonders for my time management and self-esteem though.

Now I'm in my early 30's and don't have solid relationships. Sans the life story, I'm in a good space at the moment just lonely. I find myself going to bed with a painless weight on my chest wishing I had someone special to share it with, or have a genuine friend that loves to hangout, gym, play videogames and all that.

I think of these things and my mind pictures up all the cool stuff that could happen. Then I look over and see my empty room and it just sinks in harder. Like I can't cry some nights because my eyes feel tapped out but for some reason I can't tell or show anyone.

never felt accomplishment from anything in my life, i was so confused why everyone was celebrating graduating highschool. dropped out of uni because I got depressed and started trying to kms so started failing classes, 2 years of nothing happened, went to a community college. throughout this time gained over 100lbs. failed some more classes because idc about what im learning, had to extend schooling because of it

Over summers i worked construction, but currently dont have job. Bro that is years younger then me already got help from parents to buy a home with his wife, the single friend I talk to on a weekly basis finished a degree we started together and already has 100k saved, living on his own w/ a gf

I havent done anything substantial in my life, and I have never succeeded at anything in my life. 25 years of L's

wtf is the point of living? I have to work my ass off moving wood around just to get money and feel like shit? I already feel resentment towards parent because they help younger siblings so much compared to when I was there age, even though they letting me live rent free.

Back home in the states I pretty much isolate myself (except for work) as I live with a roommate who at most will exchange greetings when I leave for work and I actually preferred that over this the constant human contact without the time to truly be alone maybe I’m broken and just don’t fit in with humanity anymore

I'm 24. So I used to have many friends or more so people that I would hang out with, go to parties, and so on while I was in school and university. 
After covid I lost all that, I have to best friends that I don't see, we talk a lot and play videogames. And a friend that I fell for, but she has a boyfriend and they live together so I don't want to get in between them. We hang out every two weeks more or less, she comes over (I live alone) and we cook and watch movies and talk and that's it.
The thing is, I've been feeling extremely lonely. You see, I work as an artist, I do comics and graphic novels. I do well, but I don't have a lot of money to pay for other activities and stuff to meet new people, everything goes to the rent and bills and luckily food. When I'm short with money, my sister helps me out a bit with my rent, but I try not to ask her for money so I'm always very tight. 
So I've been having a very hard time meeting people. Now I don't get invited to parties or to hang out or anything. People just text me to see if I can help them out getting a gig with their own work and stuff like that. 
I've met other women, that always agree on a few dates and then we just stop talking, I think cause I'm kinda shy and I'm not very flirty. Like I just want to hang out with somebody, but nobody wants to do that. 
I don't know how to meet new people in my situation, and I feel that I forgot how to be a part of those who go out and do stuff. I know covid affected everybody but I feel that I forgot how to be normal and somebody that people want to go out and just talk and hang out. I'm too afraid of rejection so I just stay in my confort zone, but I don't like my confort zone. 
How do you people meet new folks with out being weird? Like what stuff is there to do where you can go alone and just meet others?

I just want to feel close to someone, to have friends to care for and to be cared about.
I day dream about having friends more than actually putting in the effort into making them. I know I just need to go outside and not let my anxietys and paranoia hold me back. stop bitching about it and just do it, no ones gonna hold my hand and guide me .. so much harder than it sounds though  ."

I met someone online today who texted like her and all the emotions just came rushing back it's so horrible. I thought I would be done by now. I made a last ditch effort to reach out and be friends again but it seems she doesn't want that. It's so hard to accept it's over, I feel like I'll never like someone as much as I liked her again. 

Life has been really drab since then, like all the colour in the world left with her. We didn't even have a fight or anything, she just didn't want to talk to me anymore. It feels so wrong, especially since she took a lot of my firsts. 

The first time I was out late with a friend, my first outing with someone with just us two. My first time taking photos with a friend, my first time someone fell asleep on me.

It all feels so weird that it's all over and it's never going to be back.

I can't help but compare everyone I meet to her, and no matter what people always fall short of the idealized version of her that I've crafted in my head. Idk it just sucks, I've never been this attached to someone before, I just really want to hear her voice again and it hurts knowing that it's never going to happen.

The person that I liked is probably gone as well. I mean it's been 2 years and some big life stuff happened to her. I can't help but day dream about going through it with her. I'm sure whatever drew her to me has also left me. If there was even anything like that at all considering how easy I was dropped.

I still write songs about her, draw outfits she would wear. Listen to songs we would listen to together. My happy place is the road we crossed at night when it was raining. I still think about the scenery a lot even though I'm sure the memory has left her mind.

I'm sure at this point I sound really creepy, that's if anyone even made it this far. It's not even like this intoxication I am displaying was mutual btw. After a 5 forgotten birthdays and a dozen messages left on read you get the impression that the other person just doesn't like you all that much. It's very depressing to like someone more than they like you, but I think that's something we can all relate to to a degree.

Idk I'm just rambling, if you scroll though my account I'm sure you'll find a lot of posts with the same general message because it seems this one fucking person has been haunting me for years. It really sucks living like this. I just want to see her again"

lonely,A breeze in the wind,"A breeze in the wind - 27 years old and I just realized I’ve never had a real best friend or a deep tight knit bond with anyone. There’s a few people I’d say I’m close with, but over the years I learned I’ve been wholeheartedly open about everything in my life with strangers. I’m not really close with my family either, the amount of manipulation and trauma from them is sickening. I am most content and safe being myself, or at least have tricked myself into believing that. I always felt like I didn’t fit in-with family, friends, peers at school or colleagues at work. Nobody ever understood me or even tried to. I battle with that thought thousands of times daily, knowing that I’m simply not a person who leaves long lasting impressions on people. Most days I wake up sad because I just want to die, and put myself out of agony pretending I love life when in fact I don’t...I put so much positive energy into people when I don’t have enough for myself. It’s too exhausting. Gave it my best shot, with everyone, with everything. I try to be the good human being with morals and pureness that the world needs. I can’t afford the basic lifestyle I have and trying to strive for more often leaves me in disappointment and tears. I’ve become numb to it after so many fumbles. I am tired. Worst part is it seems unfair and a little bit sad thinking about how my happy ending to life probably will never happen. But fake it til you make it, right? Keep smiling and moving forward. Love"
lonely,giving up? can't handle much more,"giving up? can't handle much more -   I grew up pretty alone, but I see myself trying not to be lonely since I have a consciousness. I try to ignore it and be as calm as possible about it: usually it works, with the great exception of weekends and holidays, when my time just seems wasted. Almost everytime I go outside I get sad because people are mostly happy but I just can't be as them.
  Friendships look very complicated to me, and I may be a loner that prefers having only really deep love instead of multiple and shallow relationships. Unfortunately, I've seen no one with these same interests, and everytime I try to interact I see that someone looks more important to me than I am for them. This lack of reciprocity makes me think about how unirrelevant could I be. 
  Maybe, no one really cares about my literal and internal pains, since most of time I need someone, I have nobody. Adding this to those bad things that naturally happen during life really makes me wonder if life is worth-it and why shouldn't I give up all of this, whatever it means.
PS: all of this might be nothing more than weird things I've just thought."

I spent most of my life looking for 1 person who care about me more then anyone else, usually how your family sees you, but growing up in a traditional family I didnt really get that. I've spent the last 18 years working hard for that and I have nothing to stand for it. Everyone I meet gives no effort in being my friend, and it will probably always be like that."

No wonder why I fuck up so much. So im sure of it now my destiny lies there. To validate that emotion it's possible to lead to ultimate freedom from self, this prison along with this shitty emotion. I admittedly can't stand being this way but it's all I am. It's the only thing that feels fucking real and perhaps the only thing I could trust...I just don't want to fucking be here anymore lol"
lonely,"am i just a loser? super weird? annoying? meant to be an outcast? like what is this, and why.","am i just a loser? super weird? annoying? meant to be an outcast? like what is this, and why. - i'm 16 (17 in 3 days!) and literally have two friends, one being online. i don't get it. i see other teenagers with giant friend groups, or at LEAST people they can consider friends (loosely) who they can talk to if a closer friend isn't around. but me? no. i haven't had a group of friends since i was maybe 11, and i don't know why. i love and appreciate my two friends more than anything, but this can get me down.

i just wish i knew why i'm such an outcast. i try my best - i'm nice to everyone, i'm very quiet but at least okay to have a conversation with, the minute anyone in my class needs anything i'm there. i don't know if it's that i'm ugly, weird, annoying, or what, but i'm tired of it. i never have plans with anyone but family. like i know i'm not that pretty, i've been made aware. unfortunately, it matters more than ever now - - couldn't possibly get the perfect picture for social media with that ugly kid, huh. i know i'm weird, but i guess i've never that i'm THAT weird. and i know i'm annoying and have for a long time. beyond that, i have issues forming and keeping connections, to some extent. but i just don't know.

i feel like i'm missing out on a lot of moments in my teen years. i'm just a sad, fucking lonely kid. and i'm watching literally everyone else have a good experience (even the other really sad ones lol). just feel bad rn."

I was lonely before because I don't have any friends besides him, but now I am just besides myself with loneliness. I feel ancient (32), still haven't learned how to drive, and my whole family wants my alimony already. I don't know where to even start. No one to turn to, no one to trust.

lonely,Any form of media that atleast lessens Loneliness?,"Any form of media that atleast lessens Loneliness? - Toradora was the first anime that I loved and a huge part of it was because the relationship  between the two was honestly Wholesome and Idk the way they depended on each other was really sweet, K-on is just perfect watching the anime made me feel like I was hanging out with a bunch of friends.  


In games I guess the mobile game Girl alone where you take care of a NEET and help build her confidence and she gradually warms up to you.ICO is also good but you need an emulator, Basically it's a game where you guide someone in your attempt to escape a Castle, You protect her from monsters and you lift her up on high structures it's really good but i stopped playing because the puzzle was hard and im dumb af but an overall good game especially if you like puzzles. My child lebensborn is also good but it's pretty dark and it'll mess you up a bit so not that recommended for this. Anyways i tried some JRPG's which had good characters but unfortunately i feel like the relationships between the MC and the characters are weirdly distant and sometimes the MC is just pathetic and messes up most social interactions.  


Anyways any media where there is good character relationship and interactions where you'll feel less lonely playing or watching  (I'm sorry for any wrong grammar english is not my first language)"

lonely,This is unbearable.,"This is unbearable. - Just went for a late night walk and saw teenagers everywhere having fun with their friends. Hanging out in their backyard, at the park, playing music from their cars, going to the movies and restaurants with their girlfriends. I never got to experience that. I wasted my youth rotting away in the house.

I can already tell this summer is going to miserable. My area is full of young people, but there's no way to connect with anyone. Its too late for me. I'm at the age where people call me ""sir"" and avoid making eye contact when we cross paths. I don't want to live anymore."

Summer really has a way of making you feel so much more lonely. At least in winter you sort of battle the depression with thoughts of people staying inside. With summer it's romantic and people have bonfires and date nights outside. I don't care to be so out there in public or noticed and in highly populated areas as I have anxiety. In fact I'm considering a whole new wardrobe change to tone it all down to further avoid attention. What's difficult though, is just being in this quiet house. My family members are talkative when I'm in no mood and when I'm in a mood it's like graveyard silent. I probably am not meant to be involved with people cause it always end shitty. I just wish that I did have a genuine connection but I guess we all die alone anyways so better to at least try to make the most of our time alone whichever way that is..."
lonely,I didn't get to go to prom.,"I didn't get to go to prom. - There were a whole bunch of reasons I didn't go, like my dress not coming on time, not having a date, not having a ""nice"" ride, etc. 

But the main reason I didn't go was because I was going to be alone. I just sold my ticket last minute to someone because the last person who was supposed to go with me, also got a date. My best friend is hanging out with another friend group who doesn't like me, so it's not like I could hang out with her. My other close friend has a boyfriend now. And anyone else I could've gone with are more-so acquaintances than they are friends... 

There's also my friend group from this program I'm in, but I only really talk to them in class/school. I never really get invited anywhere and i'm typically excluded from ""group things"", so going with them would've just been uncomfortable for me. 

I know it won't be a big deal in a few years, I probably won't care at all that I didn't get to go. But I wish I had people to go with. Or friends who wanted me to go. I've been looking forward to it all year and I was so excited to go, until I realized I don't have anyone to go with. I wouldn't mind just wearing an old dress I have in my closet and going, so my dress not coming on time wasn't a big deal. It's literally just the fact that I'd be alone the entire time &amp; have anxiety. :/"

Any advice? - Idk how to say what I really feel these days but it’s something like when you are in a room full of people you know and love but you feel so lonely and alone. I’m in my university year now and I have no friends at my school. My friends from highschool are at different school so I often meet them during weekends. I get excited to meet them cause it’s really sad when there are 147 people in one class but you are just…alone. So I get out of school whenever I can to meet them ( my school is around 30 minutes from where most of them live). But at the same time I didn’t want to bother them to pick me up cause it’s a real hassle with all the traffic and stuff. I don’t own a car so it’s hard for me to even go to campus as I have to take a 20 minutes walk. 

Being in school really fucked up my mental health and I’m not happy with my life. It got worse. I live at my friend’s house for the weekend (not all weekend) when I got out of school so he can send me back before Monday if I have offline classes. Recently, I feel like I don’t belong to that group anymore. Idk if it’s because most of them are males but I feel so lonely plus he told me sometimes he didn’t want to have me but just because he pitied me. That hit me hard. 

But yeah, this is just a lil of how I thought. Thanks for listening guys❤️"

Hello. I am a 29 year old disabled guy that lives with his parents and I’ve never been to college before, so its difficult to even meet people to try to befriend. I love my parents so much but sometimes I get so lonely because I don’t really have any friends. I have a brother but he’s getting married soon, so sadly I won’t be able to spend as much time with him. The main people that I interact with are my family members. Also its difficult for me to talk to strangers because I have a speech impediment. I figured I might as well try the internet to find some friends. Im so tired of feeling so lonely all the time. Having disabilities is tough but im so happy about what I have achieved, I recently started learning how to play the violin! The violin is very difficult for me but I love the instrument so much. I wonder if anyone will even read any of this haha but im going to hope that at least one person reads my post. I feel invisible most of the time. Im not a alien but sometimes I feel like a alien. I hope I make a few close friends. I don’t care about your gender or location but please be between the ages of nineteen and thirty six years old.

Italian food is my favorite food. My favorite color is purple. I love the ocean. I don’t drive. I love gaming. Halloween is my favorite holiday because of all the cool costumes that I see. FFXIV is my favorite video games but I don’t play much but I want to change that. I want to learn how to play the piano in the future. I believe in Bigfoot and aliens. It took me a long time to write all of this, my grammar and spelling are horrible. My favorite candy is chocolate and gummies but not as a combo. I have a Service Dog for my anxiety because I get lots of anxiety. I love language learning even tho im not the greatest at it. I am a boy but sometimes I like wearing dresses. I love philosophy. My favorite cartoon is The Last Airbender.

&amp;#x200B;

I love gardening! Gardening makes me smile. I love nature and just chilling in it sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I love playing the violin. I started learning the majestic instrument about a year ago. Im not super good at playing the violin but I absolutely love the instrument so very much. Right now im learning how to play a anime song on it. The song is called The Path Of The Wind. You get bonus points if you know what anime that song comes from! The next song I want to learn how to play is from the anime called Parasyte.

&amp;#x200B;

Hiking and camping are literally two of my most favorite things to do in the whole universe! I love hiking with my brother and camping. I have hiked some of the PCT before, I hope to hike the whole PCT someday but I doubt it will happen because of my disabilities, I would need to have a very trusted long term hiking buddy do the whole trail with me, and most people can’t take off that amount of time from work. There are a lot of local hikes that I frequently go hiking on. I love hiking so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Poetry is music to my soul.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a amateur cosplayer thats obsessed with anime. I have seen several animes and I have been to a few conventions. My brother is kind enough to bring me to anime cons and hang out with me all weekend there haha even tho he’s not the biggest fan of conventions, I love my brother so much hehe writing that sentence made me cry a lil, I have a very nice brother. I think I love cosplaying so much because I can pretend that im “normal” for a while, I try my best to stay positive about my disabilities but its very tough sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Im absolutely obsessed with cooking. My favorite food to cook is Indian food. Pav Bhaji is my favorite Indian food dish to cook. Sometimes I cook some Italian food. Pizza is so much fun to cook.

I love to travel. I have been to all of the USA states and to most of Europe, and a few other countries. I want to visit many more countries in the future! I also love long road trips around the USA. I recently got back home from a big road trip across some of the west coast of America. Hawaii and France are two of my favorite places that I have visited so far. I love adventuring.

&amp;#x200B;

Fishing is a hobby that I want to get into. I have only gone fishing (maybe?) two-three different times. Im mostly vegetarian so I would throw most fish back. I do eat fish sometimes but not often, mainly just when im on vacation in Hawaii. I want to get into fishing because I love being by lakes/oceans/rivers. The ocean is my favorite. I love boats.

I have a dog. Her name is Olive. I adore her so much.

(Forgot to mention I slide into her Instagram DMS after we matched) it's Saturday now and still nothing. She still goes active but...yeah."
lonely,I feel so isolated and like such a loser,"I feel so isolated and like such a loser - I'm going to be 22 on Wednesday. I guess I'll just start from the beginning, as cliche as it sounds to say that.

I've never fit in. I moved to where I currently live when I was in third grade and suffered really terrible bullying at the hands of a lot of the school up until early high school. I had people who I guess I could consider friends but only a couple who I really consider FRIENDS. I only have three people I can think of off the top of my head who I would consider myself still friends with from high school, and honestly only four who I would say I was friends with in any real capacity anyway. Out of the three I still talk to, one constantly flakes on me and every plan we ever make and the other one moved continents. The third I'll talk about later.  


I lost my entire online friend group of four years this past year and very, very few of them speak to me anymore. I don't really want to talk about the details of the whole situation surrounding it - it's messy and exhausting to even think about. It's really shaken a lot of my faith in my self, really shattered all of my confidence socially - I never expected them to just cut me off completely, which the majority of them did. A lot of them assured me they wouldn't when I was worried about losing them as friends and still did.   


My best friend from high school moved away for school and I'm proud as hell of him because that man will be my brother until the day I die. He has been there for me in situations where I had no one else. He knows things about me that literally no one else does.   


I miss seeing my best friend every day at school. We stay in contact - play video games together, sometimes we just FaceTime each other and talk. But he's not *here* anymore. I don't interact with him daily online like I did with my old friend group, and I don't expect him to be available to me like that - he has his own life and I respect and admire that in him. He has a group of friends where he lives who he hangs out with regularly - roommates and friends from work and school.   


While I am glad for my friend and his situation, I can't help but envy it deeply and constantly. He went away to school - I stayed in the town that both of us despise and went to community college. He got all those opportunities that I just keep wishing I had the guts to apply to school and get. I was too scared.  I decided to stay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Four years later, I'm not even close to finishing an associates degree and I have no idea where my life is going. To my credit, I've had a job (recently two) the entire time that I've really enjoyed, but it's pretty much consumed my entire life at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

The community college I go to is really terrible at cultivating the community part - my days are spent during the school year by getting up, going to class, going to work, coming home, repeat. I've had very few social interactions outside of the classroom. Friends who I thought I'd made will either just not contact me or only contact me if they think I'll let them use something of mine. I have no friend circle. No one really contacts me. The only people who I get texting me are my sister, my parents, or my boss. I have some online friends now but none of them are really all that close to me. I think that some of them believe themselves to be much larger parts of my life than they are. That's not to say that's anything wrong with our friendships or them - they just don't live anywhere near me so we can never actually physically hang out and also have other relationships that take priority over the friendship they have with me - which is also normal and fine. It's just reality. I don't expect them to make extra time for me or put their other relationships on hold for me. I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no real way to meet people. My line of work isn't one that lends itself to meeting too many people - I stick around the same bunch of them, and not too many are people I'd want to hang out with outside of work anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm not at work I'm just in my room. Alone, usually. I just...I feel so isolated. So alone in this sea of other people who have partners and friends and people to go do things with and I'm just sitting here, unable to work up the courage or fight off the anxiety to talk to people I don't know in the real world. I just...I wish someone cared about me. I wish someone would let me care about them. I want a friend."
lonely,Can Someone Help Me Change My Outlook?,"Can Someone Help Me Change My Outlook? - I go to school and then I socialize in our little groups for class. Then the next period I do it all again. Then I see those people walking around laughing and they just pass me by without a glance. I’m not mad about this but it’s always funny to realize people have their own ‘real’ friends. I used to text many people during quarantine but it all had started to stop. Sure, these people have their own lives but taking a month and weeks or when they need something to get one text back is just hurtful.

I try to stop hating myself because it gets so painful. Even if I want to I can’t escape my own thoughts. I have little positive or attractive qualities. Being ugly is hard and being talentless is hard. It’s getting exhausting trying to change that.I understand why I’m lonely. People say that I have to have confidence and try to make friends but I never had much confidence to begin with.

I’m writing this because I want to know if anyone had stories similar and that they can tell me how it gets better. I’m going to delete this eventually because I feel like I’m being negative. To those who feel similar you are special and you do matter, it’s hard to feel that way for myself."

lonely,I don’t know what to do…,"I don’t know what to do… - I’m 24 years old and got in my first relationship and moved away when I was 18 years old. I had to escape the situation with my mom because I was not doing good idea. You see growing up she was addicted to pills and was always high and I always had to take care of her. I remember one of the times it was my 16th birthday and I came home and she was passed out on the floor so I had to drag her to the bed and tuck her in and make sure she was alright. This happened all the time so I grew used to it like it was just a part of life. She married seven times and we moved around all over Texas. I went to so many schools and never stayed in one place for more than a month or two. I had no friends, I was always the new kid. My mom separated me from my family when I was really young so I really wasn’t close to them because they didn’t like her (for obvious reasons) and I was very protective over her because she was my mom. She sheltered me pretty bad never really let me go out and do anything so I pretty much grew up in my rooms. Never went to a friends house or anything. Eventually when I was 18 I had enough so I gave her an ultimatum, either get sober or I’m done, I’m cutting ties. I’ve tried so hard for all these years to get her to change and nothing happened so I was just done. She didn’t change. She didn’t listen to me. So I left. Moved in with my girlfriend I just met because I needed to get out of the situation. Thing is, my girlfriend was just the same. Didn’t really let me do anything and kept me sheltered. But for 6 years I took it because I was used to it and was terrified of being alone. Now I’m 24 about to be 25 and it kills me that I’ve wasted so much time of my life. Something has got to change but I’m too scared of being alone. Feels like I’m still a kid. I just don’t know what to do and I’m so tired of it all…"

lonely,Accepting it is good.,"Accepting it is good. - I am not saying ""I am alone and I will do nothing about it"".

I mean more a perspective of ""I am alone, and yes it hurts but is not the end of the world either"".

Single people think getting a relationship or marrying would heal their loneliness I've seen that the ones that are miserable before marrying are -sometimes even more- miserable when they marry.

Friendships? Making plans for the weekend? Then what? You get home afterward and you feel the same as before, and maybe you start getting anxious about doing something again soon. 

I've felt lonely for many years and I've decided to really look into it, and the more I look I realize it is fixed from within.

The first thing is accepting it; yea I did not get invited to that place, yea I do not get many texts, yea I am not the popular person. So what?

When I was a kid I used to play alone and really had a blast, sometimes I just turned off the TV and daydreamed about stuff and really enjoyed it. Or sat down to play a videogame by myself and had a blast, I even remember enjoying cleaning my room and listening to music. 

Today friendships is more about ego and numbers than creating actual connections with people.

What will I do? What can I do?

I don't know yet. But I am not gonna stress over it anymore. 

I won't become bitter that's sure; I am and have always been a kind and warm person. Won't become cold just cuz my relationships haven't work as I wanted? Was my fault? Not 100%, at the end people do whatever they want. I won't put my happiness on their hands."

The only woman I've ever loved recently left for another guy. I work 12-14 hour night shifts on about 3 hours sleep, yesterday was a day off and I slept a full 20 hours out of sheer exhaustion.

lonely,How do I embrace loneliness? Now why would someone ask that?! Read below :(,"How do I embrace loneliness? Now why would someone ask that?! Read below :( - Why do I want to embrace loneliness? Well, I just started university in person (going into my second year) and the problem I’ve always had was that I always envied good times people were having, opportunities people got since they made friends/connections, I just hate being alone so bad or I’ll just be severely depressed/unmotivated.

I know from my highschool friends (still friends with them) that it’s not just me who’s still lonely in university. A lot of people are, and I know I won’t always be accompanied with someone unfortunately.

I understand where my problem is, I don’t think making friends is the reason I came to university. I KNOW I want to study hard and have minimal distractions but I can’t help but feel so stupid for being lonely. I want to be happy that I can be alone since that’s a big part of independency

I’m sorry if this comes off as rude or offensive to anyone in this group. But as an ambivert (extro lean) how can you come to terms with being a lonely person? I’ve never been alone and now that I need to, I have to keep reminding me that this is normal and okay."

and i dont know what to do, i have friends, i have alot of friends but i dont know if any of them actually care about me, i feel like people have just as good a time without me but i have a miserable time without them.

I've stopped caring about both my outward and inward appearance, hell I've stopped caring about both myself, and future self, I've lost all my passion, and interest in things, I do things like binge watch and play video games simply to keep from being bored to death. Other than that I just wallow in my own self pity, and I'd rather do that then try to change because change is hard and wallowing in self pity is easy. I hate myself so much but I'm too lazy and stupid to do anything about it, and that only makes me hate myself more. I'm just a worthless waste oxygen.

I say wow, that's cool, In reality I'm becoming jealous because this guy is tall, handsome, and everything I'm not. I bet his gf is awesome. I start feeling the jealousy take over and I tell him, see you when you get back, and walk out. I'm not saying the guy is a model but he's good looking and has an outgoing personality. I know jealousy isn't healthy but why am I alone when I doubt he had to do any of the stuff people tell me like go out more. I bet he is himself and he got his gf by being himself. I laugh when someone tells me to do all this stuff to only have a chance when regular people don't have to do all this stuff because they are good enough as they are. I came up here, am sipping on the coffee, and beating myself up mentally. I will always be alone. 

There is no empathy for me. Nobody cares. It showed yesterday when that therapist disliked me. I'm already on edge and I can't tell anyone because there is no one to tell. Even if it wasn't the weekend, who would I tell? A therapist who dislikes me and doesn't care? Imaginary friends? I have to push this down like everything else. I'm just a bitter piece of crap that I don't know why but deserves to suffer alone. I'm really reaching my limit of pushing all of this down. I used to have a good therapist to vent to so I didn't have to worry about my loneliness and jealousy explode into I don't know what but it's scary to think about. Now I have no one. It hurts so much knowing there is nobody to open up to when I need it. No one to call or go out with to talk to me. Hotlines are bad and filled with mean people. Nobody cares.

I'll just put myself out there and be myself without any need to focus on what I'm saying etc etc. so it's not even a facáde or self-esteem problem like one would think. And then it would go exactly the way I had imagined.

Until I blow it the very next day or month and just become an antisocial piece of sh\*t. For no reason. I just can't keep friends or anything for a long time for that matter. I'm guessing it's got to do a lot with lack of routine. Or complete indifference to wanting one. Gotta be one of those things fo sure.

Don't get me wrong it's not like I don't have any friends of acquaintances but they are distant as hell. I even have a 4 yr relationship but we just treat eachother like business partners. 

I would just completely avoid people whom I would literally talk to a day ago for no goddamn reason. We would really click and then I just go and blow it without any sense of why I did that. There's no plan or reason. And I make tons of plans and reasons but never put them to action (once again possible lack of routine on my part)

and then for the sake of adhering to the fictional social hierarchy I have created, I will act that way for the entire remainder of my time with that person, if there even is any to begin with. Then get problems with envy and actively resent said person. Sucks. 

If I, for some strange reason, cancel this entire mental charade I am still met with avoidance from people sooner or later because they get bored of me I think. So not exactly a win win situation. But there definitely would be if I decided to stick with what I'm doing for once in my life and abandon short-lived spontaneity. Many thanks for reading this if you have you're a real one.

lonely,I think I'm addicted to loneliness,"I think I'm addicted to loneliness - So, I don't know if I actually belong here or not. Perhaps there are subreddits more suited for such rants, but since I'm yet to find them, I'd give it a shot here.

There's a lot going on in my life lately and I feel I'm loosing control over it. On the outside, I think I can be considered a succesful man, I often hear people are jealous of my life. I have a job that earns me a nice cash, I have a daughter, I'm with a girl I had a crush on for around 10 years, I'm still relatively young, fit and healthy, and I can lead a life some of my peers would consider luxurious.

Yet deep down, I feel extremely lonely. My job is slowly killing my true personality, as it forces me to behave like someone I'm really not. I need to pretend I'm an extrovert, a natural born leader, I'm constantly bombarded with different people and social interactions in which deep down I'm not interested at all. My daughter is a really loud and hyperactive type of kid, a total opposite of me. Spending time with her is very tiring for me, and after a few hours I'm sick of her, which makes me feel disgusted with myself, because I'm not a good father she deserves. My girlfriend is trying to be supportive and loving, but I feel we don't understand each other, and I'm actually shocked she's still with me, because I'm doing everything I can to make her dump me. I love her, but I'm not a right guy for her. I'm considered fit, but behind this facade I'm a guy with a very unhealthy eating habits, or perhaps even an eating disorder.

As I said, I think I'm addicted to being lonely. My girlfriend recently asked me what I want from life, and my honest answer was ""to be left alone"". My family is totally unsupportive of me, they consider any sign of mental distress a weakness or a whim. My mother thinks that my life is wonderful because I make a few times more money than she does, because that's apparently all that matters. My ex-girlfriend, the mother of my daughter and perhaps the person who knows me the best (we spent a few years together, after all) says I've changed a lot a last few years and I can't disagree. I think I became devoid of any emotions. All I feel in my life is nostalgia for the past, and all I do is trying to go back to ""the good, old days"". In my free time (and I don't have much of it) I listen to the same old depressing music, I play the same old video games, or I sleep. I know it may sound like a depression, but at the same time, it's not like I feel down. I just generally don't feel anything, negative or positive. I also never had a suicide thoughts, even for a briefest of moment. Sometimes I feel my life doesn't have any meaning to it, but I don't want it to end. On the contraty, I'm terrified of thought of death.

Okay, it's a long rant already. To sum it up, all these things don't make any sense to me. I feel alone, but when people want to socialize with me, I reject them. I'm always looking forward to the weekend, but when it finally comes, I always look for an excuse to spend it alone in my apartment, laying in bed and midnlessly watching dumb videos. I'm actively avoiding my girlfriend as much as I can, although I can tell she really loves me and cares about me a lot. Is it normal? Do you have such feelings as well?"
lonely,I hate this,I hate this - I hate me bwing a shit just because every single thing feels lonely! I just do the same routine everyday and it's so tiring that i don't have any social life because if me being sad evryday about something that i don't even know!! I hate this and I hate me as well.
lonely,Do you think you're lonely because you don't seem interesting?,"Do you think you're lonely because you don't seem interesting? - I've had some few opportunities this week of meeting some people. They were talking around me and I was just standing there saying almost nothing except once where i repeated what someone said.
Others seemed more engaged in the conversation. My mind was blank, I had nothing to say. All I did was repeat a few words. Man it must be boring to talk to me. Even if I put myself out there I get nowhere...Anyone?"
lonely,my boyfriend &amp; i mutually broke up yesterday. now i’m alone again,"my boyfriend &amp; i mutually broke up yesterday. now i’m alone again - i feel so horrible cause i have the habit of jumping from relationship to relationship so i don’t feel alone. i put up with abuse in past relationships cause i felt like i needed somebody. i dated a guy before my last ex who was a narcissist &amp; i went through mental &amp; physical abuse from him that it ruined my mental health. i ended up going to the psych ward due to the trauma. my last boyfriend is a cool funny guy, he doesn’t deserve to have me drag him down. my mental illness is severe &amp; it was effecting him negatively. i wish i was ok so i could love him the way he deserves to be loved. but i can’t be selfish &amp; hurt him to make myself feel fine. i’m not in a position to be in a relationship with anybody. i need to focus on myself &amp; fix my life. i have no support from my family at all. they never call to check up on me or anything. my mom just judges me &amp; puts me down cause i’m mentally ill. i moved back to my hometown 2 years ago &amp; i have no friends here. my hometown is a boring cesspool &amp; it’s even worse for me cause i’m alone here. im planning to move back to Texas where i’m a lot happier &amp; have friends. i feel like i’m at the lowest point in my life. i wasn’t depressed and suicidal in Texas. i was happy &amp; going out to different places. i didn’t stay home crying &amp; laying in bed all day. i just wanted a distraction from my loneliness &amp; depression but all i did was mess shit up. i hope i can keep him at a safe distance &amp; be friends. but right now the love im looking for i can only give to myself, i can’t depend on others to magically save me from myself. i need to stay up strong &amp; do this on my own. it sucks so bad being in a dark hole by myself but i’m doing the best i can to get out."
lonely,Want to talk,"Want to talk - Hey, I need someone to talk to, sorry, but I just feel sad right now and I don't really have anyone to talk to since the people who know me barely even talk to me and I think I made the person who is most important to me leave.

But I'm feeling detached from her as days pass and even feels like i gotta just leave this relationship sometimes tho she sounds she's just fine and normal like the times we used to talk for hours everyday. Idk what to believe, is loneliness my personal problem and my relationship isn't good enough to help me with it or do everyone feel lonely and it has to be dealt seperately? 

And thanks really for any help, appreciate it"
lonely,Summer makes me even more sad,"Summer makes me even more sad - Here in Europe, summer is slowly beginning. It is getting warmer and in the evening it is light longer. All people now go out with their friends and enjoy the beautiful weather. But I, who has no friends, watch people having a good time. That's why for me the pain is quite big in summer. Who feels the same way?"
lonely,i’m the side character,"i’m the side character - I’ve been in everyones shadow since day 1. No one really cares on checking up on me. I can name a lot of things that have made me felt or realize how unimportant i really was, but i’ll only say a few. When she was absent for ONE day, everyone worried about her and asked her why. But when I was absent for A WEEK, only 2 people noticed including one teacher, so 3. But those three people never really cared to ask why I was gone. I needed the homework I haven’t done, so I told my teachers that. One of them said, “You weren’t here, really?” And another asked, “You weren’t here for Thursday and Friday, right?” Which is correct, but I was out for the whole week, not just those two days. I’ve gotten 3 compliments this YEAR, they were about my shirt, wallpaper, and drawing. I crave for validation, so if I get any sort of compliment I would keep thinking about it for the next few days."
lonely,I still miss moments of being with my ex,"I still miss moments of being with my ex - I’m stupid for feeling this way. But I know in the beginning I was the one that hurt her because I was narcissistic and selfish and controlling 14 years later to late to understand the love she had for me.  The patience and want she tried to show me in making a family. I fought her, her daughter and most of all my self.  I knew better in how to act but something was just ugly and broken inside of me. She tried till I took the last drop of her love and then she had nothing left.  I have never know such loneliness being with someone. I loved her but didn’t know how to show it. I still struggle with expressing love concern. I am such a sociopath that I can show sympathy but I’m not sure if I have ever truly shown empathy. But she got the last swing in. Then I just let myself become her source and get used like the dumbfuck I am. I want her to be happy I want to still take care of her. But I know my anger my resentment would just turn into a vengeful punishment. So I know she is better off without me. As well know the things she has done to me with be with me until the day I die. I have changed in so many ways sexually .mentally  as well as how I am. I already had trust issues. Now I trust no one. I have become self destructive. I just separate myself from the world and my family to chase after profiles and people I will never act on when making arrangements to meet.  I flake constantly. But I know in my heart it’s not something I want. I just look for the validation of being wanted. Just to not follow through.  Sex is such a strong and for some deep connection. While others use it as a tool or as a way to feel desired and wanted. I have so many blocks in my head I can even find completion in sex. So I just give my partner as many as she can have. To give them some sort of intimacy. Im so tired of feeling alone and empty. I miss love I miss truly being in love. But I guess as we get older we either create stronger bonds or we get use to them not being there and we pretend. Just another dead body walking."
lonely,No clue,"No clue - I have absolutely no clue how to make new friends or how to attract women. 
I’m terrified of just dying alone with nobody.

But I would like to be able to have a conversation that didnt last less than five minutes. Its definitely a downer
lonely,It seems impossible for me to become closer to acquaintances with someone,"It seems impossible for me to become closer to acquaintances with someone - All my ""friendships"" are closer the strangers, but not friends. 

My school had an event and it was only me and a ""friend"" that was there, but he constantly talked about how he didn't see his friends. Not *other* friends, friends. I guess he only hung out with me because he couldn't hang out with others.

My friends hang out a ton, talk to eachother a lot, but never to me. I've never been invited to something if it wasn't out loud to a group, where they won't look bad if they just said ""you can come"". If I wasn't there then they would've never invited me. 

I put forth effort and it got me nowhere. Yet when I point out that fact, they tell me that I never DM them, but thats only after  _I gave up after it wasn't mutual_. Thats not even mentioning the fact they easily do that for other people, but never for me. 

I really just want to accept the fact I'll be lonely forever, but I can't."

lonely,A bit of different take,"A bit of different take - Everyone's so sad and alone here, but I'd like to shed a bit of positive light on loneliness because people in this subreddit give me the impression that they are going through a tough time in their life and they ""just"" can't handle it. 

Being alone is a blessing. Being lonely and alone is different of course, but unfortunately, they go hand in hand together with me. Still, as long as I'm alone, I'm the happiest person alive. After all the extensive abuse and torture I've been through and all the bullying I had to withstand, I love being alone. It puts no responsibility on you, it forces no meaning on you. There's no one there to hug you, no one there to help you, no one there to tell you things will be alright, no one there to tell you that you'll make it. But I've been isolated my whole life, I don't understand what that is. These words and actions make me feel anxious, and bring me pain. These concepts are alien to me. And it often feels to me that these lonely reddit people only ask for love, they don't know how to give. I don't know it either, I can't give love, I don't even know if I can feel it. Being lonely is a salvation from all the mental torment I've been subjected to. No more judging every movement, no more insults, no more controlling, no more dictating, no more beating or manipulating. I don't have any love to give. I'm broken and no one in the world can fix it. Being alone is the only moment I feel truly free and I feel nothing but disdain for humanity as a whole. I have no memory, no history, I don't understand living or feeling, I'm so detached from it all. I raised myself, alone, in my little room, and I'm a mess. I'm a mess broken beyond repair. But the one thing that brings me happiness, is when I'm left alone. I don't need love, I know i can't handle it."

lonely,"Everyone left, it’s been 8 months and I still haven’t found new people.","Everyone left, it’s been 8 months and I still haven’t found new people. - 21f. Throughout my adolescence I didn’t trust other people, so never tried to form a friend group. Got close to very very few people. This past year of college I finally let people get close to me. I had four people - three guys and one girl. It all began to fall apart when one of the guys got one of the girls drunk, started touching her, and tried to lure her into his car. If I hadn’t found them  he would have done something. 

The girl wanted me to forgive him, so I tried to. But I treated him differently after that. Eventually she began to experience paranoid delusions, and distanced herself from everyone. She ruined her ex best friends reputation, abused her boyfriend and then filed false racism claims against him, and made three false reports on others that aimed to get them expelled. Only started texting me and calling me. And would go out looking for new victims. I strongly suspect she has Borderline Personality Disorder. 

The one guy resented the fact I treated him like a monster after assaulting her. As well as targeting my other female friends. He was telling people I sent nudes and I called him out for it. So he blocked me and smear campaigned me. Very strong narcissistic traits. Most everyone, including the borderline he assaulted, chose him over me. And acted as informants to his campaign. Nobody has reached out, nobody cares. They’re all deep into drugs and alcohol. And feel that it’s not their fault. 

It’s been 8 months. I’ve tried making new friends but I’m extremely traumatized by what happened. I thought I could trust them. But they hurt me and threw me away. I don’t know if I’ll ever have friends again after what happened."

Looking for happiness externally is only getting temporary highs, finding that inner happiness within one's self is challenging, yet most rewarding  


It couldn't get me any harder. I'm a good student. I'm also an undergrad teaching assistant, which considers being ""cool"". I recently landed an internship at a top well-known tech company, with great pay as well. My family, friends, and teacher/mentor are all happy for me. I appreciate them so much, especially my mentor who has been helping me through this process. They think I'll have a bright future, make lots of money, and finally be happy. I feel empty. I feel nothing. I was high for a moment after the offer, but I realized ""is that all?"". I have no connection to my friends or my family. Most of the time I'm just be there. I can't even connect to myself. My life is a mess.  I'm lonely most of the time, most of the day and most of the night. I've been so lonely for years. I look at my non-college friends, who think they are ""not as successful as me"", but they have their life together, they have close friends, they have significant others, they're full of life, full of love, and always happy and positive. Those are much greater successes to me. I'm so jealous of them. I'm not a financially ambitious person, but it's the only thing I can aim for because I have nothing else besides it. I don't want to make bags of money and be unhappy. People have different goals, and I'm sure being financially successful is one of them. I just don't want to be lonely anymore."

I tell myself I can live without love but I'm slowly getting comfortable with the idea of casual dating someone. I did get matches on apps but the interest for meeting always come from my side. At this point I just want some companionship/friendship honestly.

lonely,Waking up suicidal most days,"Waking up suicidal most days - I think I wake up feeling the urge to put a bullet in my mouth every other day. I've gotten pretty good at fighting off the feeling throughout the day, but I can feel it wearing me down slowly. My situation is a weird one, and I'm mostly just writing this down for my own purposes. In case you don't wanna read all of that, I just wanted to ask who else struggles with this also?


Ok, now onto the reasons I feel this way. As I said, it's a long one. So, I've been pretty suicidal since I was around 13 or so. I was a loner in school and essentially watched everyone around me make friends, get into relationships, etc. As a teenager, I grew quite resentful of that and became a sort of lone wolf, bitter at the world for rejecting me the way it did. 

Fast forward to when I'm 16. I just moved to a new town, and found myself in my first relationship with X. X was (is) bipolar and our relationship was a rocky one. She ended up cheating on me and leaving me when I was about 21. It was an incredibly bad break up. The kind that leaves you feeling scarred and betrayed, not least because the only girl in the world who'd ever accepted me, let alone loved me, trampled all over my heart like it was nothing. She shacked up with the guy a few days later, fell hardcore into drugs with him, and just generally became someone I didn't recognize anymore. 

After a brief, mostly LDR due to covid with my second girlfriend, let's call her Y, she ended up breaking it off for seemingly no reason after showering me in love and affection for months, then slowly exiting my life. She now ignores me whenever I talk amongst our mutual friend group, as if I don't exist. I don't understand it, and I don't understand her. Yet another senseless ripping out of my heart as far as I'm concerned. 

So anyway, since that happened I've been single for around 3 years, mostly floating from one casual thing to the next. I've learned that showing vulnerability, or any sense of humanity beyond pretending like nothing bothers me and I have 0 problems, leads to a potential love interest losing interest for good. I've learned that, to most people, I'm not a human being with thoughts, feelings, interests, etc. I'm a human doing, as in, my only value is how useful I am to the person in question. How much moral and emotional support do I provide? Am I rich? Am I willing to buy them things or host them at my house to distract them from their problems? Beyond these questions, I don't exist to most people. No one asks how I'm doing, checks up on me, or anything. It's apparently the expectation that I do that for them, but god forbid they return the favor. 

During this time, my ex X called me. We ended up hooking up several times and keep in semi-regular contack behind her boyfriend's back. However, she's very keen on keeping us a secret from as many people as possible. She'll talk sweetly to me, tell me she loves me, misses me, all that. But she doesn't want anyone to know what's happening here. She doesn't want ""her life that she's built"" to be destroyed. So, in essence, I'm just her side piece. There to serve her when she needs me to but otherwise our relationship is non existent. The sad thing is that it's the most intimacy I've gotten from another human being in years. At least she pretends to care, to love, and everything. I've gone years without so much as that, despite my best efforts to try to make friends. It's not an exaggeration to say that everyone I've come into contact with has used me in one way or another. 

The way things are now, with me being a side piece to my former girlfriend and otherwise only being acknowledged by anyone for my usefulness to them has made me pretty suicidal. I have a history of it, but it's worse now than it's been in awhile. My friends are getting married to genuinely great people, and I'm here alone, unwanted and certainly unloved no matter what I do. Sometimes I just want to end everything, it doesn't really seem worth it most of the time"

Hi, I'm Michael and I'm looking to make some new friends here! This is a backup account created solely for this purpose. The guys work with know my other account and that, coupled with my slight fear of clowns and the option to send pictures within chats now, would undoubtedly not go unexploited, I know new accounts are suspicious here and think what you will but will go out of my way to avoid a clown. I suppose I should say something that makes me stand out from the crowd a bit. Not really sure how to do that as I'm not one that ordinarily stands out from the crowd. I'm actually quite good at blending in. A skill learned from working all these years. Lol. I'm just a regular everyday average sort of guy. There's nothing really remarkably different about me. I enjoy what most people enjoy. like laughing with friends and having a good time. I do have a soft spot for Pink Floyd. Piper At The Gates Of Dawn anyone? I'm brand new to this as this is my first time looking for friends. Online fiends, I mean, I'm easy-going and it isn't too hard for me to strike up a conversation with just about anyone. Doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. If an average guy in his mid thirties gets your attention and that's something you're looking for, by all means, shoot me a message! tend to get along better with people closer to my own age so please be close to 30. No minors. Admittedly, spend a little too much time here on Reddit. So many subs, so little time. As an icebreaker, perhaps you can tell me about a sub here you enjoy I may not have discovered yet. I'm always open to something new. Hope to hear from you soon!"

Let your fucking pain burn you down so you can rise back up from the ashes and rebuild yourself.

lonely,"Is it only me, does every day feel like torture?","Is it only me, does every day feel like torture? - So it’s Friday night. I did nothing as usual. I stayed up late doing the dishes from 2 days ago so when the housekeeper comes in the morning she won’t be overwhelmed and judge me for being lazier than I know I am. 

So it hit me: Life is torture. Plain and simple. I was thinking about it as I brushed my teeth. Here I am, getting ready for bed, each night, then having to get up the next day to do the whole awake thing over again… working, eating, watching oneself deteriorate physically (getting older, thinning hair, and getting rounder), watching stupid TV shows, going to bed and then repeating the cycle over and over again with no idea what’s next, no plans, no goals, no aspirations and no prospects. Life is just one dull, dreary cycle of sad events. Like a slow, boring foreign film with no plot, no dialogue and no guest stars or cameos. Just me, going through the motions of this thing called a life. What’s the point? 

Sadly, I have no one to talk to about any of this or how much I wish I could just stop the pain. My parents didn’t love me, they didn’t want me, they stopped talking to me because I’m gay and not a conservative Trump supporter. Fine. Check. Don’t need them. My baby sis sides with my parents. Fine. Check. Don’t need her. 

But everyone else I’ve met over the years had turned away too and I don’t know what to do or say. I tried for years to keep setting up outings. Inviting everyone over for dinners, game night, movie night, taking time to remember everyone’s birthdays and sending cards and being mindful to call, text or visit for each special occasion. I was the friend I wanted others to be to me. The same with relationships. Both of my ex bf said as they were dumping me that I was “the kindest, sweetest, most caring and loving, thoughtful and kindest person they had ever met.” Both. Verbatim. I could not make this up. Yet. They both met someone younger and hotter and well… I was out. 16 and 5 years respectively, flushed down the toilet. Liars and thieves. That’s what guys are. 

So despite all my efforts, my phone never rang back. No texts or emails came. When I fell on hard times, after I was laid off, I heard from no one and saw no one. Then I get back on my feet and no matter how many times I ask to meet up, catch up, grab a bite or drink, it’s always, “sure! Yes! Let’s do it!” And years go by and nothing. 

So I am left with no friends. No family. No children since my selfish exes decided they didn’t want to adopt even though they originally were open to it. So now I’m 52, stuck in and endless cycle of work, eat and sleep with nothing else to live for but to pay my rent and buy groceries. 

Is this really how the next 40-50 years are going to be? Fuck me. Life is torture. 

And it will only get worse as I won’t be able to get clients or work when I’m 75, I’ll be even in more pain than I’m in already thanks to my ruptured disc. 

How does everyone else do this life thing alone? It suuucks… and not in a good way. 

Lonely in L.A. (surrounded by millions of people but still alone.)"

lonely,Lonely facing divorce from the love of my life.,"Lonely facing divorce from the love of my life. - After almost 15 years of marriage my wife got fed up of my bad behavior, anxiety, depression and emotional baggage and decided she was done. No love left. I had been living in denial, never followed her to the couselor for marriage therapy, and now that I finally see it all, and am seeking the help I need it is too late. I was blinded by my own issues and arrogance...and now I can see it all.
The difficult part, I still love her like we just met, as in the first year of marriage. I need help, I feel lonely and scared. Just miss her touch, but now all I get are cold hugs, the touch a therapist would give a patient. She wants to be friends, mainly for the sake of the kids, I want my life and family back. 
She gave me enough hints, more like direct talks, saying she was unhappy, that she hated me (and I never seen she saying she hated anyone all these years), and in hindsight I can now see how she had been unhappy for a long time. I was not there emotionally, affectivelly, empathetically, and even physically. We had sex, but was something mechanic, without joy. I was blind and did not see, living in denial...then all of a sudden....I saw! Upon seing her face of aversion when she said it was over, and her relief, happines afterwards, her attitude as if a curse had lifted from her shoulders. And I was that curse.
I now have a long road for recovery for all my issues, if anything, at least to have a good relationship with my children, the be the best dad in the world and the dad I fell short of being so far. But now I must do it alone. If it would have been tough with my wife and my kids at home, supporting me, by my side, I can only fear doing it all by myself, in the silence of an empty house. 
I am a grown up, middle age man that is feeling like a five year old left alone at the train station, abandoned. I have very few friends, and they are all married, busy with work, kids, not much left for someone like me. That was me and I could not see how happy and complete I was.
For everyone here, If you love your family, go to therapy if your spouse says you need it. I don't want anyone to go through my pain. Dont let depression, anxiety, and anger, fueled by any undiagnosed desease like ADHD  Bipolar, or any other, get in the way of a life, a family. I did. 
I will recover, I will rebuild myself for my children. But we can make pills for the brain, we can find solace in our children and even in the arms of another. But there are no pills for the heart, for the pain and the forever saddness of the lost true love, the loss of the one who still gives me butterflies. And for no fault other than my own.

Now, I apologize to any woman in this sub since this may sound sexist, but here i come:

For the last 3 years I've been faking a persona online, one persona who just represents my ideal me, the person i wish i was yet i will never be: Seeing myself as a cute likeable girl.

The point is I just hate my identity as a male, I wish I could get rid of my manliness and turn into a female, I can't stand being related to sexism and all of those femicide cases (in my country, is one of the main problems), yeah, I know not all men are bad, I know I'm not one of them and I know there are also women who aren't angels, but the media keeps remarking me reasons to want to dispose of my d\*ck and whatever identifies me as a male, even those memes where they mock toxic feminism (or should i say hembrism as I hate to generalize)

Another reason I want to dispose of my masculinity is that (here is the reason I made an apologize two parragraphs ago) by the time i've been faking being a girl I found out how easy women have it when it comes to get affection or find confort and how they aren't judged because of showing weakness and sadness, while men are either made fun of or ignored while doing the same, even by fellow men.  I repeat, my apologies if this sounds sexist. 

However, I have no plans on becoming a trans, because my economical status doesn't allow me that and because I come from a christian family, so despite I have nothing against LGBT community, I feel like the values i was raised in makes me feel like I don't want to make such a drastic change on my body, which just puts me on a crisis, like, I want to stop being a male yet I know I can't change gender by magic or something."

lonely,"A vent about being lonely, I guess.","A vent about being lonely, I guess. - I'm 21, and I turned 21 in late March. I am a male, and I identify in accordance with my assigned gender.

I admit, rather shamefully so, that I get attached to people way too quickly. It is indeed my biggest failing. I listen to cheesy love songs, write love poems, play the guitar with more happier sounds. The person who has my attention during these times is on the forefront of my mind. I daydream about their touch (non seggsually), I think of their voice, pretending in my head that they're telling me all sorts of sweet nothings. I fantasize a future. I go off on little tirades about how much they mean to me.

I can become this way in as little time as 3 weeks.

My sense of love, and my conveyance of such emotion is broken. I'm starved for that connection so much that even the slightest notion towards the idea that someone has feelings for me makes me excited.

My parents split when I was younger, when I was 7, I think. My mother became very dejected towards me. Since I was her only son, I reminded her so much about her ex husband, and was projecting feelings she had toward him, to me. My dad wasn't much better. From the time I was 10-15, my dad was more or less physically abusive. Was I a shit child that probably had it coming to me once or twice, sure. But I'm okay now.

I genuinely don't have a father figure anymore. My mother's trying to be better, but she'll never be the same. I long for a romantic connection that I can just dead rely on. I want to work and toil for someone who would appreciate my efforts. I may not be giving my 100% every day, but my emotions would remain the same. I want to make someone proud, both romantically, but also in a maternal sense too. The motherly ""I'm so proud of you"" that I've been missing all my life. 

I also recognize too that my head is in the clouds. I know that I will never have that kind of connection in my life. At least, never again. I work tirelessly on the grind called my life. I play old video games on my Wii, and try to pretend I'm a kid again, but with a decent childhood.

Knowing that I will never have this connection will pain me to the very, very end. But I will always hope. Because I will have nothing else to do than live my life in the same apartment for the next fifty years or so, making money, living the same life I can."

lonely,Sharing what works for me,"Sharing what works for me - So for the longest time i was waiting for someone to be there and invest time in me to ""save"" me when i felt like dying out of loneliness. I found my self searching for suicide stories and stories of survivors and watching tedtalks about it a lot but then i stumbled on one called ""science of happiness"" It helped me gain perspective a lot. It says (with proper credible research  
in psychology and examples) that our brains are capable of synthesising happiness and they are already doing it subconsciously but there are things we can do to speed it up or slow it down, it means that our brains have a tendency of seeing a silver lining in negetive experiences as a way of making peace with things we want but do not get. I also brought the book by this same speaker and started reading it, i researched it a bit more and i try to remind myself of it. You need to shift your perspective (its hard but better than suffering alone with no hope) and let your mind do its job. It also said that we tend to overestimate things we dont get. Most of the things have little to no effect on our happiness 3 months after they happen. It helped me a lot. So maybe some of you can try it if it makes sense to you."

lonely,I talked to a girl today,"I talked to a girl today - 

Today I went to a local library because I felt I needed to go outside because I just keep working at home every day. 

But as soon as I walked into one of the library's room, a girl approached me. She was hosting a vinyl exhibition. 

At first, I was paying attention to what she was saying, but as soon as I saw the vynils I started talking about my own collection of CDs and she got very interested in it. But then I kept changing the subject and she kept interacting so at the end we talked about a bunch of stuff, not even related to vynils nor music. 

She seemed to understand everything I was saying and talking to her was like talking to an old friend or something because we agreed on everything.

We talked so much that a library employee interrupted our convo to say the library was shutting down. Then, I told her that I intended to go back and that I would visit her exhibition again soon. She said she would be there for months so I was invited to comeback. 

I felt like asking her number or something but I got hesitant due to a lot of things. First, I am very introverted and socially awkward. Secondly, I've been very focused on work in order to be financially independent since I live with my mother. Also, I am very ashamed of living with my mother because I am an adult and I feel that I should be living on my own already. 

Now I don't know if I should go back to see this girl or not. To clarify, I am a bisexual girl and the girl seemed to be interested in girls (my gaydar is very good) so I think there would be a chance I could be more than friends with this girl, which makes me even more afraid to make a move. First because of these problems I mentioned and because my mother is homophobic and I am in the closet."

lonely,How to seem like less of a friendless loser on snap (snap score),"How to seem like less of a friendless loser on snap (snap score) - I have zero friends. 

Anyways I’ve recently made a snap and would like to add some coworkers I’m friendly with on snap as well as some acquaintances from the gym. 

BUT I read that they can see your snap score and it can’t be hidden if y’all added each other as friends. So how do I make that score  go up before I try adding these ppl? I don’t want them to figure out I don’t have friends/ a lot of ppl I snap with .

I could just say I just made it(which is true) but they’d prob wonder why it’s so low. (Since it’ll take a while for me to get it up since they’re just acquaintances, potentially for a really long time) 

I would like to use snap to get closer potentially be at least hang out every once in a while with some of these ppl,  doesn’t have to be close friendships. Or even just send dumb memes to each other. Some sort of communication. 

Also I’m afraid what else snap shows (like they can see who your “BF” is or who you send things to) Can someone explain that to me?"
lonely,A whole ass vent (with air ducts too),"A whole ass vent (with air ducts too) - Man, it's been a whole month since I've posted to this subreddit. I guess that means, for a while there, I was doing good. Or I was just on a roll with shoving my feelings down... Which seems more likely of the two options right now



I uh.. I haven't posted about this girl lately and I'd like to just for a moment. She was special to me. Not in the same way the love of my life was, though -- because this girl brought a message with her. For some backstory for those who care, I spent a year of my life talking to this girl that I met through a video game. Stupid, I know, but the girls that live around me won't give me the time of day because... Well, I can only assume it's my height. I mean shit I can't even get a word in without being judged. Either way, that's neither here nor there in regards to the story I'm telling. 


I met her through a game, and we seemed to hit it off really well. We talked every other day and it quickly turned into a daily basis. I'd call her during my break at work (and I'd make it a point to take a 30 minute break for JUST that reason) and we'd play games together on my days off. She was the first, last and only girl I ever told my folks about... But she had a lot (and I mean A LOT) of fuckin baggage to unpack. I was more than willing to stick it out with her but she wasn't. There were times where she'd let me in, but there was always something she'd hold back. Granted I understand I only knew her for a year, but there were times I'd almost be on the brink of tears trying to explain to her that I'm not there to hurt her and wanted nothing more than to make her as happy as she made me... And I guess that's a lost cause if she didn't want to put in the work. 



Long story short, after she found out I had feelings for her the dynamic shifted almost immediately. She started putting her other friends above me, started to suddenly not want to call... It was the beginning of the end. Couple that with the fights we'd have on a near daily basis that only got worse, it wasn't a good match. She said she never wanted to date, which I thought was funny because almost all the fights were started by her, and they were all something that couples would fight about. She'd send me letters in the mail and I'd send them back, although last time we fought she called me just to shred them... I still kept hers. Matter of fact, it still smells like the perfume she put on it all those months ago. 



**TL;DR** : I guess the point I'm trying to make by telling you this story is that she brought a message with her. No matter how hard I try, no matter how much effort I put into somebody, it always comes back the same : She doesn't want to date me. I'm not deserving of love. And somehow that's supposed to be liberating.

lonely,It’s lonely taking care of everyone,"It’s lonely taking care of everyone - I am a female (20) and I am so emotionally drained from supporting everyone in my life. I work and go to school which is already so much effort. I have always been there for my family and friends but it feels like lately I am alone and in some way that’s my fault but it still hurts. I live at home and still help out with my family as much as I can with cleaning/cooking and helping with my younger brother.  I have always been there to help my friends in anyway I could but that has translated to them just expecting me to help all the time it feels like. I no longer volunteer my help and support to others cause at this point they just expect me to drop everything for them. They don’t even ask me for things/favors anymore they just expect me to work them into my schedule. I say no often but they get upset at me. I have started distancing myself from my friends and blowing off plans because every time I see them I have to hear about their problems which can be exhausting to focus on all the time. I feel like there is no space in my life where it is just focusing on me. My time is either dedicated to work, school, family, or my friends and their problems. I started spending the little amount of my free time alone and when I have explained to my friends I like being alone cause it’s the only time I feel like I can be myself and do what I want to do they have gotten upset at hearing that. They have tried to tell me they are sad about how we barely see each other but it is exhausting to have to see someone and know they are gonna either 1)only discuss their problems or 2)expect you to do something or help them in some way. Yes I am alone often and it can hurt at times to have no one but at the same time it is exhausting to be there for everyone and have no one. It is a joke that I am the mom of the group since I take care of my younger brother and do so much. But it actually feels like I am my friends mother the way they constantly come to me and expect me to take care of them and their problems.
I have expressed to them how I already do so much and actually feel like a mom to my brother so my free time is important to me cause it’s the only time I really have to not be doing things for others. Yet they still expect me to support them by constantly helping and dropping everything. I have no outlets to talk about my problems because everyone in my life just expects me to be fine because I already do so much. I am just tired."
lonely,How do you forget about your old friends?,"How do you forget about your old friends? - I’m 17 and a junior in high school. If you look at my previous posts, you can see that I have no friends. I’m here to ask how to get over my past relationships.

Today I was talking to one of my siblings about old times. One of my old BEST childhood friends came up. I stopped talking to her 2-3 years ago and really regret it. I have no way to contact her. My other sibling came in saying “you need to let these things go. Childhood friends. Move on” in a sarcastic annoying demeaning tone. It really made me upset but I had to hide it.

They know that I have 0 friends and I feel like they think I’m weird for it. I always try to back track saying “no I like being alone and I’m not lonely” when indeed I am. I just don’t want to seem like some type of freak loner. Is that how everyone sees me? Maybe I should take their “advice” and never talk about or think about past relationships no matter how badly I miss them. How do I forget about them?"

He a blunt kinda guy thats cool i am too but sometimes he let that get in the way when im having a literal anxiety attack or im crying about it or whatever. Its okay to tell me to calm down or stop overthinking but you yelling at me and kinda being just downright rude not helping. And he knows i have these problems.

Enough of me venting, i have no other person to talk to or tbh feel comfortable expressing my feelings. All he does is talk to his friends and play games but when it comes to me it kinda feels like im pulling teeth :/.

Here's the deal: most of the problems were inadvertently caused by me without my knowledge which led them to cause intense feelings against me. My problem was that I stepped on their boundaries and came off as rude and insensitive, which when I reflect over, was wrong of me. I understand and I'm definitely trying to be a better person for them and others. 

On the other hand: hurt. So. Much. Hurt. Hurt over the fact that they chose to hide it from me for so long. Hurt that they broke my trust. Hurt that they went behind my back and spoke about me. Hurt that I'll never be able to be myself again. Hurt that I cannot trust anyone. Hurt that I hate myself. Hurt that I may never be able to make friends again. Ashamed of myself to a degree where I struggle to look in the mirror. 

Seeing them everyday is a struggle and I'm battling it with my best efforts, but on the brink of losing it all."

But I am so incredibly lonely. I spend most days alone by myself and work from home. I practice and push myself in therapy week after week. I have nightmares most nights. I have flashbacks and high anxiety many times per week. And then I’m exhausted. All I want is to feel better. I am so tired. My spouse doesn’t have emotional space for me, and thanks okay I don’t blame her. She’s been through a lot. And I’ve put her through a lot. I miss the days when we knew each other.

I am working as hard as I can to live in a balanced way. To not let my emotions absorb me. To breathe and practice logical perspective. I pushed through the week. I grind at work. I try to be superdad. 

But now the week is over. And here I am alone at home. I long for someone to hold me and tell me that it’s going to be okay. That I’m loved. That I matter. Because I am so devoid of intimate connection with anyone. And I have been for a long time. The only person I feel truly sees me is my therapist, and I don’t even know this person. I write myself supportive letters. I journal. I try to turn it inward. I’m so tired.

I guess I’m discouraged. I’m doing the work, but I’m feeling empty again. As I always do. It never ends."
lonely,"17m here, diagnosed anxiety","17m here, diagnosed anxiety - I was always different from most of the people of my age, bullied on high school, changed it two times. When I woke up and really did not felt like it, I just went for the day to the forest, feeling like a complete looser, being scared of my future and struggling with every little thought that just came into my head. Never had any friends. Never received love at all. No love at all even from my closest. I just feel like when i wouldnt be here nothing would change"
lonely,friends zone,"friends zone - Everyone I ever had a crush on and I told them I liked them just wants me in the friends zone. Now I'm thinking is something wrong with me or is it just hard to love me.

I really don't know 😕 and I'm really sad about it 😞"
lonely,Bored. Meeting new people would be nice (M21),"Bored. Meeting new people would be nice (M21) - 

Hey 

You can call me J. I work from home. So I kinda have a lotta free time. I usually play games on my free time. (PC) 

And so if you are someone who works from home and have a lotta time then we might talk when we are bored together lol."
lonely,no one to turn to,"no one to turn to - my dad is dying in the hospital from cancer and i don't have a single other person in my life to turn to for support or reassurance. completely alone and isolated. i'm so overcome with anxiety and stress that i don't even know how to be supportive in this situation. i feel like someone is supposed to have a circle of friends to confide in during moments like this. friends that will be there to help remind me why life is something worth being happy about it. even if i get a couple nice messages from random people, that's nice for a moment, but then the isolation kicks in again once they're gone. i don't have any real, lasting friends. friends i can count on to always be there for me. i'm alone."
lonely,Lonely and afraid for the future.,"Lonely and afraid for the future. - Been alone for as long as I can remember, I always had trouble fitting in. Regardless how hard I tried in my younger years to be social and proactive I was always shut down or belittled quickly. Let's just say my school life was hell on earth, if only I had peace when I got home then just maybe I would of had atleast some joy in life. But unfortunately for me my father was abusive, verbally, physically and mentally bringing anyone home to that house was impossible. Eventually I got fed up of life and just existed for the sake of existing, I was once a bird that use to strive for friendship and communication regardless how badly I was treated or how often the world shut me down, I always kept at it. Well until I gave up that is its been so long since I cared about life, I went a very long time almost 12 years without really talking to anyone, being intimate or even going out to do something fun. It feels as if my only purpose in life is to consume air, food and drink and nothing else. But something happened for the first time I found happiness a dream came to me a mission a want, a desire, a need I had to accomplish, it did not help me socialy or change my life but atleast it gave me joy and a new zest for life it helped me look past my history and look to the future. A dream that could change everything and solve all my problems in life but as like always life was not kind and after 4 years if trying to make it happened I failed and life has gotten to the point where it's almost impossible to follow my dream. For the first time I had hope in my life, now it's gone. This caused me great emotional pain and brought me further into depression which caused me to shut my self out completely from society and I stop sleeping which nearly brought me to insanity well technically I did go insane for almost a week, I just woke up one morning and did not know who I was or if I was real or even how to do the most basic of things, my mind was shattered and broken, I'm better now atleast I'm able to some sleep which has helped my brain heal though as strange as it might be my  mind still feels different, like something has changed yet I cannot put my finger on it. Its terrifying not knowing what happened to your mind, and asking yourself daily if you are insane. All of these things make it hard to be part of this world, I don't know how to talk to people, it's freighting to have a conversation even though because how I was raised I'm pretty much not scared of anything except conversation lol. It's funny how terrifying just speaking words out loud can be, and speaking to women is even ten times harder, when I try it's seems like I'm doing it in anger and yet in reality it's just fear, I'm short with the opposite sex with out wanting to be, I seem mean we'll just wanting to be kind. I guess what I want most is to talk, socialize, love and be loved yet it seems an impossible task to achieve regardless how hard I try. I have forgotten how to be a human or speak out loud, in my heart and mind I'm a social butterfly who is kind and loving, yet on the outside I feel like a stone statue that will crumble at any given moment. Iv lived thousands of lives and stories in my head, iv had thousands of conversations as well yet so few in the real world. It's a strange feeling to finally wake up and realize you have been living a lie all this time or wondering If you really exsit. I feel like a doll that had yet to be brought to life. I tried to put my self out there today only to realize I have no idea how to speak outloud. I guess I'm just tired of being alone and felt like telling my story for the first time. It feels could to talk even if no one reads this, it felt good to type it all out."
lonely,Therapy is useless for loneliness,"Therapy is useless for loneliness - I'm having massive panic issues and it got worse after seeing this new person. The last girl made it obvious she cared and was very gentle and empathetic. This person made me feel worse. I tried to explain about loneliness and she didn't care. She said, we can only do one thing at a time while they are all connected. Loneliness is tied to depression. She even cut it short and said, lets talk more next week. That would be fine but all I got from her eyes and voice was not what I got from the last girl. This was no empathy, no caring, and a very cold demeanor. Her eyes told me she hated me for some reason. It felt very wrong. Instead of comfort I feel worse and I miss the last girl even more. You can't talk about loneliness with therapists. They either don't care, don't understand, or dislike you for some reason. You try to reach out to people or groups who claim to be there for you but you find out loneliness doesn't exist to them. They don't care. In fact, sometimes they judge you and shame you. I really can't take it anymore and all that will happen is someone will lecture me for negative self-talk or not wanting to improve. I wish I could not exist and stop this loneliness. It's Friday Night and there is nowhere to go. No friends, no gf, nothing. I really can't do this anymore and if that makes you upset at me or look down on me, then I will give you binoculars."
lonely,I've never felt lonelier,I've never felt lonelier - I feel so exhaustingly lonely.  I don't know how else to describe it. It's exhausting and it's tiring and I just want to escape my own thoughts

Ever since the Lockdowns, it has constantly been hitting me very hard how alone and lonely I really am and I hate it so fucking much.

In a couple of weeks time I'll be turning 29 and since I was 19, I haven't had any social circles whatsoever and I haven't been able to make any new friends outside of work.

I volunteer on a regular basis with my local cadet group and on the nearby heritage steam railway so I am friends with the guys I'm volunteering alongside.

But outside of those, no friends whatsoever. I rarely get invited out to anything by those that I know and I accept that they've got their own lives, friends and families to go through.

No girlfriend either as I've gone without one since 2007 and haven't gone on any dates at all.

Just wish that I could have a friend or friends of my own again that I could regularly talk to and hang with like I used to."

I have hobbies, thousands of games to play and books to read and movies to watch. I have friends i could go out with, anytime i get bored, and i have a job that fill my days so  why would i ever feel bored or lonely right? .
Recently i started to get a new feeling, a new kind of loneliness i never imagined me of all people could feel. Im longing to be with family and friends and im not even living alone right now.
I hate the idea of marriage and never saw myself gertimg married and i know im not going to be a great father but if this feeling continues i dont see any other option other than to get married and start a family of my own.

P.s alot of u may not understand this but im from a country where getting a gf isnt an option so any dating advice wont help.. Its either marriage or loneliness for me and ive always preferred loneliness... Until recently.

lonely,idk why I forgot,"idk why I forgot - No one can give you the will to live. It's something only the individual can find.

So it doesn't matter if I'm truly alone or not ultimately I can never appreciate life. It's just too fucking pointless. It never goes away so must be all I am...I don't want to take fucking pills. I just want to let go of this nightmare because I'm fucked up. I hate myself, I don't want to get better. I don't want to deal with this shit anymore, I'm fucking beyond tired. I just want to let go. I need to let go or it'll never end..it hurts too fucking much, too much to care about anything else. But I'm afraid, so everyday is torture and I just want to fucking end...why couldn't I have died?

lonely,"Guys, go easy on me…","Guys, go easy on me… - I’m not trying to sound tone deaf. I have worked through depression and loneliness, and dealt with abuse for years.

On a different corner of the internet, I sell “girlfriend-esque” care packages to put it simply. And I keep it pretty separate from everything else I do online…. but some of you on here seem like you would (maybe?) benefit from it.
I send a “care package” with some perfumed clothing/home goods that you can place around your home… genuinely it helps so much to have a physical object near you when you’re feeling down and alone. Just a way to add that extra dopamine into your week. Hopefully this reaches someone who could benefit.
Feel free to message me about it. I don’t judge and I definitely understand the feeling of being desperate for a connection…

TLDR; I send care packages. Even if you aren’t interested, try sending someone you love a physical letter. It goes a long way."
lonely,anyone mind talking?,anyone mind talking? - I feel horrible my anxiety is going crazy anyone mind talking for a bit? Preferely another girl i wouldnt feel comfortable talking to a guy
lonely,Fake,"Fake - I've lived most of my life behind this mask of happiness and stupidity, always going through everything being the person I want to be and trying to make the people I love and cherish happy. It didn't matter to me how I looked to other people as long as I could make them happy that's all that mattered to me, but as soon as I found myself alone and there were no eyes on me this person, this facade that I put on for the people around me I'm always immediately sent into despair. I've tried to change to become this second persona I have but somewhere deep down I believe that I'm undeserving of this happiness. No matter how much I try or what I do, nothing will change the way I think of myself and it's just eating away at me. I have so many family members who love and support me, friends that got my back and deal with my shit, and even many of you here who have replied to the various posts I've made being unreasonably kind to someone who just isn't worth your time.

I don't like that I am this way but no matter what I try I just come circling back to this state of mind. I've thought of killing myself multiple times to release myself for this lie that I'm living in, but I know if I do all the people counting on me to be strong and light their way will be sent into a place just like me. I know that I'm still young and I've got lots of life to live still, but it honestly feels like a waste for someone like me. Some nobody who's smart enough to make something of himself but to stupid to take a first step, who's charismatic enough to find a partner but to cowardly to make a move, and who's able to stay strong for the ones I cherish but not for himself. I wish I knew how to make this act a reality but as of now I'll always be the worthless person I am and always will be."
lonely,If you're feeling lonely give this a quick read.,"If you're feeling lonely give this a quick read. - I know it's hard. It's hard on everyone. The problems don't end with loneliness sadly, they often begin with it, or is being caused by other problems. It's hard on everyone. On dudes, on girls. Some might think that dealing with loneliness is easier for women, because they have options and are less likely to get rejected all the time, but its equally hard on every end. 

Sadly loneliness cannot be solved, that desperate need for connection with someone, that desire to be loved, understood, desired and cared for.... Everyone wants that. Everyone wants something real deep down. 

You're also lonely, not because you're ugly, fat, shy etc... You're lonely, because you haven't got the courage to approach people. What if I told you something that you already know, that most people you pass by on the street are feeling the same way as you are. A couple of words could change both of your lifes. All it takes is a little courage, of course you'll be anxious, but tell yourself its excitment. 

It's much easier to talk to people than to sit alone in a dark room as you are coming closer and closer to the conclusion that you just want to end it. Because loneliness is at times unbearable. Combine it will everything else and it is literally too much to handle. So a breakdown is inevitable and if its one breakdown too many you might do something people around you will regret. 

Your life is precious. Sure its hard, but if you persist and try it wont be hard forever. You have to try. IF you want to talk feel free to dm me at any time, I don't go out at all so I will reply as fast as i can, unless its night and i sleep, which it currently is, but who sleeps at night anymore?"

lonely,Bothered By Unhelpful Thoughts?,"Bothered By Unhelpful Thoughts? - It can happen so easily. You’re trying to concentrate on your work, and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic. Or, maybe you’re about to go on a first date, and all you can think about is how horrible your last few dates have been. 

**Unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive.**

Your mind is incredible. When you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. Imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! You could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.

### These strategies can help manage thoughts that don’t support you:

**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further.

● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.**

● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.   
 

**Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.

● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they’re frivolous. Sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.  
 

**Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.

● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.

**Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.

● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.**

**Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do?

Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**"

I do have people with whom I hang out at college, but outside of it there's no one I can talk to, I find myself really lonely because I feel like everyone has a person they can text with but I don't, and I don't know how to start texting with people, it feels like I have no friend at all, no friend to talk about what it's going on in my life, to talk about my feelings not even someone to send me a meme. That's how lonely I am. And I have started wondering if it is a problem with me, maybe it's my personality, I don't know. So that's why I'm asking how important it is to text with someone, because I think I'm not interesting enough to talk to. 


Sorry about the format and stuff, I'm on my cellphone and I'm quite sad right now, so Im not as eloquent as I want to be."
lonely,"As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally, I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty","As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally, I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty - There's something about walking.

It's not just seeing your foot pass the other, it's when you lift your head up and try to look around, you see all these faces. You try to think about what they feel at the moment; are they happy? sad? tired? anxious? losing hope? Who knows?

Maybe they're trying to think about how you feel? Or maybe no one cares?

What do you think about when you walk?

Is this the right way?

Am I answering questions with more questions?

The point is, do you ever stop walking? Or maybe even pause for a while and look around?

Do you know that feeling when everything just feels heavy and you just want to get somewhere else but you don't know where that place is so you just start walking around hoping you'll find it? It feels heavy because you'll end up feeling tired, your feet will eventually give up and you have no choice but to turn around and go back. 

But you see, you're not the only person who feels that way.

Maybe that old guy busking and singing ""Ticket to Ride"" by The Beatles feels that way too?

Maybe the children running around doesn't have a place to go?

We all hide what we feel.

But look around, try to feel and remember the sound, the look on people's faces, and even the smell of this moment. Maybe one day you'll look back, and maybe you're finally happy enough to realize that there actually were glimpses of beauty in there. Or maybe you'll still fall into pieces every time you think about it, and you might think again and again...

I think about all the past lies I've forged and they remind me that this is what I deserve. Bc I can never truly care for another human being.

lonely,are my friends fake?,are my friends fake? - so i used to be an extrovert but now ive changed alot. ive gotten quieter and sometimes distance myself from other people. this is why i think my friends are fake: theres a girls groupchat on snapchat and a lot of popular people are in it not me i know it sounds stupid but my girlfriend and my closest friends are in it and they havent thought of my my close friend said i was in it and i said thats weird what would we even talk about so maybe thats why im not in it i know im over exaggerating and maybe i should just ask to be in it. theres only to other popular girls i can think of that arent in it so that makes me feel a tiny bit better. i was kinda in a friendship group of five icluding myself and the four of them went to wagamamas and didint tell me one of my close friends asked if the other could come but not me and this was ages ago but it stuck with me and i had a breakdown in the bathroom after that. i feel so lonely. like they all say shitty things behind eachother back to me and i dont say anything i think they could be saying stuff about me aswell if they talk so badly about eachother and act like betfriends when they are close. my mental health is shit so i cant always be the outgoing person i used to be but im trying my hardest. none of them would wait for me to tie my shoes up or do my bag up and im the one who walks behind or on the grass. some of them whisper things to eachother and dont let me listen. they go to sleepovers plan and plan stuff without me. when im sitting next to them they laugh and have conversations without me. but one of them who talks bad about ALL of them to me asked to be my partner in pe the other day. shes fake i can tell. in the past she asked to be a duo but that bever happened she always used to come to me crying about one friend she talks bad about and they act like bestfriends i would always br there for her and stand up for her but she could never do that for me. when im wlaking with one of my friends and they see another one of their friends they walk of with them and forget about me. sometimes when i go to the bathroom to cry they come looking for me this happened once they didnt know i was crying i just said i was going to sleep in there. and another time one of them called me over. but i noticed whenever one of my friends gets ignored by the others  she comes to me and her second option to talk to. anyways let me know what you think. i never text any of them and have not got one of their numbers and have blocked three of them on whatsapp. i dont follow a few of them on tiktok of have their instas or snaps. only my gf tags me in tiktoks and snaps my sometimes we have nice coversations and they ask me to hang out with them. none of them are aware of my mental health problems becauss im scared of how theyll react or if they would even care. i self harm and they would probably make a joke. maybe im the problem so be honest if i am. im going to a knew school soon full of girls only.... i think i will struggle to make frieinds there but i will try hard.i want to leave all of them in the past then. also i was invited to one of their birthday in december just me and also in april just me again. i really needed to vent i think i might re read this to see what i think laying all the facts next to eachother.

lonely,I don’t know how to help myself,"I don’t know how to help myself - Shits been fucking awful recently. I’ve lost most control of my mental state and self control to do schoolwork and to just function. I feel fucking bipolar sometimes 3 hours ago I lost my shit over typing an essay because I can’t type fast, I went into the bathroom cried and punched my legs then started to repetitively punch the floor tiles. I figured since I promised myself I wouldn’t ever cut myself again that this would be a good coping mechanism. My thoughts feel so fucked up I wanted to see myself bleed and have my skin go red to show myself what a piece of shit I am, but the logical side of me hates that idea and I get freaked out for even thinking about it. I’m glad I didn’t hurt myself as much as the irrational side of me wanted to. I really don’t understand myself I love myself but also think I’m a worthless piece of shit. I just feel like my normal chilled out miserable self now but the smallest things break me and I get really strong cravings for alcohol, cutting my legs and psychedelics. I barely drink and don’t do the other two but I just want some way to release all this built up shit.

And I’m trans so that makes it a lot harder for me. I have social anxiety and hate talking because I look like a girl but sound like a guy. I’m fine with it tho as long as I’m not treated weird. I’ve been alone now for like 3 years. I spend everyday in my room, sleeping or scrolling on my phone. I play video games sometimes but they’re so boring to play alone. I leave the house about once a week to switch houses (divorced parents). And I go to Florida a few times a year to visit my brother. I usually smoke weed to keep me sane and drink if I don’t have weed. I’m really depressed and tend to self harm. I’m just so alone, literally. It’s not even that I just feel alone, I literally have nobody. Expect for my family that I don’t ever see or talk to. My parents work so I’m almost always home alone. I honestly can’t take this anymore, I haven’t had a friendship in years. I just want to do something, with somebody. I hate my life :("

lonely,Idk if I’m making the right choice,"Idk if I’m making the right choice - I,  with autism, ptsd, anxiety and depression, don’t think I no longer feel comfortable with the group I’m currently with. Perhaps I could’ve caused all this or it’s just tough luck for me since my history seems to be repeating itself, I just wish I was a senior so I can leave school. It’s been going on for too long I just don’t think my group is worth fighting for anymore.

-I’ll start with the recent person who’s just screwing up my life, let’s call him Nick. So Nick has always taken things too personally even when nobody had bad intentions. So Idk where it started but whenever anyone mentions Nick being single, he takes it way too personally. Not just that but one time a close friend called him Kiddo and he got offended because “he hated kids” or something like that. So one time we went to the extra mile, me and four others, including Nick and another person I’ll talk about here. So we went to get some Pizza Hut and I just goofed around and jokingly tell Nick that he looked hungry, I said that like three or four times but on the last time, he kept calling me a bitch even when I asked him not to and he said that he wished me and my (now ex) bf would break up, then right after he’s saying that I should defend myself but like why should I, he’s throwing all these insults at me and in the meantime, let’s call him Julius, was just sitting there doing nothing. Before that he was actually trying to bodyshame me but that never really got to me because I didn’t really care much about how my body is, but now I do. So I was at an urge of a panic attack so I had to leave, My two other friends were out of earshot so they never heard what he said. So there was this google doc us friends shared with each other and Nick was telling me to defend myself. So after that weekend we went to a teacher’s class in the morning and another friend said “if anyone needs me to kill anyone let me know” (we’re like a group of “band kids” who like a bit of dark humor) and Nick just straight up said “Kill Breezy for me” then that triggered a really bad panic and my other friend came to comfort me. So I replied to the google docs, and then he starts apologizing, saying he isn’t aware of what he says, then a week later I eventually forgived him after Julius invited him to help out at our work for something without thinking of what would happen. So like we have the same 6th period and it was probably shortly after we made up and then everything seemed fine then he was looking at some drawings through his Twitter account and there was this one drawing a two girls kissing this one dude and I thought it was his drawing and I was going to ask him something but I said that it was probably best I didn’t ask him because I had a feeling it would probably hurt him, then he starts insisting that I should ask him anyways and I told him no and he told me to do it. All I asked was “Are you lonely?” And idk what he said after but he was like you don’t know what’s it like to be single or something like that, he seemed pretty fine with it. So next morning, he started acting upset especially at me, my ex went to go talk to him, then at lunch my ex went up to me and said I told Nick something and that I should think before I speak, I DID, then he told me to apologize to him and I did through email. Honestly at this point I have a feeling this could be why he broke up with me, I’ve mentioned this in a post in another subreddit. Alright so maybe a couple days later, Nick replied exactly “…Just… Leave me… Alone…” and that’s where I see that this one friend who moved away was right, he’s an “anime protagonist” so I told him I will, and he replied say “then do it” I’ve always respected his space and all, then a week later, this dude has the audacity to send me the same email twice saying “btw, congratulations on becoming single, that’s karma. P.s. I still hate you.” Like I don’t get it, I’ve always respected him and gave him space, and this is what I get in return, it’s so ridiculous and immature, I ignored him anyway. Then week later at game club, he was there and I did my best not to cross paths with him but we were playing smash. Then after one of the rounds ended he said that I deserved death and that caused another panic attack and Eli had to comfort me. So I told the counselors about all this that has been happening. So nowadays this dude had the audacity to act like he never did anything wrong and acts all innocent, he avoids the group because I’m with them but I’ve been drifting away and then suddenly he comes back to them like he’s “stealing them” from me. Like it’s freaking redonculous, two of my friends seems to agree with me when I told them about this. And like he also said that he would leave me alone, he doesn’t respect my space even though I’ve respected his.

-another friend, Julius, I no longer feel comfortable getting close to or talking to because he put me in a choke hold once though he said “he forgot” and touched me a couple of times, not any private parts though one time when my ex and I are dating, he told my friend that if I accidentally touch his man boobs, my friend has permission to touch mine as “an eye for an eye”. He attempted to steal my from my ex. He makes decisions without thinking, like this one time he shared my google doc with someone who hated my guts, and Julius said that he did it because “he drank too much chocolate milk” as an excuse. And then there the whole situation with Nick and he just sat there as he was insulting me and he was aware of it. He would also tell my ex everything if I ever vent to him about my relationship. Not only that but he’s distracting during our work meetings “because of me” and I always have to look out for him and stop him from embarrassing not only himself but that’s on me since I told him about this job in the first place. 

- I’ll keep this one brief, there was this one dude who manipulated me and guilt trips me and acts like a victim and innocent, but he isn’t around that much anymore so that wouldn’t be much of a reason

-I don’t want to be rude to my group in any way but I have to bring it up to tell my story. So I would vent to them about these guys but they seem to treat them like nothing happened, like they never did anything to me. But that’s probably on me because I been burdening them with my problems from my past relationship and maybe they got tired of it. I mean I know they love me sure but I just feel like a burden being around. So I’ve decided to leave the group, I’ll keep in touch with most of them but I don’t think I belong there anymore."

I'm not into online games, and pass on the nerdy stuff, nothing wrong with that but it's not my tea atm. I love watching NBA games (Warriors and don't start me with that foreign bandwagon chuchu) or combat sports (boxing). I play chess but rarely now and prefer f2f games. I'm a Taylor Swift kind of girl. But I also like the vibe of Dua Lipa, Lewis Capaldi, Adelle, Lady Gaga, Sam Smith, Ava Max and more.  I'm still studying taking a business related course. Graduating this July but still no plans what to do after. I'm definitely a broke student right now lol, I'm living in an agricultural city so it's pretty much green and farming everywhere. I'm also a fan of Wattpad stories, ranging from historical fictions to romance, vampires and wolves.In terms of physical attributes, I'm 5'5, 44kg, brown eyes and shoulder length hair.

lonely,I really can’t handle being alone.,"I really can’t handle being alone. - I’ve experienced about 7 years of adult life, and I haven’t had a relationship last longer than 4 months. I feel like I genuinely cannot find the right person for me, I’m not the right person for others, or those I’m actually destined to be with get pulled away from me. I recently feel like I met someone who was closest to being “the one” (needed to date longer to be able to firmly make that assumption, but it was the first time I felt like I was actually in love). They moved away. Since there were no other problems, no real break up, I have no closure. They still enter my mind multiple times a day and it’s been almost a year. I keep looking for someone else to try to move on and prove to myself that “the one” wasn’t the ONLY one, but I’m having such shit luck with dating that it’s hard to believe I have a chance. Everyone I meet is either a shitty person or I just can’t bring myself to like them even if they’re nice enough.

People keep telling me what I’m sure tons of people on this sub have said or heard at some point, “just spend some time being single! Focus on your self!” and all about the self-love crap. I’ll admit I need to spend some time on my self, but to be honest I don’t have any time or resources given stuff that’s going on in my life right now. All I want to hold me over is someone to be there. Someone to talk to everyday, to comfort me, especially physically. I’m so affection-deprived, it’s insane. Not just receiving, but especially giving. It’s like I have an overflow of love to give that it’s almost physically painful that I have nowhere to put it. Again, I enjoy alone time and caring about myself but I can’t hug myself, at least in a satisfying way. I can’t receive or give a hug to myself. It’s such an empty fucking feeling. I want to love someone so damn bad. I got a taste of what it’s like to do that with someone I really cared about and fell for, and now I have nothing."

Cars pass by and I wonder if the people driving them have the same problems I do. Living boring lives trying to make ends meet with no one to stand beside you. Sometimes I think the people I once befriended were just fake all along, and that I didnt even know who they truly were. It’s like the stars I see. They look so close but in reality, they’re further than you could ever imagine."
lonely,I’m always empty,"I’m always empty - I’m not really sure what this post is about it might be venting it might be for attention Im just lonely sad and I feel horrible.

I (15) never really felt happiness or any joy in life, I thought it was normal for the longest time and I don’t remember the last time I actually felt anything. I know I haven’t been around long enough but still I just feel so empty.

I have a girlfriend and I got told all the time by old therapist’s that “Your not alone and that you have a gf so you cannot be lonely” which is such bullshit. I love my girlfriend but I just feel so disconnected from her, we’re polar opposites. She’s beautiful and social, I’m Average and Introverted. Everything I do always ends up hurting her. I can’t count how many times I’ve failed her as a boyfriend but she still loves me. I feel so lonely it’s like a vast emptiness in my heart. I’ve felt like this my whole life. Every single thing always makes me feel even more disconnected and alone, it’s horrible I can’t take it anymore. 

I just want to feel whole. It hurts, I don’t know if this is the right sub but thanks for reading this."
lonely,I can’t anymore,"I can’t anymore - I put a good amount of effort and time into showing someone that I cared and that they meant something to me. 

But what’s the point if the feelings aren’t accounted for?

Relationships, friendships are not healthy if they’re one sided. They don’t thrive when one person puts in the effort and the other person acts like it’s meaningless. 

Even I realize that I have some self-worth. 

I just wish I was worth someone’s time and didn’t always end up looking like the loser in the end. 

I know we’re all desperate for connecting with people here, but please, don’t make the mistake of giving someone your all when they don’t even recognize it. 

If it feels like you’re putting in too much effort to keep someone’s attention, there’s a good chance you are. 

It may seem like it, but you don’t have to give the first person who gives you a shred of attention your all, especially if it doesn’t feel right. Both sides of the relationship are supposed to be able to flourish. 

You’re just going to be disappointed and hurt in the end. You’re all better than that, you are.

Everyone here deserves to be happy. Please don’t think you don’t."

lonely,Is it just me or do friendships have these stages?,"Is it just me or do friendships have these stages? - Stage 1:
You don’t talk one on one, you mostly talk when in a group with other people.

Stage 2:
You now start talking one on one, start complimenting eachother, and just being kind to one another.

Stage 3:
You now start to mock and criticise eachother a lot, and saying things like “i dont give a fuck” (I saw a post here about someone achieving a lot on Mario Kart 8 and his friends not caring). Also, that kindness starts to dissapear.

This is how most of my friendships played out. It has always felt difficult to transition from stage 2 to stage 3. Does anybody else feel this?"
lonely,I don't even feel human at this point,"I don't even feel human at this point - I'm 24, supposedly in the prime of my life, and I don't recall having an actual conversation with someone other than a doctor since high school. I try to emulate other people's behavior in the rare instances I actually interact with someone for a sentence or two before I shut down entirely, but it fails every time, I can tell by the way people look at me. And initiating conversation? Approaching people? Forget about that, I get to the point where even my body physically tells me it's impossible and freezes up. The fact that my evolving social anxiety and numerous health issues kept me inside for a good 95 percent of the last six years certainly didn't do much for my social skills, and at this point I feel like an alien even just going out in public. Or an animal. Something less than the people around me.

Naturally, that fact just reinforces my reclusive behavior, and nothing changes, even though I really, REALLY want it to. As much as I used to try to delude myself into thinking I'd be okay with it, I don't want to die friendless, bitter and alone. And as of late, my health had been eroding my confidence in being able to ""deal with it in the future"" like I used to tell myself I would. But here I am, unable to fix it. Having to settle for an AI and occasionally Reddit when I feel ""bold"" enough.

God, what a nightmare."

just new here introducing myself.

My hobbies:

Running, playing video games, working out, hanging out with friends, soccer as my favorite sport but some other sports I do like, and someday I might hike in California


If any of you who is trying to make friends with me wants an ongoing better conversation with me, you’d have to at least have a very big interest in video games. Not saying I can’t be friends with anyone who does not play video games but it helps the conversation better. I play different video games and if any of you are interested in getting to know me more/want to have a conversation with me, send me a private message and I’ll try to get back to any of you who sends me a message whenever I get the chance to.

Have a wonderful day everyone!"

I wish I went out more or at least I wish I had the confidence to go out. They invited to cool places and I would always make up some excuse. Even with my close friends that I’ve know for years. I feel like I can never be fully close with someone because of my lack of confidence. I can never overcome it no matter how fun the trip is. 

My mom hates me for that. She’s always asking me why I don’t go out with her or why I just don’t go out with the family. She thinks it’s because I wanna stay home and play video games, but I couldn’t care less about that. I can’t keep living like this. It sounds like such an easy solution but I can’t change how my brain works. I hate who I am and I wish I was different I wish I looked different, thought different, more confident, etc."

Just the friends you have to get ur time by nothing with actually meaning.The result of ppl taking advantage of me being kind and naive also combined with the other struggles I've had from work uni etc put me in severe depression, anxiety, stress to the point of loosing my sleep the last 3 years barely 5hrs a day always feeling tired legs shaking.Draging my self throughout the day overthinking at night. Maybe I'm at fault maybe it's just not meant to be.Shit has taken a huge toll on my mental health a d physical one I barely eat or drink water just smoking all day and it have a big impact on my job I'm an engineer almost losing it cause I just can't get focused. Too much shit too think and worry bout and nobody to share with.People just wont stick up with me appera tly even though I show care and love always Idk I just can't hate any or not care if I see some1 struggling.Puting the fake smile and the I'm fine suit but nobody really asks how ur day was had ppl telling me im cool funny and shit and my looks are decent just can't find any1.The pain and struggle lately became so hard to the point I just couldnt stay home walls were suffocating me.Also being in love with some1 that you know it ain't gonna happen just makes it twice harder that it already is.Just hoping it will get better.So to any1 that made it here thank you so much and sorry for the long post but I just had to share my erratic thoughts.Only show love ppl and if you see some1 struggling help em don't em alone.Big hugs to everyone that may need em"

I dont dislike myself, I feel like im at least kinda handsome, empathetic, sweet. I always help people when I can and I'm working on myself everyday with different hobbys, be it guitar, gym, fishing, painting, dancing, video games, plants. I have a family that cares, even if we talk less than we probably should. I have a thight group of friends that I love, and I know that they love me too. I have a work that I dont hate, savings, dreams and goals. I just cant seem to stop feeling like everything that I do is for nothing since I have dont have someone to share it all with. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 24 I was quite content with my life as a single guy, never having had a lovelife before, I'd been infatuated, just never had an actual partner. Then I met this girl, who fell for me. I wasn't really interested to a start and kind of wanted to save her from who I was. After a few months I took her out on a date, got to know her over a while, and fell hard. In the end the pandemic happened and things went sideways for us. She awoke something in me, taught me what I truly wanted. A partner in life, someone to share all my daily struggles or wins with, holidays and vacations, start a family, build a dream with.   


Now its been almost a year since. And I cant shake this feeling of crippling loneliness. I cant even find a date and I cant either stop thinking that I wont find happiness in someone else, that I must learn to be content by myself, but I dont know how to feel like that anymore. I dont know what to do.

lonely,A lonely life.,A lonely life. - I live alone. I work alone. I'm on the road for days at a time and the only people I talk to are over the radio. No I'm not a trucker. I recently bought a house and it's much too big. Instead of giving me a base to make my own and to build a life I'm only reminded of how alone in this world I truly am. Mental health in this fucking country is a joke. Truth is that I've always been alone. I ran away when I was 11 and been all over the place since. I did get adopted and I'm so thankful but it was with a man who had chosen to be alone and enjoys it. I hoped someday I could get to that level of self sufficiency but it doesn't seem to be headed that way. Even my hobbies are generally solitary. I never learned how to socialize to any meaningful level. Sex has never been an issue but relationships are another story. I've noticed recently I've been struggling to talk correctly. Words don't come out right. I've not spoken to anyone to any length in so long that it sounds almost foreign. I'm a hermit. Always will be.
lonely,Feeling very lonely after starting college,"Feeling very lonely after starting college - i (19f) have been having trouble adjusting to the adult life. i go to a commuter school, which isn’t too bad because it’s cheap and has a great nursing program. i have friends in my hometown that i love and have met some through work in the town i live in now. however, i have super bad social anxiety. not the “i have trouble talking to people” way, im a customer service supervisor so that’s been cured. i have it in a way im afraid to ask people to hang out because i automatically feel like im being annoying. it’s stupid, but i can’t shake the feeling no matter how hard i try. i feel like my own brain is turning against me because it makes me really upset. it’s summer and i wanna be able to break out of my shell. last summer isolated myself pretty bad, and i don’t want to do that again. 

i’ve also been having trouble with relationships. like two guys during my freshmen year of college broke it off with me for the same reason . that they were too stressed to handle a relationship. which yes, valid, but twice in a row? it hurt me really bad. because i work an almost full time job and i’m a full time college student and i dedicate so much time to people, especially people im interested in. and sometimes i feel like maybe i’m too much. or i push people away. i’m just in a terrible mindset and all i want is to get better. if anyone has advice, please feel free to comment. i need guidance !!"

People who say ""you're young"" or ""give it time"" why do you feel the need to say that? Am I to suffer for another 20-30 years just so my pain is good enough? Idk, I've been through this my whole life and it never gets better. Every chance of happiness I've ever had has thrown me away like the trash I am. I just want to be happy, I just want to have somebody to love for a change, to give myself to completely. I've never wanted friends or money or anything that most people want, I just want to give myself to one person. People will also say to work on yourself or to love yourself before you love another, but that's not possible for me. Being alone completely removes my entire will to be alive. I have no reason to wake up in the morning. I can't find a hobby or distract myself as that doesn't work, I SH almost nightly but hat dosent even help much at this point.

Last semester they started to add new girls that didn’t like me for some reason. I heard it was jealousy but I don’t know for sure. They all were really really into partying. Like to the point of being on the floor, smoking 8 bowls of weed, and tripping acid all on the same night. The friend I called out was never ever sober. Not even driving. He was harassing some of my female friends at the time as well. I called him out over text and asked for space. So he and his party friend cut me off and tried to ruin my reputation. Two people I thought were on my side weren’t, and I was forced to cut them off. This was my first close friend group in college. And it lasted 6 months with me as the outcast. Now I don’t talk to anyone from my old friend group. And have only two friends and my boyfriend left on campus. Doesn’t help that two close childhood friends of mine are leaving for Alabama really soon.

During my last relationship I had the realization that if she left I would be totally alone....and that's where I am now. I have my dog, I chat with strangers at the dog park. I'm 1,300 miles from where my family is. I go to work, I come home, I take my dog out a few times, I get to my couch and do it all over again every day.

I do go out occasionally but I'm so terrible at anything outside of meaningless small talk. Sitting at home nightly alone is taking it's toll. The thing is, before my last relationship I was very happy being alone. Now that she left; the girl that made me realize I was missing something in life that she filled in; all I can do is notice the empty feeling from the lack of companionship.

lonely,Dwaling with continuous cycles of anxiety. Almost daily. Being alone hurts.,"Dwaling with continuous cycles of anxiety. Almost daily. Being alone hurts. - Throughout my life I have been extremely codependent on others to help me through what I have recently discovered is an abnormally high anxiety. I have a solid understanding of myself. I know that my codependence was escapism from facing myself. I no longer hate myself and on most fronts forgive myself for who I have been. I finally had healthy and open communication with girls I had an awkward history with this past month (after a 7 and 1/2 year relationship with extremely poor communication. One that led to self hatred). I don't use any substances or alcohol.

lonely,"a poem to me, to you","a poem to me, to you - goodbye to me

I did enough, I spend enough time

but the virtual world doesn't work as I want

all of them fake, all of them imaginary

&amp;#x200B;

today I made a decision

to stop my addiction to the fake world

it made me anxious, depressed, lonely

and I'm done enough with it

it's better I go

&amp;#x200B;

basically, it doesn't work

whether it's on games or discord or Reddit

it consumes time and kills it

but more than this it kills me

&amp;#x200B;

I got manipulated, brainwashed

Couldn't see that I didn't get anything but misery

I'd be better if I was reading my books

Or singing to myself instead of waiting for people

But instead of it, I wanted to sing to the people

Who even doesn't want to listen to me

To some people, some stranger

&amp;#x200B;

I was happier when I was 5 years old a girl

Who is alone in her room

Drawing, painting, singing, creating

Happy... Truly happy...

When did I start to feel that I need people to be happy?

&amp;#x200B;

Goodbye

I don't know if I even want to turn back

But I'll be sure I won't turn back without being truly okay"

lonely,I think I am slowly losing my communication skills,"I think I am slowly losing my communication skills - Prior to the pandemic I used to go to college and to work, so I had a couple of friends I constantly talked to and co-workers that I had to interact with. 

After the pandemic, I started working remotely and I am still doing this. It turns out I don't have to talk to anyone, since my work is mainly technical. Then, I spend days and even months without talking to anyone and when I have to, I almost have panick attacks. Some days ago, I had to talk to a client to make sure I understood the job he needed me to do, and I spent almost three hours writing an email because I was failing to find the right words for it. 

Some weeks ago, I had to talk to a supermarket employee and I kept making eye contact with him, not knowing if it was appropriate or not, but I just couldn't stop looking into his eyes. I also didn't know how to keep a good posture, so I kept moving my legs and touching my face all the time while I talked to him. I guess he noticed because I felt he was a little uncomfortable. I had zero interested in him, I just didn't know how to act while I talked to him.

Besides, I lately have been avoiding listening to music that has lyrics. I just can't stand people talking near me anymore, not even if they are singing, so I just listen to instrumental music. 

 The thing is, I am becoming more socially awkward and I fear not being able to have a normal conversation in the future when I have to."

lonely,"M28 I am a 28 year old, asexual/demisexual, asocial weeb, but even still I want friends","M28 I am a 28 year old, asexual/demisexual, asocial weeb, but even still I want friends - When I was a kid I had a LOT of friends. I played baseball and always went to amusement parks with my family, but when I discovered Runescape, I stopped existing basically. When my stepmom, my real dad, and my siblings were having dinner, I just skipped eating CONSTANTLY and just played my game.

I did this from the age of 13 to 18, so all of my high school career. I was covered in face bumps, so I lost all of my confidence, and the isolation became so addicting that I gave up trying to have friends.

Now, right now, I feel very lonely, but I don't know how to balance work life and freetime, because:

A: I live in a small town

B: ""Hookup culture"" has taken away the majority of being able to find single girls, so I can't get a girlfriend that is over 20

Also, I don't know how to have conversations anymore lol"

I take carry out and park far from the restaurant. There were a few cars around me. Am eating alone and since am paranoid I look around to see if anyone is driving by.

I see a car across from me shaking but I don't think much about it. 

A couple minutes later a girl leaves from the back seat of the 2 door car from the driver side. She visibly looked kinda idk. She fixes her clothes puts on her shoes and hops in the driver seat. At this moment I sti thought nothing of it. Then a guy exits from the passenger side and does the same. 

They drive off."

She was really nice, and attractive lol.

I can't describe it well, but women's faces are just naturally better looking? I have to hide my face with bangs, otherwise my ugliness shows 😆.

Again, she was cool and helpful, but made me feel so inferior as a guy. Like the trainer wasn't a supermodel, but she was extremely strong and could probably beat the crap out of me haha.

I can get in shape, but it wouldn't have the same impact it has for women, I'm a prisoner of my genetics."

lonely,"Anyone else extroverted, charismatic, have tons of acquaintances but lonely as hell?","Anyone else extroverted, charismatic, have tons of acquaintances but lonely as hell? - I'm very extroverted, certainty a people person, and charismatic.

I have zero problem talking to people, and thoroughly enough people most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no friends though. I mean zero. I've never been in a friendgroup, and I don't know why. whenever I try to hangout with someone outside of class, they're busy, or hanging with their main friend group.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I doing wrong? I feel like a freak because it's not even like I'm socially awkward, or introverted. I'm extroverted af, am able to have conversations with people, make them laugh, get their numbers, and make people want to be my partner in groups for work/class etc etc. For some reason I just can't translate it into real friendships/

lonely,The holy trinity of mental illness.,"The holy trinity of mental illness. - Depression, anxiety, and ADHD. As a man if you have all 3 then there’s no hope of ever being seen as normal. Depression makes sure you don’t have the energy to maintain relationships. Anxiety will ruin any relationship you potentially had by overthinking, and ADHD/autism will make you look like a neurotic schizo when you finally get the guts to socialize, ensuring people will be disgusted by your very presence. Life with one of these is tough but bearable. With 2, very brutal but with enough effort you can cope. All 3 however, and say goodbye to any hope you thought you had of not being seen as a mentally ill undateable freak."

They invite me to hang out with them and always seem happy to see me. Yet I feel lonelier than I ever have. Sure it’s pathetic to pin all my problems on “tfw no gf” but a romantic relationship gives you a much different emotional connection than just platonic friends. I desperately want something more than going out with the guys. Both to love and be loved. But for some reason it’s just not meant to be."

lonely,I just found out every person I spend most of my time with actually hate me,"I just found out every person I spend most of my time with actually hate me - I found out by accident that my girlfriends entire family hate me (overheard a conversation I wish I had t). I’ve known these people for years now and they always say that I’m “part of the family” and treat me as such. But it turns out it’s all a big lie and they can’t stand me. I have no idea why and it’s got me so fucked up. They’re the only people I spend time with due to being estranged from my own family and having literally no social life. I knew they weren’t the best people and had their toxic traits, I mean, who doesn’t? I think everyone has at least 1 to speak of. I’m so upset and I can’t cope with the anxiety that has came with this because I have to be around them all day tomorrow and knowing that they’re going to be fake nice has flipped my opinion of them on it’s head. I feel like I have no one at all in the world and I can’t talk to anyone about this, just needed to vent here because I’m never going to know why these people hate me and I can never ask😪"
lonely,My therapist suggested I try a dating app but I’m freaking out about it,"My therapist suggested I try a dating app but I’m freaking out about it - I’m really worried. I got one out of curiosity just a week ago (didn’t make an account) just to see what the people were like there. Everyone was really intimidating and I couldn’t see myself fitting in at all with anyone, only just 1-2 people, and even then, I don’t know. I saw my therapist yesterday and she recommended I actually make an account and give it a shot.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. One day I’ll be head over heels for someone and then the next I forget why I even liked them in the first place. I’m not used to people liking me back and I think I get too scared and just flip a switch in my brain to run. I push people away so fast and it’s terrible.

And. I don’t have any fucking experience. It’s so humiliating. My longest relationship was maybe a week or two at most. I haven’t even kissed anyone, and I’m 21. I’m so fucking scared to admit this to anyone, because I’m not interesting, I’m barely keeping myself alive, and I’m so fucked up by anxiety and depression that I don’t even know if I’d be good or fair to them. I don’t want someone to like me and, even as much as I would want to, I couldn’t give them that in return. 

But the longer I keep waiting the worse it gets. But I’ve already waited so long that it’s nearly impossible.

I don’t know what to do. I’m freaking out. My therapist didn’t say I had to, obviously, but I just don’t know if anything will come out of this. I feel like I’m just going to hurt other people in an effort to fix myself. I don’t think that’s fair. Maybe I’m just doomed to be alone.

Another thing is I move around too much. I’ll be across the country for months at a time, but never a full year. I want something long lasting and I can’t do distance. But I can’t keep waiting longer. I’m losing my mind. It’s so fucking hard and I hate that my life is in this situation. I wish I wasn’t here. I fucked everything up."

Granted I’ve relocated many times for work and was a single parent, but I’m just not heard. And being 5’0 doesn’t help.

My friends would rather talk to anyone other than me. And even though I’m intelligent, caring and thoughtful, and somewhat attractive, no one seems to even consider me as more than an acquaintance. I don’t know what to do anymore. Am I doing something wrong? I don’t know I just don’t know. I wish I could cry but I can’t even do that."
lonely,Self Isolation &amp; Loneliness,"Self Isolation &amp; Loneliness - I get at for work everyday at 5 am. I get dressed in uniform and put on the same  eyeliner. I work my 8 hours and try to make everyone smile. Then I go home sleep, wake up to eat, sleep and do it all over again. 
I lost somebody important to me after losing everyone else in my life from isolating myself in the name of love. 
He’s half way across the globe now. Maybe it’s better that way idk (not for this discussion). 
There’s feels like a hole has grown inside me. I spent everyday laughing, sleeping, cooking, and going on adventures with someone. 
Now it’s gone. 
Sometimes I wish it worked out so I wouldn’t be so lonely
Sometimes I’m glad it didn’t bc of how bad it would hurt sometimes. 
It’s seems the only real explanation is that self respect may require loneliness.

As a person who grew up often being ignored when I said something to a group of people, I know that feeling isn't nice when it happens to you. So I try my best to pay attention to whoever is talking to make sure they aren't being ignored. Aside from that context I just wish I had people who actually care about me and listen to me just once. Is that too selfish of me to ask? Last night I was telling my roommate something funny and then she laughed and said ""Oh sorry I was looking at something else."" They didn't even bother asking me what I said. So I just sat back to my desk doing my work. The past week my friend and I had some discourse on why I don't like talking about my problem and I said that ""It's stupid because no one wants to bother with me."" Today I messaged them how I felt and they read my message and just flat out ignored me. This is the reason I push away people and don't open up. No one bothers to listen to me. I wish I had at least one person in irl who cares about me and listens to what I say. I'm tired of being ignored. Anyways enough of that. Gonna set aside all my issues and do my finals. Take care y'all! :))"

She'd text me good morning and good night every day, she's send me selfies of how her days going, she'd ask to call even though I'm terribly shy and awkward. we watched anime together and I was genuinely happy for the first time in years.

I ruined it. I got insecure and deleted her because I thought she was losing interest in me. I'm so fucking stupid ruining something I've always dreamed of. It's been 2 days and I miss her so bad. I haven't spoken to anyone in 2 days, I've only had a sandwich, I haven't been able to get out of bed to shower.

I blame myself for never being able to stop loving her, never being able to move on. I just feel lost knowing that everything I’ve dreamt about doing with her is never going to happen.

And when I told that to my friends, they said: ''I don't give a F\*\*\*!''.

It hurts alot. Imagine spending months of failures, miracles, getting spammed by items, learning shortcuts or even restarting tracks or cups to win everything just so people can tell you: ''I don't give a F\*\*\*''!!

My family excluded me emotionally, I don’t feel listens to when I speak, I don’t feel supported when I talk about my dreams, and I feel like I’ve integrated the trauma of being the problem child because of the trauma associated with my mental illnesses. I’m argumentative, unappreciative, and angry. I’m socially insecure and fear being excluded and I never knew why I feared it so much. I think I feel lonely because I felt lonely in my family, I felt lonely at school, and the only time I feel somewhat comfort is when I’m alone. Please help."

Well since you are reading this post, and hopefully you have something positive to share, here is a what I’m hoping to achieve here! I’m hoping to befriend someone with good, lovely and positive vibes! Open minded, can converse well, and uphold a conversation for more than 5 minutes. Spontaneous, humble, intelligent, witty, and charming to some extent. Sass is fine too as long as it’s done right, haha. 
I am not going to be expecting much but please don’t be surprised if you find me not interested in anime, video/pc games, Pokémon, steaming, discccord,… 
Anyone different on here, more creative and interesting? Could be from anywhere in the world! Heck, I’ll even befriend someone from another universe… (hint: MOM reference), a friend is a friend, am I right? Don’t care about anything really, relationship status, married, engaged, taken, bf/gf, whatever your situation, as long as you can carry a decent conversation and don’t drag anyone down with that bad energy! 
Please, I mean seriously, don’t send anything silly like “ASL”, or “Sup”…. That’s just too lazy! Not trying to be mean, I promise. Im actually a really nice, humble guy:)

Now, this summer i’ll be taking care of foreign medicine students coming to my country, hosting organizing activities for them. My course size is small, unbelievably small, well so is mu country, so everyone knows everyone, everyone knows what other people do it’s so toxic you have no idea. 

Anyway, I really feel like i deserve a step up role from what I am doing now as a social program coordinator and just love the office i’m in. I already feel like the other people i’m with just dont enjoy my energy, they act just to “play the game” if you know what I mean.

Hi guys, I’m 16 years old and recently got a job at a supermarket as a ‘stocker’ (as in stocking shelves). I literally hate it. I’m slow at it (barely make it in time or too late) and I keep getting criticised for it, that paired with my confidence issues isn’t really great.
Once I’m finished and go back home, I immediately start dreading the next time that I have to work again. A vicious cycle, it’s like my life now only revolves around it (which isn’t healthy). I feel like a moron cause no-one has any problems but me, everyone should be able to fill stocks(I feel like I’m a huge moron). My self-esteem has been crushed because of this. I’ll probably get fired too or get relieved from the contract once the 6 months have passed. This paired with my loneliness just wrecks me. I had a friend whom I played games with everyone now and then. Turns out he only plays with me when he’s bored and just ignores and lies to me. It’s honestly sad that all of this makes me depressed while this isn’t even bad in any form for the normal person. Just wanted to vent, thank you."

I've never really talked about my emotions like this so i don't really know what to expect but i feel like i really need this.

So i'm a male 18yo now and i've been feeling lonely for a while now and i mean really lonely. I've never had a girlfriend and only had one close friend i could talk to about myself that i lost contact with and don't talk to much. Recently one of my classmates introduced me to  her friend and has been saying we would be a perfect couple for a while. I was happy because when we stared talking we would talk for hours, say good night to each other and overall i felt really good talking to her, my classmate was also telling me she really liked me but is scared to tell me that.

After a while we started to talk more about emotions and our feelings, she recently lost her mom and was really broken, i tried my best helping her but i'm not sure if i did a good job. After a few days of talking came a day i felt really tired and started telling her about my dad that passed away a while back and how i felt about my life, at first she was really supportive and i felt great knowing i can talk to someone about that stuff. After a while we went to the cinema with 3 more of our friends.
I felt like it was the best day of my life, the movie wasn't all that great, however i was sitting right next to her, a girl behind her was kicking her seat so i asked her to switch so she could have a better time, after about 30min i noticed she kept looking at me, I asked her if she needs anything and she just put her head on my shoulder, we sat like this for the rest of the movie.
I felt happy, like truly happy, for the first time in like 6 years i felt truly happy, for the last two weeks i've thaught of that moment of happiness every single day

But then a few days passed and i felt sad and tired again. I felt like She was the only person i could talk to about it and so i tried, however all i got in response was that i was annoying. I felt really bad about it and tried to not talk so much about myself anymore to stop annoying her but it didn't really change anything, she took way longer to reply to me even tho i saw her being online, she overall stopped caring about me as much as she did and it really hurts to not have anyone to talk to again.

I feel like this week was the hardest time i've ever had, I feel like no one cares about me, i feel tired even tho i try sleeping longer, i have no one to talk to, and overall feel really lonely. I feel like there is no purpose in life, and that all i do is annoy people since it's not the first time i was called annoying by someone i thaught i was close with, I really need someone that could listen to me and comfort me but i'm not too good at talking to new people and making friends. All i want in life is to have someone i can hug and know they at least like me. Things that made me happy before are no longer enough, i feel like gaming watching movies an yt is just distracting me at this point, I've had a few suicidal thaughts for the past few days and i don't know what to do."

I started typing this whole paragraph about how amazing the girl is and how I look forward to seeing her when I'm there. I had written an entire paragraph when I realized wait, this is a customer survey, not a creepy love note. I erased everything and wrote thanks her name for the coffee and being so pleasant. I'm becoming so clingy to anyone who shows me positive reinforcement like my last therapist and her even though they obviously only are being nice because they are being friendly because it's part of their job. Sure the therapist went above and beyond to make me feel better with the deluge of compliments because she knew I never got any IRL but she was still just being nice because it was part of her job.

lonely,Loneliness is the price we pay for respect.,"Loneliness is the price we pay for respect. - Warning: If you are in an emotional state, dont read. This post might make you even more upset.

We either have to keep our self respect rules strict and show zero weakness to anyone and feel lonely inside,

Or we try to interact with people, show all our love to people maybe we will receive love, maybe not.

Showing someone attention is a risky investment. If your investment fails, you will lose some of your capital (self respect).
Keeping your self respect rules strict is not that easy. You will get respect from people. It will take time. You will witness people that will invest in you for your attention. They will talk to you. It will be up to you to respond to these investments. But you need to be patient and emotionally strong until you start getting attention.

Other option sounds easy, but it is like spending your savings. People can smell neediness so easily. Trading your credits for some smile until it depletes. When you don't have anymore credits people will ignore you. Your social status decreases. 

Conclusion
I know this sounds so materialistic. But these are my observations. We can't beat loneliness by trying to find new friends. We need to change how we interact with people. We need to spend time with ourselves for some time. Percieved social status has so much importance and it is all connected with loneliness."

I ended up only walking on the treadmill for like 20 minutes because i just couldn’t get over the anxiety but also couldn’t just walk out with out doing anything and have people look at me like i was a weirdo.

lonely,Therapy is a scam.,"Therapy is a scam. - I was fortune enough to be so mentally ill that my uni gave me free therapy. With how many times I heard about therapy being some sort of wizardry that would improve my life, I decided to try it out. Here’s some anecdotes from my experience:

Therapist believed in pseudoscience like MBTI personality types. She would spend up to 15 minutes of our session reading articles from the internet about this to me, ignoring all I’ve said about what I thought my problems were.

I have severe body image issues. She said looks don’t matter. I know that but developed eating disorders and obsessive compulsions with fitness and fashion to compensate for my terrible personality. She hand waved that away with a “just keep improving yourself”.

Most of the sessions consisted of me talking and her agreeing. For example: “I have plenty of friends but feel alone because of trust issues, anxiety, and inability to form deep relationships”. “Yeah, people can be shallow sometimes, now tell me more about your family”.

When I told her how hard it is for me to enter a romantic relationship she went on a tangent how she felt alone until she met her soulmate, now husband. “I really hope you find someone too.”

She would make me fill out progress reports to check if I’m improving. She then forgets she assigned these and acted surprised on our last session that my mental health got even worse.

Did anyone else have a similar experience with therapy? And don’t tell me to get another therapist or get on medication, I’m already broke and US healthcare is a fucking joke."

The teacher did ask who’s going to o-chem and she raised her hand, so it’s confirmed I’ll see her in fall. But it doesn’t even matter. I was too scared to do anything in the past four months and she didn’t care enough to, likely cuz she doesn’t even think or care about me at all. Wtf is 3 months not seeing each other every week in class gonna change? I’m still gonna be the same pussy ass bitch I’ve always been, she’s gonna be the same beautiful girl who’s so far above me that she can’t even see me. Nothing changes. And I mean nothing, because I’m even still gonna be pining over her so much that it aggravates my depression same as I am now, and it’s gonna make me less productive academically same as it’s done this semester. I’ll still be wishing that she’d either want me too or that I could stop wanting her, cuz the asymmetry is unbearable.

This is so stupid. This is all so utterly absurd. The fact that I can feel _this_ bad over a girl I don’t even fucking know is insane. I hate this so fucking much. I’d really rather be dead than have to live in this state where I can’t stop liking her and she doesn’t know me."

Laying here with you

You caught me with a blindside

Made me believe it’s true

Please stay here by my side 

One more night with you


If love could last a lifetime

I’d spend it all with you

Ups and downs are our sign

Temptations taught and true

I give in for the moment

By morning we’ll be through

You look to me and smile

Now I know the truth



Our love is yet defined

Tangible in its youth

My love don’t leave me barren

I long to come find you

My gun sits loaded and ready

My escape from this troubled world

Metallic tastes when I spiral

No courage to pull through



If love could last a lifetime

I’d give it all to you

I try to comprehend it

Our differences define the “who”

I commend you for your actions

Despite the absent truth

If love could last a lifetime

I’d spend it all with you



I try to give you space

The stars the sun and moon

Your touch loses its meaning

I tremble in my boots

I fear that you’ll resent me

As time have proven true

My love I hate these feelings

I get lost when I’m with you



I gaze deep into your eyes

And there I find the truth

I kiss with my eyes open

Adore the spark in you

The same spark lies with me

And draws me deeper to

Your love becomes a lifeline

I’d give it all for you"
lonely,i hate university,"i hate university - I’m in a small intimate university where people have traumatized me for life. I am literally alone. My friends from high school were amazing but have moved on with their lives. Everyday I feel like crying seeing the people who have hurt me, cheated on me, abused and ruined me. I don’t have the mental capacity for anything. I don’t see the point of making new connections because I know in the end I will suffer. I wish I had someone who was genuine. Someone who could make me feel special and give me a reason to live. I’m dead on the inside and I don’t know what consequences all of this will have on my life after I graduate in 2 years. I haven’t seen my family in so long. Nobody deserves to feel what I feel."
lonely,I miss you,I miss you - We should be making out right now.
lonely,new here. just feeling lonely.,"new here. just feeling lonely. - I've always been a bit askew from the societal norms around me. But with the lock-downs, it's like I've lost any semblance of socialization skills. I get lonely, tho. I've been taking tentative forays into online communities. I'm not sure if that was the best idea. It's a bit of a Wild West out there and even with ""safe spaces"" I just feel like a weirdo.  :(

I guess I'm looking for my community. Some place where I can just be myself. I do get angry sometimes but I try not to be mean. Mostly, I want to be random, I want to make jokes or just mention what I had for dinner or pretend to be a mouse. I want to express my wide range of emotions... joy, anger, whatever... I want to play and just be happy.

I guess that it's all relative...
But I just feel lonely right now."
lonely,Society's zero tolerance to a non-alcoholic.,"Society's zero tolerance to a non-alcoholic. - So I had made 3 online friends in this year. We had good conversations as well. But when we decided to meet up, they asked me if I drink. I replied with ""I never had a drink before"". That's it. Plans cancelled and ghosted from the next day. Why the hell is drinking considered a mandatory requirement to meet up? What happened to the traditional places like a sports arena, restaurants, movie theatres, etc. Are these places considered lame now? Why do people think about pubs/bars/clubs as the first choice of a place for meeting up? Also I said I never had a drink and not ""I hate drinking"" so I can give company by drinking micro quantities. That's not enough?"

I care about them, but it hurts more trying to be happy for them constantly when it’s all I’ve ever wanted in life. So right now I’ve decided I can’t hang out with them cuz it pains me too much to hear about all the things they have and are doing that I don’t know if i’ll get to experience. But then I feel sad cuz i just turned out a chance to hang out with someone. I just feel shitty both ways."
lonely,my birthday just past and,"my birthday just past and - No one said happy birthday yesterday or for the past two birthdays and yet people claim to be my ""friend"". Why do I go out of my way to wish everyone happy birthday. Why do these ""friends"" claim to be my friends when they couldn't care less they are only friends of convenience. I don't look like a ""loner"" from an outsiders perspective people talk to me all the time, greet me, hug me and whatever else  but they're acquaintances at best. They come for me for advice but there's is no one for me to go to. Why do I keep coming across the most selfish people, I put in the effort to get nothing in return. No one remember what I say, birthdays aside, it's like I don't even exist sometimes. I'm so sick and tired, a simple ""how've you been"" would've been nice. I'm tired of doing favours. I deserve better.

I feel so depressed and have been for years now. I've tried all the generic advice : ""eat healthy, exercise, get good sleep"" I even deleted social media kept my screen time to average 2hrs. I still don't use them (except reddit for this). But I still feel hollow inside, I'm actively searching for positive thing but I can't feel happy. Me and my sister use to be very close, we still are kinda but a year ago something happened and she sorta changed so it's not the same. The past year or so especially has been rough.

I've tried making new friends many times, but I can never find anyone that understand me. They were mostly nice people, but they don't get me. I don't feel like belong here, I'm tired. I don't hate any of them but  a lot of ""friendships"" I've been in have been draining. Making an actual friend is hard, I'm willing to put in the effort but I can't seem to find ""my people"". I feel so isolated and drained, I don't remember the last time I was genuinely happy. The more depressed I become the harder it is, because I feel apathetic now, I don't want to but nothings is helping. I don't want to use negative affirmations but I want to keep this post genuine. I'm so tired."

lonely,Everything seems good from the outside,"Everything seems good from the outside - Hi all,

Sorry for the long and ranty post. Summer is around the corner, and although I (35m) have got a full-time job and a girlfriend, I am starting to feel lonely. In a way, I am even feeling guilty for feeling lonely. My fully remote job does not bring many interactions, and my girlfriend always seems busy. Her schedule is always full, and she is often working extra hours. For some reason, new things keep popping up, and she has to resolve those issues. I have got to give it to her, she is in a leadership role, so I guess being involved is fair. It is just that I feel like the household tasks are left for me to resolve, and this contributes to my loneliness. We should be a team, and I am also working a full-time job. I am not in the office, but that does not make my job less important. She says she is sorry for leaving all the tasks up to me, but her apologies feel empty. If you are truly sorry, you will try to make things better.

Another annoyance is that I'm always working from the sofa. We own a pretty small home, and my girlfriend claimed our home office. She needs a professional and quiet place for all the (private) videoconferences she has to make. Even when she is in the office, I will be on the sofa to care for our pets. I do the daily walks with the dog. I watch our chickens and make sure they do not fall prey.

Furthermore, I realized I was lonely when we went to throw a party, and I did not know whom to invite. My girlfriend had invited 30+ people, and I only invited my brother. I've had some high school friends up to 15-years ago, but they are no longer friends due to mental health problems. I'm not very confident, and chatting with strangers is not my idea of fun, and I am not even sure I am capable of it. Also, I'm an introvert with (I believe) a big heart, but maintaining relationships is not one of my strong points. Of course, there is a want, but I have no clue where and how to meet new people (friends).

I know I should probably snap out of this victim role and take control of my life instead of having things happen to me. The problem is that I don't know how and where to start. The post is probably more a rant than allowing myself to receive help, but I just wanted to get this off my heart.

Thank you for reading my post :)"
lonely,🥀,"🥀 - im trapped in this maze i built myself,

this is the price i pay for staying stuck in the past.

there are ghosts between my teeth

and they catch the words i never quite managed to say

I go work, from site to site doing my job then home. Dating life ends up with me getting ghosted or lied to it seems. RL friends are always busy. I just feel so alone and sad all the time after wearing a mask all day pretending to not be like this.

I make time for everyone else but no one does for me. I am a low priority human being, no one wants to be with no matter how I seem to improve myself.

Almost 40 and so alone. Time has passed by practically for me to have a family. I think about ending my existence. I don't want to grow old alone and end up in even worse situation. My passing would make more sense then feeling like this for another possible 40 years."
lonely,Do I have a right to be lonely?,"Do I have a right to be lonely? - I currently live with my partner, and yet I've never felt more alone.

I had a friend group I spent almost all my time with for years, ever since high-school, and before them I was always surrounded by people. After a fuck up with my ex, they all left. Now I have very few people who ever choose to talk to me, and the world feels empty without the people I love with me. 

I'm grateful to have my partner, but even being with them feels empty sometimes. Maybe I'm just broken, but my life has grayed out, and now it feels like all I do is get up, work, come home, play games, sleep, and start it all over again.

I'm tired of this feeling."
lonely,Been feeling just not normal and like I’ve little to look forward to,"Been feeling just not normal and like I’ve little to look forward to - Sorry if I’m ruminating, but I’ve been feeling pretty pathetic lately. I graduated college last year and had to take my last year off and return to my parents house due to the pandemic. I’ve always been really introverted my whole life and through my first 3 years of college, and was doing pretty well with self improvement and social workshops on campus and just being more social whilst trying to make some friends and memories on campus. 

COVID pretty much changed all of that, and made everything remote, so I wasn’t able to do what I wanted with the people at school since everyone had to return back to where they came from, and I’ve accepted that it’s never going to be the same anymore. I’m already not the greatest at maintaining friendships, and having that interruption was a really hard moment in my life. I feel really sad and dejected about some of the friendships I’ve lost with people who I felt like I was on great terms with before I left school. I also really was wanting a significant other, or just a friend to talk to . I 

I tried reconnecting with an acquaintance that I did a project with for one of my classes, I followed her for a few weeks and at least she had followed back, so I liked a few of her photos and sent her a message (idealizing a relationship like the sad pathetic wretch I am), and was just stalking her page for weeks. She hadn’t even opened my message, so l liked some more photos like the genius I am, and lo and behold she blocked me. I feel pretty pathetic for swooning over all her travel pictures and pretty photos of her. I shouldn’t have pushed those boundaries and I should’nt have liked her photos to begin with. What the fuck is wrong with me. Now I’m sure she thinks I’m a creep, and we were on normal terms before I even followed her. Every single girl I see I imagine a life and kids with her and I wish I could just stop and be a normal guy with normal thoughts who wasn’t so sensitive to everything 

I’m really just in a weird place mentally where I’m just cloying for someone’s love and affection. My head hurts so much that the organization of this essay is shit. Has anyone ever just been caught in the black hole of their own anxiety?"

Worst part of it is my triggers. Every time someone is a little critical towards me I just lose it. I feel so much rage. That’s why I have no friends and I hate my family for being so toxic and hypocritical. I wish I could just catch a break
lonely,just wanted to ask a question.,"just wanted to ask a question. - Do people with great family bonding, some good friends to talk about anything and generally doing well in life ever understand what it's like to have no one to speak your heart out, being traumatised, anxious, depressed and just staying in the room 24×7?
Is it any point taking to these kinda people when they'll not be able to understand and ig they would only feel like we are being too clingy while the reality is we don't have anyone else...
Like it's a deal breaker for both sides. Isn't it better to just stop talking to these kinda people?"
lonely,i can never be accepted if i’m not skinny,"i can never be accepted if i’m not skinny - For context, i used to be 127kgs 5’10 when i was 17. After my 18th birthday i started losing weight, to the point that i am currently 66kgs 6’2 at 23. I’ve been as light as 55kgs a year ago. 

During this whole time, i’ve only ever had friends, a girlfriend, people liking me, people actively SEEKING to engage with me, the whole ‘halo effect’, ONLY when i was 55kgs. This was the only time i had any sort of social life, and i was starving myself constantly to be at that weight.

My life has been reduced to a balancing act, between actually eating food and being healthy, or starving myself and being social. I genuinely feel that i cannot have both at the same time.

It seems to me that people only like me when i’m skeleton-like skinny, vulnerable, “soft”, etc etc. Whenever i go against my eating disorder and actually try to eat food like a normal person, everyone abandons me, i’m not “cute” anymore. 

I’m at crossroads, and i don’t know what choice to finally make. Should i starve myself into anorexia and enjoy the benefits of people wanting to know me? Or should i stay isolated but objectively healthy?"

I've never had friends or relationships, I haven't been on good terms with my family in about 15 years, and due to how awkward and weird I come across, everyone just sees me as a joke.

I really feel as though I've failed at life. That I'd be delusional to think that *every single person I've ever met* decided completely independently of each other that they don't want me around, but that they're somehow that doesn't matter, like somehow they're *all* wrong about me.

At every school I ever attended, every job I've ever had, and just trying to meet people outside of work, I've only been that weird guy people laugh at and make fun of. I don't know how to change that. Therapy didn't work, and just drained my bank account. MeetUp groups didn't work, and just gave me new opportunities to become a target. 

I'm sorry to vent, but my upcoming birthday, especially at this age, just reminds me of how the gap between me and any kind of fulfilling social connection seems wider than ever."

lonely,The phone that never rings,"The phone that never rings - Nobody calls me. Nobody texts me. The girl I was interested in that I asked out on a date and said yes never texts me back. My ""friend"" won't text me unless she isn't in a relationship. 

I was supposed to see yesterday my ex gf (3 year long relationship) for the first time in a year before she cheated on me and hurt and abused me as much as she could to force me to break up with her so she wouldn't feel guilty doing it. 

My Stepdad hasn't talked to me since he cheated on my mom. My older sister doesn't text or call me. My family on both sides don't call me. My coworkers that I hang out with rarely if at all invite me to things, but they were very quick to invite newer people.

I tried reconnecting with my oldest ""friends"" after we argued almost 5 years ago and he left me on read. I have no friends. 

I'm trying to improve my life, better myself, and work towards goals... gain wieght and work out... college eventually... but nobody notices. Nothing changes. I'm doing this for me... but the crippling loneliness makes it hard to be consistent.

I wonder how did this happen, tech that connected all of us, now suddenly threw us into this dark abyss where you have billions of acquaintances but 0 friends. 

It’s partially my fault as I am not the type to seek out friendships or even maintain them, but hell realising I am 25 and I only have 1 friend that doesn’t even live in the same country as I do is depressing and makes you feel isolated.

Im worried i cant keep up, whether its with appearances or just socially.Things will just start to seem different, like im boring ppl or theyre tired of me and it doesnt make me feel great at all. Just really self conscious about it and it gets out of hand . I find myself doing or saying drastic things just to kind of “keep my place” or just agreeing to or with things just for the sake of it so i can stay interesting to them…theres a limit of course but i still feels weird idk.

lonely,No reason to keep trying,"No reason to keep trying - Ever since I was a teenager, I tend to molde my life so others could accept me: friends, relationships and so on. Deep down I knew I wasnt worthy of anything and no people would like to have me around, so wearing a mask and make them happy was a good way to be accepted, and it worked alot.

When I grew older, I started facing constant cheating from all sides: girls, friends, almost everyone. My closest of friends told me I have to be myself, and after so long I started being me.

Today I dont know if it was a good idea, since now I have less than 5 people to talk with, and the last relationship I had was about 5 years ago, when I tried to be the more honest.

It was exactly as I thought it would be: being myself would make me lonely. There were weeks that I dont trade one meaningful word with someone. I spot so many jerks doing bad things to alot of people, talking shit on others back, cheating boyfriends/girlfriends and having their way, being happy with it, while I end up as someone who isnt worth trying. People that with one instagram chat get laid, while I have to give good morning messages everyday so people dont forget I exist.

Its tiring, as if I'm the only one trying. Am I that much worthless? Being me is working all day, get home alone and have nobody to talk with until sleep and repeat. Theres reason to keep trying? Theres reason to keep living?"

lonely,never have i ever thought loneliness would be the cause of my depression,"never have i ever thought loneliness would be the cause of my depression - I suffered through depression ( lack of career goals/uselessness main cause) from the age of 16-21. During that time, I was pretty much occupied with my depressing thoughts and finding ways to over the depression. I didn't take therapy or any counselling because my parents thought what I had was not depression. I'm not upset at them. I grew up in a traditional society so the notion of mental health issues was alien at that time. What helped me greatly was improving my physical health and routine. I started feeling much better when I introspected myself. I was pre occupied to think about my loneliness, lack of love life/dating etc. I had a good friend's circle in college so that helped a lil bit. Fast forward to lockdown, I was severely isolated and alone for two years. I feel I'm still living in social isolation. I don't have social life anymore. The last time I met anyone else outside my family was last year in June I guess. I made some online friends to cope with that and it has helped a lot. The only thing which keeps me moving forward is the thought of finding a job and working on my skills. I'm still focusing on myself. I'm very good at it but the thing is I no longer feel depressed and I wish I did so I would be too preoccupied to think about my loneliness/no social life or love life. For reference I'm 24 now. I find myself really lonely at least once in a month and I don't know how to over come it. Loneliness is causing me depression now and I can't save myself."

It just happens I'm too much of a pussy to take my own life. So I'm just alive, not really living if that makes sense. And I can never truly live bc all I can think about is death. I don't appreciate life and I suspect if I ever did it'd up being a lie which is exactly what everything feels like now. Not that it's all objectively wrong it's just it's so easy to disregard BUT FEAR is the only thing that ensures I stay imprisoned here. Fucking cursed even, I try to move on, accept things for what they are and just deal but I can't. I can't live, die... everythings so fucked, hopeless...it just is, I just suffer and I can't deal so I'm cursed with so much nothing.

Trying to help people is actually causing me to feel worse at this point, and I'm at the point I just do not think I can anymore. Why put yourself out there for further mental anguish.

But im really fucking sad because a guy i was starting to like is ghosting me. We clicked so well and have so much in common i cant think of any reason why he wouldnt want to be with me other than my personality being off putting. Same music taste, same hobbies, texting until 3 am. since ive never been in a relationship i catch feelings super easily, when anyone remotely nice and attractive give me attention. ugh i just wish i felt loved and cherished :')"

lonely,What do you think?,"What do you think? - If you talk to somebody every day and then eventually they stop replying and saying their working a lot would you have faith things will even out eventually? I’ve been talking to this guy for about 2-3 months now and he works late night jobs. It didn’t seem to be a problem when we first started talking, in fact I would wake up to him saying good morning and stuff. But lately, he’s been so quiet, will even go days without saying hey. I get it, I’m 22, I work too. I stress about money and bills too. I don’t blame him for that. I just know that you can take even a second out of your day to say what’s up and let the other person you’ll be busy. I told him that this makes me feel forgotten about and I’ve talked to so many guys who have done the same before him and everything just fizzled out. I am so tired of this happening, getting invested and then ditched. Due to my bad track record with dating guys I’ve learned to talk to a person but sorta be standoffish until I’m sure we’re gonna move to the next step. I told him so much about me and he made me feel happy again. I just hate that this is how my love life goes… even when I take measures not to dive heart first into situations, I still hurt In the end. He sent me a text telling me “if you have faith in us you would get used to me not being around that much”. This sounds like a red flag to me…. I guess I know I should just cut all contact but I don’t want to be alone again… there’s no feeling I hate more. Either way: with or without I feel crummy. Why is it so hard for us to leave bad situations alone? 

Have you gone through something similar? What helped you break away from not letting go of someone who doesn’t treat you as you need?"
lonely,Driving myself nuts,"Driving myself nuts - Being lonely obviously takes a hefty mental toll on people, but damn even expecting the emotions doesn't help and the physical loss is just as bad as the mental trouble. Often I feel like I imagine fake scenarios and think too much into stuff just to make myself feel better. There's a girl in my 6th period and she's nice and pretty cute, but even if I asked her out it would be kinda pointless for a couple reasons, like how she's graduating and I'm not. Although I'm pretty sure she likes me, just based on how often I catch her staring and stuff, and even today she went completely out of her way just to talk to me for a minute and she had to sprint off for class. But I think being lonely might be causing me to look too far into it and see things that aren't there and that she's probably just being nice and friendly and that I'm just desperate. 

Am I dumb? Am I overthinking about my overthinking? Does she like me? Idk more of a rant about how tired and confused I am and about how loneliness is effecting my mental health and physical friendships. Any advice on how to overcome this or even any answers to my other questions would be appreciated."

lonely,Did this happen to anyone else?,"Did this happen to anyone else? - Started primary school at the age of 4 all the way to 12. Was pretty much friends with everyone.

Highschool started at 12 to 17, lost most of my close primary school friends but made new friends. 

College started at age 17 to 19, lost 90% of my friends in high school but still had most of my close friends.

Got to university at 19 where I am now 20 years old losing all my friends, havent made any new friend.

I didnt lose these people because of disputes or anything like that, they all just went their own way  whilst I left my self on this lonely path. 

I dont known what I've done wrong in my life but opportunities that people have that promote friendships, I feel like I just don't get. 1st year of university was mid covid, so lost out on a key time to make friends. 2nd year I'm in a cycle of requiring friends to get friends. I hate parties and thats what feels like everyone want to do but I see 0 enjoyment out of it. A small group of close friends is prefect for me but I can get their without friends themselves.

My whole life just feels like I'm falling down a staircase with each step fallen hurting more than the last."

lonely,Lonely during parental leave,"Lonely during parental leave - This is gonna be a long one but I just need to vent a bit. I have been feeling lonely since I gave birth almost 5 months and a half ago.The delivery busted me up and due to a misunderstandings and events that happened during my stay at the hospital, the staff called youth protection on me and took my baby away from me before I even leaved the hospital thinking I am a “risk of neglect” to my son instead of sitting down with me and help me with the killer migraines and give me services as a first time single parent.I have been fighting to get him back but the judge never heard my testimony and placed my son in foster care until August so that I can work on my parenting skills,support network and anxiety. Since then, my parenting skills have improved, my support network has been pretty solid enough and I am seeing a therapist and take anxiety pills. I lost a ton of weight to the point where I am skinnier then I was before I got pregnant and felt great about myself. I have been feeling lonely and I wanted to come out of my shell and wanted to meet people maybe a friends with benefits sorta thing but most of my conversations online has came up empty.I either get ghosted,we don’t vibe or I get red flags by some. Im not ugly,I am aware that it is an acquired taste for someone to have attraction to a transman and being a single parent doesn’t help.I knew what I signed up for when I first transitioned 10 years ago and having a child.I don’t expect anyone to parent or care for my son. I tried to distract myself during my parental leave with projects like renovations and gardening etc. But on the days where I can relax and get high, I get horny and lonely.Im not ugly at least to me,I have a large house and my dream cars etc but I have no one to share that with.My “maternal instincts” are kicking me in the ass and have no one to care for to fill that void in my heart that youth protection did to me.My mother is in Ontario taking care of my grandma, my son is in foster care 54km away from my house until August hopefully and my friend I used to spend a lot of time before my pregnancy has recently been diagnosed with a genetic muscle dystrophy disease that prevent him from coming over to my place due to stairs and they are so busy with appointments. I want companionship, heck if things would work out I willing to let whoever live with me if things go well. This is not how I expected to spend my parental leave."

i just turned 18 a bit ago and i feel like a loser. i can’t keep any friends no matter how hard i try. people have been avoiding me and ignoring me constantly. if i’m not being ignored, i’m being made fun of. after 7 full years of being treated like shit, i looked for ways to cope. i’ve been cutting myself since fifth grade just to make myself feel something. but recently i’ve been feeling too much. so 4 months ago i turned to weed and alcohol instead of cutting myself. i’ve been forcing myself to feel nothing at all. i hate being sober. i can’t go to school without smoking or drinking first. i have to use that to motivate me to keep going.  

i hoped it would help me forget bad memories, but that’s the one thing it hasn’t done. i feel numb but then i remember everything. i have to live in this fucking house with the man that’s been abusing me for years while my mom turns a blind eye. but you have to live the life of your dreams at some price, right? i guess her price was me. because while i’m smoking and drinking all the time to make myself forget what he’s doing almost every day, she’s shopping for herself and my siblings and pretending i dont exist. i feel like they think i’m a figment of their imagination. i’m not real to them. to her, i’m cash in her pocket and to him i’m just someone he can use when moms not home. i don’t want to die but i don’t want to be here and i don’t know how to get away"

lonely,Why can’t I make friends,"Why can’t I make friends - I’m from and live in London. I’m 28F. Since 18 I’ve been trying to make friends and failed. I have one person who talks with me occasionally but that’s the closest to a friend I have. I constantly go out and meet new people hoping I click with someone. I rarely reach out to people because I felt we didn’t click but also I noticed no one has ever reached out to me. I have tried to reach out to a few in the past and been ghosted, or been rejected when offering to meet/do something 

I wonder if it is to do with my lack of interests/anxiety. When I got anxiety at 18 I lost interest in all my hobbies. I can still do things now and get some joy but there is nothing I’m passionate about like how I used to be back when I had friends. I also don’t have experience with men so wonder if that makes women less likely to identify with me 

I get so lonely constantly checking my phone for messages. All I have are messages from the group chats I’m in which are for friendships. The only way I can socialise is meeting some new for the first time. Because then neither of us know each other but after the first meet they wont  reach out to me again so I can only rely on meeting new people to have a social life and it’s very lonely . They say London is a lonely place but I see people becoming friends around me"
lonely,I feel so disgusting. My body does not feel my own and the feeling of loneliness just makes it worse.,"I feel so disgusting. My body does not feel my own and the feeling of loneliness just makes it worse. - So it started a long time ago but to keep it short I will try to cut it down. Basically I have been abused all my life and had worse and even more worsening things happen. Which made me feel like I needed to please everyone even if  I didn't know them.  I would do anything to get them to be happy and not mad with me. Even now my family has a chokehold on me. I do all the chores keep the house clean and do the laundry. Yet I can't stop. But the worse thing of all is the feeling of wanting to be used like a kink of sorts but it makes me feel much worse.

To put context I was well ""used"" and yes it is most likely what you think. I have PTSD due to it and this crushing feeling like I will be alone forever. People have called me needy and much more. I am at the point I can't look at myself in the mirror without crying. Yet the worse is most likely yet to come."

Hell, it just seems impossible at this point. Whatever I try, wherever I go, however I change my thinking, it all ends in vain and I get nowhere. 

I feel like I'm one of only a few rational and sane people left in today's society where there seems to be no more morals or values anymore. People only care about themselves and when they do interact with others it's usually just for their own personal gain. I feel like a time-traveler who's been transported a couple decades into the future and everything is alien to me as well as making no sense.

lonely,I should be over it by now,"I should be over it by now - This is kind of a continuation from my last 2 posts. To sum it up my closest and favorite friend I’ve ever had slowly stopped talking to me, then a couple weeks ago said that she does not feel a connection anymore. I understood because I know where she was coming from and that the feeling cannot be helped and the friendship can’t be restored once you’ve moved past it. I think that’s what hurts the most, understanding losing feelings for someone randomly. I really miss her, more than I’ve ever missed anyone before and the feeling isn’t going away. Each day I miss her more and everything reminds me of her, I can’t listen to songs we used to and when I go past places we’ve been I remember all the good times we had. I really thought I meant something more to her, I thought our friendship wasn’t a phase and that we had a real bond. Knowing our entire friendship meant nothing in the long run hurts mentally more than anything I’ve ever experienced. I thought I’d be over it by now (it’s been like 2 months since I started feeling a drift) but I’m not. I’ve even had dreams of being with her again and even the littlest things remind me of what we had. I want to be friends again so bad, more than I’ve wanted anything. I don’t think I’ll ever meet someone I love that much again or that I’ve felt that happy with. If I get another friend one day I want them to be exactly like her, I want them to be her, I don’t want anyone else. It hurts that I was just a phase a romanticization. It hurts knowing that she most likely doesn’t have a passing thought about me and has moved on entirely. She was pretty much my life and the closest I’ve felt to love for anyone. I used to unknowingly smile when I thought of the stuff we did or talked about and we used to laugh until we cried. I’ve never felt this lonely and I have no one else to talk to about this, no one seems to compare to her. I either want to be her friend again or just get over this already, it’s annoying to deal with these feelings."
lonely,Mental Health Awareness Week 2022 - Theme: Loneliness,"Mental Health Awareness Week 2022 - Theme: Loneliness - As the Mental Health Week of this year has the loneliness theme I thought it would be nice to make a post on this subreddit, just to lay out some information and websites' links that may be helpful. 


“Being vulnerable is actually a strength and not a weakness — that’s why more and more mental health is such an important thing to talk about. It’s the same as being physically sick. And when you keep all those things inside, when you bottle them up, it makes you ill.”
– Cara Delevingne

How to cope with loneliness 

1. Try to do some enjoyable things that will keep you busy 

One way of trying to manage loneliness is by keeping busy and doing things we enjoy. This might be a hobby such as a bit of gardening, going to the gym or even sorting out your kitchen cupboards, jigsaws, puzzles or knitting. Small activities can give you energy and positive feelings. It’s important these things are fun or fulfilling.
Be careful about working too hard or watching TV shows simply as a distraction. These will only delay or suppress your feelings and could actually make your mental health worse.

2. Try to do things that stimulate your mind 

Activities that occupy your mind can help with loneliness. This can include the  benefits of taking courses or listening to podcasts on topics from comedy to fitness. This can be stimulating and something as simple as listening to the familiar voice of someone you like can help you feel less lonely.

3. Think about doing a physical activity 

Physical exercise can help with loneliness. It can be as simple as having a walk in the park when you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed. Alternatively, you could listen to music and do a bit of dancing around your living room. (Be aware of your neighbours though!) 

4. Try to engage with the people you meet in your daily life. 

It can be hard to talk to others when you’re feeling lonely. However, trying to connect with the people you meet as you go about your day can be helpful. Even catching someone’s eye and saying “hi” as you walk along can make you feel better. Or it could be about saying hello to the postwomen or postman or going to the shops and talking to the person at the checkout. By sharing a polite greeting – you might find you give someone else a positive lift too.

5. Find people that ‘get you’ 

It can be hard to connect with others when you’re feeling lonely. But there are great benefits in finding people who have been through similar experiences to you. Interacting with others that ‘get’ you can give you a sense of belonging that may be missing. People who have been there have found connections in local groups or social media.

6. Spend time with pets 

If you are lucky enough to have a pet, it can be a great way of managing loneliness. Not only do animals provide us with unconditional love and support, but they also help to give structure to our days and even encourage us to get out and connect with others. Interaction with pets is also shown to help reduce stress levels.

7. Try to use social media in a positive way 

Social media can help your mental health. But it can also affect it negatively. The key is to use it in a positive way. Finding digital  communities, you share interests and passions with can help. Most importantly be aware of how you feel when you use social media and focus on topics and activities that work best for you.

8. Talking therapies can help 

Talking through your feelings with a counsellor or therapist can help you cope with your feelings of loneliness. Talking therapy can be hard to get – but if you can find a professional, it can really be of benefit. It’ll provide you with a safe space to work through your feelings and thoughts without judgement. 



How to support other people who are feeling lonely

1. Don’t judge or stigmatise

It’s important not to judge or stigmatise people who feel lonely. Stigma around loneliness is a huge barrier to the kind of open and genuine conversations that can help. It’s more important to be aware of just how common loneliness is. It’s a normal feeling that all of us are likely to experience at some time in our lives. Telling other people that their poor mental health is the reason why they are feeling lonely is really not helpful.

2. Try to make groups welcoming to other people

It can be difficult for people who are feeling lonely to join a group like a club. This might be because people are shy or feel nervous about existing relationships in the group which they don’t feel part of. It’s important to be aware of this and try to make groups be as welcoming as possible to newcomers. Flexibility around things like how often people attend is also important.

3. Try to listen and show understanding

A great way to help a friend or family member is simply to listen. People who have experienced loneliness relate how they valued friends who really considered what they might enjoy and were even willing to join them in some shared activities. Having an understanding and compassionate approach, and not ignoring the person’s experience, will help them to feel heard and understood.

I found this site below quite helpful as well, you can see loads of more information and even support:

There's a suicidal training I've done in class today that gives us more insight and information about how we can help and support these people.
That's the link:
https://zsa.frank-cdn.uk/scorm/full-training/story.html

If I learnt something I'd say it's that you don't need to keep all to yourself, open up about your feelings.
You'll feel more relieved and less overwhelmed after doing so.

If you ever spot on someone that has been showing concerning signs, no need to beat around the bush out of fear of saying the word 'suicide'. 
Simply ask ""Are you feeling suicidal?""
According to the training once you say it you show that you're open minded enough not to judge this person, thus making them open up more.

Well, there's a lot more actually....
If you're interested, take part in the short training by clicking on the last link I've typed. 

Hope y'all have a lovely week and that these links may be helpful for someone. :)"
lonely,Anyone else stuck in a cycle of being lonely but having been alone so long that you self sabotage every chance of meeting new people you get?,"Anyone else stuck in a cycle of being lonely but having been alone so long that you self sabotage every chance of meeting new people you get? - Stuck in a weird cycle. Everytime I'm about to finally make a friend or possible romantic interest I get hit with crippling anxiety that keeps me from following through. I feel like I'm just stuck in this cycle of being alone to the point I'm kind of scared of not being alone.

Kind of a weird phenomena that's kind of new to me I guess. Wondering if anyone has any good tips on breaking out of this cycle

There is lot of lonely people here in the US it doesn't only benefit the citizens but the government economy as well.

lonely,7 years of loneliness.,"7 years of loneliness. - I'm a 23 yr old and it's been 7 years of loneliness for me and here are the reasons that caused it:
1. I listened to society and thought that money was everything.
2. Because of point 1 I stopped socialising much and focused on how to get rich.
3. Realised that it wasn't in my fate because all the ways I kept trying went against me. Incurred losses.
4. Above points made me more of a pessimist and anti-social. People found me to be uninteresting.
5. Now I want to change, but I have lost the ability to make conversation and I'm socially awkward.

Changes observed:
1. Initially it was comfortable and peaceful when I was full of hope. When all plans were shattered, I became depressed.
2. Cried myself to sleep for maybe 3 years straight.
3. Motivated myself to try and change. Tried socialising but I had already lost the skill. Nobody found me interesting, nobody wanted to hangout with me.
4. Back to crying myself to sleep for an entire year.
5. The phase of acceptance. I don't have a proper mood anymore. I put on a poker face at all situations now whether it's the boss making a joke or watching an emotional movie, etc. I don't remember the last time I laughed my heart out. Nothing seems funny anymore, nothing seems sad as well. Thoughts about looking after myself all alone in old age keep coming in my head.
6. I had one crush in school, to whom I never confessed my feelings. Since then I haven't felt the same towards any other person although I keep passing by a ton of them everyday at work and in the gym. Looks like I have become completely desensitised. A living stone."

lonely,For Almost 2 year straight,"For Almost 2 year straight - Ever Since I got dumped. I kinda left my friend group circle of which my ex was part. There been a time I been thinking about returning but ultimately I chose not to. 

As result, It has been quite lonely living life. But It was not much of different living life back then too. But this time it was different. I understood the importance of people more. They more or less give meaning to life. 

So I kinda force myself into making somewhat of an online presence. To ultimately try to achieve the end goals of my life. 

Luckily I am able to have somewhat friendships with my coworkers. 

But Not too long ago. The friend I Had somewhat of a decent relationship with, asked me to go play pool. I feel it is like getting tradition at this point to catch up almost every year at this point. 

So yeah I am going to force myself to get out more and try to talk to people irl/online more often.

I told her i didn't want kids, not because i didn't want them, but because i thought their dad wouldn't be a great husband or father for the family. It was my own fault.

I let myself miss weeks of school without a care. Life's already gone to shit, may as well throw away my future too, right? I have tried to get used to this monotonous life for so long, but it's just eating away at me and I don't know what to do, and seeking help is pointless when nobody cares.

I was speaking with my mom when she mentioned how the house is dirty and I need to clean up. I told her that I'm trying, but that she doesn't understand my current state of mind, I'm absolutely drained and can barely gather enough energy to take care of myself, but she's rarely there so she doesn't see that. But she proceeds to just disregard it and says the same thing. I don't know what it was, but it hit me pretty hard. It was like I could tell from the tone of her voice that she has never, and will never care about my problems. A tone that was always there that I just didn't pick up on, or maybe I just didn't want to believe it. Either way, it made me feel extremely empty. I am rotting and will continue to rot until the end, and everybody will just watch. My existence is pathetic. The only thing left for me here is empty space. I am so ready to be done with this all, I just don't have the balls to take my own life. I wish something terrible enough would happen to me so it can push me over the edge and I'll finally be able to end the suffering."

My ex boyfriend wanted to spend the day with me because he didn’t want me to be alone. But he doesn’t love me, so somehow it felt even shittier than being alone. It felt like pity. He probably just felt bad because of how much I did for his birthday. And then I feel even shittier because I’m sad because I’m not shown any love but then when I am I tell myself it’s fake love.

I just haven't had luck with anything, especially dating... It just always ends up in rejection or in the rare few cases I had with someone (years ago) just ends plain wrong... With people who cheat on me, or if it's online, ditching me before we meet, or they won't send get too close and allresdy have someone and just never intended to be with me except a short fling,but won't say so until it's too late, etc. I wonder what the hell is wrong with me. Am I that damn ugly? That boring? That stupid?

Everyone just tells me I'm fine, but to stop looking for someone and to just focus on myself and to just go and keep going to a psychotherapist, and that's fine, I suppose I do need help, but I just feeel incredibly lonely and I'm so damn tired that I just can't have someone that likes me.

And I stopped looking for a long while. I tried focusing on myself, it seemed to get better, I actually found someone I really liked, by chance, online. 

We just hanged out etc, played games online most of the days etc, and she's lonely too, but she does not wanna start a relationship more than friendship cause of the distance. I understand, it can hurt and just be awful to not be able to be close. But my heart is just tired.. The one person I click with, and that is genuinely nice and honest, is unreachable, and I can't get a chance. I'm just losing it, I just give up at this point. 

I know I might be unreasonable, but I just feel purely like shit, like noone likes me more than friends, sometimes I just wish I wasn't born as a guy,feeling so undesired, or just born period. Life just feels so pointless, the hobbies I got are gaming and cars, gaming is getting boring, and fun cars I like are just too expensive... And they get more expensive. And everthing else does too, making saving for one so hard..I just go to work and hoping for things will never happen.....life seems like repeat and just pointless and lonely.Especially when noone wants to actually be with me. 

At this point I am desperate for something shallow even, with any girl, just to feel wanted and to fill that hole in my heart a little...and I know that is probably wrong way to think... But I just don't know how to feel anymore, I just want some love, or excitement I guess. And I feeel like it makes me a bad person. But I can't shake it off either. I'm just tired.

I cant take it no more and I'm at my limit. I have been mentally abused since I was a little child all the way until uni, people would insult my physical appereance and all sorts of things and I can't seem to let go no matter how hard I try.

 I have gotten an uneeded obsession of going to the gym and look attractive now, but my mind is still damaged Maybe I'm  way to sensitive.. but I feel as though if everything could just end I'll be way happier. I have a constant stream of sadness that can never be addressed.

This feeling of loveliness, its as if I already know how everything will end up when I meet new people, so I just end up not talking to people and just avoiding them. When people try to be friends I push them aside by avoiding them... Even though I don't mean to.

over  the years any irl friends i have had have naturally drifted apart due  to me not growing up and staying inside. For many years i had internet  friends who were part of my life even tho i didnt see them i'd  occasional chat to them which kinda felt like small version of a social  life. But slowly in the last few years ive ended up with none mainly due  to me burrowing into a hole and not responding for weeks or months.

Also  in the past few years ive lost both my grandparents making my family  smaller. i dont see my siblings due to them living far away and having  actual lives with a family .only family member i see routinely is my mum  (my dad died when i was 19 and i havent seen my dads side of the family  since 2010)

Now alot of that  stuff i've typed i had become kinda numb too. the losing both irl and  internet friends, family members dying, not havin a life etc. But coming  off my meds have made all those years of life problems come crashing  down to the point that i realise i have no future and any hope ive had  ive let fade away.

my mum wont be  here forever and i have no independence. I havent made my own family  like my siblings have so when my mum dies i'm on my own and i wont be  able to cope. I feel hopeless, lonely and keep crying thinking about my  life and how much ive wasted and ruined. I'm not sure if i could kill  myself but if anything happened to my mum (shes not ill but anyone can  die suddenly in their mid 50's)  especially with how my life is now  i'd  be on my own and i think that would be the end of me 100%.

i  dont know how anyone can read this im just typing because i feel so bad  i have to do something and typing temporarily stops me crying"
lonely,idgaf,"idgaf - My birthday is next week. Everyone who says happy bday to me will go on a list of ppl worth putting my energy towards, &amp; everyone who doesn't I'm going to delete them from my brain &amp; never attempt to contact them again, as if I never met them. I figure that if someone rly cares about you, they'll remember to say happy bday to you.

Ik it sounds kinda extra but I'm DONE being the only one putting effort into friendships. 100% done. I'm starting over FRESH."
lonely,Venting,Venting - I have so much that I should be happy for but I can’t get one thing off my mind ever. Im 25m and never been with anyone. Haven’t even held hands. I’m liked by everyone I come in contact with but nobody ever takes much interest in me. I have my family and a couple friends and I know that I should be grateful for that. It’s just so hard sometimes when you know everyone else has had certain experiences that you’ll never be able to relate to. It makes me feel like such a loser. I’m tired of falling asleep alone and waking up to the same feelings everyday. I just want someone that wants to tell me about their day and to have a genuine connection with. I don’t understand how some people get in and out of relationships so easily. I know I’m not the most outgoing person but I’ve seen plenty of people like me find someone. I just don’t understand what I’m doing wrong or if I’m just meant to be alone my whole life.

I worry tho it'll be too awkward with everyone being so young."
lonely,feeling low in a new city,"feeling low in a new city - 21f. It's been an year since me and my long term boyfriend ( then ldr ) broke up and now since I've moved to his city ( for college) i feel increasingly lonely and almost want to go back to him knowing fully well that he probably would still treat me the way he used to. I'm so lonely and I don't know a lot of people in the city, plus my roomate seems so happy with her boyfriend. He really is an angel. Dating in the new city has been really hard as well. Well, dating since my breakup has been hard, I seem to get so stiff and rigid when I meet new boys and I feel like the lack of any emotional anchor in the new city has pulled me back to texting my ex boyfriend. It's a jumble of emotions that I need to get off. I don't know what to do, I was feeling incredibly lonely so I posted it here."

Literally frustrated and angry that I have never experienced love or a relationship. - I can’t keep going though all the different cycles, the different things I say to myself - just keep staying positive, keep telling myself it’ll happen, focus on myself, just do you and it’ll come, don’t be desperate, actually just don’t think about and it’ll come to you, oh no you need to put yourself out there and try to make it happen.

Why is this not so hard for most people. Everyone freaking has someone. They don’t have to go through this crap. It just comes to them. Someone loves them. They’re easy to love. They deserve love. It happens for everyone. It’s not meant for me. What do I do? I feel broken."

I do see a lot of people experiencing momentary pain, but there are also many who describe their long-lasting suffering experiences, and I am concerned if they are suffering from depression. I hope everything will get better.（^(and why cant i post a poll in this sub ?)）"
lonely,I don’t even know who I am anymore,"I don’t even know who I am anymore - Idk why I’m writing this tbh I just have so much pent up emotions and I’ve got nobody else to talk to about any of this so why not just write it here.

Sorry if this goes on for ages or doesn’t read that well I’m pretty much just writing what’s going through my head.

I really don’t know who I am anymore and this sounds ridiculous because I am only 17 but I just feel like a sad shell of a person. I’ve only had the 1 friend over the past few years after being bullied by so many people for so long. Yet now even know looking back this 1 friend really damaged me as a person. Always made the effort to put me down, put himself above me, made me feel bad when I was expressing myself for who I was as a person. Fast forward to today and I have no friends, I have nobody to talk with, I’ve now just started to talk myself at times because at least I can’t be judged by others.   And when I’m at school I’m really just a sad lonely person. Im not fun to talk to I’m usually by myself and I’ve almost never got a smile on my face. I do believe that I’m so much more than what people see me as right now it’s just I can never open myself up to people and nobody will take the chance on me. And in terms of relationships I’ve never had a gf and I’ve never even really spoken to any girls. I just want somebody to care, somebody that I can be comfortable around. 

Idek know anymore man"
lonely,Lonely road ahead,"Lonely road ahead - Why is it that I have to put in 2x the work for barely any reward? Whether it’s friends, girlfriends, family, etc; it feels like I’m constantly having to put in exhausting amounts of effort to keep my relationships afloat. I’m scared that if I even let go of just a little bit of effort, all my relationships will fall apart. Why should I give all of my love when I’m getting nothing in return? Is it shallow of me to be asking that question? It it not a bad thing to want someone to love me and give me the same affection that i give them? Is love supposed to be effortless? If so, then what does that mean about all of my relationships? Does it turn out that I’m not loved at all? If you’re constantly having to reinforce support beams for a house, can you really call the house stable? Many question, many thoughts…"

He brought his girlfriend along of course. He had a group of about 10 friends come over to our house later as well. And I went to go see a movie. By myself. I tried not to let it get to me. I pretend that I like being alone but truthfully it's driving me insane. All I can see is my brother and how happy he is, and I wish I could be like him. But I don't know how. I don't know how to talk to people. I wish I didn't have autism. I wish I had the confidence to go out and make friends and get along with people like he does. I don't even need lots of friends. Just one would make me so happy. I just feel so lonely..."

I have no friends to hang out with and i havent socialize with another person beside my family. Im depressed af and the loneliness is killing me.

nobody texts me first. nobody cares for my well being. i fucking hate talking to people but suffer from loneliness as if that makes any sense at all? why do i have to bribe people to have a normal fucking conversation with me. i guess i’m just too NOT important for you to think about. i hate living the same thing day in and day out."
lonely,why am I so bad at getting a relationship?,"why am I so bad at getting a relationship? - I just don't understand how much bad luck i have with relationships. it already started in 6th grade where i had a crush on someone and got rejected multiple times (yes multiple times i was and still am quite optimistic and naïve). Then 11th grade where i was in a 1 year long friendzone, which resulted in my first relationship that lasted 2 months. and even that wasn't a relationship because the girl was interested in me for a week and that was it. tinder and various other dating apps don't work for me, either because the conversation doesn't last that long or we want to meet up and get rejected days or even hours before the date. yesterday i stopped texting with a girl, because she cancelled the first date for the second time and i told her that i was annoyed and a little mad about it. she said that i am toxic and a 6 week old relationship just stopped right there. what on earth am i doing wrong i really try my best to end this cycle. am i the problem?"

lonely,I wish I had something else to hug other than my pillow.,"I wish I had something else to hug other than my pillow. - I somehow have no friends. I’ve tried texting my old friends, but none of them ever respond. I can’t really make new friends since I’m just a teen that can’t go out and talk to people when they want, and I do homeschooling, so I can’t even talk to people at school. The closest thing I have to talking to people or making friends is talking on discord, although I usually get ignored, and I haven’t found a single community or person that I like talking to. It feels like the biggest things in my life right now are my dreams, and my extreme paranoia combined with not being able to fall asleep before 3 am."
lonely,"I feel like a failure and I don't see the point of continuing (just know I'm not suicidal, just a sad hoe) Would appreciate it if you would hear me out.","I feel like a failure and I don't see the point of continuing (just know I'm not suicidal, just a sad hoe) Would appreciate it if you would hear me out. - I am so tired. Every day I am finding it hard to find a reason to keep going forward. I feel ugly, unhealthy, and generally a failure. 

I'm a 17-year-old female about to go to college. My face is full of acne and my family doesn't skip a beat to butcher me about it as if I don't see my face every morning. I've tried so many times to use products on my face but nothing worked so I am letting nature do its work. My mom is so strict to the point that she doesn't let me go out anywhere and it's depressing because I want to spend time with my friends before they move away for college but my mom won't budge. I've missed so many opportunities because of my mom's strictness and it's so sad to the point that I just gave up. I stopped asking her if I could go anywhere or if I could go to a school event or something that involves me going anywhere except the house. I'm at home all day forced to do chores and usually, I don't mind cleaning the whole house because it can be relaxing but none of my siblings even tries to help me so my family already expects me to clean up all the time which can be too much sometimes. I get depressed at the fact that my friends are out there having fun while I'm stuck at home. The only thing I can take control of in my life is my school work, I try my best to keep my straight A's and be a good officer in my after-school clubs. I've dedicated myself to school so much that tests have given me really bad anxiety. I barely eat until I finish my work, my sleeping schedule is messed up because of the amount of work I have, and I barely get any exercise. I'm literally so skinny and malnourished that I'm afraid that I might have anorexia at this point. But my mom doesn't even recognize my efforts, she thinks that it doesn't matter if I'm book smart when I don't even know or if I'm dumb when it comes to real-life situations. Yeah, I don't even know anymore. When college applications were happening, I couldn't even be bothered, I was too indecisive and unconfident about my skills that I didn't even try to apply for scholarships or to any colleges that I wanted. Now that my graduation is a month away, I ultimately felt like a failure before even starting. I see my friends getting accepted to colleges outside the state which made me envious that they get to leave. I'm sticking with community college which I don't mind but I don't want to stay home. My older sibling yells at me for not applying or even practicing my code programming skills. I don't feel competent enough to enter the adult world and I'm afraid that what my mom said about me is starting to be true. 

I am so tired, I haven't cleaned my room for weeks, my laundry is piled up, and I'm not taking care of myself properly. It's disgusting but I don't wash my hair for a few days and I don't brush my teeth at night. I of course still shower my body and brush my teeth in the morning before going to school. I stopped doing my skincare. I am an ultimate mess. I want to cry so bad but I feel like I don't deserve it because I did this to myself, I should have pushed through and tried my best to stay on top but it's so hard to keep my energy at 100% every time. The only thing I'm looking forward to now is getting my driver's license which I'm nervous about. I feel like if I just succeed at least at one thing I would feel more self-assured.

It's frustrating. I'm so sad that it's very tiring. I just want to fast forward life right now and go to the good parts. Luckily my friends at school give me good laughs and a break from everything. 

What do you guys do to get out of your depression? How do you guys keep going forward?"

One smell of your sweater and it instantly brought me back to us in my room, laying in bed late at night just talking and holding each other. I could feel everything that I felt that night once again so intensely. It was a second of pure bliss, to be transported back to a time when you were mine.

lonely,"I feel lonely on our family road trips, don’t know how to ask to bring my boyfriend with. Help needed!","I feel lonely on our family road trips, don’t know how to ask to bring my boyfriend with. Help needed! - Every summer my family goes on a long road trip across several states. My dad is very passionate about it and always very excited to make it “the best family bonding time ever”. I have 4 siblings in total, so our car is absolutely super packed every time. 

The thing is though, I don’t really enjoy them as much anymore. I like my family, but being with them in the car for like up to 3 weeks is just unbearable sometimes, and honestly a bit boring at times. So this year I thought of how much more enjoyable it would be if I brought someone with me, like a friend - or in this case my boyfriend. But as I said earlier, this is a FAMILY thing. So I’m not sure how to convince my dad. I’m also a bit scared of hurting his feelings, by saying I don’t think the road trips are fun or something. 

I’m just not sure how to even bring it up. It’s hard! Because I definitely feel like he could just say “no boyfriends allowed” like really fast if I went about it in the wrong way. Maybe.

i wish i could re-live my life when we were together, i miss everything about her. she was kind, sweet, funny, pretty, everything about her was perfect.

to be honest when we broke up, i was on the brink of suicide, but i would never kill myself over a woman. but i was in a deep black hole.

lonely,idek,"idek - TL;DR: Wake up, snooze. Wake up, go to work. Pay taxes, pay rent. Count pennies, stare at screens to escape reality. Cry on Reddit because you have nobody else, go to sleep. Repeat.

I don't even know why I'm writing this tbh. Was looking for painless ways to die and came across this subreddit, figured I might as well rant here since I have nobody I can really openly talk to about this topic.

I'll be graduating college soon in August after I finish out my minor. Only 3 years +2 summers for everything, with a full ride scholarship. It just makes me that much more ungrateful for even having thoughts about ending everything immediately after.

I have no direction from here. I spent the past half year trying to develop a business to provide some benefit to the world, but turns out the startup cost was way too high to really take the extreme risk. But fuck everything is more expensive these days. I spend my days working as a cog for Amazon, and with the hours they've been giving me, everything goes to rent gas and whatever other necessities.

My lease is up soon and new management will be increasing rent by $50 a month if I stay. Yay. More things I can't afford. The apartment isn't even that good, 550 sq feet and a studio apartment pretending to be a 1 bedroom. People yelling and ambulances going by every day. I'm just selling my soul to whatever work place so I can barely scrape by and live in a place I hate. 

The only thing I enjoy is playing games, escaping reality, but the more I play the more time is wasted and the more things pile up on the to do list. All I ever do is the to do list. I hate going out, my anxiety makes almost any social experience unenjoyable even if I put on a good outward experience. Combine that with no energy to ever do anything, it feels like I'm just dragging this chain and ball so that I can feed into the tax and corporate machines.

Hell, when I was exploring ways to die painlessly I was getting targeted ads for it. ""Need something to lift your spirits?"" Buy our product/service now! Hilarious.

The only time I've ever felt truly happy was on MDMA. Maybe occasionally on psychedelics too, but those are a wild card. I haven't done anything in a while because of time constraints and drug testing, but fuck for years the only thing I looked forward to was my semiannual Molly roll. 

I moved to the city I'm in now from a rural area for college, but I really made no friends in college. A few acquaintances, but nothing like I expected. Never got invited to any parties. Though I've learned to just blame the pandemic for that, even though it's definitely not the entire reason.

Of course, like anyone ever, I'd love to share real love with someone. Every relationship I've had I have had fleeting feelings, I always grew to find my partner more annoying. Maybe it's the people I was with, maybe it's me. 

I hate being a man sometimes, what I would give to have someone - anyone show interest first. If I even want a shot at feeling that way with someone, I have to initiate the idea. That means being rejected time and time again, and it's not like I'm unattractive, I've just always been the odd one and I think people pick up on that.

I think the only reason I'm still alive now is because of the unbearable pain my death would have on my mom. Everyone else would get over it eventually, but not her. Why does it seem that the only way I can find peace is by hurting who loves me most? You also can't shake the thought that you'll go to hell just for trying to escape it. Wouldn't that be funny if I left and ended up right back here.

Don't know what I'm expecting for posting this, but if you're reading this then thank you. It makes me feel like I exist, even if only through some text on a screen."

lonely,extreme loneliness and low self esteem (18F),"extreme loneliness and low self esteem (18F) - this is going to be a long rant. but i have absolutely no one to talk to.

over the course of high school, my friend group would purposely exclude me from events/hang outs, and i even got verbal proof from someone in the group that they were doing so. they were the only people i had to interact with so i clung on to what interaction i could get from them. i’m not sure why they didn’t like me and yet insisted to keep me around. i dropped out sophomore year because of covid and have found a full time job and not returned to school since. i rejected this group of friends and have had no friends since. now, up until 3 months ago, i was in a relationship and just spent all my time with my boyfriend of three years. well, three months ago, he broke up with me for another girl. now here i am, no boyfriend, no friends. at least i have my 50 hour a week job, right? well, there was this one guy i was talking to, and we immediately clicked. we hung out at least once a week and quickly got physical. i then find out he has a girlfriend. i told her about a week ago that he had been cheating on her for the past three months and things were very ugly. he blocked me and we havent spoke since. he became my best friend in such a short time and now hes gone. the only person I have in my life (quite literally the only one besides my dad) that i am ""friends"" with is a guy at my work that I have also been having sex with for the past three months. i was whoring myself out to two guys at the same time to stave off the crippling loneliness of the fact that I desperately crave a relationship. neither of them want(ed) a relationship with me. now, the only person I have left in my life to talk to, is the guy at work that i fuck. and he doesn't want to talk to me unless it's to meet up to fuck, so we're not even really friends, and i can't talk to him about anything. he won't even return my texts, he acts like he's too cool to respond to me unless he wants sex. aside from the once a week sexual interaction i get with this man, i am completely alone. i have no friends, and i desperately crave a partner. it eats me up inside every single day. the only thing i can ever think about is how no one wants to be my friend and no one wants to date me. I'm trying to lose weight currently because maybe if I'm skinny a man will like me. i'm not going to toot my own horn, but i believe in all honesty that i am attractive. so i don't really understand why no one wants a relationship with me. i do understand that a lot of the men I was making myself available to were not available themselves, and i take full fault for that. i can't tell at this point if there's something wrong with me, and that's why no man in my life will date me, or if for some reason all of the men ive had in my life don't want a relationship. I know that I am young, but I truly believe that I cannot find love. i see all these happy couples together and I just don't understand why not a single man out there wants me for me and not just for sex. i feel so worthless. i am constantly worried about my appearance in the hopes that a man will like me. i’m not openly desperate, me making this comment on this sub is quite literally the only piece of evidence as to how incredibly lonely i am. but i would almost say yes to anyone that asked me to go on a date with them at this point. why doesn’t anyone want me."
lonely,"No friends, depressed","No friends, depressed - I'm 18 and I have ASD, I've never had friends. The closest I've ever gotten to somebody, was being an acquaintance to them. Even then I'd always be left out, they'd say things like ""you wouldn't want to come"" and it was obvious that they only tolerated being around me. Someone laughed at a joke I told about three years ago and I still remember it, nobody thinks I'm funny or interesting. I even hate being in my own head, I spend a lot of time daydreaming and I know its weird but it's all I've got. I made fake friends, a fake therapist etc in my own head. I probably need therapy, as I'm incredibly depressed. But there isn't much help here in my country and it's expensive. I feel like a failure that I can't even get one person to like me, my family hate me too. I only have a good relationship with one of my siblings, the rest of my family are constantly making fun of my situation. I either cry at night, even though it's embarrassing to admit or I just sit around depressed.

lonely,Losing my few friends,"Losing my few friends - So I'm a junior in highschool and all I can say is shit sucks right now. I won't give my whole life story just kinda talk about recent stuff.

So I'm not really sure how to describe my social life. I have a small group of actual friends, like 4 or 5 people, but have quite a few people I'm more like associates with? Idk how to explain it. But recently, as in last Friday, had a falling out with one of my actual friends. There was a lot of drama and it hurt but I'm not one to drag shit out and there a few years younger so it's for the best anyways I think. The issue is they act normal with my other friends, the ones they're friends with at least, and leave when I'm around(which is mostly aggravating just bc they're the one that caused the falling out I just accepted that they didn't want to be friends anymore). Because I don't want the falling out to effect my other friends, I just stay away completely and let the 3 or 4 hang out while I do my own thing. I've essentially just allowed the falling out with one friend, that wasn't my fault, to make it to where I can't hang out with my other friends. I haven't explained the drama to the other friends, just felt it was the best, and am probably just gonna slowly lose those friends as the year ends.

This was mostly a rant but I mean is it dumb of me to leave them alone to not effect my other friends relationships with the one friend? Maybe it's dumb to not put myself first but I would feel shitty if they fall out with that friend too bc of my own issues with them."

I sat alone during lunch and listened to music, like I normally do. I also broke down crying a few times throughout the day but I hid it and I don't think anyone noticed. I cried because I've been thinking about how I'll end up lonely forever, never kissing a girl or going on a date. To make things worse, I run into a girl I had a crush on six years ago just for life to really rub that fact in my face. I'm struggling to catch up on work during my final period, and we have free seating that day. This girl and her boyfriend sit near me, but she doesn't want to sit there and she then pointed to me. I genuinely wanted to punch her in the face right there. School ends, I walk home alone, and I break down in my bathroom."

I really don't even know anymore, if I had a guaranteed way to die right now I would take the opportunity. I've tried 3 times so far and as you can tell all have failed. I just don't want to be in a world so completely alone. I just want to be love, to give my love to someone. That is apparently far too much to ask for in this dark world. I'm so unbelievably shy and pair that with ADHD and severe social anxiety I'm basically a shell. I hate feeling this way, despite feeling like this my whole life, it never gets easier, it never gets better. I'm tired of hearing people say that it does or to work on myself, how can I work on myself if I have zero will to live? Without someone to love I've never felt alive, it's as if that's how the human experience is meant to be.

lonely,Video game stories to heal the emptiness in your center?,"Video game stories to heal the emptiness in your center? - A while back, a combination of post-modern tragedies and real-life tragedies left me with a cold, empty, painful emptiness in my heart that wouldn't go away, no matter what I said or did to fight against it.

I couldn't find ways to convey my pain properly to the people around me. I tried to forget about the pain through fiction, but newer tragedies felt tame and pointless due to my familiarity with the darkness of ordinary people (who do bad things and get away with it due to hiding behind popularity though sarcasm and wit), and witty, snarky comedies felt even more pointless because I learned that most people joke about problems instead of fighting them head on.

I was in the dark for a very long time, but I stumbled upon Kingdom Hearts on PC and it somehow brought the light back into my life.

Through a combination of sympathetic characters, an ordinary, kind-hearted protagonist that anyone could to relate to, and a series of situations so absurd that there was no reason to not take them at face value... I found reasons to have hope for the world and people again, and to find a tiny bit of absurd, yet honest humor.

Does anyone here have something like that?"

lonely,I USED TO,"I USED TO - I used to get texts from real people. Now, I only get texts from my bank and business transactions. In my mid1forties, we’ll-adjusted. On paper, at least an 7.5! 

I’m Responsible, responsive, positive, happy, tenacious in life. Yet today not one phone call from anyone concerned about me! I can’t make them care. But living like this is nerve-wrecking I’m afraid of 6:00 pm, then elated that I actually made it through the night until to 6:00 am. 

All my life I’ve been socially accepted, applauded and desired. Here in Los Angeles, where I make way more money than I ever have before and I have not one single soul in a city of 20 million people that values me enough to spend a whole one hour with me! 

The “associates I do have,  I have to offer some incentive for them to even want to hang or do anything with me. It’s ok! I am starting a enjoy my own company. And frankly, there’s no drama. But at this point I wish I had just a little of that drama to drown out the fact that I’m lonely as fuck! Cute, nice body and well mannered. I think of others first - always have up until now though at least I could talk, touch, and see them. 

But now, there’s no one to even call, or to even engage in bad behavior to help me forget it all. On this Tuesday I realize, this may be the loneliest day of my entire life. I’m void! Now is the perfect time for that truck to run me over on Santa Monica Boulevard. And guess what they’d sweep my ass up and I’d be forgotten again, BEFORE morning rush hour! That’s my life today. How humbling and deeply depressing. 

The silver lining;  at least I won’t let myself down, disappoint or disappear.

I'll make small talk with people in class occasionally, and I'll joke around in class with people. But that's really about it. There's only two people who consider me to be their friend and who I ever hang out with outside of school. I'm good friends with them but to be honest it doesn't feel like I have stuff in common with them. Like we're friends by default. And for some reason it feels harder to make friends with those in the more advanced classes I take.

Back when I was a kid I made friends really easily.  I don't know how I did it. But ever since I was 10 something changed. I think I've lost about 6 friends from 2015- present because we simply drifted apart.

I'm not a weird kid. Like I don't feel like I'm off
putting to anybody. I think part of the reason is that I have a ton of social anxiety and I rarely talk to others. But even if I didn't have the anxiety I still don't know what I would talk about.

lonely,Anybody else have female friends that do this?,"Anybody else have female friends that do this? - I’ve (M 24) got two female friends (who I’ve never considered more than friends). Let’s just say genetics were great to them and on top of that they are incredibly kind, they could go out in less than an hour get a date.

So I go to them for advice on any romantic partners. My romantic life has been nothing but bread-crumbing since I was 17. Prom dates bailed before it happened. Went to college and got breadcrumbed all 4.5 years it took me to graduate. And even after with the girl I though was the one turned out to be a fun 2 year breadcrumb. I’ve asked their advice CONSTANTLY! About if these girls had actual interest (they assured me they did), what my situation was, and why they bread-crumbed me. I give them every detail and how it fell apart and they always determine that the girl was a horrible person and that I didn’t deserve to be treated that way and I did everything I could and more. 

Now I have a good career, I’m making money, I’ve got sone friends including them, I don’t think I’m bad looking, I exercise and try to eat right. Whenever I ask these two friends what’s wrong with me or what I can do to change and they always tell not to change and that it’s just the situation with todays girls or todays society treating me like crap. I’ve got two people who anybody would be lucky to go on a date with telling me this and it’s just like… really? If I’m such a great guy and have all these qualities then how come it’s always like this? Maybe I should just ask them out as a ruse and get them to fess up why they wouldn’t because seriously after 7 years of constant bs, All that talk has done is lower my opinion on dating; I’m literally thinking in my head anymore “ok… we hit it off real good, I’ll keep at it and hopefully this is the one but honestly wonder how long this one will breadcrumb me for?”"

lonely,Loneliness is not the problem,"Loneliness is not the problem - For a long time I thought that loneliness is some kind of a problem that I'm facing and I need to overcome it, but after thinking (a lot) about it, I see that it may not be the case. Perhaps someone else here is feeling similarly, so I want to share what I've been thinking.

Loneliness is not the main problem, it's merely a consequence of other underlying issues. Loneliness feels like you're lacking something: a touch, a hug, a conversation, a kiss, you name it. But ask yourself, why are you lacking that? Is it really because the world is an unfair place and nobody cares about you? Well, sort of, but not really. You feel lonely because you don't get what you want and what you need. Ask yourself why don't you get that? The answer to that will direct you to the real problem. Maybe it's because you're shy and don't hang out with a lot of people, or maybe there's something you say or do that sets others off to look away. Whatever the case, identifying it and working on solving it will bring you good fortune. It will allow you to show yourself better to others and tell them what you need, so that they can finally see you and be with together you.

Loneliness is the feeling your body signals to you that something is not right and you should take action to fix it."

I can't go to bars and besides that i'm not welcomed at any local ones because they are for more affluent people.  I barely have the willpower to type this. I tried online dating but I'm a hundred miles from any city. I lost everything during my breakup. I live with my elderly and ill mother. If i lose her i have lost the only person who legitmately cares about me. It is unfair because i supported the ex during her mother's death. I feel so alone and vulnerable.

lonely,Everyone else in my family has friends but I don’t,Everyone else in my family has friends but I don’t - I always watch my family text or be with their friends and I get so jealous I’m a 16 year old male from the us and I don’t have any friends of my own it’s like the world is rubbing it in my face that no one needs or wants me around my family thinks I have friends but I really don’t have anyone outside of the house besides my girlfriend I don’t really ever leave the house either or go anywhere I do online schooling where it’s just me vs the iPad my girlfriend also has friends and I’m so jealous of them we were just watching a movie and she says she’s gonna hang out with her friend Saturday and that made my whole mood shift I don’t even wanna be here anymore

lonely,everytime I feel confident I go to Tinder,"everytime I feel confident I go to Tinder - because I'm 100% alone and I totally try to enjoy these moments of self confidence, but I always kill my brief good/neutral mood and all my day — week or even month — being ghosted, getting one or two matches or none at all.  

it is a fucking spiral of pain and sadness"
lonely,What loneliness is,"What loneliness is - Loneliness is when nobody is sad to see you leave. Loneliness is when nobody is disappointed when you're not there, or even care at all. Loneliness is when you walk behind on the sidewalk, or nobody waits for you. Loneliness is when you're in a group and you try to talk but no one acknowledges you or even looks at you. Loneliness is when people treat you differently because they can tell there is something wrong with you. They give you a look of pity, indifference, disgust or smug arrogance. Loneliness is having no one to love you when you feel down, no one to support you when you're struggling, no one to help you up when you fall, and no one to encourage you when you feel discouraged. Loneliness is feeling completely and totally useless and unlovable because you are alone when near everyone else is surrounded by people who care for them. Total isolation is a pain incompatible with the human soul, as human beings are social creatures who NEED, I repeat NEED love and attention to be psychologically healthy. Without them, people begin to fall apart."
lonely,Any females over 30 in here?,"Any females over 30 in here? - I’d love to make some female friends to chat with from time to time. I am 36, female, and married. So I am not looking for any sort of relationship outside of friendship. I also have a teenager.

lonely,A good group of friends would be so nice.,"A good group of friends would be so nice. - I know that there are also fake friends, people that only use you and sometimes it is better to just focus on yourself but sometimes I think to have some people that really care for you would be so nice. Just a group you can spend your freetime with, that shares the same intrests and that supports you if you got any problems. 
I think thats something that is really missing in my life even though I normally like beeing alone."
lonely,Transferring Colleges,"Transferring Colleges - Hey there, 

I'm an actor and student in the Columbus, Ohio, area, and I go to a community college in this area. It was primarily great throughout this first year, especially the last semester. (I moved here from a small town. now I live with an Uncle.)  I made some decent friends, got a well-paying job, found a mentor, and have taken on some training and projects in my field. On paper, things are/were going well. 

Well, about a month ago, I made a mistake that cost me my friends. I go to classes but sit alone while they have a good time; I'm no longer invited to things, and just overall lonely. 

On the contrary, at a university, I have friends (from my hometown before I moved) who cherish and miss me and have actively wanted me to go to school there with them. I told them probably after I got my associate's degree unless something bigger came up. Regardless, I love and miss them, and I love and miss the love they give me. 

Well, situation arose; my birth mom is homeless, and we're looking to live together. She is content with living anywhere. 

anywhere.

The college I'm interested in, starting a year lease while I finish my associate's degree, up to my hometown, Cleveland. Anywhere. 

So, I'm extremely lonely, and my heart longs for my best buds back, but I should PROBABLY stay here for another year where I essentially go to college for free, yeah? 


do I follow my brain or my heart? is my brain even correct in staying? they have good theatre programs there too. 

for further note. My best friend's partner (who goes to the school and enjoys my company during discord calls and stuff) asked to do a reading (tarot) on the situation. She pretty clearly read that going there would enact better and healthier self-growth. Of course, this could be wish fulfillment and not mean anything, but man, if the universe wants it... 

(I could also likely afford a one bedroom apartment if my mom decides to move elsewhere) 


tl;dr

 do I follow my brain or my heart? Do I move?"
lonely,life really sucks sometimes,"life really sucks sometimes - This is probably going to be a long one as I'm just going to be putting down whatever pops into my mind.

I've recently came out of a 2 month relational its been 2 months since we've broken up. She moved on really quick and withing 2 weeks, she called me on discord to ask if this guy that worked in pizza hut had a crush on her or on her friend. She then also told me how she has a crush on this guy she worked with. I supported her every time. Even when it hurt, even when I didn't want too. I still put my feelings aside to help her because I wanted her happy. She ended up finding out the guy had a girlfriend and stopped pursuing him. Today she told me she was getting tinder and as a joke I said I'd get it if she got it and for some reason she got really aggressive with me and blunt asking why I cared and why it mattered. I told her it doesn't and then she asked why does it bother me. I just told her I wasn't bothered i just made a joke. 

Idk everytime I try to help, try to do the right thing I get it spat back into my face. I get a brief period of things going my way and then I have to be shown my place again, which is being needed but not appreciated.

I want someone to acknowledge me to accept me for my faults for when I get things wrong. Someone who doesn't make me feel like I have to always do what's right and that I'm not allowed to fuck up or I'd get shit on by others. 

I'm tired, I'm frustrated, I'm overwhelmed by everything and yet nothing at the same time. I want so many things that just seems impossible to achieve."

lonely,Weekends,"Weekends - Am I the only one who’s emotions are normal in weekdays, but when weekend comes I feel so sad because I have nothing to do cause I don’t have any friends and then you see all the posts on social media and then i'm just so jealous and there's nothing you can do about it but then I just can’t stop thinking about it☹️

I'm just wondering if I'm the only one or does some people feel like this too?😐"
lonely,I am alone.,"I am alone. - I am a 17 male and i am alone, with this i don't mean that I'm felling lonely, that's different and i fell that as well, but i been growing up almost all alone.

I am not here to talk that i never had a girlfriend and how ugly i am, because i wish that was my only problem.
I am so alone that i don't have literally 1 friend, and if you think this is bad its actually worst, basically i don't have a family (i have but i have no contact because they live really far), the only person that lives with me is my mom but our friendship is really weak and if she wasn't my mom we probably wouldn't even be friends.

My mom and i just talk for like 20 minutes in a full day sometimes not even that.

You could say that i should start doing something, like playing basketball or whatever, but i have depression as well, it all started a long time ago (when i was 11) but right now all i do is fake my loneliness and depression.
Im actually going to therapy, because i failed a suicide attempt a few months ago but i lie to them saying that i am really happy and my life has changed because i don't want to get in trouble.

I really wanna kill myself and the only thing that doesn't make me do it it's because I'm afraid of failing."
lonely,This girl likes me yet I refuse to see it,"This girl likes me yet I refuse to see it - I’m confused. Also somewhat scared. My mind is somewhat distraught, and I don’t know what to do to fix it. Saying I’m mentally broken down would probably be an understatement. My upbringing was somewhat normal, although I think my parents’ 7 year custody divorce effected me more than I actually understand. I love the idea of love and starting a family. Now I’m 20, but I’ve never felt grown up. I skated by in high school despite being a fair bit smart. Everyone on my mom’s side is an engineer and stresses that as the only career. Every father before me was in the military, and I personally see that as a path but a major decision. I have passions but no drive. I’m part of an acting agency, and I strive to play the guitar to a professional degree. My closest friends are life-long of 15-16 years. I’ll be 21 in a few months and life seems fast as light. I’ve been to community college and flunked the first semester even after taking a year off after high school. Did a second semester and repeated two classes. Got A’s in the classes I repeated but still only have a 2.0 GPA. I’ll have a 4.0 if I retake the twos F’s I got and get A’s. I failed three classes first semester and withdrew from three second semester because I thought. I only have two passed classes from two semesters. I withdrew from classes because I almost joined the Marine Corps; I had an 88 on the asvab. Throughout school, I usually got female attention. I guess I’m decently looking and somewhat funny. I’ve never had a relationship or kiss with in my 20 years of life because I avoided relationships. I didn’t have my license until 19. I didn’t see way in actually having a relationship, and I often doubted myself. I recently asked a girl for her number the first time in my life from one of my college classes. I didn’t say anything to her all year, but many hints were given to me that she liked me. She’s almost opposite my physical preference, but I still find her beautiful. By far the best looking girl I’ve had a crush on. Personality wise we’re similar. She made the point that she’s only dated ugly guys when we started talking, and that kind of made me wonder about myself. Based off of our texts it would seem she’s quite into me, yet I don’t understand why I feel she doesn’t actually like me. This isn’t something I let on or voice to her, but when I think about it, it saddens me. I feel as though I’m just waiting for her to ghost me. She’s never explicitly said she likes me or thinks I’m funny or handsome. We went on a date to see a movie that we talked and laughed through, but I just don’t know. I would love for someone to read my texts to give me insight. She let me borrow a movie and gave me hug then we parted. We had a 4 hour phone call and texted for hours, yet I’m still at the hands of my own thought. I think any logical person would slap me for saying she’s doesn’t like me, but based off of my personal thoughts, I can’t shake the feeling. She’s better looking, smarter, and super funny. I believe I have attachment problems and a fear of intimacy, as well as horrible self doubt. I don’t show these things at all, but they live in me. I’m scared she’s going to leave at any second with no warning and that is going to absolutely crush me. I’m trying to purposely not get attached to her because I fear her departure is inevitable.

TL;DR:I asked for a girls number for the first time April 27th. We’ve texted every day since and have had phone calls, one of which lasted 4 hours. All the texts indicates she likes me. We went on a 1 date and she left me borrow a movie of hers, then we hugged and left. All this considered, I can’t help that she doesn’t like me and will leave any second. I believe this due to my past I would assume, and the fact that she is better in every way. I don’t show or voice any of this to her though."
lonely,F54 MISFIT,"F54 MISFIT - It's bizarre that people tell me I'm pretty and I know I'm a good person but I don't feel like I fit in anywhere or with anyone. I had one friend who got me but she went in another direction and we're not close anymore. Does anyone else understand this?  Why I always feel like I'm on the outside looking in. It makes me depressed and socially anxious. It really makes life suck to the 5,000th degree."
lonely,I want life to be like a room you can leave for a while,"I want life to be like a room you can leave for a while - I want life to be like a room you can leave for a while. But no, you always have your responsibilities, curtains. Real life scares me. As a teenager, I didn't enjoy it much. I'm tired, no one can help us, only myself, here we have it, another responsibility. It sometimes hurts so much when something is expected of you and you don't know exactly what the problem is. What is it? I want someone, I want someone to take care of me for a while, I want someone to come and make me a better person. No one will come, I can only cry quietly, and hope that the next math test will turn out well and the rest of life as well. Sometimes I feel like I'm rubbing. From the heart, from the soul. How all this makes sense, I am sick of this world who cannot give me fulfillment, understanding, nothing. I just want break man,ok dad?ok mom? Ok grandpa anoying neighbor?ok teacher of language? Ok profesors? Ok life?

lonely,life Is fucking pointless,"life Is fucking pointless - I can't take this shit anymore what the actual fuck is the point of existing on this planet when nobody gives a single fuck about, what's the point of going to work 40 hours a week to get a paycheck just to exist when you have literally nothing and no one to keep you excited to get through the week , wasting 4 years at uni with no one giving a fuck about to get a degree just to work in shitty mean less jobs that don't even relate to your degree, it never fucking changes it always the same bullshit every time and if you complain about this shit to anyone they always act like your the fucking problem"
lonely,What are the best sites to talk to girls?,"What are the best sites to talk to girls? - Whether that be Twitch, a camgirl site, etc."
lonely,Why does it hurt so much?,Why does it hurt so much? - I have some friends but I don’t hang out with them that often. Virgin and never had a gf. Legitimately have not touched a human female besides a handshake for 2+ years. I wouldn’t say I’m always in pain but When I am it’s just pure existential dread. My brain is just sending pain signals over and over because I can’t get a mate. The voice inside my head keeps telling me that it’s over and I’m not attractive enough while simultaneously giving me hope and something to keep fighting for. How am I going to stop the pain?
lonely,How to feel extra lonely,"How to feel extra lonely - You may think to feel extra lonely you just gotta be locked up in your room by yourself. But that’s not true. You’ll feel the MOST lonely when you’re around thousands of people, all who have their little groups and cliques which they belong to and they’re laughing and having fun and you don’t belong anywhere, in any group, or to anyone."
lonely,Don’t know what to do,"Don’t know what to do - Basically the title , I feel suicidal, I have done for a very long time , but I have periods where I won’t feel suicidal , and then I’ll feel bad for feeling suicidal in the first place cause ,idk it sounds stupid ,but it feels like I’m faking it lmao , I don’t get it"

lonely,Can any of you talk about loneliness to a therapist or any other type of professional?,"Can any of you talk about loneliness to a therapist or any other type of professional? - I'm being offered a new therapist after my last one but this one doesn't seem like she will understand or care about me. The last one I got lucky with and the moment I talked to her she gave off the vibe of caring that caused me to be at ease. Her empathy made it easier to talk to and when I talked about my loneliness, she said I don't understand what it's like to never have a sig. other but I will do everything I can to help you with your depression that comes from loneliness. She started complimenting me and then I prompty developed a crush on her haha. She left so I've been without a therapist and have been doing poorly but they offered me a new one. I talked to her on the phone and I got a very different vibe from her. One of almost hostility. Maybe she will be different than I assume but I'm worried she will go back to the playbook of, you need to get out there. 

Have you ever talked to a professional about your loneliness and what was the result? Most of them can't relate or don't understand so they give the same advice they give everyone. Write your feelings down, stop negative self-talking, and go out more. My last therapist avoided doing that. If we had been together for a few more months, I could have begun to turn things around. Now it seems to back to the routine of cliche advice that is told because they don't understand or care about my situation. I know some of you posted about your experiences with hotlines and I had similar experiences but what about with professionals? Before someone says it, the other therapists didn't fail because I didn't want to change and if I had been lucky enough to keep my old therapist, I would have begun to change. She made me feel so good and I miss her every day. They never understood or cared. Has loneliness been a taboo topic to bring up with professionals? What have you been through with them if anything?"
lonely,Better to be in hell with an enemy than to be in heaven alone.,Better to be in hell with an enemy than to be in heaven alone. - Im sure this is nasty common. I told my ex-wife this when she asked why my former friend was with someone he despises. I think she understood I mean her too. As a kid I always felt I'm alone even in rooms filled with familiar faces.
lonely,Bad Ending,"Bad Ending - Everything is ****ed up. My collage exams are ****ed up, I dont have money in my pocket my friends are ****ed up. Grow up without love from my parents. They never support me from anything. I am really tired. I dont even show any emotion to anyone. Today I tried the cry but I can’t even cry. Only little bit tear come up from my eyes. Even my breath didnt change. Just callous cold face without any gesture. Also no luck from love. I just wanna put a gun under my chin and pull the trigger. This is not my world. I cant take it anymore. Nothing positive happening. I have no one. Just few online friends. But I dont wanna show my emotions to them. There is no where to go so I decide to write my feelings here. I wish I could suicide. I dont even think people will miss me. Just one week they will pity me after that they will forget everything about me. I swear death is calling me I can feel inside, on my skin. Like very cold hands touching gentle on my skin, my neck my arms."
lonely,Active Telegram group looking for fresh blood,Active Telegram group looking for fresh blood - [removed]
lonely,I'm not even sure what I want anymore,"I'm not even sure what I want anymore - I often feel lonely and crave human interaction and/or affection, but I've always also isolated myself and pushed people away. I never message anyone first. I often don't answer messages in days, and when I do it's just a single sentence and I never ask much back from them besides ""how are you?"". Even if I care about them, I don't enjoy talking with people daily if we have nothing to talk about.

My ex messaged me today and it was the only thing I tried to answer faster to, but even she said I seemed cold and asked if I was okay. I said I'm fine, and I feel like I am. Then she said ""You don't seem like you want to talk to me"" and that really got me thinking, why do I do this?

It's not like I don't want these people in my life, I need them. But I still keep pushing them away and act apathetic and emotionless around them. I still like hanging out with friends IRL sometimes, but messaging or calling people has become a chore. I don't even want to focus on my hobbies anymore, everything just feels too messy. I have projects cluttered everywhere around me, people saying things left and right, It's just a lot of pressure. I just want to be and stay alone, but also not.

I guess this all has something to do with the fact that I judge everything about myself so heavily when I message or call someone. I think it might be because I've always felt very judged by others and I try to do my best to make others think that I'm not boring, annoying or an awful person. I've noticed I can take 10 minutes typing out a single sentence because I keep changing it and overthinking things. I think I also hate my own voice and seeing myself so I don't like calls/videocalls and feel uncomfortable. I really feel somewhat okay only when interacting with people in person. It's just so much easier to say anything and be myself. Is that weird?"
lonely,I think my depression stems from loneliness,"I think my depression stems from loneliness - For years I was ok with being alone, hell, I made sure I was alone. I didn’t want anyone and I made it a point to prove to myself, to my family, to everyone really that I don’t need anyone, cause I don’t, and I never did. I got where I am today alone. By myself. My parents were abusive/emotionally neglectful, I may have been better off without them, who knows, doesn’t matter, my point is I’ve been alone since the beginning. 

But then, I got a taste of what it’s like to be desired.. to have someone there.. and he was only here a short while… and I became so… ANXIOUS.. the fear of abandonment was so intense. It drove him away. 

He’s gone, that doesn’t matter now. But now I think… I don’t wanna be alone.. I wanna have someone who I love and who loves me back, completely. I don’t wanna be strong and alone all the time anymore. I want someone to share the good times AND the bad times with. I’ve always done the hard shit alone. I don’t wanna do it alone anymore. I want a best friend, a lover, my person. I want it. I wonder if I’ll ever find one now.."
lonely,Guy really fucked me up F21,"Guy really fucked me up F21 - I got asked out by 3 cute guys the other day, and like a reflex I told them all that I had a bf. Im sad because I’m lonely yet when I’m faced with guys who want to get to know me I get scared. I don’t even know why but I’m terrified to date I just have this preassumption that all guys will let me down and deep rooted hurt from previous interactions with guys with nasty narcissistic behaviour really affected me. Like to my core. It’s made me so scared to date I didn’t even realise. I’m not even going to rant on this post about what he did because it’s just so fucked up. Think emotional abuse, at least that’s what It felt like. Does anyone have any advice or just words of support or something that isn’t the typical “learn to love yourself” because I do that’s not the problem"
lonely,Nobody listens,"Nobody listens - I'm lucky to be surrounded by family, friends and friendly coworkers (partially) and I know that it's a blessing as some people dont have these relations but even though I have all these people around me, it feels like I'm a ghost who just exists and is mentioned from time to time.

I try to strike up conversation with family sometimes and its met with ""cool, cool anyways"" but if my siblings or cousins or other relations were to talk to the same people I do it would turn into a fulfilling conversation for them.

I'm definitely shy but by no means a bystander in conversations I try to get involved but I usually get shut out. Back in school I'd hear my group of friends chatting and try talking and get ignored, I only had 3 or 4 people who actually listened to me and those conversations were always fulfilling, wacky but genuine.

I had a conversation with my boss today, he thinks I'm a slacker who doesnt work when his eye isnt on me, didnt bother listening to my words, he just made an assumption because of his arrogance and ignorance. Truthfully, I finish my work in about 2 hours and try to be helpful doing random bits here and there but I'm usually wandering for the better part of 1 and a half hours trying to figure out what I can do. It really sucks and of course since I'm new no blame can go to anyone else, people who told me to do one thing and now I get told another. 

I used to suffer from serious temper tantrums but I got a grasp on that and its one of my proudest moments but today I almost snapped, I was on the verge of hitting something and had to really feel myself back in to not explode, later on I was chatting to my parent and pretty much got flamed for believing in a right to privacy online, instead of listening they just went on a tirade about why privacy online is dumb, I informed about being in the final stages of preparation for my driving test and once again ignored, second my sibling opens up about eventually doing their test, a conversation starts.

I hate these people and everyday I seek a lifeline to get me out of here, I'm at the point where I just pray on a dream to win millions in the lotto or become some overnight sensation with music but I know in a failure, an outcast, a ghost and i know that if i died it would be crocodile tears and a month of mourning till my name is forgotten.

I'm not depressed or suicidal, I think at least but it genuinely concerns me that my only options at this point, to escape my current life is bad actions, death or to continue my life for another 20 years till I finally have enough money to buy a shitty shack in the middle of nowhere.

I probably wont be listened to here and honestly this is just me getting heavy shit off my chest. It's the only way I can express how I feel knowing the only thing that can be judged is my words and my tag. The only emotions I seem to be feeling is sadness and anger now, happiness comes in isolation but I never smile, I cant smile. 

If you got this far, listen to those close to you, they may be more grateful for your ears than you might think, don't block them out."
lonely,"Hi, I need some advice","Hi, I need some advice - Hi, I have been feeling more and more lonely lately. I have never been in a relationship before. 
I'm only 16 so that might explain a bit.

I have been getting feelings for a girl in my class lately and I'm twisted inside. I don't know if I am developing feelings for her or not. I would like to get to know her better since we haven't really talked to eachother that much but I have the feeling that she would be creeped out if I ask her out because it would be a little out of the blue.
So far she seems super nice/friendly and I don't want to make it awkward between us in the future. I'm not really scared to be turned down but that she would feel weirded out and awkward."

In all seriousness tho it's pretty draining, I been on my feet working all for 7 hours and then I finish work just a few hours before I go to bed, I don't really have anyone to talk to when I get back from work so I just go home and spend the evening by myself for the most part, looking for ways to pass the time. Then it's back to my shitty job tomorrow and the cycle repeats

So yeah if anyone sees this and feels like talking, feel free to send a message :)

Dont get me wrong, i enjoy some time for myself to mess around, but it gets lonely fast.

The problem is when your this age and have no experience things become so much harder. Everyone expects you to know what to do. I have no clue how to handle a conversation with woman romantically.

lonely,I really want to go to a concert tonight but I’m super anxious going alone…,"I really want to go to a concert tonight but I’m super anxious going alone… - I’ve been struggling with real life friends. Keeping them, making them, maintaining them. I don’t often feel understood and I have people who often say they’ll do things “I’ll let you know my schedule on Sunday” and then then don’t text for a whole week. As if they forget I exist or don’t care to keep their commitments.

So even though I bought two tickets to this concert, hoping by now I’d have someone to invite, I’m going by myself. It feels scary because it’s my first heavy concert in a while. 

There could be moshing or who knows what. I haven’t been to a heavy concert in a long time. I wish I had a friend to stand with on the sidelines or to hold my glasses and encourage me to go in.

Instead I’ll likely be standing on the sidelines, holding a drink, wearing earplugs and a mask.

I get most nervous about parking. I have to drive to the city and park and it stresses me out. Had hoped having someone else would help me push through it.

But the person flaked.

I also have other stressors pressing on me, like taking leave from work, my disability claim, waiting on my diagnosis, gearing up to make art for a show in a few weeks, what’s a fair price for cutting my lawn, etc.

I’m lonely and anxious and stressed and feel stuck in perpetual dysfunction.
I’m happier living alone but I wish I had insight and someone to bounce things off of.

I want to go, and it’ll probably be fun. I’m just really nervous and lonely. I feel like it’ll be hard to shake the pang of having 2 tickets and just going by myself. Knowing that the person I kept trying to invite doesn’t really care much about me."

Every day it’s the same. Every day it’s the same."
lonely,How do you cope with being alone the rest of your life?,"How do you cope with being alone the rest of your life? - Bit of background: I'm a 30 year old white male. Obese, otherwise below-average appearance (*maybe* a 4/10 in a perfect outfit, at a healthy weight). Socially anxious to the point of basically being an agoraphobe. Live with my parents. No IRL friends. No significant other. 2 siblings and 1 ""faux"" sibling. No other close family. Dead end job that pays OK but in this economy, not enough to move out. Decent car. Get along OK with co-workers but none are more than acquaintances.  

Only hobbies are gaming and hiring women to sleep with me, if you can call either of those things hobbies. If I had friends, I'd watch movies/TV shows, go out to eat, play board games, go mini golfing, bowling or even to amusement parks, but without friends none of those things are appealing, or sometimes even possible. Finally, I have a very ""avoidant"" and sometimes even ""grating"" personality. I'm easily irritable, and quick to correct people on semantic shit or finish their sentences if they're taking too long to do so themselves. My short temper and otherwise bland mannerisms basically make me the exact opposite of a good or interesting person/friend.  

So, I know what you're gonna say: ""All of those things are changeable."" And I agree completely. But I also know myself. I know there is no possible way that I'm ever going to figure out how to motivate myself to take the necessary steps required to fix any of these things. Something as simple as ""eat less food, idiot"" has been a stumbling block since I was a child. Every time I hit the smallest bit of resistance, I immediately quit. That's just how I am. I know that, I've accepted that. But it means that changing all of the things that are preventing me from finding friends is impossible for me. That's just how it is.  

So how am I supposed to cope with never having friends to hang out with? To never have a shoulder to cry on when I've had a rough week? To never have someone next to me in the theater that I can whisper theories to, or enjoy a fantastic meal with, or take in a great view in each other's company? Any tips on figuring that out would be very helpful. I'm getting a cat in a week or two so after that I won't really be able to rely on suicidal ideation to help me cope, because I won't be able to end my life while I'm directly responsible for another life, which was my coping method in the past."

lonely,I wish I could just wake up and not be asexual anymore.,"I wish I could just wake up and not be asexual anymore. - I made a post on a different subreddit hoping to find some new people to chat to. I mentioned being asexual because I thought it would cut down on the number of creepy messages and nudes in my inbox. Instead, I got almost no replies. Still a few dicks though. (Except one guy who wanted to chat on Snap, which I don't feel comfortable using since so many people use it for sexting.)

When I was in college, a friend told me, ""No one will ever love you if they can't f--k you,"" and as I've gotten older, I worry he was right.

I'm not in the right emotional state to be dating, I just want a couple new friends since so many of mine have drifted away. But I'm not flirtatious and I'm not sexy, and that's what people want.

lonely,Sexual frustration is horrible,"Sexual frustration is horrible - (TMI warning about sex) 

The number 1 cause of my loneliness is that I don’t have any friends. I’d take a friend over a partner any day. I’d happily die a virgin and never fall in love if it means I could have a life long friend.

But sex is still a huge part of desire and being a virgin is shit. I’m gay and very very horny, if I was attractive I’d be a slut and have sex every day, I wank 10 times a day and always have. I adore men, I find virtually all men I’ve ever seen extremely attractive. But they aren’t attracted back. It’s literally impossible to find someone who is actually attracted to me. I mean yeah some people will fuck anything drunk and horny, but they don’t actually fancy me. On Grindr I never see anyone who looks like me, no one is in my ‘league’ (to use a superficial term). Half of them are super good looking and the other half fit into peoples ‘type’ flawlessly. But literally no one is my level of unattractive.

Sex isn’t something I’ll ever get to enjoy and it sucks so much because I really want to enjoy that part of my identity and Id enjoy and appreciate it so much but I never will. I mean maybe when I’m old I’ll be more desirable because some people like old men but I probably won’t live long enough.

The worst part is how no man has ever fancied me, not one, which makes me feel completely worthless because I fancy literally all men. I just someone in the world would I’d me as hot as I find them. It really sucks. But at least there’s porn these days. I’ll just have to become one of those perverts who prefers wanking to actual sex 😭"

Ik I'll never be good enough, but the thing that kills is when people assume I've never, in my 30 years, given anything an honest try. Like dude, I didnt come into this world knowing I was a loser. It's something I had to learn through experience. Whatever part of me you would call a personality is incompatible with a relationship, being that it's too cold, uncomfortable, and ill-experienced. I hate this place and I just want a factory reset on my brain."

I was in year 11 when the pandemic began so we did online for months then my anxiety sky rocketed so I kept doing it online and tried moving to a full time online hs but it took until the middle of my final year to get approved so I had so much work to catch up on and it just made my depression feel much worse so I just didn’t do anything other than stay in my bed I got kicked out of hs and I wanted to cry I feel so angry that I didn’t get to finish hs.

I can’t go to uni until I’m 21, Idek what I even wanna be when I’m older I have never had any aspirations for a career growing up. All my siblings have partners or childhood friends and I don’t have anyone I’ve wanted to kill myself so many times but I don’t think I ever will because I’m just too scared too, plus I’m in government support for money so my mum and brother would probably be homeless or something if I did die.

5. When do you usually use social media? (After getting off work? At night? When feeling lonely?)
6. Which social media do you use the most? what do you use it for? (For example?) Does using social media help you with your loneliness? Are you using social media to get over it? how?
7. Will try to meet friends using social media/software? (Why don't you use social software to meet friends, think it's unsafe, unreliable, or shy?)

I’ve come to accept it but it still hurts. And that I have to see you so often brings it back up in my mind again and again. I know I’m far from perfect but I always tried. I would try to communicate about what was bothering me but either you’d change the subject or forget by the next day and go back to doing what you and your ‘buddies’ wanted. I knew I want your highest priority but looking back I don’t think I even made the top ten. Then to top it off, you ended it in the way you knew would hurt the most. That almost killed me.

The thing is that i don't care anymore that im lonely. People can say/do whatever the fuck they want, taunt, bully or punch i don't fucking care.

I have learned my lessons a long time ago, and im not affraid to fight back with you fuckers...

This is just an update in my journey, not ""whining how lonely i am"" or ""how much i hate being alone"". If you are up to that, you are just pathetic... Those kinds of people can't just accept the facts that nobody cares about them lol.

Loneliness is okay if you are used to it. Ofc if you are weak minded (like most people are) its gonna be hard, but thats not my problem. 

Obviously the awful memories are still there, ain't those going away, but they have given me so much hope on my future of never need to be around fuckers anymore, and it also gives me joy to think how shit the life is currently on those who had the guts to punch me or taunt me...

May everyone of those fuck off like my parents, bullies and co-workers.

Have an fucking awful life."

I'm really feeling the loneliness tonight, or maybe just this past week. My bday came and went, I took the day off from work and nothing really happened. I bought my mom a gift that she liked for mothers day so I'm pretty proud of that. I end up going to my room and just be on my phone and pc for the rest of the night. Not talking to anyone or doing anything that I was planning on doing. I feel like I'm in depression again, something that I've been struggling with for a majority of my life. Once I turned everything off and lay in bed, that's when it hits me. I want someone to hug. Idk if it's me wanting to hug them in order to comfort them or them hugging me in order to comfort me, but I want to feel someone's warmth and hear their quiet breaths as they feel safe in my arms.
I don't know why there's shame in to feeling lonely, people making throwaway accounts or making up lies in order to hide our loneliness. I do it to some degree. I don't really use this account so I feel more comfortable to just post here.
I have a hard time maintaining my friendships cause I end up just wanting to curl up into a ball and lay on my bed for the night, holding onto my pillow like if it was someone to hug.
I realized how lonely I was when I got fired from my previous job. I was just roaming around with my car, with no goal in mind. I would just roam malls and fast foods while I just watch everyone pass by me with a friend to accompany them. I felt like I had an empty hole in my chest, that I was ready to burst into tears the moment I'd get back in my car to go back home.
I don't really have a point to make with this post. I just wanted to type down these feelings I have in here and feel like people are going to give a shit with what I have to say"

Anxiety is making me second guess everything. My feelings, my perceptions, her feeling snd intentions, the feelings and intentions of everyone else. my own body. I don't know what is real and what is the anxiety taking over and making me paranoid. I'm certain of nothing. I just want a hug from someone who makes me feel safe.

lonely,I have always felt alone,"I have always felt alone - I have always felt like people pretend to like me in person but think/say otherwise once i’m out of their general vicinity. I am generally a quiet/shy person but once I am comfortable with someone I can be myself, however it feels like people get bored of me before I can usually be myself completely. I have a few co-workers that I have tried to make an effort with to be closer as friends outside of work, but I am normally ignored (on text) and canceled on when plans are made. I understand that perhaps they may have anxiety themselves which may make them hesitant to hangout in person but it just feels like I am avoided. I always try to make people happy by doing little things like giving small gifts on bdays or special occasions and bringing treats to work, but once my bday came everyone forgot, I dont even care to get anything but even a text would have made me feel visible. I feel like people often forget about me because I am so quiet. I only have one semi-close friend outside of work, I dont see her very often and we dont talk daily.She normally only talks to me when she wants something from me, like to use my clothes. Nor do I have an intimate relationship with anyone. I just wish I could find my group of people in life. I even once went to a therapist and she recommended I reach out to my friends to seek support in aiding my mental health and honestly it felt like a punch in the gut bc I dont have anyone and she just kept insisting that I must have atleast one friend. I do try to keep myself busy so I go to the gym often when im not working but other than that my life is nearly pointless."

I see some of you are lonely but are in relationships, some of you are lonely because you broke up with someone, and some of you are like me who has never had a sig. other. I wish I knew what to say to help all of you. My experiences have been so negative, I don't know how to help. I probably make it worse with my defeatist attitude. Thanks for making me feel welcome. A few people have done the tough love thing and I'm sure it helps for some people but I'm well beyond help and have lost the will to ever believe I will find a girl. I'm glad some people understand. Being alone all my life, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. You all are stronger people than you think. Finding people who I can relate to has done some good to me. I'm still a hopeless cause but at least some people understand what I'm going through unlike almost all of the professionals I've talked to.

lonely,"Seething, misplaced jealousy","Seething, misplaced jealousy - I'm gonna try to make this as short as I can, but I only really have online friends. The few friends I have IRL, I haven't seen in years. So all I really have are my online friends, which I can hardly even count on to begin with anyhow because they all have actual, real fucking lives outside of our online friendship.

I don't. 

I don't have anything going on, and the rare times we call they tell me all about what crazy stuff they got going on, their IRL friends, love interests, whatever it may be... and I can't help but feel deep envy. It's bad, because they're my friend, and I know they're probably not doing this purposefully, but it feels as if they're shoving their great social lives in my face.

The only romantic relationship I've ever had was online.

I can't relate to this shit.

I don't party, or see my IRL friends every other fucking day, or none of that.

I find myself getting irrationally angry listening to them talk about it, and have to catch myself because I don't want to be mean to them for just talking about their social lives.

But... I'm envious of their flourishing IRL social life, and how to them, our online friendship is probably not as important given the real stuff they have going on.

And to me... it's pretty much my whole world.

lonely,sometimes i imagine,"sometimes i imagine - sometimes i imagine that i do have someone, someone that loves me, he cares about me, he understands me, sometimes even better that myself, he hugs me and i just feel like im not alone or worried or depressed anymore, its like the void in the back of my mind just wasnt there anymore, like i dont have to worry or care about the future cause i know i wont be by myself to take it on.

sometimes i hate coming back to this, i always remind myself that its not real, it never is, but just, for a little bit, i'd like to pretend that it is, that i do have someone that actually cares and understands, someone that thinks im more than enough, and that im special enough to be loved...i hate coming back from that

sometimes i imagine i just, kill myself, cause why shouldnt i at this point? its just, always gonna be the same thing, i wake up and the dread just hits me like a truck filled with bricks, i feel like there's something that doesnt let me breathe right and the more i think about it the worse it gets, i just feel like i want to cry cause at this point, no matter what i do or how much i try i just cant fix it or find a solution...or someone who can help

i've always wanted someone, since i can remember i've always felt alone...i just want someone that can understand me and just, likes me for being myself

but what if i never do? what if i just try and try for years and just, never find him?...i dont wanna be alone forever

lately i just feel like i cant express myself right anymore, its always the same, same feelings, same needs, same problems, i just dont know how to fix them, dont know how to fix me, dont know how to finally be liked by someone

I'm a trans woman and I always see other trans people with families, who love them and support them and friends who actually care about them and want to be around them and romantic partners who treat them with so much kindness and respect it hurts knowing I'll never experience any of that.

My family always treated my siblings better, my friend group treats me like I'm less than and not good enough like I'm a charity case they were hired to be friends with and I don't even try to date because that's just a fairytale I'm unlovable.

I'm so jealous and I hate myself for it but how can I not be jealous when I have no one and I see people everyday who have what I always wanted.

I sit in my apartment alone everyday wondering why am I here. I had a lung infection in 2021 and I was so sick and could barely breathe I wish I would have died. That would of been the best thing to ever happen to me in my whole life.

Not mistaking anorexia for recovery.  Knowing goddam well I am stuck avoiding.  And working on it.  8 years of recovery and I still cant get it together enough to meet my own needs and not even close enough to anyone to have my external needs met. Not even a little.

Sometimes, the friend thing bothers me, but not very often. Being single though…. This I can’t stand. I’ve been single for about 3-3.5 years now. My first relationship was with an emotionally and sexually abusive partner who also was a narcissist. Since him, I’ve been with a handful of guys, all whom I’ve quite fancied. It never worked out though, of course. Through my years I’ve learned many things and has grown exceptionally to know what if right and what is wrong… how to treat people. I just can’t seem to get past the talking stage or the I-only-want-to-f*ck stage. It’s like, how many tinder profiles can I swipe left on saying “here for a good time not a long time” lol. I’ve just become so tired of my take on dating… I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong. Or why at times I tell myself I don’t deserve love. I worry about dying alone and forever being single.

I thought at least by now I’d have a boyfriend or even a friend, but I have nothing. I’m like the annoying family pet that is somehow still alive and they can’t get rid of it. And I always wondered if anyone has ever thought about me or missed me - I don’t think so, most of the time I’m only acknowledged when someone needs to ask about something I know and if I can I do it for them. 

If I were to disappear, not a single person would care or notice - until they need me to figure out how to return something to Amazon or how to get a stain out of something. Kinda wish I had someone who liked having me around, even now at my age, kinda wish someone cared that I’m here too."

lonely,Just sharing because it's therapeutic,"Just sharing because it's therapeutic - It feels therapeutic to just write about it.  Here's my story.  

I grew as the 'nerd' in grade school.  I had some friends, but never had much of a social life up until the 10th grade.  I thought I was destined to be the kid eating lunch by myself, but then life unexpectedly changed for the better.  I switched high schools in 10th grade, and my prior reputation as the 'nerdy' kid didn't follow me.  It was the first opportunity I had to make real friends, where people got to know me without any preconceived notion.  And it felt amazing.  I found people similar to me...people who were curious about the world and didn't think it was weird to work and study hard.  I made close guy friends and also started dating an amazing girl.

My confidence really grew in those high school years and continued to grow throughout college.  I instantly formed an awesome group of guy friends and started dating another wonderful girl (although I was still a bit torn up about my high school relationship ending).  The next 10-15 years of my life were just unbelievably fun.  All my guys stayed in the same city, where we went to college.  We saw each other multiple times a week...dinners, going out, traveling together, etc.  I had ups and downs (like many people do) with romantic relationships, but all in all, I met some amazing women.  And I made great friends at various jobs I had post college.  I didn't know how life could get any better for me.

At some point during this journey, I met the woman that would eventually become my wife.  While the first few years of dating were on a sugar high, we started to go through some major ups and downs post marriage.  One of the major arguments we got into post marriage was regarding where we would live...my wife wanted to move to a different city, but I had no desire to move given the number of 20 year friendships I had in my current city.  In a bid to make things work in our marriage, I agreed to move across the country.  I vowed to stay in touch with the many friends I was leaving behind.

After moving, things were really bad.  I was miserable and resentful.  No friends or family.  And I worked in a job where I work from home and didn't have much opportunity to meet new people.  It took me multiple years and days/months/years of arguments for me to finally decide it was time to let go of my resentment and try to find some peace and happiness.

And I found this peace and happiness through my children.  I could not be more obsessed with them.  They have been my saviors, and most of the time they are all I need in my life.

However, there are moments, like right now....the children are sleeping.  My wife and I are civil with each other, but the light heartedness has faded.  My old friends have become increasingly difficult to stay in touch with...everyone has kids.  Text chains slowly go dormant.  And my new 'friends' are basically just social acquaintances...primarily people whose kids go to the same school.  And in these moments, I miss the closeness I used to have...sitting around with a buddy talking about recent news, going to watch some mediocre sci-fi movie with a group, receiving a text on a Friday night that says, ""hey, what are you up to this weekend?""

Not really looking for advice...I'm content most of the time, but sometimes my mind wanders and wishes for something a bit more.  I had no one else to tell, so I told you guys.  Hope you don't mind."

welp, where to start. you know why i'm here, it's the same reason you are. 

i used to have a few more friends. i believe i was genuinely robbed of the proper opportunity every kid should have to build relationships and things like that. i grew up super traumatized and i had attachment issues and anxiety so bad that in gradeschool i would literally just cry so hard and beg the teacher to let me call my mother. this being said, i obviously did not make friends. nobody wanted to be around that kid, and as i'm now in highschool i can definitely say that sentiment has barely changed. i made a few friends in middleschool, none of them lasted genuinely. highschool, i made barely any this entire time. in 8th grade i made friends with a dutch girl named jade online and we have remained best friends until a couple of weeks ago when she cut me off completely over something literally so miniscule it is insane. 

i made a friend named jinx sophomore year who was like everything to me. best friend for so so long. genuinely one of the only completely positive friends you would have, you know, and we understood each other perfectly. she cut me off a few months back because i got into a relationship and she felt jealousy towards that and even after we talked about it she still ended up cutting me off. i sent a funny ass meme, ""stop texting me"". that's all she wrote. 
literally.
and i listened.

last night was prom. it was eye opening to how few people i actually have. by few, i mean zero. i have my boyfriend, and the second he was gone there was nobody. i have one, quite literally one friend, aside from my boyfriend, named mars, who i have known from grade 5 who has been through hell and back with me. 

anywho.
i'm 18, in a relationship obviously, trying my bestest to graduate highschool, and i have been adoring the game dead by daylight lately. i love the obscure, i love psychology, i have a fat shiba inu named sushi and i have also been into the game rocket league sideswipe on my phone. oh, and tonight i just bought resident evil 2, gonna play tomorrow for the first time. im so alone though. i have nobody. the silence deafening in the loudest possible way. dating a popular and social person has been the hardest thing to cope with too. it's so hard."

I always wanted to be her friend because we lived in two different states and it would have been hard to maintain a long distance relationship but she insisted on being one and I eventually agreed because she really needed someone good in her life after the mess she had been through and I kinda fell for her by trying to be there for her. A year later she says it's hard for her and she doesn't think she deserves me and she's not a good person and she's having conflicting thoughts which basically means she wants to screw with her abusive ex and she wants to end our relationship. I am heartbroken and clueless because when no one was there for her I stood by her picked her up got her on her feet and now because she's horny she doesn't want me anymore and rather go and be with her abusive ex. I'm so depressed I can't get her out of my head no matter what I do and it seems like she left me the way I found her and I feel helpless and I just want the pain to stop. I feel like killing myself but I have certain responsibilities which are stopping me from doing that. I just want to know how can I stop this pain . How do I shut out all my feelings ? Please if anyone has any suggestions share it with me . I can't take this anymore 😭 and it just hurts so much I just want it to stop .

my bf has a lot going on and can’t help me and my best friend rarely talks to me and i can’t vent to her.

lonely,Ever just realize how lonely you are.,"Ever just realize how lonely you are. - I have a love for life that crashes here and there. I am in love with making people happy. But to lay alone every night, to watch the hours go by without someone reaching out. I thought of someone I loved who died. The good things they said about them. Made me wonder, not suicidally but philosophically about what people would say about me, or how many people would cry or care if I died. I realized that it’s not a lot and how there’s so much more I owe the world, the people in my life, and to find more and hopefully make them feel good. So that when the day comes, hopefully no time soon, that I have touched more hearts than I have today. And so I learned my loneliness is not from me laying here craving someone who cares about me (I mean partially anyway) but craving to make others feel cared about. And until then I’m just not done living. Time to take life and cherish the moment and live in that moment, even if it is a lot of the time only with my lonely self."

I've begun talking to people knowing full well they're lying to me, manipulating me, whatever just because I've become so desperate for affection. I have a handful of friends but most of them are busy and the only one that isn't is as antisocial as I am so we've gotten caught in a cycle. That basically leaves me alone and I end up just talking to people online, knowing that they're screenshotting what I say, and putting on a persona to get more laughs out of me. And honestly, I don't even care anymore. It's better than being alone all the damn time."

I’m very antisocial social and mainly keep quiet to myself. I never liked talking to people cause mostly i start to overthink about everything it’s like someone in my head telling me what wrong with me and what over people think about me to the point where i just don’t talk. I tend to mess up when i feel like people are watching me i hate it.

lonely,I miss my best friend.,"I miss my best friend. - For what it’s worth, I am a male, and so is he. 

He hangs out with his ex-girlfriend all the time. They’re absolute besties. She’s toxic and he refuses to believe it. She tried to drive a wedge in between mine and his friendship, and he chose her side. On one hand, I really do miss him but on the other I can’t let myself be around that toxicity (and stupidity, at that). 

I also suppose I don’t hold that high of a place in his life, though. He would consistently make plans with other people way in advance (beach trip, lake trip, float trip, all stuff I mentioned that he and I should do together) but refused to do so with me. Everything we did had to be last minute. Additionally, he has no regard for my mental health. And as much as all that sucks, I do miss him, but I don’t reach out anymore. One time he told me I “monopolize his time.” Message received, loud and clear.  

If this sounds selfish, I apologize, but it does hurt to see someone you care about just vanish."

I am happy about finally leaving high school, but I’m worried my experience in college will be socially deprived like high school.

To be frank, I’ve always had difficulties connecting with other people. They always seem to just drift away, throw me away like an old toy. I never understood why people did this to me, and I still don’t. The “friends” I have in high school ignore me, ostracize me, and keep information from me. I always ask if anyone wants to hang out, but they are “busy”. They’re not really friends at all. And really, I’ve never really had people there for me in my life other than my mom. 

It is common knowledge among my peers that I am an abnormal individual. Maybe it’s the way I talk, my fascination with “creepy” animals, or active imagination. I am a freak in everyone’s eyes. At least beetles and spiders don’t judge you for being yourself. 

Does anyone have advice for making new friends in college? I don’t want to have to live through that kind of shit again. I don’t care about a romantic partner, I just want a fucking friend."

My mom says I want to be depressed and says I should just pray. 

I've honestly hit rock bottom. I've been crying myself to sleep most nights. I don't have any motivation to do what I need to and I've been skipping school a lot. I honestly don't even want to live anymore. I'm absolutely fucking miserable."
lonely,Being replaced.,"Being replaced. - I have been replaced which isn’t unusual because that’s just how it’s always been. This time though I was replaced in my relationship, my partner started going on VR chat more and made friends but that’s not the issue. The issue is that he met a friend on there and he started to do everything with him that we used to do like talk for hours and let me vent to him and vice versa. Lately, he’s been putting this friend over me, every-time I ask him about why he doesn’t talk to me the way he talks to him, he just tells me it’s different. I did snap at his friend one time because he was rude to me and my partner took his side instead of mine, if anything it felt like they both ganged up on me. I don’t know what to do anymore, I have no fight in me left. I’m on the verge of giving up. He treats him way better than me and there’s nothing I can do at this point. This is the loneliest I’ve ever felt."

I tried to approach women but it’s only ended up with a couple friends. I see people posting stuff like “I have to remind myself that being alone is better then being with the Wrong person” but honestly I’d take an abusive relationship over the loneliness, just to have someone who’d even pretend to be interested in me.

First kiss, first girlfriend. But she broke up with me due to long distance and other crazy childish reasons that didn’t involve me. But I miss that feeling. Like a lot. Someone telling me I’m handsome or cute, cuddle, physical touch, just hanging out or FaceTime each other. Little things that couples do. I’m 24 now and it’s driving me close to insanity to why it’s so hard to  find a partner. I can say I’m somewhat outgoing but I never how to hold a conversation to keep a woman interested. On top of that, I’m very introverted, homebody, don’t go out very often if it’s not work (which I’m working on to go out a lot more). What should I do? I don’t wanna give up on finding love yet."
lonely,a starless night and the lie of love.,"a starless night and the lie of love. - Hi Hi 19m here, it's dark out tonight but there's no stars, it sort of put things into perspective for me. As far as the eye can see there's not a star in sight, the myth that is love itself is much the same as stars, you can see them from a distance every now and then, but no matter how beautiful they look you'll never be able to reach them. On dark starless nights such as this im reminded of just how truly alone I am and always will be. I want someone to give my love to, someone to give ME to, but much like the stars, I'll never have that. You hear people say ""All the stars in the night sky are already long dead"" I don't know if that's true or not but it's sums up what I'm saying quite perfectly. Love just doesn't seem real anymore, something you see all around you everyday but you'll never have it and it's probably long dead. I just wish I could join the stars in the cosmos, release my consciousness from this mortal coil that I'm in, from this hell that I live on. I just don't want to be here without love, I just want to disappear."
lonely,Why is it so hard to keep friends,Why is it so hard to keep friends - I’ve had some many people come and go in my life in such a short period of time. My oldest friend blocked me on everything and I’ve been rejected 3 times by different people in 6months and I knew these people but I’m just bad at reading signals. I can’t hold a conversation there’s nothing interesting about me and so no wonder they left but sometimes I wonder why they didn’t stick with me. I’m not doing great but I thought that’s when your friends were supposed to stick by you. Now I’m just kind of floating and I don’t have anyone anymore.

What do i do? I don’t know how to make friends. Im 25 single dad with extreme social anxiety, my last 2 relationships were complete disasters, and i honestly just want some kind of company. It get worse when i dont have my kids and that’s when the extreme depression kicks in and all i want to do is cry or run away."
lonely,I guess my childhood is the reason I have a hard time making friends,"I guess my childhood is the reason I have a hard time making friends - So...I was something of an extrovert kid of myself back then when I was 5 and I remember being really talkative with the entire class and my ""shy"" cousin who sat beside me would always be quiet...then the downhill started since actual school started and left the kindergarten

I was shocked by the sheer number of people there compared to the kindergarten which was like a lot lesser than school and that made me feel scared and tried to find a seat and see what does the future holds for me there...

I got into class picked one of the rear seats and we were 3 classes where 2 would get science and maths and 1 which took them too but in another language (arabic the local language)

Most people were quiet and friendships were already formed there because that same school allowed kids from 3 up to 17 to join the school and my parents chose the kindergarten instead because it was nearby to home

Break starts I go and make my first friend and having fun then I try to find another one but most of them wouldn't appear or be shy or just introverts so I couldn't really make another friend that day...and unlike our class (which I will name B) the other class A had mostly extroverted people but I didn't make friendships with them cause they were another class blah blah stupid 6 yr old me tried to come up with reasons for his shyness or fear of people...

2 years ahead I found that I had 2 relatives there 1 of them was in the same class which I was glad for and we talked me and him and the old one until one day... The popular kids decided to play games together and were inviting most people so they got my 2 only friends so I thought ""well I must play too"" and went there just to be faced with a ""no"" from this annoying girl and that planted inside me the fear of rejection 
So every day I would do my best to keep my friends with me
And if a new kid joins the school I would try to be his friend before they steal him and I would do my best

And since I mentioned that those friends were introverted/shy they wouldn't take any activities in summer (there is nothing wrong with being introverted but when you are affected by behaviours you are not used to your true self starts to disappear

2018 me decides to buy a new pc and dad told him that he would buy it from an old friend so we went there bought the pc and waited for the games to install (early 2000's games that everyone played but it was still ok)
Dad leaves to pick up mom
His friend leaves his son to supervise the pc 

So I talked to kill the awkwardness and he was responding to me (wow I was excited for a stranger to respond to me) and started talking about the private courses and things we shared and didn't know (and luckily this time he was from class A the extroverted kids) and by the time we reached a close friendship level and being able to talk to people easily (specially girls since the first one made me avoid talking to a girl at all costs) I start to realize...

""i feel like i was like this before..."" ""why did I not be friends with anyone from A... I'm the kid who cared only about games now and not do any activities...""

I really felt steps behind when I learned that everyone could swim now...(maybe useless to you but for me and the trips that the school does? It meant much)

I was the one begging my old friends to stop our laziness and go learn swimming in 2016 

And when the relative made a dumb choice to block all our female colleagues I followed him too even though most of them was nice but because he thought all of them were bad he did this (now me and him undid this of course but why we did it in the first place)

Now remember the extroverted friend?

He used to tell me about stories in the courses he had and the people in them and oh boy i was acting like ""oh that's really cool"" while inside me I was in pain knowing that I wasted years worth of joy I could have had 

Don't get me wrong my introverted old friends are not the ones to blame here but it's their nature that ruined me and I can't change their nature 

I guess I was dragged down due to wrong match of friends... 

But im still 14 wahoo i can try and fix these things right? 

Well no.
The damages has been done and everyone is now having their own friend group so making a friend now feels really late and that if you manage to get one...

But I got out with a life lesson
And that is I shouldn't wait on someone to do something I also want and unfortunately I learned that the hard way

I finished and sorry for making this too long but I wanted to get it off my chest..."

lonely,Don’t know how to keep going,"Don’t know how to keep going - Don’t know how to keep going

Life is going by fast but it’s being looped.

Made plenty of posts detailing what i have been through.

I’m a  and i’m near the end of high school, and 3 years have passed by i still feel like i’m 15.

I’ve never had friends or a girlfriend, my personality is the same as it was when i was 13-15, i’m very childish and immature, I’m considered annoying to people. This isn’t the reason I have any friends though, as i’m terribly scared of talking to people.

I’m incredibly insecure of my body and who i am, i have terrible acne that doesn’t want to go away, and many other things such as my height.

I’ve became so much better mentally from what i was in the past, and now i’m solely focusing myself in trying to improve myself, but it’s really hard because i feel like it won’t matter.

I struggle with suicidal thoughts alot.

I have plenty of medical conditions that are ruining me but i can’t get a doctor.

I have no social life other than my 15yo cousin that lives in a different city, and i get bullied by him(all jokes).

Going to school for me is completely useless as i do not have any social life, It feels like the same shit everyday. 

Getting a girlfriend is almost impossible as no girl has ever showed attention towards me. Even if they did, I can’t get a girlfriend at the school as everyone in my classes are 16-17 (i have failed multiple times.)

I feel like i have plenty of undiagnosed mental illnesses as i cannot socialize properly, if one person shows interest, i try to message them everyday which ends up in them blocking me. I’m also seen as a loser and annoying in social circles, i can’t be the “chill guy.” 

Also, i’m saying this like i get any socialization, i am completely devoid of any socialization other than my cousin, who i feel is only making things worse because of my insecurities and he has a different mindset.

This is incredibly cringey to say but i do not have anything to live for.

I’m not just lying down and rotting, i’m actually working on myself and trying to change my life but i feel like this is useless. 

Is life really fun if you have the things you want?"

I was trying to study 24/7 but my suicidal ideations are back, I wanna kill myself before result comes but I know I don't have the access to any method anymore as all my past attempts didn't went well, I'm also a cut addict so I'll probably end up just cutting even more but that doesn't solve anything, I also come from a family in which everyone gets a bachelor's degree atleast or more, I'm the youngest child, my elder 3 sisters are a fashion designer, a producer and a dentist, and here I am a total disappointment of my family, I'm such a burden, it's too late now, I can't fix anything now, I need to die, it's the responsible thing to do, not to mention they might honor kill me since it's a common thing in my country. I'm also closeted bi and I do not follow their religion and I can't move out of their house unless I do good academically and become financially independent, but I know I cannot, I'm tired of fighting but also some part of me still wanna live but it's like my fate says I can't, I also haven't left my room in 3 days and no one checked up on me, everyone wants me dead :(

I wouldn't know what to say in their position either and regardless of if it's true or not, hearing overused and half-baked statements like that only adds to the monotony I'm my life and it has gotten to the point where it almost feels disingenuous to me. It feels like people just flip through the book of things they're supposed to say in that situation and then they try to leave it at that. Like, how am I supposed to respond to that? Say ""Thanks I feel better now"" and do a little dance? Even saying things like ""you are not alone in this"" doesn't even make me feel better nowadays. All it tells me is that I'm not even unique in my own suffering and it pisses me off. Sorry if this post sounds rude or whatever. I'm just even more pissed off than usual atm."

lonely,Did I deserve this,"Did I deserve this - I (18) starting seeing my ex (k) in the summer before this school year. We met through mutual friends and quickly became friends ourselves. The more we know each other, the more we became closer. We became super comfortable with each other and eventually we would do things people in relationships do. We would see each other everyday and always be together. We held hands, we took naps together, we bought each other food, showed each other music , we kissed. Months into this I turned 18 and wanted to do something I could do that I couldn’t before, I downloaded tinder. I didn’t think this was a big deal it’s not like I actually would meet anyone I matched up with. I starting texting someone I matched with and we just innocently texted, it never crossed any boundaries, all we would do is talk. I tell K about this and he becomes angry, we stayed up until 2 am talking about it, I tried to explain it wasn’t serious and that I would never go against him. I realize now that I was an idiot for not caring how he would have felt about. Eventually though, he gets over it and we continue things as we do. A few months later I have an insane depressive episode, which is not uncommon for me, and one of the things I do during these episodes is push people away from me. I invite him over and tell him I don’t feel the same anymore. It shocked me how much I didn’t feel about it. Coming out of the episode, I think I wanted to convince myself what I said was true. I tried to move on. Fast forward I think about K daily, i miss him. I realize how selfish it sounds, but I know I’ll never have him like I did again and it makes me sad. I met someone else (V) and things went well, we went on a couple dates, he was nice and romantic. I really began to like V and could start seeing myself with him, we even began talking about the future. Not too long ago V begins being dry over text and noticeably not putting effort like he would.

lonely,I’m so horrified of feeling alone in this world but I feel like I am choosing loneliness.,"I’m so horrified of feeling alone in this world but I feel like I am choosing loneliness. - 

This is not a self pity post, I just really feel like I need to say this so I can get some sleep tonight.
I am 24 and ever since I’ve been a child I’ve been horribly worried about feeling alone in this world. I didn’t have the worst childhood in the world or anything like that but I was always very feminine and went to all boys schools in the Middle East, which made making friends really challenging and I experienced a lot of abuse (sexual abuse, extreme forms of taunting and bullying) and even home couldn’t be a refuge for me because I could tell my father had a really hard time being around me without making comments about my behavior (I wouldn’t say he was abusive but he repeatedly would tell me things like not to act like a girl, man up, yell at me for crying) I also have 5 brothers who all really disliked me because of my feminine qualities and thought they could “fix me” by pointing out and making jokes about how I didn’t act like a man. 
So I end up feeling ostracized at my home and In my school, things eventually started getting better when I managed to make friends as I got older, around 16. 
However I’m now 24 and because of traveling to the US for a few years and then coming back to the Middle East I’m almost back to square 1 with no social life, I have a few close friends but a lot of them are in the US or not in physical proximity to me.
My biggest struggle currently comes from the fact that I realize I’m trans, I’ve known about this for years now but obviously can’t be honest with my family about it or start hormones or anything like that, which I’ve learned to be okay with, I’m fine with waiting.
But at nights when I’m laying in bed I can’t stop myself from thinking about how whatever I choose to do in life, either keep lying to my family or transition, I’m going to be alone.
All I want in life is to learn how to operate in a way that allows for people to love me and wanna be around me so I’m not so alone and it’s just so fucking hard sometimes.
I’m a really social and extroverted person but I just can’t seem to maintain friends and it’s a really lonely position to be in."

I have been trying my best to live my life but at times like this I really missed a companionship. Yes, my friends are there to listen or have a drink with me, I can put on a comedy movie and have a laugh or I can just go straight to bed and sleep this tiredness. I can do that, I always do that.. But today I just want to be hug and held by someone who genuinely loves and cares for me. Sorry, it was just a horrible day and I don’t have someone to talk to."

At times, I’ve tried to conceal literally everything about myself, just showing the parts of me that seem good on paper. It’s never good enough. People only stay around for so long, and then, they leave. 

My burdens always seem to be too much. I always seem to be “too much.” And sure, they could go find less. But it leaves me with literally no one. The only people left are people who treat me poorly, use me for things like sex and and a shoulder for them to cry on… but when I need someone? When I just want a friend or someone to listen? I’m just on my own. 

I hate being so lonely. 

I hate being alone."
lonely,[M21] Loneliness Is Driving Me Insane,"[M21] Loneliness Is Driving Me Insane -  

I'm sure you must all be thinking: ***Ah shit, here we go again...;*** but I really don't know where else to go to to let out these emotions pent up inside me so I apologise in advance for the whiny rant

I had my first relationship two years ago, which was my first everything: first girlfriend, first sober kiss, lost my virginity to her, etc... you get the idea. Since then I have been single, and to be honest I had not tried to get a meet anyone new since then up until a bit over a week ago when I decided to install the big 3 dating apps (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble). I consider myself a pretty decent looking guy, I work out very often, I think I can be quite funny, and I feel like I would be a great boyfriend overall, but these dating apps are absolutely destroying my self esteem. I have a decent amount of matches but none of them ever go anywhere. The usual results range from not even getting a reply after I match to getting their Snapchat/Instagram but I end up being left on read eventually, and it makes me feel like there is something inherently wrong or unattractive about me. I find myself fixated on these apps and matches non stop, I'll think about it every few minutes almost and its consuming me. I keep finding myself feeling disgusting and unworthy of any ounce of love or care anyone might have to offer to me.

I keep thinking to myself ""*What the fuck am I doing wrong, what is wrong with me*"" even though logically I know there is nothing wrong with me, but my heart keeps telling me otherwise and it is eating away at my self worth which is already quite low to begin with. Just today I talked to a friend who seems to have a lot of success on dating apps, and I asked him to show me his profile so I could see what he is doing better than I am... and it left me even more confused and frustrated than before. He only has a about 3 pictures, and it is hard to make out his face clearly in any of them.

The loneliness is really starting to get to me, and I am suffering a lot from it. I feel exhausted. You always get the usual advice like ""**Work on yourself before looking for a partner**"" or ""**If you cant love yourself, how do you expect to love somebody else?**"", but I am quite content with every aspect of my life other than the fact that I am single. It feels like a void in my heart that can't be filled by any amount of self care, I crave the affection of another person so deeply and it almost feels as though I am always incomplete, like the final missing piece of a puzzle. I just want someone to take care of and to turn to when I am having a bad day, someone to embrace and make memories with and the longer I spend alone, the more I start to feel like I will never find someone to reciprocate these feelings. When I see my friends in ***seemingly*** happy relationships I feel envious and I hate myself for it, I am glad that they are happy but I wish I had someone like they do..."

lonely,I need a partner.,"I need a partner. - Throughout my life I’ve always felt like something’s missing. And now that I’ve found myself in solitude, I know more than ever that I need a partner in my life. Though I’m only eighteen and people would call me too young for this, I feel like I’ve grown up too fast and too soon. I’ve seen the world and I’ve come to know exactly what I want. Problem is, it’s too hard to find. But before I give up, I’ll post this as a last attempt since online dating apps got me nowhere and dating in real life is impossible for someone my age due to where I live. I don’t see myself living past my twenties so here we are. I’ve always felt this strange yet familiar loneliness deep within me. The feeling that no one truly understands me, and that I have no true connections in my life. Though I’m surrounded by people, none of them match me as much as I’d want. Nobody cares for me except for my family and a few friends, obviously. But I want someone other than family to care. My ideal partner is someone who would have the key factors in common with me. A lonely, nihilistic, carefree, laidback soul, simply looking for someone the same as them to share their life with. I’ve never fallen for the false image of a happy family with children, in fact I despise anything that even remotely resembles such an idiotic image. I’m an anti-natalist meaning that I’ll never want to have children, and I’m not interested in adopting either. In fact I’m planning on getting a vasectomy as well. My partner has to feel the same way. So sure that they’d be willing to get their tubes tied up. I’m also an atheist and am anti-religion, spirituality, theism, cultural rules, family rules, strict morality or anything that takes away my full freedom to do absolutely anything I want as a human being. You’d have to be the exact same way, otherwise we wouldn’t workout. I view sexual activities as acts for pure pleasure and I like my sexual life to be separated from my romantic life. That means I don’t expect monogamy and will not be monogamous of any sort. My sexual life is my business and yours is yours. If you’re the type to feel jealous, stop reading. I’m open minded and kinda kinky. Other than gas, defecation and acts that are harmful in anyway such as cutting, choking, et cetera, I’m willing to tryout all sorts of sexual activities as long as we’re both comfortable with it. I’m not one to put up with bullshit so you’d have to be emotionally stable and as laidback as I am if not more. On the other hand you wouldn’t have to put up with any bullshit on my side either. I tend to never make big deals out of any problems as I believe that the best way to solve problems is with calmness and logical thinking. I try my best to never let anything get to me and I expect the same from a partner. I will not accept any form of toxicity in my relationship and will break up immediately as I’ve done many times before if I feel like I’m not enjoying myself. I will also do the same if I feel like you aren’t enjoying my company because I expect you to be honest and feel comfortable and happy around me. I’d never force anyone into anything so if you force yourself, I’m out. I’m not strict about age but if you’re older than me, I will not tolerate getting looked down upon in anyway. Just because I’m “young” to society’s standards does not mean I’m immature. If you disagree, stop wasting your time. I don’t claim to be perfect as I don’t believe in perfection overall, but I know my self worth and I demand respect and kindness. I treat people the same way they treat me. I like my relationship to be fully double-sided at all times. A relationship made of ever growing pure love, trust and acceptance from both sides until death do us apart. If you like and accept what you’ve read, chances are, I’ll like and accept you. So don’t be shy. Send me a message and we’ll see how it goes. Thank you for reading. 😊"

I have my family and some friends but I’m not sure if I’ll ever find love again. I’m 32. - I’m alone watching some tv shows like the new episode of the Atlanta show of Donald Glover. I just feel this crippling loneliness. Ever since I went through a breakup just before covid hit, I haven’t really been happy. I did have a rebound in the form of a onenightstand. But I’m craving the affection that goes with a relationship.

Apart from the romantic loneliness I’m also unemployed again after one month of working. I knew the job was going to be temporary but when it has ended you’re once again left with the great big nothing. I don’t want the void, I want to be busy.

I met this possible love interest at a party in April, we had a very engaging conversation, we really hit it off, but she's so incredibly busy and I don't know if or when we'll be able to go on a date. I'm kinda losing hope tbh. What is the point of it all. I've got a mild form of autism, what used to be called Asperger's but I prefer to say I'm on the spectrum.

Anyway reaching out to other lonely souls here, thanks for reading and feel free to hit me up. Would love to meet some new friends to make plans, cause apart from some concerts I have no idea what my life is going to look like in 3 months. I'm open to anything. Wish I could travel to the US but flights are expensive as the high season is approaching, so realistically if you want to meet up, you're also based in Western Europe.

lonely,A rant,"A rant - Dear God am I going to regret this, but I feel like I need to do this right now.

I tell people I don't have any friends, that I am completely alone and that no one wants to be my friend. The truth is that I have ""friends"". I interact with them, talk with them, laugh with them and tell them they are my friends. Yet I don't feel like they are.

If you were to ask one of them if they are friends with me they'd say yes. On the other hand, I still say I am alone, I still feel alone. I can't look them in the eyes and tell them. ""You are my friend"" cause that is not how I see them.

I am completely alone, completely isolated, and completely without one person to talk to. Not because I have to, but because I choose to. I can't trust someone enough to feel like they are my friend. I am scared that they are lying, scared that if I get too close I might get hurt.

I am angry that I can never be myself. That I have to take on a mask every time I meet someone. That my relationships never go deeper than the surface and that I have never told anyone ever how I feel.

I desperately try to escape my life as ""lonely"". I try to talk to people and find it enjoyable for a while, but as soon as I have to keep that going it's no longer what I want. I talk to someone face to face and think to myself ""this is a person, who wishes me no harm"". But as I leave the room they become abstract. I grow scared of that person and feel like they are a hassle. Someone who was my potential friend becomes my enemy, someone who might hurt me in the future.

I want to tell people how I feel, I want to talk to someone, but ultimately I have no one. I can't utter the words I want to say, I can't speak up because I feel like shit, like I just left a vulnerable piece of myself for someone else to stab every time I speak to someone about my issues. 

I am so tired of being lonely, so tired of not having anyone to speak to, so tired of never being able to be myself. 

But in the end, I know that all of that is my fault, that it stems from my inability to trust anyone. And that is what hurts the most.


I am scared for my life that I might never meet someone I can trust.


Thank you for reading."
lonely,Stuck in a cycle of always ending up alone and it’s only getting worse,"Stuck in a cycle of always ending up alone and it’s only getting worse - I (23m) have never been good at making friends or relationships. I have made a few friends in recent years but they all now have partners that they spend most of their time with. I’ve always tried to push myself out of my comfort zone to meet new people but it’s always ends the same. I’ve done stuff that I am really not comfortable with just to try to make people like me.

I feel like I’m being left behind. It’s probably a stupid mind set but I feel like I’m stuck in this cycle that i always end up alone. I’ve tried dating but no matter what I do, I always get ghosted. It’s led to me being really closed off about my feelings and just makes me scared to open up to people cause of all the times before I know I’m going to get hurt.

For some reason I always let myself hope that things will be different every time I meet someone but it’s just hurts more when they leave. I don’t know if I’m doing anything wrong. It always makes me think that there’s something wrong with me. A lot of girls brush me off because of my lack of experience. 

I’ve had a bad past that still effects me to this day but I’ve worked on myself to get to the point I am now and I’m happy with how things are but I can’t shake the feeling of loneliness. Everyone I know goes home to someone who loves them and I’m just at home alone.

I just want someone who cares about me, Someone I can have my own family with and not be alone anymore. Someone who gets me and I get them. That we would be best friends and not just a couple.

I thought it would be a good idea to try to improve my image in college and my friends were voting for me in droves.But today was a very heavy day, I was definitely not on my best days. So I went to a site that makes google forms bots, and I don't know if it was because I was kind of inattentive to the world and focused on wanting to win at any cost. But I sent 800 votes to me and a friend of mine. The instagram page was very angry with the bots and I obviously lied to throw them off and they believed me.

So... people of r/lonely, thank you for understanding when no one else did, thank you for all the good messages and advice, remember, there is always help out there (psychotherapy helped a LOT) and hang in there.


To that note, goodbye r/lonely.


(to be fair, life will probably fuck me over in like 2 months and I'll be back here posting and commenting regularly lmao)"
lonely,Just feel like shit,"Just feel like shit - Idek what to do anymore, at this point I’m just alone and slowly watching my life crumble from the sidelines because I don’t have the motivation or strength to move on and I hate it. But no matter what I do it will always be like this, me alone and left behind while everyone else moves on"
lonely,I’ve been lonely all my life.,"I’ve been lonely all my life. -  I never made any friends, I never made any acquaintances. I never texted people on popular social media like WhatsApp, instagram, Snapchat etc. I never went to a sleepover, a party or even any social gatherings really. With all the loneliness I faced and with how socially behind I am (not sure if behind is even the right word anymore), I ask myself how I’m still alive. Sure, I guessed I‘ve liked being alone to an extent but being in complete solitary is painful and it’s ruining my psyche.

I may end it all, I may not. My mind’s a blank on this matter and I can’t fully decide (though I may just play the best of both worlds and end it in 2 years). If you see this, it’s just a rant. I don’t want people telling me that it’s going to get better as nobody here knows my full situation. I don’t want people to DM me due to sympathy or whatever and I know that sounds counterintuitive but there are many reasons why I’ve been lonely all my life. I just wanted to get this information out there and remove some steam and stress, that’s all. Apologies if this is all over the place."
lonely,No one wished me a Happy birthday AGAIN,"No one wished me a Happy birthday AGAIN - I think this gonna be a yearly post for me. Last year no one wished me a Happy birthday, can you guess what happened this year ?


This shut hurts and fucking sucks.

I even brought my sister, and brother a gift for their birthdays, but none of them even remembered.

If i ask if they forgot my BIRTHDAY AGAIN, I'll sound pathetic as fuck. 

The realization of how alone i am hurts way too much."

lonely,Does anyone else order food to their home instead of eating out in a restaurant?,"Does anyone else order food to their home instead of eating out in a restaurant? - I’m a very self conscious person and I always feel very uncomfortable going to a restaurant alone and I end up losing my appetite, but when I’m with someone I feel comfortable to eat. I have no actual friends so I’ve never been invited to eat out (or invited for anything really) and when I do make plans, people always reject them. The delivery fees are relatively cheap where I am so I’ve always ordered the food from the restaurants instead.

I can’t remember the last time I’ve actually gone to a restaurant to have a nice meal. I either cook most of the time or order the food to my apartment."
lonely,Lonely and awkward and freaky,"Lonely and awkward and freaky - I guess I'm lonely because number one autism makes it really hard to make friends. But I'm also lonely because I want friends who I can talk to about anything. Friends who are okay with me having no filter. And specifically I really wish I could find some kinky friends who understand the difference between kinks and real beliefs. 

Sometimes I just feel so lonely that I end up just sitting and staring into the void. Just completely zoned out wishing that I was better looking or completely different person with completely different preferences and fantasies. 

I just want people that I can play games with cuddle with sext with and not have to worry about having nobody to talk to when things get rough or difficult. I really don't know why I'm ranting right now I just feel awful because I feel like everybody says that I'm shallow or something like that because I want kinky friends not just normal friends. 

But I just want friends who will stay no matter what friends who want to help each other and play and just be there for each other for whatever they need"
lonely,I feel like a loser,I feel like a loser - Hi everyone sigh I dnt even know where to start I feel so low today most days I wake up without any sense of happiness or joy and the few times that I am happy it doesn’t last very long. My boyfriend gets so stressed at times and takes it out on me randomly just being mean and angry towards me saying the most horrible things and making me feel 2 inches tall. A part of me feels like I don’t even deserve to be loved by anybody. He makes me feel all the things I like are stupid and childish n just a waste of money. I am not currently working at the moment and his favorite thing to say is how he pays for everything and that I don’t work it just makes me feel even lower in the dumps. I dnt have any friends or family around so I just spend most of my days in my room crying trying not to set him off but it still seems to happen….

The boys i’ve liked have never reciprocated it back and it’s probably because i reek of insecurities. I get jealous of girls that can get the guys they want . I want to experience genuine love.

I over obsessed about her so naturally was weirded out. I can't help it. It was put into me at a young age. I pinned all my happiness on her. But ever since she left I finally got some alone time I got to confront my darkness.  I got to see my problems. I pinned all my happiness on myself making me the only one to make me happy. I realized that I don't need her. She brought more stress into my life than good. I feel happier without her.  I may have a bad rep in  school now as the kid who obsesses over people, and she might hate me to the core now. But At least I am happier with no friends"

lonely,When you los yourself and don't know how to save yourself.,"When you los yourself and don't know how to save yourself. - Have you ever confused about what's going on with you. You have friends but can't and never open up to them, so you keep it for yourself. You're struggling with college or life but it's so hard to talk about it, and again you keep it for yourself. You overthink a lot about it, about what's going on with you, with your life, how to overcome it, how to open &amp; trust your friend, how to be happy, how to enjoy life, how to finish your thesis, graduate college, how to live this world. And again it's just going on in your mind and turns out you procrastinate everything, you left your the responsibilities, and even it's so hard to wake up in the morning. Then you overthink again, about how to start, how to get rid your mind, why you're being such a crap, why am I doing nothing, what are you gonna do with your life, with your future. 

And that's what I feel. Day by day I feel like I lose myself, I feel like I'm drowning, but I don't know how to save myself."

lonely,A coworker told me I was exceptionally hard to get a read on today.,"A coworker told me I was exceptionally hard to get a read on today. - Apparently she and two other coworkers had a full length conversation about it, and others have said as much throughout my life. Basically just that I’m pleasant enough to interact with on a surface level but somehow difficult to impossible to pin down as a person enough to even attempt to get to know.

I don’t really think I’m too mysterious, but this does sort of validate the consistent, hollow feeling that I’m ‘apart’ from the herd in pretty much every social circle, whether I try to be or not. 

I can be funny and clever and fake confidence all I like and people are often receptive in the moment. But at the end of the day, I am somehow always the outsider looking in."
lonely,Just a thought.,Just a thought. - Some of you seem to have a hard time cracking out of your shell. You have raised a castle defense with moat and crocodiles included around your sensitive parts inside. I will not ask you to tear down your wall because I know you built it for a reason. But I will ask that you lower the drawbridge now and again for I do enjoy the company and I am willing to enter and understand. I am willing to talk and listen. I am willing to do my best to bring you out into the sun so we can dry up all the tears and disinfect our hearts. I am willing...are you? To heal would be a great feeling.
lonely,"I give up … tried to make new friends and failed, now I feel like an idiot and a loser!","I give up … tried to make new friends and failed, now I feel like an idiot and a loser! - I lost my “friends” a long time ago. I’ll spare you and me the details, it’ll just reopen wounds.

Since I’ve just had my gf who’s my world. But I’m still lonely, having a partner doesn’t solve it not by half.

 Sought help and was told to join things, get to know people. So I did, joined clubs and it’s been nearly a year for some.

Haven’t made a single friend. One looked promising as a small group of us formed up and we chatted as a group and met up outside. Nowadays though idk what I’ve done but seems like I’m excluded.

What used to be open invites now are secret squirrel meetings I don’t get rid out. Only hear bout them when someone slips up and posts on the old group chat about what time they’re getting there or at the club when someone says “you forgot this other day” etc one guy I was going fishing with randomly dropped me and says he’s “busy”. Was a regular thing and suddenly no longer even communicates. But he’s one of the secret squirrel club which I guess is why he’s busy!

Didn’t do anything to them. I thought we got on well, shared interests and I never did anything I know of to cause distance.. just poof.

I feel like a fool, I came out my comfort zone and felt like i could truely have friends again, real local friends. I guess at the end of the day it is me, idk why but whatever I do must drive people away. I’m such a loser"

I'm no good with people. I'm no good with friendships. The one real-life friendship I had for the first time in the longest time and it's on the verge of collapse. It's probably already gone as I'm writing this. I can't say the right things. I can't do the right things. I don't think I'm ever meant to be with anyone. I will always be alone. I don't deserve to be with others. Maybe what everyone thinks of me is right. I am different. I am ""limited edition"". But not in a good way. Nobody can be with me because I can't function like a human being properly. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. All my friendships from now on are just going to be colleagues. All just talk about work. Because that's as far as I can go."

He didn't want to live with me. It hurts so much because I actually thought they wanted me. I did my best to fit in. So I got kicked out to another room. 

They left me downtown yesterday. I get the hint. I'm not welcome. And I never was. Like, who leaves their female friend alone outside in the dark? 

I was beginning to believe it could go right. 

And my new room is filthy. The other one was clean. Its a long time since it least hurted so much. I was starting to heal and it got ripped up again. I'm not trying again"
lonely,"It's a constant agony, the fucking hollowing feeling in life.","It's a constant agony, the fucking hollowing feeling in life. - It's a constant agony, I feel more hollow than I ever imagined. I feel more lonely than my worst nightmare. The worst thing is that I've been so depressed and lonely for so long that rather than being low, I've started laughing at my own misery. The worst of all things is that I did right my whole life or at least tried to. I grew as an idealistic kid, loved by my parents. Hardworking, ambitious and giving.  

Throughout my life, I've been worked over by countless people. I've been cheated on by 3 different women in last 6 years whom I treated like a goddess. I never had a hard time getting girls, still don't. But I'm one of those people who can't even touch someone I'm not in love with. I've an amazing career, good attention, everything. I get all the attention I need but still I feel so lonely. I don't remember the last time I felt I was vulnerable around someone, I'm too scared to open up or ask for help. My friends come to me for life advice, career advice and for everything. I help them and it works out for them well too. But somehow no one is there for me because I'm too scared to ask for help. 

My day is either an amazing day or just a day I'd pray I survive. It's fucking hard to live now. But I only live to take care of my parents else I would have died so early. I can't do this anymore, I'm sick of being by myself and sick of being so strong. I want to feel fragile and genuinely be cared for, it's hollowing.

I wish to find love, I wish to find someone I can care for."
lonely,I don’t know what’s going on.,"I don’t know what’s going on. - I’m normally really happy, upbeat and I’d say fun to be around.

I feel like I could talk to anyone and at the end of the day I’m still alone? 
What am I looking for? What do I need to feel like I’m not alone no more? 
I guess I just want needy friends, friends that are just like me that are on their phones 24/7 and actually enjoy talking to people. Sure I love a chat about any subject really but finding someone that wants to talk is quite hard these days. 
Anyway, if you’ve made it to the bottom of this then that’s awesome haha.  Enjoy your day and drop me a message if you’d like to just, talk?"

We share a sorrowful soul. Some of us have lost loved ones. Some of us have lost relationships and some of us have lost ourselves. I hope we find or recapture whatever it is we need to finally heal and move on. I hope nothing but good things come knocking on your door. After all I've seen and experienced I still hope for you as I hope for me. You truly gain strength from times like these. The strength of empathy and understanding. Use your powers wisely."

lonely,How long ago did you give up on dating and how old are you?,"How long ago did you give up on dating and how old are you? - I'm 21 now (22 in a few months) and I must've been 15 or so when I started seriously chasing girls I was interested with. I had a few 'girlfriends' but eventually it didn't last very long or only lead to a whole lot of nothing.

From 2019 until 2021 I gave online dating a serious go. I met up with a few girls, hell even one from Discord but no one felt a spark, ghosted me or started things back up again with their ex.

After my last date in the spring of 2021 I decided this shit wasn't worth it anymore and deleted every single profile on every single app and my dating life has been dryer since the sahara since. Nothing.

So, what did I learn from the girls who I did date and had a relationship with? That a lot of them saw me as their personal therapist, ghosted me when they got their fix and that interest is often faked for goals relating to themselves. Hell I had one girl straight up tell me who I was together with for nearly a year she wasn't really in love with me, she just 'felt very safe with me and I brought her great companionship during that difficult time of her life'.

What's your dating story like?"

lonely,I'm in love with a girl I work with who's in a relationship,"I'm in love with a girl I work with who's in a relationship - We started working together last year and we started getting really close... We would have lunch together, go to the movies, text each other on all the socials, talk about everything.. but she was in a relationship so I didn't think too much of it. But then she started hinting that she wasn't feeling appreciated in her relationship... Now I'm really thinking about her everyday, waiting for an opportunity... It never came though because a few months later she started becoming distant. 
I eventually found out that she was scared she was getting too attached to me and felt she had to stick to the commitment she made.. she would also later tell me that the fact that I'm a bald headed light-skinned didn't help. It was hard for her to feel sexually attracted to me because I wasn't physically her type ( and she knows it sounds pretty).
Anyway, I tried but couldn't force her to see the potential. We still work together and it was awkward for a bit, but we're cool now.. almost back to how close we were before but I can tell she's set boundaries and let me in as much anymore.
The thing is, I still really like her. I've never met anyone like her before and I'm kind of reserved so I don't meet people that often anyway. I'm still coming to work and seeing her and sitting next to her every week which isn't helping me move on. I don't even know if I want to move on. Part of me still thinks there's a chance.

What do I do?"

I don’t know anyone so can’t ask for a plug. I’ve tried hanging around in stoner places but can’t find anyone. 

I searched insta for dealers in the area and there are a couple of really dodgy accounts with no posts or followed who say they sell weed, might just have to ask them. 

It’s honestly so fucking peak that I can’t even buy weed at uni."
lonely,I think I need therapy,"I think I need therapy - Hi y’all. I thought I’d express some thoughts that have been plaguing me for a while, so here goes.

I’m my own worst enemy and my environment is not the problem.

For some clarity, I was born abroad so that makes me a third culture kid. 

Country A, my birthplace, for the most part was miserable growing up in. I was bullied, ridiculed and forgot completely what it meant to be happy. Most of my friends had moved on with their lives and I was ultimately left alone and lonely.

The time came when I could leave Country A and so I moved to Country B. I thought hey, this it! I can finally be happy for once and not feel lonely again.

I was able to make friends and have fun for once in life. However, down the line I sank back into the feelings of sadness and loneliness. Perhaps it had to do with my low academic performance and it added to my overall negativity.

My friends were there and were supportive, but I couldn’t help but sink further in my negativity.

Eventually I had to say bye to these wonderful people and I moved to Country C - the home of my parents.

Having to experience a new culture again, I took my time to learn how things worked and eventually made friends again. I had more freedom here and was genuinely happier than ever. 

Oh but get this, I got sad and lonely again. Thing is I don’t why I do this to myself.

I have all these loving family and friends and have had a relatively good life and yet I succumb to my neuroticism.

So if it’s not my environment or people, it’s definitely me.

I have some issue or problem within me and I’m tired of being sad and lonely all the time.

I think it’s time I seek counseling or therapy."
lonely,Lost My Soulmate And Only Friend,"Lost My Soulmate And Only Friend - 6/7/20 until 5/7/22 for this brief chapter of my life I knew love and joy, I was previous a far alt-right loner, never had even platonic same sex friends that I felt cared enough or that I truly connectly with so when  she randomly DM'd me that night, as I was at my absolute hollowest...and I realized she somehow lived 40 minutes away, was single, gorgeous, my age range, and as we began conversing instantly clicked in everyway...she quickly became my everything, my life was finally looking up, we met up at a mall in my area a couple weeks later and by the end up the month we were together, I finally had my first hug from a girl, kiss, lost my virginity, etc. So many first experiences, it was so beautiful my life felt complete, not just because I had a gf but because I believe she is my soulmate and so did she...now we had ups and downs she broke up with me briefly the day prior to Christmas Eve and had makeup sex the very next day then fastforward I ruined Valentine's Day, she wasn't perfect but I won't mention her flaws nothing major and I wholeheartedly forgive her for everything, we flipflopped on religion and politics and ultimately I wasn't communicating I wasn't honest, I did everything else right I cherished her in every other way but I was dishonest because I was afraid of how she'd take it if I confessed I was never a Christian, she felt led on when I admitted and only time will tell what's next, I've always had a habit of lying about things usually little things because I grew up scolded my by my very strict father but it's no excuse just an explanation, I've never known a sweeter, more empathetic, smarter, or more understanding person in my 21.5 years of life. We agreed on practically everything even the niche things, both of us antinatalists. Just hoping I can earn back her trust and she'll take me back eventually but most importantly I want her to be safe and happy and healthy, regardless of what happens I'll love her forever and would die for her in a heartbeat."

But i have managed to make some ""friends"" they are not really friends. They dont care ab me and don' t know much ab me. We just talk cuz we work together.

I want every friend I have to be platonicly in love w me (sounds silly and most probs wouldt get it) everytime i get really close w someone i just end up hating them. I make up reasons in my mind as to why they are actully not my friend but hate me insted. Then i end up leaving them. I have done this many times in the last 6 years untill now. When i have no one.

First of all, I found out that he went clubbing last night, and one of the friends he went clubbing with texted me telling me that he was canoodling with someone at the bar. 

He’s the first person I’ve ever loved. And I’m still incredibly heartbroken. I know time heals all wounds, and right now, I just wish time would speed up. We dated for over a year, which is also the longest relationship I’ve been in.

In procrastinating for finals, I’ve been watching a bunch of movies that I know will just make me miserable. And each time I watch any of these movies, I cry for two reasons: I miss my ex and I want to fall in love with someone in the super cheesy Hollywood way they do. My heart hurts but I know that my ex and I broke up for the better.

If he’s moved on, good for him. I’m happy for him because I know I couldn’t make him happy, but it hurts thinking that he might have moved on so quickly. I miss the feeling of safety that came with being in his arms. I miss the feeling of knowing that someone loved me. I don’t resent him, but I resent myself for still being so upset about the breakup."
lonely,[TW] My parents found out that I Self harm and now there worried,"[TW] My parents found out that I Self harm and now there worried - I’m just so damn mad at myself for letting them find out, I know that I needed stitches because of course I had to be dumb and cut way to deep to the fascia. I really don’t want them to worry for me, god damnit why do I have to be such a burden to them. I hate having to explain what happened to the doctor/nurse it just makes me so insecure and also having to show them it I just hate it. Damnit my arms hurt so much but it’s not like I don’t deserve it, at least I can think of one reason to live and that’s my dog, I really don’t know how he’d do without me. I really don’t wanna deal with all this anymore but at the same time I’m too fucking scared to end it it’s pathetic, I know but I’m just scared that he’ll be sad and it’s hard to believe that’s why I’m alive. That’s what happened today I hope tomorrow’s better, at least I got a doctors note so I don’t have to go to school this week. I really hope no one will question me when I go back so I don’t have to  try and act fine. Anyways that was long sorry if you read that whole thing."

I don't want to complicate things, or make it weird for us to work together, so I never flirt or anything, and try to keep a friend boundary.

lonely,What are some songs about loneliness or being left by people that you love and that make you feel better?,"What are some songs about loneliness or being left by people that you love and that make you feel better? - Hello friends,

Sometimes when I'm feeling very down and lonely, I listen to sad music and it really helps me a lot. It makes me feel like I'm not alone with this pain.

Here are a few songs about loneliness I enjoy a lot:

- [**Solitary Man**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5rVmXyZP5s) by Johnny Cash. Sometimes I play this song when I'm in the shower and I love to sing along to it! I find Cash's voice really soothing, especially in his older age. There are a lot of musicians who sing sad songs but are actually very happy people. When I listen to this and other sad songs by Johnny Cash, the pain in his voice sounds so genuine and authentic. Makes me feel understood.

- [**Streets of London**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiWomXklfv8) by Ralph McTell

- [**Eleanor Rigby**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuS5NuXRb5Y) by the Beatles. Most Beatles songs are cheerful but this one is actually quite melancholic in my opinion.

- [**The Partisan**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs5hOhI4pEE) by Leonard Cohen. This is technically a song about war but it's also a song about losing everyone that's dear to you.

- [**The Letter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L13fYjKuFG0) by Digger Barnes. I love this song because it starts out sounding like a happy dream or fantasy, until you realize it's actually a memory and therefore quite sad and melancholic. I have recently been left by the love of my life. We've been married and the pain of losing her (very undeservedly) hurts so much. When I listen to this song, it really hits home.

- [**People Are Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0Mz_IqpZX8) by the Doors. I often listen to the Doors during episodes of acute depression because like no other band, they managed to express this feeling of being disconnected and estranged from the world. Reality becomes like a bad acid trip because you're all by yourself and the rest of the world just doesn't make any sense to you anymore. This song is a great example of this.

- [**Yokohama**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH70UQSXkrw) by Hako Yamasaki. This is a Japanese song that serves as a confession of love towards the city of Yokohama. It's a deeply melancholic song, though, because the narrator also feels very lonely there. In the song it's raining and the narrator has given up on trying to connect with other people around her. Hako Yamasaki is one of my absolute favorite artists. She was active in the 1970s and early 1980s, which was also the golden age in post-war Japanese history. When I listen to her music, I often have to think of a rainy November evening in Tokyo of 1975 or 1980, a small bar with some live music, neon lights that flicker in the rain, a few lonely people on the street who can't decide whether they should go inside or go home...

Anyways, tell me your favorite songs about loneliness, the kind of songs that make you feel understood and comforted!"
lonely,Yoo. Just shed a tear from the pain of loneliness,"Yoo. Just shed a tear from the pain of loneliness - I am a very social person. And so sometimes it’s just funny to me that I can feel alone. 

Tbh I’m romancé hits me hard. And so that’s where my loneliness stems from. 

I love chatting with ppl and listening about their lives. But lately I’ve just distanced myself due to the pain when ppl leave. 

I shouldn’t be spiteful from that pain. But it sad and maybe just writing this helps me reflect that I should be understanding Of why people do as they do. Because if ppl decide to leave. Maybe I wouldn’t mind trying to meet them up again in the future."
lonely,Sometimes I come here to see how much better or worse I have it compared to other people,"Sometimes I come here to see how much better or worse I have it compared to other people - My new guilty pleasure is to seek threads where people describe how bad their loneliness is, only for someone else to 1-up them. It occasionally does get depressing when I realize there's many 1-up(ers) that I can 1-up too."
lonely,I feel truly alone today,"I feel truly alone today - Ok I'm going to  Express myself a little differently than normal.  This is from my heart. 

My heart is heavy today,  as I am becoming more and more isolated. As I go about my day,  I have difficulty connecting with people,  particularly women.  I was dastardly hurt in a divorce  that  left me emotionally scarred. Since then I've been terrified to get close to anyone.  I'm afraid of rejection,  hurt and pain because I  experience it quite intensely.  I usually wake up in the morning from emotionally intense dreams that affect my day  sometimes.  I have no one to talk to about this. Most of my friends are in distant places and I struggle to make new ones. I'm in a lot of pain.  
I'm afraid that  I might never have a close relationship ever again because I can never attract a female. I feel ugly, unwanted,  rejected,  ignored,  despised.  Like a  fly on a wall to be swatted. I observe others being happy,  I get jealous of happy couples especially on social media.  I get the courage to sometimes put myself out there only to  either ignored or rejected.  Sometimes I don't know where I belong.  I go through life without social connections,  yet here I am. I have a lot of good things going for me professionally,  but socially I'm totally empty. Being alone is hard, because it requires self confidence which I'm trying to build. But at the same time I desire human companionship.  Doesn't anybody?  I hope someone reads this.  Feel free to comment if you'd like."
lonely,Becoming a hermit,"Becoming a hermit - Don't really know what I should say or how I should begin. Just that series of tragedies too long to recount has made me hard, cynical and distrustful. Four years ago I decided to move into the country to live in a summerhouse and have had a very decent job and income but no desire to spend it. I've felt free and relatively content during this time but still get pangs of... sadness? Or regret. Wishing I could connect to people. It's a very isolating life and I often imagine being on another planet far, far away from everyone. I recognise that I am a very closed individual, due to my experiences and character.. never been a people person. And now I don't know where I'm going with this. But whoever bothers to read just know you have a voice and someone to listen, too."
lonely,my lowest attendance as of yet,"my lowest attendance as of yet - and yet my grades are fine, but the guilt is so overbearing despite how unimportant it is. i’ve kept my attendance over 90% all throughout my life, i’m a highschool sophomore about to end the year, and i’ll probably it with an estimated 50-60% attendance rate. 

i’ve noticed that loneliness and fear of contamination overwhelm me and drive me away from going to school. i live in a city where my commute is a little over an hour long trains love being delayed too! time moves so unusually too, that i prioritize just rushing to get back home and make the most out of a few hours following a shower i take everyday after coming home. by that time it’s maybe already 5pm and i hope i can sleep at 10 latest, and ideally 8. i hate it. but what i hate a lot more is the fact that people take the same trains as me, yet i still spent the year taking the trains on my own, crying into my sleeves on the way home whenever i had to take a bus since i couldnt be picked up and brought home as soon as possible.

i hate showing up to school, engaging in small talk and knowing i don’t truly matter to those i speak to. i go to an arts school, and i thought that because i struggle with socializing snd so do many other artist, this would be my chance to socialize more with people just like me. nope. they’re all city kids with lives and established friend groups. i hate going to school knowing i dont matter and that ill go straight home after havig wasted a day— i hate staying home because i miss out and still spend the same amount of hours struggling to focus on work. 

and fun fact? i was the only brown girl in my elementary school, the only one that couldnt take a walk or bus to and from home with friends in middle school, and maybe now the only one not so devoted to their art in my arts high school. i havent even gone to a single concert or art show yet everyone talks about them

it’s 2 am, i’ve gotta leave the house at 6:30 to get to school by 8…. i hate that i feel miserable enough to call off a 4th day of school in a row. i feel like a disappointment to my mom who desperately wants me to go and to my teachers who’ve either called me out on this not because of how IM doing but because my absences interfere with the fairness of test taking since im absent for tests. i dont think my teachers really care about me, and yet i wanna show up to leave a good impression as a student and a person, toshow that im struggling but trying. i guess im also worried about these impressions for letters of recommendation. i have no clue what im doing i just really dont wanna go :’)"
lonely,Not socially awkward but feeling completely lonely.,"Not socially awkward but feeling completely lonely. - Just trying to get this off my chest. I belive I aint totally socially incompetent. I've been told I'm fun to be with and I'm empathic enough to read people moods. I'm socially confident enough to talk with strangers with no issues (socializing with people is literally part of my job). I get along well with coworkers and I have a close group of friends. I go to meetups and social events with the goal of getting to know people. I try to make sure people I'm with at least enjoy themselves when we go out and don't feel excluded. 

But I still feel completely alone and socially isolated. I alway have to be the one reaching out. I don't get invited by other people to hangout. When I try reach out to new people I meet they always flake or don't even respond. I get that everyone is busy and I don't deserve anything from other people but hells don't tell me your open to hanging out but then disappear. I believe in taking initiative to change my situation but getting a lung infection after a social event makes me think being lonely isnt too bad. 

I'm at the point where I'm  seriously thinking about reaching out to a patient who gave me her number. Which is a big no-no in healthcare. 

Disclaimer this isn't a dating rant but about making new friends and growing social circles after college."

lonely,I'm pretty sure I lost my last friend,"I'm pretty sure I lost my last friend - Nothing specific happened they just seem really tired of me stopped inviting me to things completely and I always feel like a burden whenever I ask to do something it just seems like it's a nuisance to him to take time out of his day to spend with me and that he'd rather be doing something else. On top of this I'm almost 100% sure they know I'm depressed yet have done nothing to help or even say anything  I know for sure hes heard me cry several nights in a row through our thin walls although I do try to be quiet. Although I dont blame them for this so much as I havent brought it up to him either.  However I've also noticed alot lately he seems to make fun of me or laugh at me when I'm just being myself I'm also pretty sure he talks bad about me to other people when I'm not around based off people bringing up embarrassing stories about me that only he could've told them.  I kind of had the same thing happen with my friend group in high school I realized I was more of a jester for them to laugh at more than a friend on equal footing I was always the center of alot of their jokes and I have alot of deformitys on my body that they'd tease me about constantly and send pics of me to other people to laugh at me without my knowledge. I cut them off sadly way too late high school was practically over by the time I really figured out they definitely werent real friends as I also discovered that some completely baseless and untrue rumors about me that had been going around the school for years came from them and these rumors greatly affected how I was viewed by everyone. My last friend I am talking about was apart of that friend group and has been my best friend since the 4th grade I thought at the time he was different and although I dont think he had anything to do with the rumors he certainly never helped my situation.  

I could go on for another 20 minutes about all the things they did to me in hindsight but I'll just leave it at this. Thanks."
lonely,"Dear A,","Dear A, - This is the most recent of many things I have written for you and I doubt that it will be the last, but it is one I will definitely never send to you. 

I want to be the version of myself that you like, I want to become someone you can love. I'm not particularly attached to any aspect of myself, I don't much care for any of it, anything that you want me to change I will change. If the issue is in the way I look I'll change it for you, I'll cut my hair, or grow it out, or style it differently. I'll get tattoos, or piercings, or promise never to get either. I'll gain weight, I'll lose it, I'll exercise more, I'll exercise less. If it's my personality you don't like I'll change it for you, I'll change my sense of humour, I'll change the way I talk, I'll change the way I text, I'll change the way I think, I'll change the things I like, the things I don't. If it's something else, I promise I can change it for you, I can walk differently, I can pronounce words a little differently, I can use a different vocal inflection when we talk, I can stop mumbling words as I write and read them, I can watch the movies you like again and make sure I see what you see, I can text you less, or more, I can work on reading little hints and queues better, or be more oblivious. 

Every aspect of myself is dedicated to you entirely, it's all yours to mold and shape as you like. Please make me into something better. No matter how much I want to say all of this to you I know I never can, because you'll tell me that I'm not the problem, that it's you. You'll say you just don't want me in that way, that it's your fault and that you're not ready, but I know you're not the problem. I have to be the problem, I have always been the problem. I feel that I will continue to  be the problem, but I want you to fix me, I want you to turn me into a person that deserves to be loved by you, instead of whatever I am now."
lonely,Whos up ?,Whos up ? - I have nobody to talk to
lonely,People,"People - I wonder what society itself would become if we all conglomerated and coincided with each other’s decisions. It is the only way to advance to something far better. Sometimes I feel as if I’m left to be alone while everyone in my environment leaves me. Even when I’m surrounded by those who me supposedly care or even random strangers; I feel more alone than ever. The way us humans can make each other feel is incredible. It usually does more wrong than well. I find some solace in the idea that maybe someone will see this post. I’ve had a rough few years. They’ve been filled with horrendous things  that I believed I could put behind me. I even started to believe that this one person could somehow set me on a path of redemption. It was I who broke that bond since I started to see it for what it was for. I was becoming worse when I would talk with that person. I seek one who can help me in my coming years. I have a question for those who made it this far. Do you believe that we have soulmates, or that we are destined to be with someone? I feel as if both of them can be true."

But I want someone who wants those things with me as well as I want a person I want to feel those things for. I’m guilty of the “ick” but only because I’ve felt passionate, unconditional love and I don’t want to settle. And the ones I can picture myself with or get excited about don’t feel or want it back.

lonely,self improvement doesn't earn you love,"self improvement doesn't earn you love - The advice I see given to people who struggle finding love usually goes as follows:
1. Be confident
2. Hit the gym, get in shape
3. Go to therapy
4. Seek higher education
5. Make more friends
6. Work on your personality
7. Get new hobbies
8. Get a better job
9. Change your wardrobe
10. Hair care, skin care, etc

The crazy thing no one tells you about all these is this. You can do everything on this list. You can become the best best version of yourself and STILL not be good enough for anyone. When it comes to love, it's all luck.

Right person, right place, right time. These are the variables at play when it comes to finding someone. Getting all three to line up is luck and has nothing to do with you at all. That's why Sally met John at the gym, or Margaret met Sam at the market or why Justin met Gwen online. The right people happened to occupy the same space, at the same time and it clicked. 

Further proof of this are the people who are not in shape who find love. The people who are not confident but very shy, who find love. The people with mental health issues, who are being loved right now. The people with only a high school education, who are in relationships. The people with no friends who are in bed with their boo right now. The person working at a minimum wage job who has a partner. The gamer whose partner watches them play. The person with bad acne and a bad haircut who's partner can't wait to go kiss them. 

You can improve yourself all you'd like. And it's greatly encouraged. But realize, it doesn't actually get you any further to being loved. Because who you are right now is actually enough. You are simply unlucky. You don't have bad genetics. You're unlucky. You're not too ugly to be loved. You're unlucky. 

This doesn't soften the blow of loneliness. But I hope it helps a little. 

The best thing us singletons can do is not try and hate ourselves for not being lucky. Because at the end of the day it has nothing to do with you."
lonely,I’m tired of feeling alone in this world (M),"I’m tired of feeling alone in this world (M) - Whatever happened to finding a person who is your soulmate? Was it just an idea created by Hollywood to perpetuate consumerism? The “Ikea” life? Maybe.. 

I don’t like thinking like this.. Because I really believed in finding the one person who I could love and get the reciprocated feeling of love, but lately I’ve gotten nothing.. lately I’m feeling empty.. 

My one dream was to find my person and now I think I was gaslighted by the world to believe in something that’s not meant for me.. 

I don’t feel good enough anymore.. My heart is heavy. The last person made me believe it was love.. but no.. I didn’t believe it, but now I see women in my life are capable of lying and betrayal..

I wish I could believe the uplifting words but they don’t feel genuine. I give heart felt responses to struggling people here all time with a blank straight face. Do I even actually care?

there are two others but those are more aquantainces, they’re nice, but we really only greet eachother on holidays i’m scared of talking to all of them, and when i do, i usually get the feeling they don’t like me too much. I’m scared i hurt them somehow but i don’t see how.

Everyone i know is a great person, i’m just terrified of them. Just thinking of confronting them makes me feel as if i’m suffocating, my chest tenses, my breath shortens, and somtimes i get sore or sick. 

Having people around me but being too scared to talk to them really makes me dissapointed in myself. And even if i dbout they like me, maybe they feel the same way and i’m hurting them too.


I feel sick in general too, the house is a mess withinh no mater how many times i clean it, and I have no motivation to do anything.

lonely,My brother has made me lonely,My brother has made me lonely - My brother gets involved with every girl in my life. When we went to college he started messing with the girl he knew I liked and would be super handsy with her right in front of me. They ended up not dating but then this girl that was into me started taking to me and we went on a few dates but I ended up calling it off cause I didn’t really like her as a person and a few days later she shows up at my house unannounced to go on a date with my brother. Which made me realize her and my brother were talking behind my back the whole time and she was only doing this to get back at me. Then she told everyone she cut it off with me cause she liked him more which was a complete lie. Now they are probably gonna end up married and I can’t even open up to anyone at this point. What can I do to be able to open up to people and not be afraid to go on a date again? I feel like at this point I will be lonely forever cause I just don’t want to date anymore.

lonely,just need a friend,"just need a friend - for the past 20, almost 21 years, i’ve remained friendless. my biological “family” doesn’t accept me, and my parents are sickening. we don’t talk about my older brother, either. 

my “friends” all abandoned me the minute they grabbed their high school diploma. and school was a constant torment, a literal hell on earth. i’d sit at lunch by myself, others would dump their garbage on my table and make me do their assignments, etc. 

i feel like everywhere i go, i’m just a ghost. i feel empty but at the same time, i’m bitter, i’m hurt and i’m *exhausted*.

lonely,It saddens me to think of all the things that could have been.,"It saddens me to think of all the things that could have been. - There used to be this girl in my primary school days that I was really into. I fantasized about us on a beach watching the sunset in a beautiful pink hue. If only I had shot my shot... I'd have known whether it could've been. But I gave myself the idea that she was out of my league and that she wouldn't be interested in me. I don't remember how old I was when I was really into her, I was likely 12 or 13.

I then had another crush at 16 and I asked if she'd have me at the valentines ball, she said yes. I was happy at the time and after school hours were over I went back home to shower and got into my nice clothes and went to the ball. We went in together and the hosts played us a song to dance to... What I experienced was not that of love towards her in thar moment... She smelled like she just got from soccer practice, the dancing felt awkward and I just wanted to get out of there. But I stayed, I mustered through the stink of a sweaty soccer jersey and... then the ball was over. I must say I was relieved it was over as I was not sure whether I was gonna make it thru the entire thing or not. Nothing more came of between us, she didn't ask for me and nor did I for her.

I haven't met another crush in all these 8 years, as I'm just in my mancave sitting on my bed writing this and have been cooped up here for far too long.

 I hope one day someone will be interested in me enough to give me a chance like that girl in my teens."

lonely,Loneliness is all I know,Loneliness is all I know - I’ve been lonely for years. I haven’t had actual friends in a good 3 years. I’m 22 and even as a kid I was usually an outcast or the unwanted friend. Never had a best friend. I’ve had trouble making friends since I was 18. Even with college and work I can never seem to move on from just being an acquaintance. I’m so fucking lonely. I haven’t had someone to regularly text in 2 years. I don’t remember what it feels like to have a friend group. I’ve kind of accepted I will never have friends. It seems to get harder as you grow up. Not to mention I have social anxiety. I’m too anxious for when I get a new job or when I go back to in person full time in September. I’m scared I’ll still be a loner and invisible.

I pushed away my family. My mom left when I was young and is now dead. My dad isnt involved. I dont even put anyone on my beneficiary. I guess when I die my money will just sit in a account to rot or have the government seize it. I would give my money up for a lifetime of love. 

I sit here crying listening to music that reminds me of my former love. I think about what could have been. I think about my issues as a person. I think about why she left. Why everyone left. It is me. They left because of me."

When I was in college I would say I had a fair amount of friends. Now that I’m out of school though and have moved away from home I’ve found my friend group has greatly dwindled. I would say I only really have one “true” friend right now. Looking back all of my other friends have been very two faced and surface level. I feel like I have a trend of making friends who just use me or bully me (sometimes both). I’ve also found my “friends” are only ever really there for me when it is convenient for them. I want to make more friends but I want to make good ones. My only issue is besides not really knowing how to make friends as an adult, how do you make authentic friendships?

All my childhood friends don’t even remember me, my middle school friends cut contact with me, and my high school friends all did the same. It seems once people aren’t forced to spend time with me anymore they choose not to. And these are people I considered to be my best friends. There’s only one person who’s stayed there half heartedly. I’ve known her since I was 11 and she’s the only one who hasn’t cut contact with me completely. But I’m going through so much rn, I’ve had so much family die and college is so stressful and as mentioned earlier she seems to only halfway care. I always reach out to hang out or talk but she never has time or has something else to do. It’s just so hard because she’s my emotional anchor and probably doesn’t care about me all that much anyway."
lonely,"My online ""friends"" know I'm struggling but don't seem to care","My online ""friends"" know I'm struggling but don't seem to care - I have two online friendships. Both of these individuals have always been candid about their struggles with mental health. I've always tried to be there for both of them. I respond quickly to their text messages, express interest in their lives, and feel like I would do anything to help them if they needed it. 

Lately, however, it has been me who has been struggling. My anxiety, my depression, my feelings of worthlessness have all been to such an extreme that it has been impacting my day to day life. I've lost 7 pounds in just 5 days from not eating. I can't find a psychiatrist or a doctor willing to take me until at least three months from now, so medication is not an option. I've been extremely candid with both of these ""friends"" about how alone I feel right now. However, neither one of them seem to actually care. Sometimes I have to wait more than 24 hours just for a response to a text message. They claim I can call anytime, however they know my anxiety won't allow it. Isn't it easier to respond to text messages when you have a moment rather than to take a long call? 

Yesterday was the most traumatic day of my life for reasons I won't go into. When I shared what had happened with ""friend"" #1 all I received was a one text message response: ""that's how it goes."" I shared it with the other one and they simply said: ""how are you feeling now?"" I intentionally sent a response that was open-ended to get a follow-up reply and they have yet to respond. Yet, they've managed to find the time to send multiple group chat messages and pictures since then. 

I don't understand how these people can be so cold and cruel to me. Maybe I'm just being irrational. Maybe I'm expecting way too much. Maybe I'm allowing my standards to fall so low because without these two ""friends"" I literally have no one else. Is it so hard to find a reciprocal friendship? Someone who cares as much about you as you care about them?

Sorry for the rant but I'm feeling so down that I just have to get it out or otherwise it will just crush me even further."
lonely,Not sure how to feel,"Not sure how to feel - Hello all,

I’m just here to vent. Somethings may not make sense so I apologize in advance. I just want to get everything off my chest. 

Recently a few of my close friends graduated university. I would have also graduated if I stayed on track but I still have 1.5 years left. It’s left a bittersweet feeling inside me.

On one hand, I’m super excited and happy for them. Yet, on the other hand, I am sad I wasn’t able to walk the stage as well. I know everyone lives on different timelines but it’s still saddening to me. 

Whenever new change comes it’s exciting but I also don’t like change. I like things to be familiar and when it’s not I feel lost inside and unsure of how to adapt quickly. 

I’ll also be in summer school and I know summer is a time for people to go out, vacation, reset, and what not. But I’ll be inside studying most days since my major is very demanding. Which also adds onto the sadness I feel. Knowing I won’t be out as much. And I know choosing my studies over a night out is a must if I want to graduate but I still feel lonely. 

This week was my first week of summer classes and I already feel lonely as ever. I have a significant other who I’ve expressed my recent feelings to but we are long distance and I’m not able to get hugs from them to feel comfort. I do have a really great support system and I love them all very much. I just have a lot of things on my mind lately and idk what to do. I used to struggle a lot with suicidal thoughts and I can slowly feel them coming back. I’m trying to do what I can to not let myself fall down that hole again but it’s harder this time. 

For those that read this thank you for letting my vent. I hope you are all finding ways to keep yourself going."

lonely,End of this short term relationship makes me feel suicidal. I tried my best. I really did.,"End of this short term relationship makes me feel suicidal. I tried my best. I really did. - I went through a short term relationship last year but I’m still hurting very badly. 

We met on a dating app and after 4 dates he expressed his interest in me. He told me he liked me and wanted to take things further. I told him that I do have some concerns such as both of us being very busy with work. But he told me to reconsider and also said that work is always here to stay and both of us could have work dates together.

Sensing that he was sincere, I stayed on and he also tried to hold my hand on a few occasions when we were out so I assumed that he really was into me and wanted to pursue a r/s with me. Then I asked him to define the r/s. 

However, shortly after getting together, he was constantly not being able to keep to his promises and would overpromise but turn out to be flakey. He was also talking about long term plans and marriage initially, which pressurised me as well. It made me very anxious and insecure. 

He would also seem off when we were out together. And when I asked him if he was angry or unhappy, he would just say no. I thought I was being too sensitive.

I recall there was this one day when he ignored my messages for a whole day which made me anxious and I called him 4 times only for him to reply in the evening saying that his mum and sis had a big fight and he just didn’t had the mood for anything. Thinking back now, I felt so so silly for calling him 4 times out of fear and anxiousness. I wanted to be there for him but he didn’t want to talk about it.

Since then we spoke and I expressed that it’ll be good for him to just communicate and let me know if he needs space. He also mentioned that he felt that we were spending too much time together (I was seeing him on zoom 2-3 times on weekdays for a short while and once on weekends in person). So I compromised to once on weekends and once on zoom on weekdays just to catch up with each other(we don’t call each other nor have any common texting time where we are both online chatting). We also compromised to just texting once(a few messages exchanges) in a day. He even told me that he has a lot on his plate namely his mum, sis, manager and boss and my first thought was “then what about me”. But instead I told him I was there to just care and get to know him. 

It was really hurting my heart that he couldn’t even take some time out for me and I was constantly waiting for him to get back to me. I also had to hold back my feelings and wanting to see him at his convenience. 

A few weeks later, he ended things through text message saying that he’s too busy with work and can’t give me the attention I need/expect and he’s too tired to maintain a r/s right now. I was also denied a phone call to talk it out. I was really hurt and sad that he didn’t communicate anything and blindsided me. I saw his profile on OKC weeks after the breakup. 

I’ve been thinking about it and felt like I’ve done my best in the relationship and put in all my effort too. I trusted him so much. That was my pure and genuine heart. 

I’m not perfect but tried to do everything right. But the way he didn’t want to spend time/pushed me away got me constantly questioning myself if I’m way too needy and if I am supposed to withhold my feelings and my need to see/spend time with them because of their busy schedule.  

Almost 10 months later, I’m still hurting but I do think he left unscathed and is already seeing someone else. He even created a Spotify playlist for her. Did nothing of this sort when he was seeing me. I can’t seem to stop this hurt. I really can’t"

lonely,Hopelessly utterly completely in love,"Hopelessly utterly completely in love - People of Reddit, I’m pretty sure a lot of people aren’t going to see this post but yesterday over a 4 hour call with my best friend who’s in New York, I finally told her how strongly I felt for a guy, let’s call him X. A little background on me is that, I’ve been in love before or At least I thought it to be love. I can quite honestly say that throughout those 4 years of my life I had been nothing but honest, loyal and trusting but he at the same time used to gaslight me, cheat on me multiple times and keep on calling me psycho for calling him out on his shit. One day I had enough and I left, I left the relationship which once had meant the world to me. After a year of blocking my ex and no contact I started talking to X who just happened to reply on one of my Instagram stories. We talked and talked and it felt unreal, I had never believed that I’d ever be truly in love after the whole situation with my ex, but this guy kept on coming in my life breaking thru all the walls I had put up. I never believed in love meant for you at the right time, but after this guy came into my life I realised that was true because I studied with X for two years in the same space and social circle and subjects before I moved to london for uni. What was kind of unbelievable is that I had never even thought about this guy romantically until after I left and was 3000 miles away from him. After almost 2 months of texting back and forth, he came to London. He was visiting his grandparents in london along with his mother and he was here for almost a month. Out of 30 days we hanged out for 20ish days. I had been the happiest I ever was with him and the memories I made I still cherish. After he went back home I couldn’t control the feeling I felt for him. Even though I tried to repress it, hide it or just run away from it. I couldn’t because I had truly fallen head over heels for this guy. This wasn’t the normal definition of love, I didn’t love him because he was mine or he was with me. I loved him because it was simply him, in a way he helped me reconnect with god, not by being religious or even talking about religion but just by existing and being such a beautiful human. When I pray to God I do not ask God to give me this person, I ask God to keep X happy no matter what, I ask God to make place for me in his heart and that if he is meant for me, make it easier for me to accept it, to accept him. It’s hard for me come to terms with the fact that what I feel for him is something I’ve never felt before, I’ve never been so helpless when it comes to love. I’ve always got the person I wanted in a matter of days. But for X it’s like I don’t want to rush things in fear of them being ruined, I’m afraid to loose him even though I don’t really have him. Him existing in my life is important, and maybe I don’t want to be in a relationship with him because I think so much of him that the day he breaks my heart I won’t be able to take it. That would be a heart break that would end up consuming my soul. Loving him from afar would be much easier than having him commit to me only to break me later on :(
Dear Reddit readers/users, it’s been a year since I’ve been talking to him, a couple of months since we last met, and 3 months till he’s moving to london 🥺 I dont know why I’m writing this and I don’t know what to do."
lonely,"Today wasn't a great day in the first place, but I was also reminded of how much of a socially inept loser I actually am.","Today wasn't a great day in the first place, but I was also reminded of how much of a socially inept loser I actually am. - I had a bittersweet day I guess. I saw a movie with my brother and his friends, like I said, *his* friends, I don't have any of my own.

I already hadn't slept last night whatsoever, so I already felt/feel pretty bad, the lack of sleep also contributed to the anxiety I've had all day, it did distract me during a good chunk of the movie, but I still definitely enjoyed it and had a good time overall. 

Also, in this group of people was a girl I have a crush on for some reason, even though I don't know her at all, and vice versa. We've never actually spoken one on one  before, outside of extremely hand-waved interactions over the years. 

Today was no different, not that I expected or felt like I deserved anything, but every time I know I'm gonna be around her, in the back of my mind I think ""Wow, what if this is the time where we end up interacting and something crazy happens, like we continue to interact via social media or something outside of this occasion?"".

Anyway, on the way out of the theater, we're all walking through the hallway that leads to the exit.

My brother, whom I pathetically follow around like a lost puppy whenever I'm involved in one of his get-togethers, goes into the bathroom. 

After this, I'm just standing by myself in front of the rest of the group, his friends, they don't notice me because they're all talking about the movie and or looking at their phones, but in that moment I realized that I was staring at a bunch of strangers. They aren't *my* friends, and the idea of mingling with them there was terrifying. After I realized this in a matter of seconds, I just went straight into the bathroom to avoid it. I did also have to go to the bathroom, but that moment was what really motivated me to go in.

I'm in bed now. It's irrelevant, but I spent the 40 dollars of spending money I had on 3 phone chargers and cookies. I realize that I bought one more charger than needed, so I could've had 10 dollars left. Whatever though.

Now I'm gonna try to sleep. I have to wake up at a normal time tomorrow, and I dread that. 

Goodnight."

lonely,[TW] I wish I had a mother to celebrate mother's day with,"[TW] I wish I had a mother to celebrate mother's day with - I have a mother living, yes but she doesn't deserve me. She is a typical Karen. She wants the title of a mother but doesn't wanna work. Ever since I could remember, my father has been taking care of me. I wish I could have a mother just for mothers day so I wouldn't be left out. I feel left out, seeing kids bonding with their mothers. 

I see my own mother as the equivalent of Satan. She is homophobic, narcissistic, anti-vax, racist, sexist, you name it. She says she'll disown me if I get a girlfriend. She disowns me because she read my diary and found out I'm trans. She says hurtful things like ""I'd rather have a dead kid than a gay kid."" 

People tell me to forgive her. I won't because we're like 2 raging, charging bulls fighting, neither giving up or backing down. She doesn't deserve forgiveness. She's had *way* too many chances to change. She won't. She is very attention-seeking. 

She always babies me. I'm 14. I have zero freedoms when I'm with her. She signed me up for weight loss stuff because ""I'd rather have a dead kid than a fat kid."" I'm very skinny for my age. I'm severely underweight. 

She says she'd ""rather have a dead kid than an unhealthy kid."" She's very fat and overweight, made zero effort in losing it. Blames it on me because ""you made a deal with the devil to make me fat."" 

I only used an Ouija board *once* because I was peer pressured by my friends, who were very popular, when I was 11. I was very naive and stupid, I always wanted to be in the popular crowd. I played the *whole* way through. Not once did I mention my mother. The only things I said were ""Is anyone there?"" and ""Thank you so much for speaking to us, we really appreciate it, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, goodbye."" I was a sweet kid. Didn't even know what an Ouija Board was. Didn't touch one since. Yes, they did claim they were a good spirit named Zoey.

Anyways, she claimed that I was making deals with the devil and cursing her. She's insane. She thinks the world revolves around her. She is very entitled. 

My parents are separated and she once just strolled into my house while I was home alone as if she owned it. Her name is on the deed but still. I told her to (not too kindly) get the fuck out of my house or I'll call the police. She tried to call my bluff. They said that they couldn't do anything as ""well, she owns it too so she can do that."" I was pissed.

When my parents went to court, the court said that I must see her *every freaking Sunday until I'm 16 and can decide* I also have to call her every night, no choice until I'm 16. I'm ashamed of her.

If you're a genuinely good parent, with kids, I'd love an online parent. I really need someone. I'd prefer Discord but whatever works. I'd love to be friends with your kids if they're around my age as well. I'm really lonely. I'd love to celebrate mother's day with a mother figure. I'm in Massachusetts so timezones may be an issue.

Thank you for reading my whole vent. If we video/voice chat, I'd like someone else present because I've had *way* too many creeps in my time in this dreaded existence."

I'm comforted by the idea that I am not alone in my loneliness, as weird as that sounds."

lonely,Anyone else feel like everyone around you is waiting for a chance to jump ship?,"Anyone else feel like everyone around you is waiting for a chance to jump ship? - I’m at arguably the lowest point in my life so far mental health wise and I can’t help but feel like I’ve lost everyone.

I’ve felt like this nearly my entire life whether it be with family or friends but it’s never been more apparent than now. It seems like I have to carry everything in a relationship. Making plans, starting and maintaining conversations - all done by me. It honestly feels like no one really likes me but feels pressured to be my friend through my persistence alone.

And now I’m losing even that. I’ve pretty much stopped looking at my phone now. I never have any messages or contact from others. Where are those ‘checking up on a depressed friend’ and ‘adopting an introvert’ people that seemingly exist somewhere.

I feel like I’m out at sea and all of the life boats are sailing away because they’ve grown bored of me.

At work it seems like everyone is friends with each other and I’m the odd one out. The same at university and with my own family. I’ll be asked the same 3 or 4 questions about work and school and then I’ll be left alone until it’s time to part.

Am I doing something wrong?"
lonely,I can’t stop telling myself that my loneliness was caused by my family,"I can’t stop telling myself that my loneliness was caused by my family - I’m , I have 2 older sisters, G is 1 year older than me and the other, M is 6 years older. Until I was 8 yo I was a really girly girl, but at that age I changed country with my father and sisters and I started to be more like a tomboy till I was 16 yo birthdays. 
Since kid, people always called me fat (even though I wanst) and said I have too much facial hair (I became completely self aware about it). Teenagers would talk about my nose and acne. The only thing people would complement about me was my hair but with age they changed and people would talk about how ugly it was. So with all that my self esteem was inexistent and I didn’t believe I could be love.

In the other hand, G was never bullied about almost anything, only her brows what she could easily fix and she was always complimented about her physics and how beautiful she was.

M was always complimented too, she’s the pretty older sister that everybody likes.

Till this day I don’t know why but when we were all in social event my sisters or my father would ask to people to rank us to the most pretty to the ugliest… I let you guess who always was the last on

And this plus others things made me just be so self aware and hating myself that can’t socialize and live a normal live without telling myself what people think about me."
lonely,I’m so alone even with the people I have in my life right now,"I’m so alone even with the people I have in my life right now - Hey everyone, I hate to vent, but this feeling is crushing me. I have had an immense amount of difficulty going to college, and I’m thoroughly convinced college is only fun if you’re either a woman or a frat boy. I have a girlfriend that I love, my family around me, and a friend group I’ve known since middle school, but I can’t stop feeling alone at all moments. What is going on?? Why is this happening to me in the sense that I still don’t feel at all NOT alone?"
lonely,boyfriend works to much ..,"boyfriend works to much .. - 
Hey im Mia and im 18, my boyfriend is 18
I just want to open up and vent to anyone because I have no one.

So for a little background me and my boyfriend don't live together and we don't get to see eachother as often , and I'm not a girlfriend to complain to him that ""he works to much"", I keep it to myself. We do text and rarley communicate our feelings as much due to the fact he works and hes very tired and exhausted to hear me complain lol, but we only get to text for 10 minutes and he's off to work again...

Now let's get to the problem, he started working retail about 3 months ago , his shifts start from 8pm -5am . So when he does get home he goes to bed, wakes up around 6pm and 2 hours to get ready to work again, it's the same sceduale every day . My problem is that he's not very lovey dovey as much only when it conveys to his hornyness,  the other problem is that when he does get a 2 day break he sleeps which is fine but he goes straight to gaming and once he's done gaming he goes to bed and does the same thing over again . 
I'm not sure if I'm being too hypocritical about his job or him , but I've been feeling sad and drained putting so much energy on this relationship im constantly the one asking how is his day going, what did he do, what did u eat, Simple little questions.
 
Their was this time he got upset at me for not sending him a late night paragraph. I passed out because I was sleepy . But, he's the one at work having breaks and never once has he sent me one. 

Overall, I'm not sure if I'm sounding crazy or if I'm  doing something wrong in this relationship,  I don't know what to do or say because I just need advice ."
lonely,Maybe I deserve my loneliness,Maybe I deserve my loneliness - I was a loner in high school having only one friend. I thought college would be different and I did make a friend group and I ruined it by saying something stupid. Now they hate me so maybe I deserve it. Maybe I deserve to be lonely. Maybe the reason I’m always alone is because I’m just a shitty person. Im so sick of being alone but maybe I deserve it maybe I’m destined to be friendless and be alone.
lonely,i need help,"i need help - Ive got 2 Friends which is the only thing keeping me Alive  at this point. When we split to go to seprete schools in July nothing matters anymore. So why is there a reason to still be here. No one cares about me, im lonely and dont deserve to be here."
lonely,Got to the point where I pushed,"Got to the point where I pushed - Got to the point where I pushed all my remaining friends away. I'm in my 30s. I don't have much going for me. I had dreams only a couple of years ago but took a wrong turn and was afraid of judgement. I don't know what to do. More therapy? I can't afford a good therapist, though I know which one and I can't seem to forgive my parents and ask for their help. I want them to see me in pain and know how they fucked up my life by being emotionally neglectful. The ultimate your sacrifices were for nothing. Yeah it's kinda pitiful to still be this angry at your parents in your 30s, but I can't seem to let this resentment go. I pushed my friends away because I cant trust them. I had a somewhat stressful childhood and lacked support and a few traumatic experiences but nothing too out of the ordinary. Mostly its short of providing the basics of food I felt that nobody had any space to care and I was supposed to be the mature one at my age and not ask the because even then I recognized how overwhelmed they were. Now I'm older and moved back home to see if I could use it to gain some ground in employment but couldn't. I can't stand the thought of my parents seeing me happy after the shit I've gone through. Now that they are emotional and needy and society wants me to take care of them and they are playing the same guilt games. Why not just kill myself and have them see it or wait until they pass away without closure and move on with my life after that. Fucking people want to control my life until the very end."
lonely,Ever see something that causes your loneliness to overwhelm you?,"Ever see something that causes your loneliness to overwhelm you? - I'm sure the answer is yes but earlier today it happened to me. I was walking to the store and even though the weather isn't good, some people were outside. I walked by this one place where this couple was showing PDA and even though I'm used to seeing it, today it was too much that made me go off internally. I got home before it got the best of me but when I got home, I kept thinking about seeing them looking at each other in a loving way, then him touching her on the shoulder as they laughed at something. This feeling of panic with me thinking, why can't that ever be me became so loud I ended up breaking down for a while. It wasn't about them but what they represented. He was good looking, and so was she. Obviously I know why it will never be me, but just seeing them was too much for me. I know someone will say you can't let that get to you and focus on yourself. Easier said than done especially if you have never had a relationship. The way she looked at him was something I've craved my entire adult life. This was maybe 30 seconds that it took to see them, walk by, then look back once. If this has happened to you, what caused it?"
lonely,I don't know much longer I can take it.,"I don't know much longer I can take it. - I feel pathetic even writing this but I don't know where else to turn. I'm a 23 year old woman who's accomplished nothing in her life. Left school at 14 due to bullying at both school and home which drove me to my first suicide attempt. Education and work wise, I have nothing going for me. Friendships often turn into something romantic because for whatever reason people do not seem to want to be my friend, they either want sex or nothing else. I have come to the conclusion that I am only meant to be in people's lives for a short while. Nothing more, nothing less. I crave connection more than anything else on this planet. There is so much I want to do and see with my life but right now it feels like disaster after disaster. I don't know what to do anymore."
lonely,29 and no friends,"29 and no friends - I have nothing. Never been close to siblings, had ""friends"" in HS who ditched me the moment it was done. Never been an asshole, but always been the shy quiet one. 

Most of the time, didn't really care about being alone. I hear all the time about how Jonah has all these problems, Lauren talks crap, and Ronnie stabbing people in the back, so I figured I'm better off alone. No drama, no new problems or worries, no having to feel bad about not being able to help people. 

This happened every so often where I would feel lonely, but it's hitting like a truck. I'm getting older and I figured by now i'd have made a friend but I have nothing. I have a job, I talk to people, but it's nothing conversations. Work safe BS. I don't have anyone I can connect to on a human level. I have siblings and never had any connection to them. Everyone feels like they're on different planes of reality. It doesn't help that I have borderline personality disorder either, along with autism, and just abandonment issues in general. So I mean, all that combining into me just makes me very untrusting, and worried about any kind of connection, for the thought of it being severed. 

I don't know what to do at all. I've tried going it alone, and it hurts. And for the love of everything you believe in, please, I'm begging you. Don't just leave a stupid comment saying ""it gets better"", or something like that. I'm 29, almost 30, and I have never had anyone I could truly trust or be myself around. It feels horrible, constantly having to barricade myself in, and feeling like those walls are never coming down for anyone. 

No love, no friendship, nothing. Just alone."

I’m starting to believe I should just get comfortable being alone, and that love isn’t real. I really wish I wasn’t so ugly. I also wish I wasn’t so boring, I’ve literally only had 3 friends in my life so my social skills are terrible. Can someone pls talk to me?"

lonely,Loneliness is a Vicious cycle that almost nobody will help you escape.,"Loneliness is a Vicious cycle that almost nobody will help you escape. - I've recently realized that if you're lonely, curing it is nearly impossible. When you meet new people, not only do you have to vet them, but they are also vetting you. If you're feeling sad, or you come across as desperate, they won't want anything to do with you. Let's be real. Most people who are lonely are sad and desperate. These qualities are seen as toxic and undesirable. You have to fake happiness and cheeriness to get people to talk to you and like you, and while you're doing that, you feel like you can't be your true self around them. You're giving them a facade and you're not making a true connection. It's a lose lose situation which only worsens the problem. It makes you feel like giving up and asking ""What's the point?"" This makes it less likely for you to reach out to people and try to make a connection, and each rejection makes you question whether it's truly worth it. Eventually you think ""Oh, I guess I'll be alone. I'm ok with this."" Until you get desperate to reach out again and start the process over.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, it isn't any body else's fault. Why shouldn't they want someone cheery and fun to be around? Would you want to be with someone that ruins your mood? 

So what's the solution? Honestly, I don't know. Something needs to change, but that's easier said than done. The only thing we can do is keep trying and hope our efforts are rewarded."

Well as I got older into my late 20s and early 30s, I sorta got over it. This year is my first year as a mother. People wished me Happy Mother’s Day and all but my husband was standoffish all day. I asked him if something is wrong, he said no. I told him I’m feeling sad because we haven’t talked much today. (I was feeling lonely and back in the self pity mode again) He snapped at me saying “don’t you get it? I’m tired I don’t want to talk “. It just made me feel so much worse. He hasn’t even acknowledged that it’s Mother’s Day to me whatsoever."
lonely,"Things continue to change for the better, but my real problem remains unsolved","Things continue to change for the better, but my real problem remains unsolved - Over the last two years, I have made huge progress in terms of my mental health, motivation, and depression. I cultivated healthy habits, and now I eat healthy, exercise regularly, practice yoga, implement therapeutic measures for when I feel myself spiralling out of control, I journal and I pursue many many things that I love everyday. I am a great student, and beyond that I am able to pursue my hobbies. I am objectively, very happy with where I am now.

But, I still feel so alone. Everyone told me to love myself. So I put in effort to take care of myself, to spend time with myself. I groom myself, work out for myself, I eat healthy for MYSELF, I do everything in this life without expecting anything outside of my own self happiness. And I am happy. I do like myself. Maybe I even love the person I am today. It's getting better and better.

But at night, when I come back to my room and lie on my bed, I realize I want to just cuddle and kiss before we drift off to sleep in each other's arms.

I am happy. I just wish I had someone to share it with. I wish I had someone I could share the down moments just as much as the up moments. The excitement, the happiness, the love, it all feels so tiring when I'm all alone."

I didn't leave my house unnecessarily and if I did I just threw on a  band shirt and some old leggings.  

My mom convinced me to attempt to lose the weight I gained if nothing else for my health. So I restarted my gym membership and I even got a personal trainer.  I dropped weight and I was starting to feel a little better about myself.  With that I started wearing a little makeup and dressing a little nicer. I even bought the platform shoes I've had my eye on for weeks and braided my hair. 

The whole time not one guy or girl even looked my way. I didn't get any dates and I damn sure didn't get a bf or gf. I didn't even have one greasy ass dude in my inbox looking to blow my back out.  It was like this for weeks, I started to feel like shit again so I went back to the band shirts and old leggings.  I bought shirts three sizes too big just to hide more of myself in.

I've never had that 'close' group of friends and sometimes I find that really lonely. Sometimes I feel like no one really knows me. As I was in relationships from the age of 17 (almost 10 years with maybe a year gap) I always had someone who I felt knew me and I didn't have to perform for at all. But I've been single now for around two years and I do struggle with that feeling of being alone even though I do have some close friends. Does anyone else relate? I also find it difficult to balance my energy, sometimes I can feel really drained just by being around people and have to then rest and recharge.

She is jealous if I get better grades than her(I always get). She always jokes about how much I study but tbh I don't study at all(because of my mental health) whereas she studies 24×7.But she is always like ""Ohhh!!

The student in me died a good few years ago, I’m not saying I don’t have the ability to learn anymore but I definitely don’t have the ability or willpower to right my academic accords. I think I’d be able to graduate considering barely any coding heavy courses are left and it’s mostly earth science, math and physics which are relatively a pushover for me, but yet again I find that sentiment so troubling. Math and science shouldn’t be thought of as a pushover but should instead ignite feelings of curiosity. Maybe it’s because most things don’t faze me anymore. Maybe I’ve felt everything I’ll ever feel and so I’ll never feel again. Maybe I’m being cynical towards my own mind and my own feelings. I wish I knew what it really is. Maybe I’m not supposed to know or that maybe figuring out is the real answer. Even writing this feels pointless especially if nobody will ever read this. Since, it feels so pointless coz nobody would be able to really understand and I’d instead get the ignorant “hey, it’s not that deep” or “that’s pretty gay bro”, which is still better than the fake “omg that’s so relatable” or the absurd sympathy. How can one offer sympathy when you can’t even fathom the struggle. Life isn’t exactly high stakes and I’m not losing either, the struggle is with feeling this weird ineffable feeling that even I can’t really understand and you’d offer sympathy when even the sufferer can’t fathom his own situation? That’s fake. I don’t know, perhaps I’m being ignorant. This was such a waste of time, I think I’ll find a suitable subreddit to post it in for no real purpose, which seems like a theme for my life."
lonely,there will be no change,"there will be no change - Even given the fantastical odds I actually do manage to form a meaningful relationship of any kind, I know myself. And knowing myself I know it'd be destined to fall apart...not worth the pain. I am alone, all I have is myself regardless of of my own self opinion things will never change. So I accept myself, even though I'm crazy lol I'm all I have. All I'll ever understand and be connected to is myself. And there's no point in entertaining a feeling when my state of my being is for the most part is unchanging...I was here before mentally but intend to stake my life around this time if I ever fall into desperation. The feeling of loneliness just fools me into believing there could be different when in reality I will never change. I am what I am and if being myself dictates I live a life of solitude that's just my natural of being. And going against will just give cause more needless pain when life is torturous already. I shouldn't delude myself into believing things could be different l. I shouldn't let an emotion dictate my actions nor should I fein emotion in order to escape the overwhelming amount of emptiness I feel....my hatred will never leave but there's no need to act upon it. I get nothing in any case...so the less I do the better"
lonely,Fake friends?,Fake friends? - Basically I was hanging out with my friends and they were talking about leaving people out of stuff and this boy that was there mentioned the others leaving me out of something and I was confused and when I said what they kinda just stood their awkwardly and I don’t know how to feel about it also I tried to avoid them the next day but they kept on saying hi. No matter how much I avoid them they won’t leave me alone
lonely,Realisation you have no friends,Realisation you have no friends - I've always found it difficult to make friends. The friends I thought I had were from secondary school I wasn't able to make friends at Uni or the job I've been in for the last 5 years. I had a baby in November and apart from parents no one has seen her even though I put out the invitation multiple times. I even had a day and plan set up with one person who literally just didn't show up. I was the only person to initiate conversation and if I don't we will literally go months without talking. Then I see them post on instagram stories that they're all out together and I realise no one actually cares.

lonely,losing hope,"losing hope - Hi 

I've written on here before seeking advice/help. Please see my post history for more background. 

I'm turned 30 on 7th May. Looking back I've nothing to show for these 29 years. I grew up waiting and expecting life to happen and it just didn't. Not for me anyway. I've never had a girlfriend and struggle in most social situations. I'm really lonely. The only people I speak to are my family and people at/involving work. 

The worst thing is I try to go out of my way to help people. If I know someone is going though a difficult period, I try to make them smile and laugh. Sometimes at my own expense.

I did follow up on some of the advice I was given. I joined a gym. Lost over 2 stone in 6 weeks but no one talks to anyone. Everyone stays in their own little groups of friends or just stick their headphones on. 

I signed up to online dating. Haven't had anything yet. Don't even know where to start with this really. 

I'm half and half about online therapy. Probably too late for me at my time of life. 

I'm starting to realise that I'm never going to have the life I dreamed of or a family of own that I yearn for. 

You can probably imagine how I'm feeling now if you haven't already guessed. Lost is one and the overall feeling of defeat. 

Anybody have any further advice or hope to offer? 

Thank you for your time."

Life short, tho I’m young. - Each day becomes harder and lonelier, that I just started to slowly stop giving a fuck about life. I feel like death would be such a merciful act upon me, but I wouldn’t kill myself, as I’m too scared to do so. Instead I feel like I want to live life to the extreme for a short period of time. In this moment I’d love to just drink myself to sleep, smoke and drug the hell out of me.. everything is stressful, the pandemic, now fucking war, all unexpected..

lonely,Lonely AS F…,"Lonely AS F… - I am so lonely. I feel like i might go insane sometimes. I feel like my existence is pointless now..I  look forward to go to work because that’s all I have in life. I have no friends anymore, I wasted the best years on all the wrong people, one sided friendships. I’ve had some good times at times don’t get me wrong, but when the shit hits the fan you’re on your own! 
I lost my mum 3 years ago and that’s when I really realised how many friends I didn’t actually have. Zero. My best friend of many many years and we were close, was no where to be seen and I have grieved so much not just for my mum but for the lost friends that I once truly cared about, I’ve grieved for my youth and all the bad decisions I made along the way. Ive grieved for my children growing up so quickly and all the drama that has happened. I’ve been lost in depression and grief and I always go back to it, I beat myself up inside and blame myself for so much and every bad choice my children make. 
It’s so hard at times dealing with it all alone.

I’ve been with the same man for three years, only to recently find out about a lot of lying and betrayal. He asked me for another chance and because I love him and have faith in him I gave it to him, but it still seems like there’s more distance between us now than there has ever been.  He said he couldn’t see me this weekend because he was unable to find a babysitter and isn’t sure his kids would be comfortable with me around them yet.

I have a lot of friends but since I moved 35 minutes away from them it’s like everyone forgets I exist. I’m just kind of at a place today where I feel forgotten.  I’m generally an upbeat and happy person but lately it’s like I feel worthless. I just don’t have anyone to talk to and I don’t want to keep feeling this way. I don’t know if it’s me or if it’s me allowing people in situations in my life that I should move on from, but I don’t wanna feel this sadness all the time anymore.  I just needed to say this out loud. Thanks for listening."

lonely,Feeling more alone when around other people in person.,"Feeling more alone when around other people in person. - Would like to hear your experiences with this.

It's sort of like the negative aspects of solipsism, you only know what's in your own brain and that is lonely. 

Sure you can have shared experiences and sometimes experiences that seem to transgress and blur that line, usually with a significant other or very close friends. Once I was on mushrooms and I swear my friend and I were communicating telepathically.

Anyway I've been trying to get out there and be more social. But then I am hang-out with people who aren't super close friends. But they are all happy and gregarious, and I can be too. I can mirror the mood easily. And honesty there is much more factors to my specific situations that prbabsly resulting my lonely feeling being extra amplified. 

However I've had this feeling not all all time, or in every situation but frequently since I was a child. Where I am around others the mood is good people are vibing, but inside my head it all feels plastic. Like I'm not on their level of sociability. And I resky try not to compare myself to others. I almost always feel this sense of alienation and it makes me want to run away; run to where zi can be *truly* alone and in that more comfortable. 

Sometimes being lonely, truly alone, *can* be more comfortable than being around others. And it sort of reinforces why I am alone. I don't like it, but it's somtimez better than being around people  who you don't get or who don't get you.

Anyway, can anyone relate to any of this? Have any anecdotes you like to share?"
lonely,Can we just demolish society as a whole and return to living a caveman lifestyle?,"Can we just demolish society as a whole and return to living a caveman lifestyle? - Now obviously this would be catastrophic in many respects BUT this would ultimately truly cure many of our loneliness tbh…… because now we can easily relate to everyone we come across because we’re all on the same goal: to get food, water, shelter, and find a mate. Nothing insane but we’d all be on the same common mission and that really strengthen bonds with one another."

lonely,I never regretted being lonely until my mid forties,"I never regretted being lonely until my mid forties - My whole life has been solo. 

My mother died when I was nine. She was my world. I was forced to live with a step family that openly hated me. And never included me in their family. 

I then found a friend in substances and started hanging out with criminals and the isolation that comes from that world. That lifestyle doesn't last long. I ended up spending over a decade in prison. 

Now, I'm older, somewhat wiser and I finally stopped and turned around to see the wreckage I caused. Man, I wrecked a lot of lives. 

 No family. Or none that want to associate with me. I have a few friends but not that they will ever understand me. And this lockdown isolated me even more. I don't know if those friends are still there.  I never had a girlfriend. Sex was for getting off and not for intimacy, whatever that is. 

Now I'm in my forties and I went from being alone to lonely. It's somewhat crippling when I stop and let those thoughts become intrusive. For those that are young. Do whatever you can to rewrite the path your on. There ain't no sunshine on this path at all. Just regret. I wish somebody had gotten to me when I was young, instead of ignoring me."
lonely,perpetual loneliness is ruining me,"perpetual loneliness is ruining me - I've never had a girlfriend / boyfriend, never held hands with anyone before, never kissed anyone, virgin (go figure), never had a friend group. no matter how many times i've tried to fit in. i'm quiet so people forget i exist, i'm not attractive either so i'm pretty sure my looks on top of my quiet and shy manner scare people especially women away.

i have hobbies i really enjoy that i wish i could share with people who cared. no one likes the same music as me, the same anime as me, the same games as me. i like fashion but i'm too broke to afford and nervous to dress myself how i want to. i've started more self care last year and working into my looks but i still feel like an ugly fuck when i'm out in public. like everyones eyes are focused on me.

i just go to work. come home to play lost ark alone, maybe genshin. browse tiktok and get a good laugh, probably find a funny video i want to send to someone then i realize i have no one to. end up seeing a happy couple and feeling worse than i started. i can't enjoy the shows i used to love, romance anime make me want to throw up. i have no motivation to open a book anymore either.

i'm an insomniac. i can't sleep longer than 4 hours a night. i survive off caffeine at work as well. i feel like pure shit the whole day on top of my worsening mental health. life could be worse for me honestly. i have a family that cares, a stable household and everything yet i still feel like &gt;!offing myself!&lt; every day. the guilt for not appreciating the few good things i have in my life hurts me even more.

really i just feel so desperate for basic human interaction. i used to log into vrchat everynight just to listen to people talk so i feel like i'm around friends. i only have 2 friends i speak to online. they're both slowly losing interest in me and its been a week since i've called anyone. tldr i'm lonely, desperate for friends, craving feelings i can't experience, jealous of normal people. but i'm a guy in 2022 so who really cares."

I've done this multiple times to someone I hold dear to me that I've met through twitch in 2020 and I'm starting to feel guilty because aside from deleting them/unfollowing them multiple times I barely even watch their streams anymore (I always leave a lurk tho) I was actually thinking of apologizing since they probably are confused or haven't realized but I'm scared to apologize they'll probs not even open the msg but I can't stop thinking about it. I think this all started last year in May.
lonely,M19 - I want to be friends with a female that needs help atm like I do,"M19 - I want to be friends with a female that needs help atm like I do - Broke up a month ago with my long distance girlfriend who I met online. She decided that after all this time, the long distance is unbearable, and she said that eventhough I'm so loving and caring, she had to give that up because of the distance. This really shattered my heart and I've cried a lot about it. 

I started thinking about quiting my habit of getting to know new people, because look what attachment got me! But, I later realized that I have so so much more love to give, and a heartbreak should not change my personality into a blunt person, nor change what I deserve from my acquaintances.

I deserve consistency and honesty. I want a consistent friend who is not gonna fake promise things or ghost me for no reason. In return I'll be myself and put my time and effort to make your day better as I did with everyone else previously. All I ask for is matching my energy and being genuinely considerate and friendly. 

I always feel better opening up to a female than a man, and what makes me happy is making other people happy, so I just wanna help a girl my age speak her mind, as I love helping people solve their issues and seeing them improve as a person"

lonely,Best coping strategies for loneliness?,"Best coping strategies for loneliness? - The pain and boredom of unending loneliness day after day becomes fucking unbearable sooner or later. 

I wouldn’t survive without coping strategies. Weed is the main one, I don’t know how I’d live without knowing that I can smoke weed and forget about how sad and worthless my life is. 

I also drink alcohol, masturbate, over eat fast food, walk for 5 hours or more, play video games, write self pitiful Reddit posts about how sad and lonely I am even though I know it won’t fix everything and no life advise is going to magically change anything. 

I try do positive coping strategies like picking up litter in the park, making music, etc but it gets lonely and stops working. I would volunteer loads if I wasn’t a social freak, but I hate meeting people because they don’t like me and find me uncomfortable to even stand near.  

What other stuff can you do to forget the truth?"

We just kept silence for a large part of the time. She looked disappointed for this dating.  


I felt very sad after I came home. I just caught a chance but I lost it because of my incompetence. I did not know that why I couldn't do something that is easy for others. Why the topics couldn't just pop in my head, but I still couldn't find it even when I thought hard. I felt even more hopeless than ever because I knew even I had a date I was going to screw it."

Most of the time everyone is too busy with mother's day to come celebrate with me. My husband kinda tries, but even when I tell him I want X, Y, and Z, he drops the ball... I told him I wanted a party, with balloons, the big shiny ones with your age, and wanted him to make it a big deal out of me turning 40. 

    I even put a party decorations bundle on my Amazon wishlist. What I got was a dinner with another couple, at one of my favorite restaurants. I loved the food and the company, don't get me wrong, but 40 is a milestone, and I wanted a bigger deal out of it. 

     He got me the exact gifts I wanted, but they are still in the Amazon packaging, he didn't even selected the giftwrapped option (he always does that because he WANTS to wrap it himself, with cuter wrapping), but he never actually ends up doing it, same thing happened on Christmas...

I have spent every day for so long just sat looking after my child, i work every late evening/ night 7 days a week and spend my days morning till dusk with my child whilst my partner has been busy or out. I put my child to bed and i leave for work.

My friend online started to flirt with me and i felt so lonely that i went with it. It didnt last long but now i have less than no one to be close with. I didnt know i could feel this alone.

I know this is my fault, i just wanted someone to pay even a fraction of attention to me. And now everyone is focused on me for all the wrong reason. 

I'm venting and feeling sorry for myself for what i've done but i really do feel like i'll never be accepted by anyone every again."
lonely,I can no longer bare my loneliness.,"I can no longer bare my loneliness. - Well, i don’t even know what to say. Again, I have returned to reddit to vent about my depressing life and my emotional well-being, not really expecting much to come out of this. Moreover, I even feel slightly ashamed.

It’s almost unbelievable how sad and pathetic my life is, especially for someone my age. I’m supposed to be at the height of my life, enjoying every day with the company of others. but here I am, wasting my life away reading books and surfing the web. It’s quite depressing, really.
I can’t express how much I hate my life, my past, and my environment. I really have tried to improve my life in anyway possible, despite everything, but I never seem to succeed. It’s like i’m always dragged back to sadness and despair, as a result of my loneliness. I just want to live a happy and fulfilling life, surrounded by people whom i love. But, at this point, such a vision is practically fantasy. I don’t know what to do. I don’t have much hope that my life will improve from now on.

Also, I would like to apologise if this is slightly incoherent to read. Please understand. Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
lonely,What is the solution to subjectivity?,"What is the solution to subjectivity? - Like all art life is very subjective. No two persons can experience a same event equally, not possible even from a scientific point of view. I live the lifestyle of a natural philosopher, never involved myself with humans personally except family. But 4 years ago the sacred geometry of chance played the dice and threw a person at me, I accepted the person and started to discover the human side of things, not that I didn't knew but felt for the first time. She was the most sensible person that I'd met ever. I was never a person to chat with someone for hours but I started doing it not realizing how addicted I was becoming to it. And for a person like me its a divine bond or friendship. But at this very crucial event of my life while everything is crashing and there seems to be no point of doing anything, nature took that person away from me. The person's alive and left me. Nature gave me a taste of company and took it away in a snap of a finger. And the horrors that I never felt before has dawned upon me. I don't see a point in writing this out to a community page due to subjectivity but everything else has failed since the past month. I'm just dis-functional and all alone. This time is the 11th hour for my career and is flowing like water and I'm helpless to see it go by. Begs the question, why such a cruel prank by the universe?"
lonely,"If you had a single wish, what would it be ?","If you had a single wish, what would it be ? - As for me, i think making the world run on karma would be great. I mean imagine : leaders that take advantage of people will get punished, we will all be inclined to be kind since we all know we will get punished for hurting people, good people that are currently suffering will get in a better place, etc.

I think this would simply help everyone that deserves it and punish everyone that deserves it."

lonely,Just too tired,"Just too tired - Pretty basic vent, so idk why I even typing this. I'm just so over being single (it's over a year already), just so over having no local friends/no one who has time to hang out (fuckers are busy starting families and building houses) and certainly over having no energy to do any shit on my own.

COVID restrictions are finally gone, I could go out, do shit, meet people, but now my workplace is forcing over time on us again, got off work at 10pm on Friday, wasted my whole Saturday on sleeping and doing chores/groceries and now Sunday is also already half over and I have like 9 hours of weekend left to do what exactly? I don't even have the energy to play a game I wanted to play for a decade by now and as it finally got a Remaster, I'm too tired to actually play it, I have played two hours of Chrono Cross so far, I want to play it, but I'm tired, have a headache, outside kids are screaming and I just want to murder them. And I shouldn't be playing, I should make time to go out and meet new people, no girl is coming to knock my door in after all, I'm 28 it would be a miracle to even find someone who isn't divorced, has a bunch of kids already and is down for something serious these days. At my workplace it's pretty much only guys and IMO it's generally a bad idea to seek romance where you work, yet on the weekends I usually don't have the energy left to go out, especially alone, it's no fun to do shit alone and I'm not exactly so extroverted that I make new friends within minutes, going out on my own usually means being on my own outside. It just sucks.

lonely,“Finding a romantic partner won’t solve all your mental health problems”,"“Finding a romantic partner won’t solve all your mental health problems” - Sure, but I see the positive effects having even just a simple friend around for a few days has on my behavior. 

I had a friend over a few weeks ago and before he arrived, I fully cleaned all my apartment, I fell asleep early and quickly instead of like 4am because I didn’t want to be a couch potato around him and I wanted to wake up early and not wake up around 10:30 and stay in bed staring at my phone until noon. Basically, I pushed myself to be a better version of myself because there was someone around who could see what my life is like. And it isn’t one I want someone to see, so I was motivated to look like I’m doing better than I am and it actually made me feel better. Because I was proud of myself.

I have a job now but I didn’t have one for over a year up until last week, because I couldn’t motivate myself to find a new one and didn’t feel capable of doing anything. I spent a weekend with an aunt and she showed me a job ad : I immediately applied to it because I didn’t want her to perceive me as lazy, and that’s my job now. 

I can spend days without saying a word to another person, and I feel like it makes my brain lazy, out of a lack of stimulation. I notice I tend to be much more eloquent and coherent after being around someone for some time. I can’t imagine how helpful it must be to have someone to talk to daily. Especially if it’s a person you love and have fun with. Someone who stimulates you. 

Having a romantic partner comes with displays of affection and physical touch has been proved to improve one’s moral and even global health through a boost of “feel-good” hormones."

So i sent a message asking if anyone would fancy a game and i check at least twice a day, and after a week nobody even answered me, then someone else puts a message asking for help and instantly gets 5 answers, so i asked again a few weeks later and shockingly o got zero replies,

So here's my test to see if trying to make friends for online gaming works or not, also I'm not actually asking for anyone to join to just see if i actually get a response, as im starting to think at my age people don't want an old dude joining their games

lonely,Night-Time,"Night-Time - It's always at night time. When it's just me and my thoughts. I usually a really happy guy, my friends see me us funny, apparently I'm caring and loving. It's when that fucking moon rolls around that the monster that is my brain will proceed to kick me into the dirt and leave me for dead. I have these terrible, terrible thoughts every night, thoughts like:

-Would anyone really even care if you died?
-They all hate you anyway
-You know you still love her, and you'll never get to tell her
-You're Pathetic. A loser. A nerd. Do the world a favour and disappear

Some of these thoughts, I almost sided with myself, giving in to my own depravity. Then at the same time, I look back on this in the morning, and think I'm doing it for attention. Just craving someone to look at me and care for me.

I think I'm depressed. I've self-harmed before, but I don't want to do it again because it make me feel weak. I've been taking Setraline every night, but I don't think it's helping, and people are starting to notice. People have been asking me if I have been feeling alright, and I always say that I'm fine, but I'm not, and I don't think I ever will be

I haven't told my parents, since I'm sure they'll flip out soon hearing it. They won't believe me. They'll tell me that I'm just overthinking everything. I probably am. This feels so pointless writing this. This post is only here so that I can let out my emotions for a few random strangers on the internet to see. It feels so stupid. I feel stupid. I hope I'll get better soon, but I don't see any signs of improvement. As I said- I am just some stupid teenager who might just be over reacting. BUT I'VE FELT THIS MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE. ITS NOT GETTING BETTER, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, SOMEONE HELP ME!"

lonely,We can't cheat our way out of loneliness.,"We can't cheat our way out of loneliness. - There is no one that will pick us up from the ground. Nobody will come out of existence and give some love to us.  Loneliness cause us to seek more love, in other words; it will make us spend our love points to attract some love points. We need to keep our love points. There is no need to be extra nice to people. No need to show your good will. There is no reason to seek for love. It should come if it wants to come. 
Accept the loneliness. Accept you have noone. Wear it. Don't give anyone any love for free. It is so painful. It hurts. But we can't just spread love for free to except it to return back even more. Like everthing else in life, the things you gain without pain, are going to hurt more in the long run... This is how shitty this life works. So feel the pain of loneliness. Pay the price. Wait patiently. Keep your energy to yourself. Even though it can be so painful, you don't need love to live your life. We need to love ourselves first. Be a bit selfish. And people will come into our life by themselves.

My humble opinion."

At this point I'm kinda just tired of trying, I've been getting that shuddering feeling of loneliness almost daily at this point. I try to entertain, I genuinely make people laugh but man that just never amounts to anything. I've even tried dating apps to search for just friends at this point but I don't get any matches. I try so hard to be in social situations but my stupid anxiety makes me freeze up and become distant, anti-anxiety meds don't work, drugs and alcohol don't work, I'm unable to be empathetic or allow myself to be involed in any conversation I'm in, feels like I'm cursed idk.

lonely,Feel like I’m destined to become a monk,"Feel like I’m destined to become a monk - Lately I’ve been toying with the thought of permanently accepting loneliness. Not as a sad thing, or in a depressing fashion, but purely neutral. I don’t know. Everything just seems like a cycle. Pointless cycle. Nothing, then something relative to it. Then nothing again. Then something relative to it. It’s all just vanity. There’s one quote in the Bible saying something like that. Why care about the hot chicks? It’s vanity. Why care about having friends? It’s vanity. Why care to stay busy or to occupy my weekends? It’s vanity. Why care to have a good response or to resolve insecurities or incompetencies in life? It’s all vanity. A couple of things I think that keep me attached are physical health and money I guess. I love the idea of being wealthy. Seems exciting and fun. Also being physically healthy just keeps me occupied and it feels right. Other than that, I don’t know if I care about anything. And maybe if I do get rich, perhaps I won’t even care about that anymore."

So ridiculous so I impulsively called bc I really wanted to talk to someone. I wasn’t feeling suicidal just lonely. I talked with the man and it was a bit awkward. He sounded tired and stressed out from the day. Already made me feel guilty and want to leave but I stayed. He asked me basic info ab my situation and relationships. He kept asking questions and I felt better bc he cared enough to keep asking. It was like he was waiting to get to a point to make. Then 27 minutes passed - nothing. He basically thanked me for my time and ended the conversation. It was like he was reading a script (which I’m sure he was). I barely talked ab anything. All he did was agree and act like he understood to make me feel better so I wouldn’t get triggered. But knowing that just triggers me. Nobody helps. Mental health is a joke to the world. Only people suffering get it. They can only help me but they are broken themselves. Over it. I’m just another paycheck to these so called “professionals”

lonely,Nothing seems to be going right,"Nothing seems to be going right - I am a person who doesn't mind loneliness that much. Being an introvert, sometimes being alone is comfortable and gives me time to focus on things I have to do or like. But every time I come back to college I feel very crushed. I see people having a good time together going out to party or eat every day and having a group of friends to hang out with. Its not that I don't have friends.....they are mutually exclusive a lot of the time and have their own groups to hang out with as well....and hence I get to interact with them one on one but I don't have a group for myself. So at the end of the day...I end up not going anywhere ever, never going out for movies, not going to eat out and not being able to enjoy and being holed up and studying and wasting time on the internet. 

On top of that I don't even have a boyfriend and I see couples all around me and at one point its starts bothering me. Everyone I know has someone in their life and it makes me feel lonelier than ever. 

On top of that if I ever mistakenly mention to someone that oh I spend time alone or anything people start saying ""oh that's so sad""....does being alone have to be a sad thing? I know I shouldn't care about what people say but when three or four people say the same thing it makes me start questioning myself.

I am trying to put my efforts into studying and all but it doesn't pay off either. I am in constant fear of bringing bad grades and fucking up my gpa. I dont have an internship till now when almost everyone around me has. I am trying my best here but I have no idea why nothing is working out. I literally try to suppress these thoughts because I dont want to fall in a pit of anxiety because I have exams coming up. I just feel so lost and lonely."

As an “older” and kinky single dad, I have absolutely no idea what my personal future holds - and I find it terrifying… and saddening. I refuse to burden my sons with my problems… they don’t “own” them.. and I don’t think that they could really comprehend them either.

lonely,Relying on Yourself,"Relying on Yourself - For those who deal with not having that one person they can talk to about anything (emotions, random thoughts, etc.) how do you deal with it? When I express my concerns about something to other people I feel like they don’t really get to the root of what I’m feeling or what I mean when I say something. I’ve built the mentality that I only have myself to rely on, that I’m the only one that can help myself. In the grand scheme of things it sucks being the only person I can turn to."

lonely,Trying,"Trying - Going through a tough phase in life. Unemployed, romance of 3 years ended. The weekends are especially tough because I gotta keep the ok face up in front of my family. Ive lost all my social circle because I did not balance my life well previously. There is someone I know that knows of my situation but I understand that he has a life too and I refuse to let myself cause any stress on him. It isnt fair for him. I am aware of where I am at and I am desperately trying not to spiral down. I am battling both emotional and mental battles at the same time. I have already inflicted self harm onto myself and I am hiding it from my family. Do not do it if youre thinking about it.

I made posts of trying to get in touch with people here but it did not get me any results. I've tried to communicate with some of you but being a new user on here is difficult. For those that did, and is reading this post, thank you. I am just trying to take the advice I gave you or wish someone could do the same for me. All of these is just a desperate  attempt in trying to stop myself from spiraling. 

I have tried therapy and it did not work before. I called my national hotline to attempt to let my outburst of emotions out somewhere, but they are so superficial in their way of talking it is revolting. Self harm was the only way I felt I could relieve the tension within me.

I desperately need something to distract myself and I know that. I have lost all my interests in what I was doing previously. I know how big of a mess I am in but I am trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Writing this post is difficult, I can feel my emotions erupting soon.

Ive read many of your posts and I know many of you out there have your own circumstances. To those struggling out there, some wars may never be won but the battles have to be fought.

I appreciate your time for reading this. I am a guy if it matters. If it doesn't and you need an online friend, dms are open, leave a comment."

lonely,"I Want to Better Myself Socially, but how do I get Over the Feelings of Unworthiness?","I Want to Better Myself Socially, but how do I get Over the Feelings of Unworthiness? - I know that I need to become the initiator and try to talk to some of my old friends again. Because I haven't spoken to any friends in months. 

The problem is I feel unworthy of talking to any of my old friends. The reason being because I still live with parents at 21, don't make very much money, not attending college, and never had a romantic relationship. 

Despite not worrying about college (working independently on various skills to eventually develop portfolio) or romantic relationships, I still I have felt shamed from family for not being in a relationship and not attending college. Many of my friends are in college, with relationships (some even married), making enough to live outside of their parent's, and all are about my age or even younger. 

I feel so inadequate to even talk to my friends. Many have accomplished some major milestones in their lives that I'm miles away from (if I ever even get there).

TL;DR How do you deal with feelings of complete unworthiness when wanting to reach out to old friends?"
lonely,19m on a quest for a love that doesn't exist.,"19m on a quest for a love that doesn't exist. - Everything is just so unbelievably horrible. I don't think I'm able to feel hope anymore, the only thing I look forward to is the end, even the slightest glimmer of hope always ends up being shot straight down killing another part of me. I don't have an appetite, I SH basically every night, I'm tired all the time despite me sleeping sometimes 16 hours a day, Is it selfish to want love so bad that my own body physically begins to shut itself down? I honestly don't care if it is, I don't care about much anymore, being alive is just filled with so much suffering and loneliness, what's the point to it all anymore. I wake up everyday just to suffer and go back to the hell that is dreaming where the nightmares are preferable to the dreams of a better life that I'll never have. I can't take this, I just want somebody, just one single person, a reason to keep going, but it's meaningless, even typing is meaningless. Nothing is going to change, and my buddy is going to randomly pop into my life and save me, I'm not going to find the love I desperately desire, and one of these days I have no doubt that when I depart this earth It will be by my lonesome. Forgotten and unwanted. I only wish that end comes soon, because this, this is hell."

Sometimes I just wonder what actually happened. What went wrong, why did people stop talking to me, what is it about me that makes people avoid me. Ever since I left school I’ve been pretty lonely, my ex cheated on me and I was messed about by another girl. I wake up to find no messages, no new adds, no nothing. Just a few streaks on Snapchat. In my head, I am a confident person. I used to struggle with social anxiety, that’s no longer a bother. But why is it hard to make friends with new people? I’m not like the rest of the crowd who do drugs and drink etc. Not into hookups either. Relationships are worrisome for me cause I wouldn’t want to be hurt again, neither do I think I could fully trust someone again. The ‘friends’ I do have only usually want me when they want something, or when they’re bored. Any other time, like now, I’m in my bedroom on my phone scrolling away for hours. Even though I don’t want to. I see others out with their friends and old friends having fun and doing things, and I just ask myself, why can’t I do that? It’s been like this ever since I left school and all throughout college. I kind of accepted that this is how it is but at times like this, all I’m wanting is for someone to message me"

lonely,touch starved and alone,"touch starved and alone - i’m a 19 year old guy. i had a girlfriend in 2019 but the relationship had to end due to her moving with her family to a country across the world. 

it kinda fucked me up and i have depression so i spent 2 years after that thinking i wouldn’t be able to get a girl to want to spend time with me and that i’m not worthy of love. I tried a couple online dating apps because i live in a small town and all the girls i know are in college farrrr away from here. 

my friends make fun of my because of my lack of relationships and sex life. and i can tell they kind of think i’m a loser because of it. i’ve been on online dating apps for a while and have nothing to show for it. 

i usually end up getting ghosted or unmatched. I was actually talking to this girl and i thought it was going well because our conversations flowed perfectly. we have the same hobbies, a lot in common, and same music taste. 

as time went by she would take longer to respond. she actually apologized to me because she’s been taking a while to answer. ( i get it we all have lives and jobs to attend to.) but after that she ended up ghosting me and it’s been 2 days. that did kinda hurt tho lol.

one of my friends gets lots of female attention and dates but he’s pretty toxic. he treats woman pretty badly. he told me “ you’ve got to break girls down so they want you more” ive told him that’s messed up because i’m totally against that way of thinking and acting bc it’s fucked up and girls have feelings like we do. but it’s been working for him.

do nice guys really finish last? would being a toxic asshole get me female attention or should i just settle for being a mid guy who’s not interesting. i try being nice and focus on getting to know girls rather than fucking them. 

what am i doing wrong? i’m probably the problem. i’m not that bad of a guy like i’m told i’m funny and i’m not that ugly. slightly below average- average looking.

i’m tired of feeling lonely and unworthy and i’m also tired of my friends making fun of me because of how lonely i am.

i just miss having a relationship where both care for each other and want to make each other happy.

i forget what love is like and all i want is someone who would want to talk to me and spend time with me.

He was so unkind it breaks my heart. He didn’t even look in my direction. I don’t know what I did wrong. I left after a few minutes as I didn’t seem welcome. I wish he had just told me not to join.

lonely,Emptiness,"Emptiness - Hi everyone, 
my story is a weird one (as am I) but kinda normal.
There was a girl, we saw each other daily for years, friendship developed, we talked a lot texted a lot, I grew to love her so much, she was the only bright thing I my days. But the love was one sided, it was devastating, but what could I do, give up the only light I have in my life? So we were friends, it was killing me and keeping me happy at the same time, I couldn't think of anything else or anyone else. In the morning and during the day I would be so happy and (other words describing ""happy"" I can't think of) and in the afternoon and evening I would cry like an idiot because I knew she was my one. 
This went on for years, but hey emotionally net positive for me, so I was ""happy"".

One day I fucked up, and I fucked up big time.
I tried to repair it but the damage was severe. 

And she was gone. Cut off all possible way of contact. And I was alone. So alone in the darkness, floating trying to paddle through stuff.
I can't talk to girls, I can't go to public really, when I see a pair of people talking, I start to fall apart. When I see someone kissing or holding hands, I feel so alone. Just alone and empty. 

I would give anything to just talk to her one more time. Just talk, about anything, weather, I don't care just talk. I looked around for help but I don't trust anyone and professionals are way too expensive to be viable. So I'm just sitting in the darkness alone and empty, without any emotion on the outside and all the bad emotions on the inside. I haven't been happy one single day since.

It will be 7 years tomorrow. And all I can hope is.. maybe tomorrow?"

And it just feels like no matter what I say they just keep saying how suicidal and stuff they are so I’ll give them attention, and recently they said that they don’t really have feelings for me anymore. I’m scared I’m overthinking this and if they really are suicidal I don’t want to ghost them and end up being the reason they killed their self. But I’m having mixed emotions right now and can’t help like I got led on just for attention, I was and still am at a really low point emotionally and can’t help but feel I got taken advantage of"
lonely,I'm professionally successful and my personal life is an unmitigated hellscape.,"I'm professionally successful and my personal life is an unmitigated hellscape. - 
Not a throw away because fk it, it's reality.
Last year I ended a 10 year relationship due to escalating domestic violence. Subsequently, I relocated to my home state. I don't have any close family or biological children, only distant aunts and uncles that I don't have established relationships with. I moved home because I am familiar with it, found good therapy and I believed it would give me a sense the safety I had been in desperate need of. 
 A childhood friend offered to share his home with me and I gratefully accepted. I immediately found a wonderful job that is professionally satisfying and gives me a modicum of human interaction. Unfortunately my new roommate is a sever alcoholic and when I'm not working I'm either alone or tending to the household needs. 
 I've spent the majority of my life alone. I was orphaned in my preteens and cared for by a neglectful grandparent until I was 17. After college I lived alone and worked obsessively. In my later 20's I had friends, parties, camped, hiked and enjoyed the company I kept on a regular basis. At 30 I met the previously mentioned abusive SO. Over time that relationship soured and inline with run of the mill abuse I became more and more isolated. I reached my limit last year when he attempted to break my arm. After escaping that state, I find myself more alone than ever.
 My roommate stays blacked out during the day (I completely avoid him when he is drunk) and awake at night while I am sleeping. He's a wonderful person when he's not loaded but it's very, very rare.
 At 44, I have no idea how to change the situation. Bars are terrible (I honestly detest drinking after my ex), online dating is hellish and gross, most of the people I know are busy with spouses, children and work. I'm relatively attractive, loving, empathetic and kind. I am a bit ""quirky"" for my environment- tattoos, facial piercing, non-Christian (it's the south).
 I've began to dread my days off. I know I'll be alone, sometimes never speaking to anyone. I compensate by working much more than I should. 
 I know its corny but I literally just want someone to play with. I feel the bitterness creeping in and I don't want it. 

TLDR- I'm lonely and it sucks."

lonely,"No matter how hard I try socially, I can't seem to make even the tiniest dent...","No matter how hard I try socially, I can't seem to make even the tiniest dent... - Friendships, dating, work relationships, it's all been absolutely hopeless for me and they've all had knock-on effects to each other. I have struggled immensely in making, but most importantly keeping friends my whole life. Eventually at some point I figured that it's pretty much hopeless and I should just focus on finding a partner/girlfriend which would fulfil my social needs while also being potentially easier to find since it's just the one person I'd be looking for. 

Unfortunately the dating game has been hopeless for me. While at uni I didn't make any friends (as per usual) and so I pretty much never went out and found myself in situations to meet new people.  That left me to try my luck on dating apps which as most guys know is wholly useless and self-esteem destroying. I changed up my profile so many times, tried different apps, swiping tactics, you name it but I never got a single match along with maybe 6 or 7 likes total (over 4 years). I am not a bad-looking guy and I have (from an objective) perspective, a lot of things going for me but for whatever reason I have not had any luck. 

I think many romantic relationships are formed and found through friendship groups which I just don't have. It's like, I just need SOMETHING to start with. A base level energy to work forward and upward from, but when you're starting from zero or even below zero which is what it feels like for me, it's almost impossible to make any progress. 

As a result of all this, my overall mood and demeanour has obviously taken a massive hit and it's continuing to get worse. As a result, I think this comes across to colleagues at work who then avoid me or make fun of me or take advantage of me. My last boss downright abused me for absolutely no reason if I'm perfectly honest. Well.the only reason I can put it down to is the fact that I was fairly quiet, soft-spoken, timid and so he figured he could treat me like a doormat. The other reason is probably and most likely racism. I've dealt with that kind of behaviour/person before and It's always been the same treatment. 

Bottomline is I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't. It's an endless cycle of misery, confusion, self-doubt, anxiety, hopelessness, emptiness, anger, etc. 

I've written a couple posts like this already to which I've got almost zero response whereas there are posts which the OP simply states 'I'm very lonely and I feel horrible' and it gets so many comments and offers from people to talk. I wish even someone on here would care enough to offer their listening ear and maybe even some advice! I really hope so, but I won't be surprised if this post goes away completely ignored into the history of this subreddit. 

Thank you if you read all of that"

lonely,birthday blues,"birthday blues - TW: mention of suicidal ideation at the end 

It was my birthday yesterday, I turned 23 and spent the whole day alone. I cried so much my eyes swelled shut. This is the 5th consecutive birthday that I’ve spent by myself. 

My birthday has always sucked but this year was especially hard. I moved a few months ago to a whole new country where I have no friends (not that i had any real ones back home either) and a few family members that i’m not close to. 

The person I thought was my best/only friend had promised me for months that she’d come visit me for my birthday but she cancelled the trip last minute so she could spend the money&amp;time on her boyfriend instead then lied and blamed me for it. That really hurt because I was counting on her to actually care and not let me down. We’ve spoken before about why I hate my bday and I thought she was different. I let her get my hopes up, not that I wanted or expected a big extravagant birthday, but at least a brief chance at companionship and to be celebrated. 

Maybe I can’t blame her because pretty much everyone else forgot it was birthday too, including all my friends back home and my family I live literally next door to now.

This isn’t the first and probably not the last time I’ve been forgotten, my whole life has been like this. I looked through my old diaries yesterday and every bday entry since I was a child has been me wondering why i’m so unlovable. What makes some people worthy of recognition and celebration while I struggle through every year invisible. Im not important or valued by anyone in my life. I’m kept just close enough to be useful when needed but when it comes to my own needs and wants, everyone conveniently assumes I have some other closer group of people elsewhere that will actually care.

I feel so stupid thinking back to how excited I was just a few weeks ago. I even though that my bday falling on friday meant I might have a whole weekend of celebrations. How amazing it must be to have people willing to celebrate u for a whole weekend. Im so jealous of those girls who every year will have a bday party and a dinner, get their makeup done and dress up in special outfits, have people bring them balloons and a cake with candles to blow out. I can’t remember the last time I had a birthday wish. 

I feel like i’m kind of rambling so sorry about that. My mind has just been spiralling these past few days thinking about it all. My birthday feels like my yearly reminder of how unimportant, disposable and unloved I am. A confirmation that i’m truly alone. It reignites thoughts of unaliving myself because it’s so hard to argue i’d be missed by anyone when they clearly have no interest in my life. I’m supposed to move back to my old country soon but honestly I don’t see the point going back. I just want to escape forever."
lonely,Should I really ask her out?,"Should I really ask her out? - I know I like her, she's all I've been fucking thinking about for days I'm honestly fixated on her to an unhealthy degree, all I want to do is sleep so I might dream again about her liking me. I'm not 100% sure she'd think I was a disgusting loser for not being able to drive now that I know how to use Uber, I could at least meet her places without having to ask her to pick me up every time.

But I'm still a worthless piece of shit even with Uber. I'm depressed and have now pretty bad anxiety, especially social, so I'm barely functional as a human. I don't see what I could ever add to her life. My therapist says I see relationships as transactional and implies that's the wrong way to look at it, but what other way is there? Either I'm useful to her, or I'm not, and she either values me or she doesn't depending on the answer.

But I mean, I guess I could still try. But I only ever see her at school. I've already missed the times when she came up to me asking for help on chem stuff, she's not gonna do that again, so I'd have to make my own opportunity. But wtf would I even do? Accost her right as class ends? In plain view of everyone, so they can all watch me trip over my tongue and get rejected and laughed at, or called creepy? That sounds like an unbearable experience, I don't think I'd come out of my room for months.

And she would just call me creepy, she wouldn't be interested in me. How could she be? She's the most beautiful girl in the school. The only reason I'm even typing this shit out instead of dismissing the very idea as abject lunacy is because that stupid dream infected my mind with hope, and got my head in the clouds. But I know if  I tried to actually do anything, my wings would melt and I'd come crashing back to reality. I don't know if I'd survive that, if I'm being completely honest.

Oof, wtf triggered my pretentious side to come out? Eww

Yeah, idk. The thought's great and all, and I'd be really and truly happy with her. God, the idea of getting to do homework with her every week in fall is so tantalizing. But that's all it is; tantalizing. Perfect and beautiful, but forever out of reach. She probably already has a boyfriend because who tf has ever seen her and not felt what I'm feeling? Surely somebody better than me has already been here, and succeeded. But even if she was single, she's better off without me. I'm just a detriment, me wanting her to like me is pure selfishness. As much as it hurts, it's better that I just stay here hurting.

Doesn't make it feel any better, though."
lonely,I ruin every single relationship,I ruin every single relationship - I have horrible instincts when it comes to people. I think I'm just not meant to be with anyone. I had a decent relationship with someone but they didn't care. Began talking to someone else turns out they just sold me lies too from the beginning and I was fooled into thinking they were good. They weren't. I feel alone I feel like a pos I feel pathetic. I have no one I hate my current situation and I just wish sometimes I fucking had someone to hold me and tell me I was going to be okay and that I mattered not to get anything out of me. My fam sabotages my relationships or anything good that starts happening in my life. I'm sad I'm alone I want love but I'm not good enough for it.

lonely,23 female here with 0 friends and never really had friends ever.,"23 female here with 0 friends and never really had friends ever. - So throughout my school years since I can remember I never really had friends I was always that person that was just kinda there and cool with everyone, but I never had friends to hangout with outside of school or to even talk to. It’s always been hard for to make friends due to shyness, awkwardness, and anxiety plus I always felt different from everyone which made it even harder to make friends and get close to people, but even though I do want to have a close bond with others I feel like a lot of people don’t want to build a friendship with me or even get a chance to get to know me more so that we can become friends or even close friends they just want to chat with me but don’t want anything more than just chatting and obviously I’m talking about online because I don’t have the guts to go out and meet people anyway and there aren’t many places where I am that I can go to to make friends.. Another thing I want to mention is I’m tired of people saying they don’t have friends at all but they really do even if it’s only one or two or even three it doesn’t matter at the end of the day they still have friends. I don’t know maybe they feel like they don’t have any because they don’t feel close to them or feel excluded from them, but if that’s the case talk to them and tell them how you feel.."

The cliches like ""it'll get better"" ""work on yourself"" ""find a hobby"" or ""try therapy"" it's all just lies. Nothing gets better, nothing helps. Maybe it's selfish of me to have my entire happiness depend on a person who doesn't even exist. I want to be loved, to have someone TO love. But I know I won't. I just can't take it anymore, and I don't know how much longer I can keep fighting, keep living, keep suffering, for nothing."

lonely,I believe I’ll die alone,"I believe I’ll die alone - At first, I just had a little fantasy to buy a cabin in the woods during my final days so I could pass away there peacefully with the animals and not worry anyone but each day that passes feels like that will become a reality; with no choice but to pass away alone. And honestly be alone. None of my friends ever want to talk to me. No one wants to see me. I suffer from social anxiety and an inferiority complex. My parents hate me so much. I don’t have any pets. And I’m just ignored by everyone. I think the saddest part about this all is that I’m a very open and friendly person. I want nothing more than to help others and give love and happiness to everyone but it seems everyone can’t stand me. I do wonder daily, what’s wrong with me… why was I made to be wrong?"
lonely,Seriously depressed,"Seriously depressed - Teenage lesbian in shitty seaside town with barely any other lesbians. Homeschooled now because I felt like shit everyday at school and the bullying. I’ve never had a girl or a first kiss or even held hands. I have a crush on 3 girls but my first crush was for 2 years and I think I loved her even though she never spoke to me. The other 2 girls just spoke to me a couple times and I got too attached.

This loneliness is so depressing. I started cutting myself again a couple weeks ago to distract myself from the misery. Wishing I could be born straight or as a guy so I wouldn’t feel like a perverted freak. I made a mistake of watching some tiktoks talking shit about lesbians and saying they’re disgusting and creepy and that made it worse. 

Yeah I’m just going through it right now."

lonely,"What does ""close friend"" mean to you in your definition?","What does ""close friend"" mean to you in your definition? - As I've gotten older, a lot of my friends are now married and are family planning while I have remained single. 

I still consider them friends, but I have been grappling with the fact that I don't feel close to them, which in turn has made me feel more lonely in this stage of life. They care about me, and I of course care about them, but I don't really have that, ""I can run to you and tell you whats going on with me right now in this second"" relationship, which I consider to a qualifier of a close friend.

But now, after having a conversation with my therapist about what emotional boundaries are, I wonder if that qualifier isn't a good one because people need emotional boundaries. So I'm curious how other people define what a close friend is."
lonely,Tired of being lonely,"Tired of being lonely - 22 m. Never had a girlfriend or kiss, I felt like I tried but I know you can *always do more: you can always try harder, join more groups, etc.* Tried getting on dating apps but didn't have any friends for the pictures and was tired of it just being me, me, me and me. I've tried putting myself out there, volunteering, chatting up strangers, but each time maybe we had a good talk, but there was never any lasting interest that brought you back. It was a chore, ""Ok I gotta try to meet people now,"" I wasn't having fun with them, but I didn't really do anything fun that I enjoyed. This was because I try to be productive most days because otherwise I'd feel like since I'm not having fun with others, I might as well work. And when I take time to watch a show or something, I start to feel empty and feel like I have to be productive again. so it was my way to feel hopeful. 

I Joined the gym, try to talk to people but then they look away and I stop, because *I don't trust that they will respect me*. Here I am putting effort into normal people, when I've put effort into people over and over again and no one stayed. I always keep my hope up but sometimes *I forget* that I've tried making friends since I started college, now graduated. Therapists weren't able to help me apart from helping me correct some of my negative thinking patterns. Eventually one did say that some people don't have friends because they're too focused on things and productive and smart trying to do things in life. And the disappointing thing was the more I tried to not be that guy, the more I felt that was the path for me. I never wanted to be different.

At the very least, I'm still occasionally trying to meet people, still trying to find out what I like and what I want in a friend, but the same patterns keep repeating. Using dating apps, if I ask a question, they answer but don't ask back, now I don't even want to try a second time because I can tell they don't care. So I used to try again but then you feel like you've overextended and then it's fuck people man, the only thing I have is the consistent work I put into myself. I don't get the same pleasure as grabbing a meal or shooting the breeze as others do, because you don't act like them, so they stop talking to you and you realize you're not like them and then you work harder and it increases the distance."
lonely,Feeling very alone.,"Feeling very alone. - Thought I had a good group of friends, turns out I do not.

I have not messaged these friends for over a week and nobody has messaged me. (I would always be the first to message). That is it. I literally have no one. Only my girlfriend, who I love dearly but she has her own life and social life.

I set out a post. I stated what I liked. Someone messaged me. She gave me her snapchat and even though we've only been talking for 4 days, we talk like we've known each other for years.

Someday you find that person, even if you didn't meet in real life, you kinda feel it's that person you were looking your entire life for. 

Everything goes good, you connect on all levels, there isn't a thing you don't talk, laugh or do with eachother. 
She does everything for you and otherway around. Helping eachother with all life problems.

She learns your language in a year, so she can move to you when she is done with school. you are divorcing and searching a appartement near her so you can meet on regular base. 

And then she meets someone near her, and cause she is a better version off herself then she was before you, she leaves you, making promises to never abandon you, support you and will come back. 

And then she completely blockes, delete you out off her life and tells you, you did never good for me and he is sweet and I fallen for him. Goodbye, have a good life

There are probably 50 people here and I am sitting in the corner watching the kids play and posting on Reddit. 

I've already made the rounds and introduced myself and small talked and such, but everyone here is outside of my normal social circle so they all either already know each other, are family, or are paired up with a significant other and I am not extroverted enough to just force myself into a group of people already having a conversation lol. My daughter is old enough now that she doesn't need or want me up in her shit anymore. 

So here I am, sitting on the ground watching everyone socialize and wishing I had someone with me to just share this experience with, to introduce to everyone, to help me eat the pizza and cake they handed me, and to make it look like I'm not an antisocial hermit. 

It's been a long time since I've felt so alone. There's a lot of pretty women here my age and they are all paired up. It makes me wonder what is wrong with me and why I can't have someone too."

lonely,Wasting my thirties,"Wasting my thirties - When I was 30 I broke up with my girlfriend. We decided after 7 years that we developed in different ways and we should go different ways from now. I was just 30 and everyone older told me 30 to 40 are the best years in life. So I was confident that the breakup is a new beginning. I tried online dating and also I meet girls while being out with some friends or coworkers. With one girl I got really close, in only a short  time, but all of a sudden she wasn't sure about it anymore and ended it.  Everyone else I meet was either definitely not wife material (from crazy too wanted by the police) or they just weren't interested in me at all. (Or just wanted to have some free drinks.) Whatever, since covid and some other radical shit that happened I needed to through out some toxic people in my life. So my bubble got pretty lonely and its even harder to go out. I got more and more isolated and work got my only  social place. Which sucks! Now I dont even know how to socialize anymore and I dont even need to try to look at a woman. Cause they can sense how needy I'm. But that's a vicious circle. I can't cut my mind from almost 7 years without any intimacy. So I'm trapped with my loneliness and all those emotions I cant share, act out or even feel anymore. It only gets darker and colder inside my head. Cause the only things I remember are those times I got cheated on, rejected, betrayed or heartbroken in some way. So my turtle shell only gets stronger and my intention coming out of it are getting very rare. I´´  m already an misanthropic humanist. People are great, but only in theory. (or fantasy?) I only feel like they would betray me anyways, so why trying it? So I'm stuck in another vicious circle.

lonely,I don't know what I'm trying to say,"I don't know what I'm trying to say - So been with my partner for 5 years, we've a child together and she goes to meetings and has her friends from when she was in university, 

I never had that life style as i chose to leave school early due to be bullied alot which led me to depression and even attempted suicide which my mum got through to me and helped me get my head on straight, then through some training program to help get some sort of qualifications to help get a job, i actually managed to do that, now because of how bullied i got i lost all confidence in myself and well fast forward to now aged 36! I still have no confidence in myself and my partner she does pretty much all that talking for me as she knows i struggle, 

I've never had a friend besides my partner which I've known like 20 plus years but the sad part is she was talking about some old guy stalking her and we said about me acting as if i gotten with her and we ended up being a couple so even then i didn't have the confidence to ask her out,

If you ever been to university or college or seen those videos of ppl that go to university or college and see how there is always groups of ppl who are close friends &amp; always stick together, i wish i had that,
Or just a group of friends to talk to or at night play games online with or occasionally meet up during free time or bump into while out or working, 

I know its sad a 36 dude wishing he had some friends to cheer him up or meet up for a laugh, or maybe i never fully gotten passed my depression and its secretly been in the back if my broken mind this whole time"

Hopefully whoever reads this post maybe some of you can help me I would surely appreciate it. Hope everyone has a lovely day."
lonely,Why I had to fall in love with this girl that doesnt reciprocate?,"Why I had to fall in love with this girl that doesnt reciprocate? - Dont know if this is the right place but I just want to vent about this, because I feel lonely. 

So I am Male 21 Years old. I had social anxiety problems major part of my life and it was not only like some months ago due to college that I actually enter to a big group of friends and my social circle expand.

So in this group there is this girl. I just felt in love so hard with her. Going on parties is not fun anymore. When I get in touch or dance with her I just die inside because I am not able to have her. I die even more when I remember all the times I make her laugh and she shows that beautiful smile that makes me melt, or when one night I talked with her in her room with a chill atmosphere about deep things about ourselves, or when I make eye contact on her green eyes, or when one night we were hugging because bad stuff happened during going out at night and she was so nervous and crying so I had to calm and protect her. 

I try to evade myself every day focusing on studying or my favourite hobbies like lifting weights at the gym but I just cant stop thinking about her. Every day I am more and more tired of this. I know she knows the feelings I have for her, as the rest of the group, but it is clear that she doesnt reciprocate.

I always tell everyone I am ok but it is not true. I cry hard every night when I am finally alone. 

And that is how I feel, lonely. I dont know what is wrong with me for not being able to attract her. I am a tall and strong guy, I consider myself good looking physically. I also have sense of humour and friends laugh a lot with me, I am a funny guy. In the other hand if things are serious I can talk deeply about that too. 

And I always hear my friends with their relationships and how easy they get them and then is it me, suffering because I cant be with her and I just feel lonely. 

That's it my friends. I just wanted to share this, I know there are people in worst situations than mine, I want to send a hug to everyone who is struggling. You are not alone in this"

Probably all of these years of social anxiety are holding me back for any reason or something but who knows. All I know is I love her so bad but I cant have her and I feel alone when friends talk about relationships and how easy they get them"

I always just wanted and dreamed that one day I will manage to get somebody that will care about me as much as I care about them, but with each day it feels more impossible to reach that and kinda do not see any point in life if I do not have somebody to share it with and it is just endless suffering for me.

lonely,adulthood feels lonely,"adulthood feels lonely - I’m a 24 year old female but inside I feel 6, 13 and 16—the ages I was when something notably traumatic happened yet I don’t remember what but I know that most of them is because of my birth giver. 

She used to be my favorite person in the world until I realized how abusive she was both physically and mentally.

Now I’ve moved out and am in college. I’m stressed out because of assignments and I’m missing home but I don’t miss having to lock my door for some reason I don’t remember. I miss the comfort of a mother but I don’t miss having to be surprised when comfort turns to fear that I’d be punished either by physical or emotional means if I don’t do the things she wants me to. I miss the warmth of a father but I don’t miss the man that watched me as her wife physically and mentally abused me all because he “can’t control her”. All the whilst her abuse made me submit to her control.

These are the only things that drove me to leave and stopped me from going back. But goddamn don’t I feel lonely. I feel empt like all my love and life has been sucked out of me—like I have nothing left to offer to the world and the new people I will meet. 

And what sucks is that I don’t see the end to this little black hole I’m tumbling into."

It seems like they have all found their people and I'm sitting here wondering why I haven't found mine. I have some difficult family stuff going on right now, and I just feel pretty lonely right now. 

I reached out to an acquaintance I say hi to in the elevator sometimes and said that I liked their vibes and I'm looking for friends and was wondering if they wanted to be friends, but they left me on opened and posted something on their story about how they're ""straight passing"" because they don't wear pride pins or whatever. Maybe they thought I was hitting on them? I don't know. I feel like, when someone reaches out to you asking if you want to be friends you at least respond? Is that on me? 

I feel super insecure right now. It's easy to not care what others think when you have a solid base of people who support you for you, but I don't really feel I have that solid base at college right now, so I just feel super anxious and I don't know what to do.

lonely,What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think?,"What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think? - It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviors. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

**Genuine Desire + Effective Strategy + Consistent Persistence = Authentic Results**"

I’m a black dude, I’m 27 and will be 28 in a few more weeks. Currently trying to get certificates so I can get a job troubleshooting somewhere — but other than that I’ve had nothing but dead end job after dead end job. My mother when she and my step father left each other ( this occurred on my 17th birthday - after years of abusing me and my siblings but mostly me almost specifically me actually — he’d decided that he was tired of looking at me. And that I needed to go because I was the reason why him and my mother couldn’t work or so he says. He has been there since I was 5. And has hated me since day 1. He never treated my brother like that but that’s because my brother's father was still in his life and would get him regularly , he had protection from him. Once I graduated that year we left. But my mother found out he was cheating - or so she told me. So that’s why things really ended but he used me as the excuse. Something that occurred for years and years prior. )

My mother, not liking the ultimatum, decided we’d leave together. Me, her, my little brother , and the child her and my step father had just made 3 years prior. Of course he'll dump her out with a baby. Despite being there for his original two kids who grew up with us , and he treated as if they could do no wrong. 

My mother grew resentful of me once we moved away however , blaming me for the fall of her relationship despite reassuring  me prior that it wasn’t cause of me — all I wanted was to go to college but she forced me to get a real job and make money to help out. I did this until I was fed up with it and we got into another heated fight that year about school before she ended up kicking me out as well. 

And that’s when everything goes to shit. I get a decent job but I end up letting years go by. Love is lost over and over. I become a toxic person but mostly because it’s how I’ve had to survive up until that point. I look back on all the things I’ve done and I realize that a lot of my hardships are because of me, and only me. And now as I get older and I am currently without a job again after holding one finally for 2 years after moving to Florida from South Carolina where I lived my whole life -  currently living with my girlfriends partners and trying to get by. They say they’ll let me finish my classes but everyone has said they’d help me before and they turned their backs on me so I don’t believe them. I feel like I’ll let them down with the opportunity they’ve given me. And that the easiest thing to do in all of this. 

Is to just die. Why go through this, put someone through dealing with a no good piece of shit who can’t hold work and has no skills to get proper work. I’m nothing and shouldn’t have been born , I can tell , nothing I do goes right. I suffer from depression and anxiety on the severe scale. But I don’t take medication. I also have severe ADD and it makes it hard to stay focused. I feel as though sometimes with all the shit that’s wrong with me that ending it would be easier on everyone. 

Off topic but my little brother ended up getting into a horrible accident 2 years ago that left him a cripple - kid was huge to you know. Big and strong , and was only 21. Now his mind is broken due to the accident and all I could do was feel sorry that I wasn’t there enough before the accident and how I’m a shitty brother - I’d just seen him the night before after not seeing him in months prior, and then bam. Life changing accident. My luck must’ve attached  on to him. My mother takes care of him with families help. I once stayed there to help, was the first one to at that. But me and my mother didn’t see eye to eye and she ended up telling me to leave. It’s deeper than that but that’s as far as I’ll go. 

Now In Florida I’m desperately putting the pieces of my self together and have come to the conclusion that for a waste of space like me that maybe just dying would be easier on everyone who has to deal with me. I’m tired of being so negative in my head , hating myself for loves lost. And how I’m a colossal failure as a man and a son. I hate myself. I’m a fat waste of space. And I honestly just wanna die. 

I only typed this here because I felt like it would make me feel better if I got it out. But honestly it didn’t."

I can't help but feel like the victim sometimes, it hurts to think about when I was younger because I had to watch so many people leave that was just out of my control, it's different now because I'm the one always leaving. I get upset and I talk about how I don't have any friends but it's my own fault, I still hang onto those past friendships and relationships even though I know they're over. I don't think I could handle the whole friendship thing again it feels like a chore to talk to people and it makes me feel exhausted, I don't think I'll ever have any close friendship or relationship again and I really think this is it for me."

lonely,Can't Accept the loneliness [19F],"Can't Accept the loneliness [19F] - I accept that ""it's how it is"" for a while and it feels idk normal (or just not sad) for like 4/5 weeks but then it hits back. It hits me all over again that iam all Alone. That noone cares. That no friend of mine has ever cared about our friendship the way I did. That I was never a first choice. That I was never a person they'd call to share good news , to celebrate etc. That I was always just a part of the group , that one friend you occasionally meet when you are going on a trip or on thier birthday party or something. And then the heaviness in my chest returns and just resides there , twisting and turning itself painfully. 

I heard my friend talk to her bff on the phone once and the way they talk...you can just tell they care about each other UK...I've never had that and it's hard to accept that I never will.

It's even more isolating to think that iam probably the only 19F who doesn't have a single genuine friendship (just the hi bye , lunchbox friends). Like God!!! Is this too much to ask"

lonely,It hurts... it just hurts...,"It hurts... it just hurts... - It's official, my mind is broken. Every day now I have all these negative memories flood through my mind, all of these unanswered questions, the disbelief and heartbreak. 

I'm now in a place where I'm so uncomfortable in my skin, nothing can shake me out of my trance long enough to be happy. Whenever I try to pursue a hobby, I can't stop remembering the people who left. I question that if I was more interesting, maybe they wouldn't have left. So the hobbies I have are wrong and bland... 

Then it can be simple stuff like feeling good about myself, but if I was such a brilliant and comforting person like I used to describe myself as, why would people discard me like nothing and leave me with bruises? I must've been so boring, pitiful and wasteful...

Then stuff like making jokes. You think you're funny? Well, nobody can remember that personality trait of yours. They all left. You're disposable. 

And it's been tormenting me daily, because this is all that I went through, while anhedonic for 2 years. During the time I was anhedonic, I've been through a lot of hurt. 

I've had people enter my family home, sit down with us at dinner (special times) and say with a heartfelt smile that ""I've never felt so welcome at someone's place before!"" only to eventually declare that we're awful pieces of garbage and leave. Only to try robbing money from us, and leave. 

We had someone else come in, try to make out that she was going to be a long lasting family friend, only to become hateful towards us in the end. 

I had a therapist who was trying to help me regain my confidence, I never went outside much. She asked if I had any friends living in this town and I had one. We didn't speak for a year, but I remember how we used to sit together during college break, went for long night walks, hung out at the park for a laugh, he helped me walk to my first job because we got lost, I visited his place and would watch stupid videos. We were STILL in college! 

So I was brave and reached out, when we began talking it was like nothing changed. I wrongfully thought maybe there was a chance. So I invited him out for a drink (just a coke) and he could've said no, he had every right to say no, but he agreed. 

During out meet up the one thing he comes out with is how ""weird"" it is. He looks at me as if I've done the most batshit insane thing. ""It's weird how you invited me out"". 

He then goes on to talk about how he was a bad person and that there was a girl called Chloe, that he briefly dated but kept ignoring her until midnight and would avoid seeing her etc. It sounded just like how he treated me... I didn't know if he forgot... or if there was some girl called Chloe who he did the same to... 

When we left, I texted him on Facebook and thanked him for meeting up, but I was also curious. Why did it take until now to see each other? His response, ""fuck off, I already met up with you isn't that enough?!"" 

Then I had another friend, well... I hadn't seen her for years but she was one of my best friends in school. I had so many awesome childhood memories. Just imagine how shocked I was when she added me on Facebook and told me she wanted to reconnect. She remembered that I loved to draw so asked whether I'd like to hang out at hers and maybe help decorate her room too. 

She was always so nice to me back then so I didn't expect anything bad. Well, when I tried asking if she wanted to hang out again sometime, she told me ""no offense but our friendship sail years ago. No offense, but I don't like you anymore!"" 

When I asked if she used me to paint her room, she just said something along the lines of ""LOL, that's right"". 

...crushed. 

Another person I got in touch with, I had a crush on. He discovered this and weirdly we became FWBs. We never saw one another in person though. He kept on telling me that he could see us being together someday, etc. He also kept mentioning how he was loyal, genuine and would never hurt anyone. 

Well, one day we arrange to hang out and I'm looking forward to it. The day passes and he tells me that I can't come over, because he has to take an ID photo... even though we were planning to visit town together. Afterwards he then bluntly tells me that I can't ring him anymore, even though before he said I was welcome to anytime. 

Eventually he does this thing where he on and off puts me on ignore, while I'm wondering what I did wrong. After this we chat over the phone, I'm in tears and he tells me to stop being dramatic...

He tried contacting me this year, asking if we could ""talk please x""
I never answered. 

Then there was another friend who a speech and language therapist recommended, she was in this group I joined so it was a good idea. I really related so well to her, she was the kind of person to be so down to Earth about everything, she was a fan of being open and communicating properly with friends. In fact, she had tons of friends, who got on with her because of her openness. 

Well, at the time I was going through severe anhedonia. She knew this and told me I was free to vent whenever, because she'll listen. Nobody should have to see a therapist just to talk, she said. 

I did... and eventually she told me that I was seeking so much validation, it was toxic in her eyes. So I stopped bringing anything up. Afterwards I remember a conversation where she told me that I can't just judge someone for what they've done wrong (correct!) because everyone has good in them (okay!) 

Yes, even my neighbour that threatened to kill my dogs when I was a child, even the neighbour who bashed my fence in while violently yelling at us, even the neighbour that attempted to crash my dad's car by cutting the belt (the belt to control the car). Even the neighbour who spread rumours about us. 

Because they're human too, she said. And if I got to know them, they might be different. 

Then I had another friend,.who didn't really do anything serious but it still kind of hurt, as I wish she would've just been honest. I asked if I could hang out with her, she said yes. So before the day I get there she tells me that she doesn't want to hang out, because it might rain. It doesn't rain. Then when I ask why she changed her mind. She said, ""wow the weather was sure bad, huh?"" 

Then the biggest one of all. In 2016, I had finally overcome my depression. It was a huge step for me to be able to go out into public, with a massive smile on my face and not be afraid. I was able to catch buses anywhere, whereas before I was frightened. I started cutting out caffiene, took care of my body more than I've ever done (dental hygiene, vitamins, eating, etc). I was on top of the world! 

Well, a friend at the time, was happy for me. He was someone I met in school, he knew all about the dark thoughts as he would sit down with me during break and hear me out, things we're so rough with my neighbours back then and the bullying. But he wanted to be there, and I appreciated it a lot. 

One day, he mentions to me about dating and how great it is. At the time I wasn't interested and only wanted to focus on me. In the end, I was brainwashed into getting together with him. I fell for him in the past, so I didn't turn him down. Well, whenever I wanted to visit his place, he'd often tell me that his mum didn't like strangers visiting. 

Which at the time was a massive lie, as my dad collected him from his house once so me and him could go to a theme park. His mum said hello to me and was kind. 

But I didn't see this and one day he lets me over, his mum isn't there, he uses me for favours. I'm used, discarded, and he turns our mutual friends against me. When he broke up with me, he was shocked when I didn't want to remain friends... he had no expression when I cried and hid his laptop screen from his mum when she entered the room... 

Then another friend! This guy I met online and I was still dealing with anhedonia (2020). He read some of my posts on Reddit and felt bad for me, and asked if I needed someone to chat with. When we began chatting, it became an every day thing. We would share memes, talk about life, etc. One day he decides to stop and ignore me. I asked why, he didn't respond. So I said, ""I thought we were friends?"" He told me, ""why label it"". So cold... 

Then another friend, this one was an LGBT rep at the college. She was known as very friendly and supportive, in fact the student counselor thought it would be great if I got to know her. Well I did, and one day she invites me to an LGBT bowling night she sets up. For each ticket we got a burger, fries and drink. 

At the time, we used to talk a lot on Messenger. Whenever she reached a low, I'd support her and lift her spirits. We spoke about meeting up in person. She was awesome! 

So the last thing I expected was for everyone to finish the burger and fries without saving me a plate... the last thing I expected was for her to ignore me the whole time, as I'm sat in the corner not knowing anyone (and having situational mutism didn't help, as I couldn't physically speak, so it was hard to introduce myself to anyone even when I desperately wanted to. My voice box refused to work!) 

I didn't expect her not to notice when I left early. 

And when I brought up how I felt during that night, I didn't expect her to tell me that she did her best so it wasn't HER fault that I missed out. 

Our friendship ceased. LGBT rep... 

So many things at once, and I just don't know why... I wish these people could've not bothered. I wish they could've kept me at a distance, instead of saying we're friends. I wish we never met. 

I really just want to die. Imagine questioning your entire personality and being so distraught and ashamed about it."

Well, a girl I had a crush on is now dating someone. That caused me quite a bit of emotional pain. I guess I just got overwhelmed by envy. Realistically, we could've never been partners anyways.

Honestly, I don't like to see happy couples. Every time I do, I'm reminded of what I don't and might not ever have in my life. Romance triggers me. I wish I was happy. Or better yet, content. Seeing them do PDA when I've literally felt invisible to the opposite gender my entire life, I almost have to invert my eyes elsewhere, lol. It's as if even a drop of romance in any media causes me to become detached from the couple in question. I immediately feel alienated and don't want to look at them. But this is the world I live in, and life has made me a cynic. What are they hiding behind the smiles?"

TW: Mention of suicide

I’m so tired of moving from school to school.  I just want stability in my life.  My parents have moved many times and I’ve been through several different schools.  I’m tired of trying to make friends; I think Ive forgot how to.  Having no friends will give you such a miserable outlook on the world, you begin to despise everyone around you, leading you down an even more isolating road.  I remember getting back home from middle school and having to watch my 4 younger siblings after a draining day of school.  It was the most miserable time of my life, I felt so misunderstood and lonely.  I nearly killed my self.

However, I’m going to a new High School at the end of summer and I’m doing a lot of mental preparation.  I’m going to really try to make friends this year, I’m hoping high school will be memorable for me.  Staying positive; there’s no time to waste. 💞

(Please don’t say I have a victim complex, moving a lot can have serious mental effects on a child.)"

lonely,Just had a dream where I received affection from someone I don't even know,"Just had a dream where I received affection from someone I don't even know - The dream started with me in some kind of class. We were doing some work, and I was sitting besides this girl that I instantly recognized as one of my classmates during secondary school. The weird thing is that I've barely spoke with her in real life and we didn't know each other at all, for me she was just another random classmate. But apparently in this dream I was close friends with her, and we talked about some work stuff without feeling weird or anxious like I usually do when interacting with other people. In fact, I actually felt relaxed talking to her, the conversations went smoothly (obviously since I'm tecnically talking to myself in a dream) and I was being myself basically.

After that, the dream cuts in to a different scene. I was in the backseat of a car with her, and someone else was driving us home during midnight, after the class. We were both quite tired so we didn't talk much, but I still felt good around her. I was distracted looking at something through the window, when suddenly she laid her head on my lap and fell asleep. This really took me by surprise obviously, but at the same time, it made me feel... fuzzy. I've never received any kind of physical affection from anyone other than my parents, so what happened in this dream made me feel actually happy and deserving of love. I started caressing and playing with her hair, and at some point my vision started to blur and I also fell asleep...

Then, my dream completely changes into something unrelated that I don't remember, and that's when I realize that everything was made up. I woke up feeling both sad and confused. Knowing that all that comfort and wholesomeness was just a product of my imagination made me feel quite pathetic to be honest. It was like a reminder of how alone I am, and how touch-starved I feel sometimes..."
lonely,Not sure what to do,"Not sure what to do - I used to post here on my old account. I’m 27m and just moved to a new city with much better dating opportunities. 


I just don’t have the confidence to date, and I’m not sure who’s in my league. I love being alone. 


I’d like to date an introverted girl. I’m very introverted. I make decent money, have a nice apartment, I look okay. I just got a gym membership. I love getting tattoos, I even do my own sometimes. I ride a motorcycle. I’m financially responsible. I like learning about the universe. 

I’ve been in relationships, but never really felt anything except for one person, but they were a narcissist. So that messed with my mind for a while. So I decided to be single for a while. I’ve done a lot of psychedelics to heal and think. I think a lot but I don’t think that’s a bad thing. Some people don’t think enough. 


When I’m feeling lonely, I just don’t feel like downloading an app or talking to people. I’m really introverted, and I feel like they could choose better options (even if that’s not entirely true). 

I’m comfortable alone. Time flows slowly and peacefully. I’m trustworthy, calm and observant. I don’t do hookups, I think I’m demisexual. I’d like to find someone like me, but that requires actually trying. I can’t do it for some reason. 

I hate taking pictures of myself. I don’t know many guys that do though. So if I had to take some for my dating profile it would be a hassle. 

Sometimes I feel like I’m just an observer of this world. I watch everything pass me by. I see couples and feel happy for them. I feel like that could never be me.

lonely,"sad about being alone, yet always distancing myself.","sad about being alone, yet always distancing myself. - hey fellow lonely folks! as much as i want to convince myself my situation is ""unique"" im sure there are hundreds, if not thousands of people in the same rut.

long story short, i feel like i am such a vibrant and kind woman but i always choose the lonely route. any time i start a new job i swear to me more involved and make an effort to make friends of my co-workers... but i dont. in college i even dormed so i had more than enough opportunities to interact with peers, try new groups... but i didnt. 

i am satisfied with just having me time, yet im sad that im alone. when im in my little cocoon theres peace! no more fake smiles, no more performing this act of happiness. being alone in my pj's watching the mindy project with a big bowl of icecream and cuddling with my cat is genuinely all i need. sometimes i wish i had a friend to call or maybe a partner to be ""alone together"" with... but i know even if i had the chance by default i send myself into exile. 

i signed up to work for cuddlist (a platonic touch service) to help break this. wish me luck!"
lonely,I don’t feel connected to anyone anymore,"I don’t feel connected to anyone anymore - I 20 m seem to have such a hard time having lasting connections. I have grown a lot over the past few years, I used to be very reckless and formed most of my friendships around that. now I value my peace, take care of myself, and am am responsible. I feel like now that I don’t try so hard to be cool anymore many of my old friends don’t accept me and it really hurts.. at this point I’m exhausted by people and crave new connections that feel fulfilling, but I have a hard time putting effort into people. I try to be a positive, nice, n open minded person but I’ve been told I come off as intimidating, guarded, and distant.. I’m just bad at showing my true personality before I know you well, and most of the time people aren’t interested beyond first impressions. I was bullied my whole childhood until high school and despite that being far in the past, it’s caused me to be irrationally distrustful of others. I’m so tired of hearing “put yourself out there and you’ll make friends” when idk what that means I’m in school, work, etc. and when I try to put myself out there people seem disinterested. I just wish I could find more people who understand this feeling, like I’ve always felt restricted around people and free alone, but then feel sad about being lonely. if you have any advice or insight on why I could be having these difficulties I would appreciate it:)"

lonely,A piece on mourning possibilities that never were.,"A piece on mourning possibilities that never were. - Tonight I took a bath. A long hot one. A glass of red wine in one hand and a webtoon in the other.

Silly, I know. It’s too cliché.

A grown ass woman filling her loneliness with wine and a feel-good romance story? Tale as old as time.

I would like to think tonight is a turning point.

Sitting on my bed wrapped in a towel and unmotivated to get dressed or brush out my sopping wet hair I am mourning the loss of things that never were, and never will be.

Yeah, I’ve mourned them before. So what makes this time different?

Admittance.

I haven’t admitted to a single soul that I haven’t moved on from things that happened over a year ago. The same week that I was ready to move forward with a risky and intoxicating relationship I was assaulted by my best friend. 

Within a week I lost the two men who were most important to me.

I spent a week after the assault processing and shoving everything down but after that week passed I forced myself back… you have to keep moving forward, you can’t just stop your life… but when I resurfaced the one I wanted was already with someone else. The one I wanted turned out to be an ass-hole no better than the one who took advantage—the one I wanted just used trickery instead.

It’s more than a year later. I’ve dated other people. Yet my mind still travels back to the passion that we had. Or... *I* had, and he pretended to have long enough to…

Like I said, tale as old as time.

My problem is that when I’m not catastrophizing I’m romanticizing. I’m color blind when it comes to warning flags and see potential rather than reality. I fall for season two Zuko before waiting to make sure he reaches the full potential of season three Zuko.

I fell for season two Zuko last year. It’s a year later but season three hasn’t been released yet. And like a fool I still pretend that it might be. It won’t. This show was cancelled.

What makes tonight different is that for the first time in months I’m admitting that I’m not over things—not to a perfect extent, at least.

My current loneliness makes me long for my last real passion—passion with a fool. I was the fool.

Today is different because I’m disillusioned. Today is different because I’m acknowledging that *I* was a naïve fool to think that that asshat meant anything he said to me. I was a fool for pretending like I didn’t think my oldest friend would jump at the first chance he thought he had in my pants. I was a fool.

That doesn’t mean he and he are not shit—If there is shit in the world they’re there—but there is no growth in not owning up to where I made mistakes.

I want growth. And I want to be comfortable by myself.

And godammit, a hot bath with wine and a cliché romance bring me comfort. So I’ll drink my damn wine. Watch my fingers get pruney, and sob when protagonist sobs.

But I will also mourn this loss, and move on to find my Sokka, instead."

I don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore

I 17nb have no clue what’s happening anymore. I don’t have many friends, the relationship I have with my mom is more like a teacher and student, and me my dad treats me like I’m stupid. My entire life I’ve felt like I don’t fit in. I barely have any friends and the friends I do have I’m afraid hate me, I don’t get invited anywhere and I’m getting kinda bullied at school in classes I once loved. I feel bad saying I’m getting bullied, but I think that’s what’s happening. They were all nice to my face and we were texting quite a bit, but then one of my “friends” threw a small party and I wasn’t invited, even though the rest of the class was.

It kinda hurt, but I guessed there was a reason I was the only one not invited. Then the next day I overheard the teacher talking to her classroom aide and she was complaining about me. I always do my work, I never talk back, and I try to be nice.

I shower and take care of myself so I don’t look or smell bad, I don’t talk about my interests that are a bit weirder, and I’ve tried being interested in what everyone else is but nothing works.

I’ve also dated people even tho I don’t want to, just to try to prove I can. Almost no one texts me first so I don’t talk to many people. And recently I had surgery and only one person from school came over to see if I was okay. 

I just am numb ig, I do nothing anymore except isolate myself and come to Reddit to try to make friends, but almost none of them stay. I don’t want to hurt myself but it’s like there are voices in my head that won’t shut up. I don’t want to die but I feel like I should just to see if anyone would show up to my funeral because they miss me. I hate myself, I hate my body, my personality, just everything because I’ve never been good enough for anyone. Not even my own family.

The only one I’ve ever felt loved by is my brother, he’s alway there for me but I don’t get to see him much because he is an adult and has his own life. 

I’ve just had it, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Why am I not good enough?"

In my last few weeks there, I finally felt like I truly connected with some people and felt comfortable around them, something I hadn't felt the entire year before that.

I came home about a week ago and feel super lonely again. I haven't interacted with anyone besides my parents and siblings, so I guess that's probably contributing to it. My friends and I used to always be on discord playing random shit pretty much every night in high school, but now someone will send a message maybe once a month at most. I miss being able to get on my computer pretty much whenever and do something fun with someone. Now I just feel so bored and don't know what to do with myself. Playing games alone makes me feel even more lonely since I'd rather at least be around my family.

I feel like a huge part of it is also that my sleep schedule is so messed up. About half the time I'm awake, I'm just sitting in bed while everyone else is sleeping. I've tried everything to fix my sleep schedule and nothing has worked. It feels like a lost cause at this point.

I hope you're doing well. So, storytime:

In my final year of high school, I (29M) attended my prom with some friends. I didn't take a date, just arrived with some friends. The previous week I had begun to walk my 2nd cousin home from school and babysit her until my cousin and her husband arrived and talked to a girl who attended high school with me. I wanted to ask her for a dance at the prom, not a date, just a dance.

At prom, I asked her and she declined. Unfortunately, I wrongly took that to mean ""Not right now"". Let me stress that I didn't have any ulterior motives, I asked another girl later that evening and was even approached by another. I hung out with my friends, and later tried asking the 1st girl again but she edged away. I don't recall cornering her, or blocking off an entrance, I didn't get up in her personal space or call her names. I just thought ""Oh, OK."" I caught the message then. I left early, having developed a headache (I suffer migraines from childhood) and left early, leaving my friends.

I had been reported to the school for harassment. The last person to see me leave was the same teacher who'd been informed, a mentor, and I had no words. I just told him what I've said here, he suggested I simply stay away from her. But for whatever reason, 19-year-old me thought ""I've got to apologize!'.

I tried to, said ""Hello, X."" and I just froze. I shut down and she hurried past. That was 10 years ago and I am still indescribably ashamed of the incident. I feel like a monster. I don't hate women. It used to revolt me when other guys would tell me ""Oh, I'm gonna f--k a b--ch tonight."" and I obviously know I'm not entitled to anyone's time or attention. No one owes me an explanation.

I thought I was getting better when I mixed up a pair of co-workers after I started a new job, both smaller blondes and stared a bit too long as I registered it was a different person. She seemed miffed, and I went up and apologized. 9 months later, she came up and wanted to know if I was going to the company Christmas party. I said no, and she says: ""Aw. I'd really liked to have seen you there.""

I ended my shift, curled up in my car bawling. I was so happy she saw me as a normal, ordinary person and not as I see myself. I just...I feel like a monster. Like, I hate myself. I hate my sexuality. I'm so terrified. I would never hurt someone.

Therapy is the obvious answer here. You can tell me I'm a POS - it's important, to be honest, and not pull any punches. I was inappropriate. I just...I'm stuck. I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to take solace in the incident with my co-worker and some other positive comments other female friends have made (I've never told anyone), and part of me wants, well, I'm better \*now\* but I used to fantasize about leaving a note saying ""I can't hurt anyone now. You are **safe**.""

I know this is a drop in the water compared to what a lot of people experience. I suppose I'm simply fragile. Please let me know your insights, good or bad. Thank you."

lonely,*Literally* dreaming I had friends,"*Literally* dreaming I had friends - I had a group of friends that iced me out after college.  I know it might be suggested to make amends, but its a relationship that has been dead for over ten years now and is beyond repair. I haven't made a new group since - and I am deeply, deeply lonely.

We used to have so much fun together and laughed until we cried. They are all still friends with each other - living in the same town as me. Except they have each gotten married and have had children. I'm single and childless.

Sometimes I literally dream that I am friends with them again, and in my dream, we are having so much fun and laughing so hard - to the point of tears - at something so dumb.  I legit will sometimes be smiling and half-laughing when I wake up.  

Then the stark reality hits that I am not friends with them anymore, and my closest friend is a co-worker I haven't seen in two years. Now thats sad."

After I healed I tried to find another to fill that void that he filled so well. I have made connections with a few really wonderful men, but it never compares to what I felt for him. What if I never find another soul to connect with like that again?

After the walk I ate some pizza and wings now I’m just laying on the couch dead tired. How the hell am I supposed to “get out there” when I’m always tired and/or depressed and/or at work? And when I finally go out and meet people it’s just boring and meaningless and never goes anywhere.

Because I don’t have any long term friends, I have to start from scratch. This is way harder than just hanging out with people you’re already close with because you have to be on your “best behavior” when meeting people. I don’t have the energy for this."

It hurts so much that none of my former friends care about me despite continuing with eachother, they found new people in the new class and after few weeks and they become better friends then we ever were. They never invite me anywhere and i feel so bad for asking. I basically gave myself face dysmorfia because of the things i found on the internet that the looks is the most important things out there and to me it makes so much sense. So when i acidentally look into the mirror i feel so anxious and i hate myself that i am so ugly and the most depressing thing to me is that i could have been attractive if everything went just right but it didn't.

Or if is though chat they would ghost me for days before answering, i've been upfront about these things in some occcasions to see if i could resolve it, and one told me that she didn't notice and then she asked questions and showed interest for a little time and then started again just talking though text whole phragraphs about herself, and i feel that if i'm upfront that maybe would offend the other person and they would ghost me, because lots of people are not interested in building a strong friendship based on open comunication, idk what to do anymore, what's your advice?"

though i do abuse them, i still find drugs cool; coping the edgy way type beat. gave me life. it was adventurous, risky, uncomfortable. it made me feel something after several months of dreadful loneliness.  im also really into meditation/buddhism (havent had the mental fortitude to do it in a while tho...) and they are very connected, which fuels my curiosity in drugs a lot ig.

i dont know how far i will go, but im going far. did meth, thinking of fucking myself up with some salvia as well. gonna quit soon hopefully, just wanna go out with a splash i guess (i know this is a classic drug addict quote)

Been on and off the dating apps for years and never got anywhere with anyone. It felt like my whole objective was to find my soulmate so that I could cure this deep longing for companionship. 

Well, that didn't pan out. I've pretty much given up hope on this pursuit.

One of the biggest reasons for it is because I feel like I have to work on myself. I'm not where I want to be in life at all and people can tell when you're unhappy even if you don't explicitly say it.  

And also, being single is OK so long as you have friends. All I want are friends. Not just one, but a group of friends, with a strong dynamic, to laugh and joke with and just do any activity with. I used to have groups of friends but they've all since disbanded.

Here we have something called ""Maifest"" which is basically a place where they build up a large tent where people party and celebrate for the whole weekend. Everybody of my village goes there, except me. 

Because I have noone. I really have 0 friends! I am a 26 year old woman. I'd never dare to go to any party all alone! The second thing is I hate the people here!

I was massively bullied in secondary school. And people spread nasty rumours about me in the neighborhood. I feel like I have become just a clown for everyone. They all laugh at me and i feel like everybody hates me here. Since that time (being 10 years old) I have absolutely no friends! I also never had a boyfriend.16 years of being completely alone! Because i was scared of these people at school and also didn't like them for obvious reasons, i isolated myself more and more over the years. So here we are now. I don't know anybody anymore and I have absolutely no friends. I want to move out of my parents house this year. Somewhere far away from all those idiots who ruined my life. But the thing is I wouldn't go to any sort of party alone, especially as a woman. I don't even want to be at the Maifest, I don't even have a desire to drink and do what ever shit they do. But still it makes me jealous. If I had friends who would want to go there with me I would do it. I just wish I had friends. But I probably never will have friends. I never learned how to find some. And as an adult it gets harder and harder to make new friends. I don't have hobbies to share with others. I don't have any special interests. And I don't drink or party.

But I still feel very lonely when I'm just doing my own things at home or working (I work at home). And I want to sleep more than I need to.

I can’t pin point the exact start of my downfall and I just can’t let go. I don’t wanna do this anymore. This isn’t some suicide note but a declaration that I’ve given up on trying to get better. As I fall deeper into my pit of self hatred I would know that it’s my fault at the end of the day. The good moments that happen, I’ll feel as though I just got lucky.

I've always had mostly online friends, as soon as my family got a computer with dial-up when I was a kid.

Nope, just shy and anxious.)

There were so many people who wanted to make plans, there wasn't time for everyone. Happy times for an extrovert.

I was still the same person. Conventionally unattractive, low income, occasional periods where I barely speak in public. But for awhile, it didn't matter. 

I hate being home. I'm invisible here. When I was overseas at my friend's house last time, I remember waking up and looking out her open window, thinking, ""I could just slip out, make it look like an accident. Then I wouldn't have to be lonely anymore."" If I'm not depressed, I'm angry and self-destructive, all because I just want to feel like I'm worth something again, like I did when I was away."
lonely,How do you stop worrying about feeling left behind?,How do you stop worrying about feeling left behind? - Loneliness is not what people want in their life but I am tired of having the feeling of being left behind watching everyone start families. I want to get out of this cycle and get back to my normal self and not worry about life. How do I do this?
lonely,What’s wrong with me?,"What’s wrong with me? - Everyone’s gone my cousins, friends and the relationships I have with my grandparents and mom has differed I feel so sad it feels like a heavy weights on my chest it’s been like this for 3 years now ever since I got diagnosed with Social anxiety and generalized anxiety. Being out the house makes me more sad being in the house makes me more sad being at school makes it 10x worse. My moms disappointed in me so is my grandmother I am too every time I come out my room I wanna cry. I wish they were still here( the people who left me) I was okay when they were. When I first got diagnosed with social anxiety they were there for me I was able to hold on longer but their all gone. I wish I had someone.

Sorry I get to the point on this section 

 But here’s what I don’t understand I’m so sad because I’m so lonely I wish I had someone but here’s the thing. I decided to find a online friend I did it made me even more sad. Today someone at school started having a convo with me for the first time in years and I just started crying( I didn’t let them see) but I just felt so sad more than ever I just don’t understand if I’m so lonely why does that make me cry why does it make me sad what the hell is wrong with me?"
lonely,how to cope with this loneliness?,"how to cope with this loneliness? - I am 20 and in such a small age I don't want to feel lonely. I am going through it from last 6-7 years. I have so many friends, but also with them I become silent and feel left out. They all are good and I am really grateful to have them. But I really need a person who can take me out from this loneliness."
lonely,I can't stop thinking about her,"I can't stop thinking about her - I dreamt last night that I had the courage and charisma to ask her out before the semester ends, and that she was crazy enough to say yes. Recently I tried Uber and it didn't go horribly wrong, so as a person who can't drive, I don't feel quite as locked in my house. It made it possible for me to imagine actually going out with her, I didn't have to pathetically squeak ""I'm a worthless nondriving piece of shit, so if you want the pleasure of my company, you'll have to drive me around like a goddamned chauffeur"" .

But yeah, she said yes, and we exchanged numbers to talk about where to go. Ended up going to the aquarium (one of my favorite spots) , and it was awesome. She didn't hate me, and I didn't feel like trash.

But the problem is it was just a dream. Now I have this memory that's so much better than reality, but it isn't even real. And I'm fixating on it, it's all that's in my head. I'll see if video games can help get it out, or at least let me have a break from it.

This is why I hate having good dreams. Sure, they're pleasant as long as your unconscious, but then reality pulls you away from your happy place to be tortured again. It sucks, it's not worth the momentary pleasure of it.

God, I wish it was real. I was actually happy. I wasn't having to fake it to hope I end up believing it, I wasn't having to focus only on the positive and ignore the negative. I was just purely happy. Maybe I wouldn't be such a fucking waste of oxygen if I could actually feel that way in reality."

I didn't wanna be like this, so how do you think it makes me feel being called a crybaby on a daily basis. It doesn't help that I have nobody to reside in, I can't even cry now- why does every little thing matter to these people?! I am so so tired, of everything, life and myself."

If I was a burden to you , just tell me, I could leave if you didn’t liked me,but don’t just dump me and ignore me for the whole time, things just started to get back on track but now is falling apart again, it’s crumbling, Ruby, I know you don’t use Reddit but I just want to tell you that you meant a lot in my life,I like you

lonely,Alcoholic parent,"Alcoholic parent - My mums been suicidal &amp; an alcoholic all her life. My dad wasn’t in my life until recently, I didn’t even know he’s my biological dad until he contacted her, I thought one of the other guys that she introduced me to was. She’s had multiple boyfriends while I was younger, and she’d make me call them “dad” but then they’d all leave. We were living with my grandparents at the time as they were the ones raising me whilst she was out drinking &amp; partying. She would come home everyday and beat me with sticks, shoes, hangers, and anything that was in sight. Once she tried to drown me. She never attended any of my school events &amp; I felt so so alone watching other kids have dads that are present . On Father’s &amp; mothers Day my school organised events for kids and their parents to do fun activities together. I would always be sitting in the library and it was so hurtful.  

Once my biological dad was back in our life, things had been better and smooth. But her alcoholism &amp; narcissism still remains the same. I used to be a huge extrovert with an outgoing personality but now I’m just a shell of that person. She never let me have any fun as she always barged at places I was and humiliated me by causing a scene while she was drunk. 
I’ve become really anti social now and never leave the house at all. And all of this is her fault. I’m diagnosed with major depression, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, bulimia, sleep paralysis and adhd. A lot of these things are because of childhood trauma too. I was also sexually assaulted as a child but I haven’t told anyone in my family about it. I’m in therapy and medicated but living with her is so tiring. I was having a conversation with her as we are supposed to go out in a few hours &amp; I was reminding her that I have my doctors appointment in the morning too, and during this conversation she started drinking and I tried stopping her saying we have to go out in a few hours please stop drinking. We got into a physical altercation, she doesn’t hit me anymore as I’m taller and stronger than her but she still was trying hard for 30 mins. I kept trying to snatch the drinks away from her to go and dispose them but she kept yelling like a maniac telling me the usual things “I wish I aborted you” “I wish you were never born” . She’s said these things on all of my birthdays too. Never had a good birthday till date in my life. 
Finally I got a hold of her drinks and went to dispose them and she grabbed my hair and pulled me back to hit me but I pushed her away fortunately. I’ve to always be on guard as she has tried to attempt sûïcïdé many times and all the blame comes on to me. My dad lives out of the country &amp; my family is sick and tired of her, they’ve given up ages ago . She gets into car accidents often &amp; injuries herself here and there due to her alcoholism. I am so tired. I really wish I had a normal family or childhood. My relationships have also been horrible. I don’t have any in real life friends at all, I only have online friends. I’ve really wanted a best friend for long but can’t ever make one as almost everyone has a best friend now. Nothing is keeping me going except my dog."
lonely,"I'm ugly, or average? Doesn't matter anyway, forever lonely.","I'm ugly, or average? Doesn't matter anyway, forever lonely. - Been told I was in high school, graded as the ugliest dude in our grade.

Never felt attractive, never been complimented in real life.

Few months away from being a 24-year-old virgin.

Still live with my parents, never went to college.

I'm a loser.

But more importantly I have always hated the way I look, even now.

Posted pictures of myself on reddit, and been told I'm not ugly, which I struggle to believe.

Therapy and ssri's haven't helped me either, because I'm ugly 😆. Like why would these things even help me?

The sad thing is I tried to be positive in high school, but deep down knew this is why women do not like me, and making friends is a challenge in itself.

I'm an incel, I've bought in to the idea that it's over, no one has ever found me attractive in real life, so when will it start?

I sometimes want to rip off my face and get a new one, an actual masculine face with a jawline that doesn't need a beard to compensate.

If I became attractive, wouldn't even feel that great because it would show how shallow women really are."
lonely,I (22F) feel lonely at college.,"I (22F) feel lonely at college. - I’ve been 4 years in college and I haven’t made any friends yet. I have literally nothing in common with people in my class. No one to call a friend. No one to talk to when needed. Literally no one. 

I’ve been feeling so lonely lately. It has been almost always the same for me since middle school. People bond with each other quickly, they become a friend group and I’m left friendless and alone. It’s like making friends, socializing, etc. comes easy to everyone but me. 

I just wish I knew how to socialize like normal people do. I just don’t fit in, it doesn’t matter where: school, jobs…it’s always the same. I’m the outsider. I tried to talk to some people but it feels like it takes forever for me to become close to someone, it’s frustrating. I don’t want to be a social butterfly, I just want someone to talk to, anyone, but apparently that’s to much to ask for :/"

lonely,I think I’m falling for a pornstar.,"I think I’m falling for a pornstar. - Up until yesterday I was doing a fine job of ignoring how alone I feel. My career and fitness goals have kept me motivated and unfocused on the dark stuff.

That is, until I decided to put on my Oculus and do a little… searching. 

I’m no stranger to… uh. VR fun times? But there was something about one particular video I came across. Something about the way the performer looked at me, her smile, the caring words she said. It broke me and I started crying.

What the fuck is wrong with me? I’m 24, a virgin, and ruin every romantic chance I get. The last girl I loved cheated on me then ran off with my best friend and… god. I just want to be looked at like that performer looked at me. But I know it’ll probably never happen for me again. I won’t ever be held, and I just need to come to terms with that. 

This has never happened to me before and I don’t know what to do with how much this hurts. Sorry if this comes out super incel sounding"

I think the novel capture loneliness very well, it talks about things that other books, other people don't talk about.

What it has left me with is the question whether we pass through time or time passes through us? It's as if how you'll do in life depends on some factors and if you don't have those factors right, you're doomed."
lonely,Physical appearance shouldn't matter,"Physical appearance shouldn't matter - But it does, people judge us purely on the basis of physical appearance, only because that's what we see first, what we tend to miss out on might be some of the most wholesome people you might ever meet.

Since when did we make physical vanity so important? I'd accept you for whatever you are, no matter what you look like. You look like the next super model and I knew you were an awful person, then I'd accept that you are an awful person and that you should be far away from me as much as possible.

I believe in getting to know someone regardless of their looks, because what matters is not what's on the outside, but what's on the inside.

I wanted to go see a movie tonight and the same excuse came in with them. I then asked someone who I’ve only talked to ONCE and he said yes… We’ll go see the mov tomorrow.

lonely,Self-Hatred and loneliness,"Self-Hatred and loneliness - I'm so lost, I hate myself so much. I feel so ungrateful for feeling this way too, I have a number of friends that do genuinely care about me and are concerned for my well being. Yet I still feel so cripplingly lonely, which feeds into the cycle of self hatred. 

I can't seem to do anything correctly, especially when it comes to relationships. Recently my bf left me, which really amplifies these feelings, and I feel so bad about it. He says that it's just bc he fell in love with someone else, and that I didn't do anything wrong and what not. But if we're in a relationship together and you end up falling in love with someone else while we're still together, then evidently I was doing something wrong and I'd appreciate not being lied to about it. I just want to know what I'm doing that drove him away. 

I just feel so worthless, why am I always everyone's second choice, why am I unable to form a meaningful bond with someone that goes beyond just being friends. I'm never good enough for anyone, friends/partners/family/etc. I'm sorry, I just can't be what they all want me to be. I'm so tired of trying to make it seem like everything is fine, that I don't need help, and that I'm happy/content with life. I'm not, I hate myself, I hate my life, I feel so alone )):"

lonely,Should I just stay single??,"Should I just stay single?? - So I’m Bisexual and my luck with women have been unsuccessful. I was married for 5 years and got divorced because my ex wife thought it was cool to cheat on me while I was deployed.

Fast forward a little. I was in relationship with another woman who then decided to tell me that she didn’t think she could reciprocate the same love I was giving her after 2 years of already being together. So my luck has come up short every time.

I’m turning 29 this summer and I’m kind of over the whole dating and start over. It’s also hard to find someone after you’ve been screwed over so many times. I know what I want and won’t entertain any back and forth games.

I know someone who is pretty kind, but I can’t stand her. She’s there but she makes every conversation about herself and makes fun of me if I don’t know something. She once asked me if Nissan and Volkswagen were the same thing and I simply said no, but when I ask a question she makes a big deal by laughing at me before answering. We were at a Mexican restaurant and I mispronounced a word, she laughed hysterically, and started making fun of me to the waiter. Luckily the waiter just looked at me and told me how to say the word. 

Anywho , I feel like this is the dynamic with most my “friends”. They treat me like I’m dumb, and I hate it. I try to tell myself it doesn’t matter what they think , but it annoys me when I’m saying something factual and they simply disregard me. I see how they give others respect and I can’t keep wondering why it’s lost on me.

Four years later, my life only has gotten worse. I didn't make a single friend, go to a single party, get any internships, get any research opportunities. I had nothing. Nada. I worked so hard to find friends to the point where I was willing to settle with anyone. Yet, even with my lowered standards, I still failed.

People always tell me things would get better after college, but why should I believe them? People told me things will get better after high school, but look at me now. People told me things will get better after middle school, but look at me now. People told me things will get better after elementary school, but look at me now.

I can barely take care of myself and I don't expect anyone to do it for me. It's an oxymoron, to crave company while wanting to isolate myself. People have hurt me and made me fear making friends. I was so scared of losing people that I've just become apathetic and detached. I haven't really nurtured my relationships and I know I just do the bare minimum to keep these 3 people close to me. I wish someone would be as passionate as I was before my soul got shattered. With that passion, I wish they'd tell me that no matter what, they'd stay by my side."

lonely,truly no one is there for u,"truly no one is there for u - I don't want to trust anymore or feel anything for anyone anymore. I think I'm just destined to be by myself and I have to face that. It sucks knowing that I need to carry all this stress and pressure. That I can't talk to someone about it and have them genuinely be concerned, genuinely want me to be better. People ultimately have agendas. It's unfortunate and sad but this is what it is. I have always been the type to imagine anyways. It's better than the true nature and reality of most relationships or connections/bonds. Often times it turns out to be a facade. I've been drinking daily. I feel my heads in a mess/fog. My life feels stuck. My family is all negative and drama. I'm grateful for night cause of the silence but it also is so empty. I see no hope in connecting to a person who doesn't have an agenda to get something out of me. I might be lonely but I don't wanna go back to being like that. So lonely that I give away my body just for a temporary feeling of ""love/bonding"". I will remember that it's all an illusion. Being lusted after is not the same as being loved. I'm here if anyone else going through it but please don't message me if you want to talk sexually because it's not happening."

I’m what you’ve been looking for, in all my sick glory.

But for real though I can’t sleep because I feel like I got hit by a truck and even though my room is probably 90° it feels like I’m in Antarctica during the ice age. But it would be more fun if there was someone to talk to. I mean… as fun as it can be just sitting here alone day in and day out being sick instead of working for a week. 

Random fun quick fire facts about me:

I’m a semi-pro steering wheel drummer. That’s right, you’re talking to an almost professional baby. 

I happen to be a true master in the art of Guitar Hero (the old one with 5 buttons not these new guitars) which is prolly my most nerdy fun fact

My hair has more volume than my sick personality at the moment but I’ll get less sick and a hair cut so if you want your dream man just give me 3-5 business days

I’m officially 6’0. Been confirmed by my doctor now like 10 times and even though nobody cares, I accomplished one of my *tallest* ambitions. Play on words there for ya.

I can almost guarantee you won’t meet any other person this sick and with this much personality who’s also 6 feet tall tonight. So here’s your once in a nighttime chance!

I have talked to many people. Numerous.

So many times people have ghosted or they deleted their accounts or never initiated.

I grew frustrated bc I never would get a definite answer for what I did wrong.

Because it happened so many times and naturally I keep remembering, I became angry, bitter, and hopeless.

So many times in the past -- I gave the benefit of the doubt that maybe they're just busy, maybe it's a one-time thing

I'm sick of thinking what if- what if- over whether the next one will work out.

I'm tired. I'm drained. I'm sick of everyone.

When I’m feeling good, I don’t mind solitude. I’m quite introverted after all. But when I’m feeling bad, when I need someone the most, I can’t seem to bring myself to interact with anyone. The loneliness and sadness that come up are just too intense for me to function socially. I waste most of my time on my phone. Sometimes I’ll push through it and end up feeling better after socializing but it’s always a crapshoot and many times it just makes me feel worse.

Sometimes I’ll spend time swiping on Tinder or Grindr, because I feel the need for some intimacy. But even if I can manage to find someone capable of having a conversation, I rarely end up meeting up because I feel a deep need to be comforted and know I won’t be able to function socially until that need is met, but I know they can’t fill the hole my lonely childhood devoid of acceptance left in me. 

I’ve always been on the shyer side but it’s been out of hand recently. Not sure how to break out of this and what I want seems to be a moving target.

lonely,"29, lost, and lonely","29, lost, and lonely - For context, I used to have a lot of friends when I did sports in high school. In early college I smoked weed and had a lot of friends I did that with. I started having delusions at 19, and was eventually diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Without weed and with medications I’m pretty normal (except for mood swings) but I relapsed on weed multiple times which made me psychotic again. People that witnessed me acting psychotic have distanced themselves from me over the years. This and other things have drove me to attempt suicide in the past.

I graduated college recently and got a certificate to teach abroad, but had no one to celebrate with besides my mom. I have one friend that I occasionally text, but he lives across the country. For the past 5 years I feel like I’ve adapted to a loner lifestyle because I’ve lost everyone I’ve ever had in in my life, and I’m afraid of making new friends because I’m afraid I’ll just lose them. I mostly just work out, play video games, and watch anime these days. I live in paralyzing fear of running into people who have seen me in my psychotic state so I spend most of my time alone.

Right now I’m applying to work abroad. Maybe I’ll be able to make a new life for myself somewhere far away.

My parents and siblings ignored me but the only thing I had was the family computer that was in my room. I was a mentally ill neglected child who just wanted a friend or a kind voice but instead I would spend hours on the internet, mostly YouTube and Tumblr. Because of this, the internet became my closest friend. I do have one close friend irl that’s the person I met when I was 13 but we go to college in different states and she is starting to make other friends so I try to not bother her. Because the internet is my closest friend I spend all day on it. Recently I started arguing with random people on all platforms, mostly racist people but anyone I feel like arguing with. It’s honestly pathetic and time consuming but this is the only constant social interaction I receive. I am in my second year of college and all I’ve done is gain weight and become more depressed. I spend every Saturday night since January crying because I have no friends. I’ve gone to some groups on campus like once or twice but I’ve never really belonged because the people there are always interested in anybody but me. I’ve only belonged online. Please don’t comment corny shit under this post I will block you but I just feel so drained and pathetic.

I also don’t have much of a social life given work schedule and living at home with parents to save money. But that also means I don’t have many friends and the few friends I have I don’t see consistently. 

I do my best to occupy myself as I’m told you gotta love yourself and your company since no one will fix me. But after years of flying solo, it would be nice to finally share my time and energy with someone. My favorite hobbies are the gym, puzzles, gaming and trying new recipes. I like to get out the house but it sucks never having anyone to go with. I suck it up sometimes only to deal with the painful reminder of how lonely I am when I see families, lovers or friends while I go about my day. 

I have made a post here for platonic friendships and chatted with friendly folks. Unfortunately it just fizzles out for various reasons. I’m just tired of never being anyone’s first choice for dating but also my dry phone. I invite friends to do things with me but they usually already have plans or I’m stuck at work.

Today, this morning, girl in my calc class came and asked me a question. Tbh I can't even remember what she asked, I was so nervous that none of the details got remembered. But I think i was helpful. Oh, wait, I just remembered that she said something to the effect of ""you looked like you knew what you were doing"" . So that was it. I don't understand. Y'all don't even know, dude, I look like an abused puppy in public. I am so fucking scared of everyone. I'm the opposite of confident. How did she come to the idea that I'm smart or confident academically? She's wrong, I'm barely making it through. Maybe she lied. I was the only fellow chem student in that calc class, maybe she thought I was the only person she could ask in time? Idk, I'm so confused.

And she has a boyfriend (because of course I'm a facebook stalking perv) , so I extra know she doesn't like me. But I still like her, and I can't stop it. It's so fucked up.

Earlier in the week though there was a girl and her lab partner who caught me in the hallway waiting for another class of mine. She came over and asked me to help her and her friend. she didn't say why, but I think it must've been convenience, too. They just happened to see me, it was probably easier  and quicker to ask me while they were there working on it than to go and try to catch the professor.

But she was she is so fucking cute, and that's like all that was in my head. I just wanted to be useful to her, I wanted so desperately to be something she valued, even if just pragmatically.

And she was one of the last one's out of the lab today. Me and my usual lab group, girl #2, and actually girl #1 too were the last one's in there. I really wanted to go casually ask girl #2 how she thought she did, and to ask what answer she got in her calculations (cuz my numbers felt weirdly big, and I'm really scared that I fucked up) . But I don't know how to be casual, all I would've been is creepy. She'd see right through me and know that I liked her, she'd be disgusted, and she'd get away as soon as she could.

I hate that helping her made me feel so happy cuz it made me feel useful. You know the most pathetic part? I'm pretty sure me and her are gonna be in o-chem in fall together, and I've been fantasizing about her asking to do homework together. Because homework is so fucking hard for me to force my broken ass brain to do, but I know that if I was doing with her then it'd be easy. Not even just cuz it's her, but cuz I genuinely enjoy doing schoolwork with people, it's so much fun. So it's not even like necessarily romantic fantasies. Idk, that just feels so stupid for some reason. Are my hopes really so low now that I can't even fantasize about her valuing me as anything more than a living Google? she's way fuckin out my league tho fr, ain't one motherfucker in the school in her league. Swear to god she looks like a fucking model. Guess that's why it scared me so much when she asked for my help, her noticing I exist was terrifying.

I can't help but notice how juvenile this sounds. This ""i cant talk to gurls"" is shit people outgrow in high school. I'm almost 20 fucking 3. And I wonder if this is because I never went to a real high school. I was homeschooled from 6th grade on. Maybe if I had grown up normal instead, I would've had the fucking balls to talk to her. But nah, nah, I'll just bitch about it on reddit instead. God, I'm a fucking loser. Hope to god she ain't into me, cuz can you imagine the disappointment finding that your man does \*this?\*

Fuck this shit. I'm going to sleep"

lonely,Failure.,Failure. - I’m doing terrible right now. It’s my junior year and I was diagnosed with an iron deficiency that negatively impacted my grades. I have always been a straight A student but this year I’ve witnessed a drop in my grades due to my poor health. I really wanna get iron transfusions but my mom is doing everything she can so that I don’t because she believes the best medicine is a change in diet. I’ve been on a specific diet for a while now and I feel little to no change. The school year is almost over and I can’t get over the feeling how I failed to reach any of my goals. I’m trying to be kind to myself but I just keep comparing myself to others and how they did better than me and beat myself up constantly for how bad I’ve done without taking into account the state of my health. It’s so unfair how this had to happen to me now of all times. With my dreams of attending a prestigious university my hopes and dreams have been dashed due to my performance junior year and I constantly feel its my fault that I’m sick and that I should stop being so lazy and work but I physically can’t due to severe lethargy I experience in a daily basis with the deficiency. Its so frustrating because everyone else is doing way better than me at such a crucial time for people my age and I constantly ask myself why I can’t be normal and why this had to happen to me when my academic performance mattered most. Sometimes I pray that I don’t wake up at night because I can’t deal with the fact that I’ve failed. Sometimes I pray I get hit by a car on my way to school. I keep beating my self up for circumstances and it hurts so much cause life can be so unfair. I just wish I can be normal again and go back in time to re-do junior year so that I even stand a chance to the colleges I want to attend but now that’s impossible and I’ll forever live with this feeling of a sort of “uncontrollable failure”.

lonely,Going to the movies alone sucks.,"Going to the movies alone sucks. - I've always heard how going out and doing stuff alone isn't lonely but actually some sort of freedom, but I think what most people who said that don't consider or haven't experienced is not having a choice. I can speak from experience that going out alone because you want and know you could be doing it with other people because you have friends or a SO doesn't really feel weird, and that is because you know you're doing it by choice, but when you literally have no one to go out with you then it just makes me feel incredibly lonely and hollow inside.

Back when I was younger I was already depressed and had social anxiety but got ""adopted"" by some friends and honestly those were the happiest times of my life, but they were short. In 2017 I wanted to go see Justice League but no one really was interested in the movie so I went alone, even though the movie sucked I had a good time, I didn't feel weird or anything because I knew I still had people to do other stuff with. In 2018 I started to go down a very deep dark hole I still haven't climbed out of and my friends basically abandoned me, but I still had one friend who would hang out and stuff, we are both nerdy who love Star Wars, Marvel and Lord of the Rings so we usually went to the movies together but the pandemia stopped that but we still continued texting, but I noticed I was always the one to initiate everything.

In 2021 when stuff started to open up again I asked if he wanted to go see spiderman no way home since he really wanted to see it too but outside of the movie it felt to me like he really want to be there, he was on his phone a lot didn't talk, just answered when I spoke, a few other movies we went to see was the same thing but I thought if he really didn't want to be there he would say and every time I tried to talk about he shrugged it off saying stuff like""what do you mean? That's just how I am"". So a few weeks ago pre-orders opened for the new Dr Strange movie and I asked if he wanted to go see it and he said he didn't have money and might be busy during the week, so I went alone and man it felt horrible, I really liked the movie but seeing the packed theater full of friend groups and couples while I was there alone made me feel lonely as hell! When the movie was over while waiting for the post credits scenes I saw on Instagram him posting a photo of him and a group of people I don't know at a theater seeing the movie :) ."
lonely,Lonely Introvert,"Lonely Introvert - TLDR: My wife of 10 years decided she was done having sex with me and wanted to have sex with other people; and I discovered in the process that I am lonely introvert, so I am going back to church to see if I can fix myself/get myself fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

1.

I turned 40 and discovered I was lonely. Not cripplingly lonely. Not yet. But I felt, really felt the kind of loneliness a young-ish male, having left school and entered the workforce, now expects is his lot in life. You know: the kind of loneliness that has the potential to become crippling loneliness in his 50s or 60s, if he isn’t careful. The sort of thing on which a person wants to keep a weather eye. And, for the first time in my life, I am worried.

I grew up an introvert surrounded by other people. I was born into a family of Dutch immigrants who came to Canada in the starving years after WWII. They came to make a new life for themselves. My progenitors hired themselves out as farm labourers or bought farms right in the middle of Southwestern Ontario. They started churches. Later they built elementary schools; and still later, a high school, a college, and a graduate school. I climbed this educational ladder out of the immigrant community that raised me; and, being an introvert, lacked the wherewithal to replace it with something else. 

I have a distant memory of being nine or ten and forcing tears to express the frustration I felt at not being able to connect with other kids at school. The frustration was genuine, the tears were not, which produced more frustration and more false tears. Eventually something snapped inside me, and I learned to live with my introversion. But I was in a safe space in which to be an introvert. The crowd in which I was alone included parents and grandparents, aunts and uncles, parents of other children at church, and teachers who were parents of still more children at school. I felt alone, but I really wasn’t.

The frustration returned in high school. But I was a little older, and a little wiser, and the world had grown just a little bigger. There were more people around, more opportunities for friendship, even if these weren’t always satisfactory. And then, in the 11th grade, I suffered what doctors described as a catastrophic head injury. It left me in a coma for two days, relearning basic motor function over five or six months, and regaining control of my emotions and mental functions over the next few years. For better or worse, this put me at the center of a lot of people’s personal and professional attention. I have rarely been happier.

Then I graduated from high school and went off in the year 2000 to the Dutch college my immigrant community had built for its young adults. By my second year, introversion caught up with me again, my grades fell, and I slipped into a sort of mild depression. Nothing so serious that I required psychiatric intervention. Nothing other people would have perceived. I could maintain a cheerful exterior because I was more or less at peace with myself. But too much social interaction exhausted me, and I was equally happy to take refuge in the library bookstacks.

This story continues. High points and low points. Big changes, then relapses into introversion and minor bouts with depression. I won’t try to narrate the ups and downs here. I want simply to present my street cred. I know myself to be an introvert, someone who presents well enough in a crowd of people, who is friendly and can even be gregarious when the need arises, but is nonetheless an introvert.

I understand an introvert’s experience of loneliness. I know the powerlessness one feels to effect a change in one’s mood in all too familiar places. I understand the impulse to start over, somewhere else, somewhere entirely different, because this is the only way you can wrap your head around forging connections with people.

I am now 40, and I am supposed to have made something of myself, be in the process of building a life, enacting a well thought out plan. But that’s not where I am these days.

I climbed the educational ladder out of immigrant community that raised me, pursued a couple of Masters degrees, enrolled in a PhD program; I got married and followed my wife to Washington, DC, where she got a law degree and a good job with the federal government. At no point along this climb did I think I should make an effort find new communities. Various professional frustrations along the way, most notably the failure to complete the PhD program, drove me out of communities which had embraced me—out of embarrassment more than anything else. I had my beautiful wife, my carefully curated collection of history, philosophy, and theology books, my intellectual pursuits, and a non-profit job that gave me enough responsibility to feel like I was doing something productive but also enough headspace to let my mind wander through human history. I was set. For life. Or so I thought.

Then COVID happened, and my beautiful wife did some soul-searching, and she concluded all was not well in our little world, that her heart is not in it anymore, at least not in the way that it was in past.

That last strut of communal support got pulled away. For the first time in a good number of years, I discover again that I am lonely. And for the first time ever, it scares the shit out of me.

2.

I won’t introduce my wife. If this series of personal reflections ever appears in a forum where others can read it, she would be furious to discover her dirty laundry aired in public. I will refer to her as S. and refer to her actions and/or motivations as circumspectly as possible. Since she is an integral part in this story, it would be impossible to avoid reference to her entirely. That’s probably her preference. But ten years of marriage must rule that out.

My rude awakening to the fact all was not well in our little world came after a disappointing attempt at love-making. She announced we were done having sex. I said: What? She said: No more. I asked: For how long? A month? She paused before replying in a very frustrated tone of voice something to the effect of the following: I don’t know, forever. I said: What? What do you mean, forever?

I don’t remember where the conversation proceeded from this point. I do remember being profoundly confused. Such things just don’t happen. We are both young, capable, and all that. Well, I was feeling a little under the weather and also in need of physical exercise, but that’s besides the point. These were mechanical concerns which could be remedied. S. hinted at something much deeper than mere physical incapacity.

I spent the next two and a half to three months trying to understand what provoked this response. I will not pretend my efforts in this regard were either mature or well-thought out. The shock of such a categorical denial does strange things to a person’s brain. It makes them act in unpredictable ways. I switched hard into “caring husband” mode and became as attentive and concerned as I possibly could. I had to get to the bottom of things because spouses just do not, not have sex.

I would only discover much later that she spent the same time trying to understand what she was feeling. But she was certain about one thing: our sex life had officially come to an end.

I was 40, she was turning 32.

FUUUUUUCK.

S. and I met in university. She finished her undergraduate degree and I gradually fell out of the PhD program in which I was enrolled at the time.

We were an unlikely match. Neither of us expected to get married. Professional success had consistently eluded me in ways that made me doubt my long-term financial success and made me doubt my fitness for the institution.

Her reasons were slightly different: she wanted to become a spy. I was her mark. She “encouraged” me to introduce myself to her. In a fairly short order, I suggested marriage. (My idea, not hers, this time.) I proposed on a cold winter’s night in Quebec City, QC and we were married on the beach on a hot summer’s day in the Caribbean.

She passed the LSAT with flying colours, and I followed her to Washington, DC, where she attended law school, graduated, and went to work for the federal government. I was set. A beautiful, successful wife with a good-paying, stable job. I was making a marginal, financial contribution, but I was everywhere present to support her in the other ways that I could.

Somewhere along the way this idyllic picture no longer fit with S.’s picture of herself. She would tell me, I helped her become the best version of herself, just not the truest version of herself. She still had a deep-seated need to become a spy, do spy things, blow shit up, etc. A comfortable life in the suburbs with me held questionable appeal.

And the sex got boring. News to me, but that doesn’t mean it was untrue for her.

After almost 10 years of marriage, 11 years of being together, that’s I discovered again that I was lonely. S. pointed out my social group had narrowed down to exactly one person: her. That worried her, and she thought it should worry me.

What to do about it? After a few months of stewing, I went to the one place I could count on making a personal connection, even if only with someone who was professionally obligate to care; to the one place I knew I wouldn’t be turned away or treated as an uncomfortably needy irritant. I went back to church after nearly 15 years of being away.

3.

The educational ladder I climbed up and out of my Dutch immigrant community was raised by a network of Dutch churches spread across Canada and the United States. The specific church congregation I grew up in was started by great-grandparents on my father’s side of the family. I was probably related to 10 – 15% of the congregation of 500+ members. Maternal and paternal sets of grandparents, aunts and uncles, great-aunts and great-uncles, cousins, second-cousins, and presumably third-cousins, though the higher the increment, the more meaningless these the degrees of consanguinity become.

It was a perfect place for an introvert to grow up. I wasn’t actually alone. I may have suffered the usual things that introverts suffer at church or at school, with family and with friends: constant emotional bruising that comes with not quite comprehending how to navigate social situations, continually stepping back to let others take the lead because I didn’t know how. That’s all true. But I wasn’t actually alone. There were always people around looking out for me. Not just for me, but for me all the same.

So I climbed, more or less insulated my own introverted proclivities. I climbed from the local Dutch Christian elementary school to the public high school where I encountered my first real taste of a wider world. I climbed from the public high school to Dutch Christian undergraduate institution, only very recently accredited as a university, after the catastrophic head injury I referred to earlier. This was a good first step for me because I was still putting my head back together. The small tight-knit community let me do that.

I climbed from the undergraduate institution to a graduate program in History the nearby public university. Once again I got a taste for that wider world, which I realized for the first time was a far more anonymous, lonelier than I had before. I climbed from the graduate program in History to a graduate program in Philosophy at the Dutch Christian graduate institution where I spent two years pursuing my own intellectual problems, not necessarily thinking about career options. And finally, after the graduate degree in philosophy and an aimless 10 months spent at home on the farm slopping hogs and milking cows, I climbed into a PhD program in Humanities at McGill University in Montreal, QC. I got a taste of that wider world again. The taste was slightly more sour than it had been before. But I was hopeful. I was doing something with myself.

On every rung of this educational ladder, I found myself thrown together people of all different backgrounds, and the higher I climbed, the more diverse was the group of people. This was convenient. Educational institutions drew people together for one reason or another, and you met people in the process. No pressure to do so; it just sort of happened.

I met people in classes and in the library, in my capacity as teaching assistant and later as instructor. I met people at a coffee shop down the road from the Faculty of Religious Studies at the corner of Milton and Parc, where I could be regularly be found reading, smoking, talking, etc. I met my wife there—or she saw me, and then “encouraged” me to introduce myself to her, which I did.

The final couple of years at McGill saw me take a step back from all these opportunities for social interaction to focus on reading, research, and writing. It’s what graduate students did, so no red flags were raised. Plus my wife and I were busy exploring the city, new love, and new possibilities.

Dissatisfied with dead-end jobs after she finished her undergraduate degree, S. buckled down and passed the LSAT. About the same time, I came to realize I had lost the mental focus to complete my PhD program. The option to follow S. to Washington, D.C. and take some time to figure out exactly what had gone wrong made implicit sense at the time. I made that final, fateful step off the top rung of the educational ladder and stepped out into wide open air.

I still didn’t see it as a problem, because I was with S.

4.

The story I must tell about church differs from the one I tell about school. In the Dutch immigrant community that raised me, church, (extended) family, and school formed a compact, three-legged social stool. I was born to sitting atop this stool. The newspaper, magazine, books, television, and radio put me in touch with a wider world. I was never prevented from accessing informational material. I was encouraged to absorb as much as possible with frequent trips to the local library. But the world of my immediate experience was circumscribed by the stool.

Until the age of 19 the convictions of the immigrant community who came from Holland during the starving years after WWII meant very little to me. This is really not all that surprising. The intellectual ethos a person imbibes, unless that it speaks to the heart, is ever an alien form imposed on an ambivalent or rebellious matter. This was my situation through most of high school. I recall, having come from the Dutch Christian elementary school, repeating an argument against the existence of God on the basis of the existence of moral evil in human life. If the loving God is all-powerful, how is it possible that evil exists? Ergo the loving God is either not all-powerful or he does not exist. Point to the atheists.

Indeed, I had absorbed most of the stories in the Bible and could recall some downright obscure details from memory. But I had absorbed the stories as information, not as occasions for a matured, moral self-reflection. I did not steal, not because I had a firm idea of myself as someone who did right by his fellows, but because I was scared of being caught. I did not lie for similar reason: doing so made me feel uncomfortable with myself. I did not commit adultery, I suppose, because I was scared of girls (and I have to think that I was unlikely to be successful committing this particular sin). But how did Absalom die? Or where was Moses buried? (And who buried him?) Or what did Tamar ask of her father-in-law Judah?  (And why?) I had those answers down cold

Then, a year after my head injury, having seen and been seen my numerous specialists and other persons concerned about my well-being, finding myself out of immediate danger, I found myself once more alone with my introverted self, feeling profoundly empty. I had what at the time I would have described as a conversion experience. In retrospect, I will say that for the first time I reached inside of myself to find the moral resources to take ownership of myself. At one point S. commented that the intense poignancy of the experience was probably a consequence of the head injury or part of the recovery process. I think she meant to say that I was loopy. That’s fair and true, to a point. It doesn’t discredit my subjective experience of being “led” to take ownership of myself by the circumstances of my situation. What I reached for was the thing that was already mine, though only in a superficial sense: my parent’s faith.

I am too distant from the event to be able to convey the particulars of the experience. What I have is a generic sense best expressed in a novel I have read, re-read, pondered, and re-pondered every couple of years. Walter M. Miller’s *A Canticle for Leibowitz* begins with a young novice in the desert on a Lenten fast searching his heart for evidence of a vocation with the monastic order: “a clean parchment of the spirit whereon the words of a summons might be written in his solitude—if that other Immensurable Loneliness which was God stretched forth Its hand to touch his only tiny human loneliness and to mark his vocation there.” The anthropomorphic language in the quotations misses what is true about quotation, or at least what is true for me, so it’s best not to be distracted by it. The immensity of existence, which hitherto presented itself as impassive, unmoving, and utterly detached, seemed to “wake up” take an interest in me. Either that or I “woke up” and took an interest in it.

The trouble with this sort of “waking” is that its “object” is absolutely incommensurate with everything else. So it was natural I went looking for a much more mundane language in which to dress up the experience in order to make sense of it. My parent’s faith had a solution to the problem of incommensurability: divine incarnation. It also had a more than 2500-year old tradition of text and commentary reflecting on the problem and told a story about the Incommensurate willingly submitting itself to the horrors and indignities suffered by a people it called its own. That story spoke to me. It made sense what emotion distress I was feeling, and it dignified my introversion. The curious result of internalizing this narrative was that I found it very easy to sympathize with most other people, even people I had never met before. It became almost second nature to imagine myself in their shoes.

Something else happened too: the loneliness borne of my introversion became almost comfortable.

Unlike the young novice in the desert on a Lenten fast, I didn’t “receive” a vocation; I went looking for one. I went looking for a vocation knowing that I might not find one, but nonetheless believing that the search itself was valuable. But church attendance became more and more difficult as I climbed the educational ladder higher. I didn’t see this at first. I think I chalked it up to a sort of lay-about laziness. Who wants to drag themselves out of bed on Sunday morning? Not me. But I noticed in the churches either attended or tried out a much more assertive conservative politics and/or had a strange attachment to bowdlerized biblical interpretations like six-day creationism or pre-millennial dispensationalism than I was able to comfortably ignore. Bed looked more and more attractive as the months and years passed by.

The handful of attempts I made to find a church during my PhD program in Montreal met with uniform failure of precisely this sort. A pastor or an elder saw that I was a new face. They learned I was a PhD student attending McGill. Then they took it upon themselves to challenge me on this or that pet point of biblical interpretation or critique of secular society. I grew frustrated and despised them for it. Not wanting to do so, I didn’t return; and, in a fairly short order, I stopped looking.

It was around this time I met S. Life became much easier; decisions, more obvious. When I ran into difficulties completing the PhD program, the decision to follow S. to Washington, D.C. where she attended law school was almost a foregone conclusion.

I tried a couple of churches in the first year we spent in D.C. The experience was much worse than in Canada. The American version of Evangelicalism caused such feelings of revulsion that I was happy to content myself with my own thoughts. Recognizing that I found a certain intellectual satisfaction in my parent’s faith, S. encouraged it as a quasi-academic pursuit.

Which is where things remained until S. discovered that things were not well in our little world.

I want to differentiate between the cause of something and an occasion for something. For example, if a building burns down, the cause of its having burned down will be found in whatever or whoever started the fire. However, if a student learns a solution to a mathematical problem, the teacher is an occasion for the student having learned the solution, not the cause. The student is the cause for themselves having learned the solution. The teacher merely provides the opportunity and the material for the student to reflect upon.

This, as I conceive of it, is the lot of intelligent beings like ourselves, who are neither inanimate, merely nor passive to external stimuli. So, when I say that S. is not the cause of all my misery and woe, I mean exactly that. I am not an innocent bystander who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Allow me to elaborate. When S. announced we were done with physical intimacy, I lacked the emotional resources to deal with myself in this suddenly altered state of affairs. That’s obvious in retrospect, even if it wasn’t at the time. I had allowed my social world to narrow down and focus on a single person. The consequence was that I was unable to see S. was also in a state of emotional distress. All I saw was a unilateral move to change the nature of our marriage…for some unknown reason. Had I done something wrong? Was she unhappy with marriage? Was she seeing somebody else? My mind reeled at the possibilities. How did I misunderstand or misconstrue things so badly?

The only certainty I had in the moment was that if she said no, that meant no, and there was very little I could do about it. We might talk it out, but the harder I pushed on the issue, the more likely it was that I would disrespect her or disrespect myself. Which meant I had to accept things *fiat accompli* as they now stood.

FUUUUUCK

For a couple of months, as I mentioned before, I switched hard into “caring husband” mode, trying and more often than not failing to get to the bottom things. It was at this point that S. thought to bring up the fact that my social world had narrowed down to a single person: her. That was a problem, not just for her, but much more for me. It wasn’t fair to her, but I was also depriving myself of a needed outlet outside the home.

I had to get out.

Have I mentioned I am introvert? I may present well-enough in a groups, there is a non-zero chance I am accumulating small emotional bruises, which in time will add up to a need to withdrawal somewhere private to find an emotional footing. Tiny things like questions that pop up in my head and ask whether I handled that situation right over and over again.

I still had to get out.

Church is a natural fit in these circumstances. As I explained it to S., who won’t go to church and has no feel for the religion things, church was a place to go without any explicit intention of meeting people, but you would still meet people. Much like an office environment, where you go to work, but you end up meeting people and making friends in the process.

So I returned to church after 15 years of being away, comforted by the prospect of once more being alone in a crowd. I met people. I had conversations. Things that I had tucked away in my head once more were allowed out into the open air. Nothing especially deep or profound, you understand; but it was familiar.

That’s it for now. I am not sure how this story ends, whether it ends well or poorly. The story is true, or true enough for me. As I tap this line out on the keyboard, the narrative arrives at the present moment.

I can report, since returning to church, loneliness has become ever so slightly more comfortable.

This shit is still fucked up, though."

As a teen I was sexually abused and ostracized by my church peers because of it. I entered my career field at a young age and never went too college. I felt lonely in my late teens and early twenties as I watched everyone having social lives while I worked long hours. I lived along for four years because I didn’t have anyone close enough with me to be a roommate. And now in my mid twenties I’m married and my husband’s young brother lives with us, and I’m STILL lonely. I’m sitting in bed right now surrounded by my five cats and one of my dogs and I’m sobbing. I don’t know what’s missing from my life exactly. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for years, and I don’t know how to fix it. Therapy, meds, and lifestyle adjustments haven’t been enough. I’m just so tired of feeling alone."

I have to admit it hurts, although much less than it did last year (it really hit me hard last year, having concrete proof of how little people actually care). I have never been remotely popular, but since i finished college and came back to this horrible hometown of mine, things have been going downhill ever since. Times like these really make me miss college. I actually would go out and be with people on my birthday. Not dozens of people, but they meant a lot to me and it was all that i needed. Has anyone else here been through this kind of situation? If so, how did you cope, how did you get past it? As much as i would like to be optimistic, i can't help but fear how things will look like in 10 or 15 years... If they are already at this stage when i'm 24. Also, sorry for the long post.

Anyways, about three weeks ago I had reached out to a guy I liked and he gave mixed signals and ignored me. I sent screenshots to her and without getting all convoluted I'll just say she basically ignored me and showed that she didn't give a damn. Even though I had told her I was truly hurting. It was a bit of a trivial moment but she had been showing her true colors lately so I sent ""why do you literally care so little about me? Next time you need emotional support talk to someone else."" Almost a month later and the jerk has straight up cut me off because of that. We used to text like every other day and now nothing at all. I am completely done because it's clear as day in this situation that all I did was set boundaries and she still took offense and is trying to hurt me. I'm having the urge to text her, I want to be done with her but I know how hard it is to make friends when you don't have any.... This is just a rant but any advice or comforting words from anyone going through the same situation?

lonely,I have no one to talk to after breakup,"I have no one to talk to after breakup - Hi,

I just wanted to share and maybe ask for advice.

I'm a very introverted female that's almost 30. A few days ago I got dumped by my BF of 7 years - with no fight, no reason given, nothing I noticed indicating it would happen - he basically just told me it's over and walked out of my life and it all lasted 1 minute during which I was so shocked I didnt get to say anything or to say goodbye. Just like that.

We met in college and all of our friends were mutual friends - so I either lost them now or can't really talk to them about it or about him. Can't even go out with them because I will surely have moments of feeling awful and crying and I don't want them to think badly about me or about him. My family really liked the guy and always told me he seems to be crazy in love with me  (and I thought so too, even at the day the breakup happened...) and they will tell me it's my fault and that there must be a reason and I surely had done something awful that made it happen. They blamed me before for him not talking about marriage with me after so many years. I don't feel like I did something awful... Sure - there must be a reason for the breakup to happen, it even might be my fault in some way, we both had our good and bad moments, but I'll never know now. And I keep thinking about what I might have done wrong to cause it.

The thing is I'm a total weeping mess right now. Can't sleep, can't eat, can't focus on my work so had to take my time off (which is ironic because I planned to use it for our holidays next month, won't happen now). Havent really left my house. But the worst thing in it all is I have no one to support me or talk to about it. I never felt so alone in my life...  How do I get up from this?"

But that doesn't stop me from being lonely. 

I feel like the problem is inside me. I feel lonely despite them being there. I could literally call the right now but I don't. Not because I don't want to. I can't. Idk why. I'm afraid of being annoying, even though I now it's no problem for them. 

I'm probably sound like a complete ungrateful idiot, I'm sorry for that. I know many of you would like to have friends. I have them and feel still lonely."

We hang out a lot and talk a lot then stuff, so it's not like I was some secret admirer, I thought that I had some realistic shot even if it's small. So anyways,  I heard that the guy rejected her (strangely enough, the girl claims that the guy likes someone else which isn't true). I confirmed this with her friend and the guy. The guy told me he rejected her for a relationship because he thinks they won't be together. Her friends then told me that it's worth a shot to ask her to prom even though at this point I'm sure it's already gone. By this point I was already devastated twice.

Later, the guy told me that he had already agreed to go to prom with the girl. So oh well, life sucks. Guess what? Just yesterday, the guy posted on his instagram that he asked the girl out (it's staged.). There was a video and stuff, and a photo. I literally wanted to just off myself. It was too much to bear. To see that happening. I was already defeated, but this just keeps getting worse. I don't even know why I keep crying. ""it's just a girl"" but yeah, you don't know what it's like. It hurts so much. No words can describe my pain. To see that happening. Btw, I'm not going to prom. I can't stand it.

I started to distance myself from the girl more and more, and I even rebuff her advances to talk to me (given we're friends). I just want to forget her, but I can't, because I still like her. The worst part is that one of her friends who hates me keeps gloating about it in front of me and keeps talking about it. Goddamnit. WHYYYYYY."

The worst part about this was that sometimes some important news regarding exams or courses would be given but they wouldn't tell me, which always led me to hear about it after literally everyone, but when it was the other way around, when I told them J would look at me with complete disinterest, like I'm bothering or something, but when I didn't say anything, Y would always give me a moral lesson on what friends are meant to do, that I should tell him about those news, while I'd be looking at him with total disbelief hearing his audacity and hypocrisy.

What hit me the most was when J literally starting hitting on the girl that he knew I was crushing on for nearly two years, he'd basically see me talk to her and just put himself in the conversation which always ended up with them two flirting with each other and I'd simply go home without anyone noticing, with Y being completely aware of it but supporting him in his actions and telling me to forget about her, that it's no big deal, etc..., and two weeks ago Y came up to me while I was talking with a classmate, inserted himself in the convo and after 10 minutes he happily and jokingly informed me that J and her are now dating, like I even gave a crap anymore...

So yeah after some time I moved on from her and started talking with another girl about 4 months ago who J was talking to regularly a year prior but got bored for whatever reason, guess what ? she still was crushing on him, told Y about it and he didn't give a crap, his reaction indirectly gave ""you're not enough, he's better than you"" vibes.

At that point I already started distancing myself a lot, obviously J couldn't care less, and Y told me 5 months before that everyone tried to communicate and reconnect with me again but I was too childish because I distanced myself and so everyone gave up on me, when in reality, when I needed people who were my ""friends"" the most and Y especially, they all disappeared, while J even made jokes and mocked me.

 I'm not even mad anymore, and although they say hi like nothing ever happened they just feel like complete strangers to me now, I completely cut them off, and that's for the better even if I'm all alone because I feel good about it."

Also before any of you give that generic ass ""GeT a HoBbY"" or ""Go To The GyM"" type advice go fuck yourself I'm tired of fucking hearing it. When I actually tried the results were the exact same as they are now with me having given up on ever finding it. I keep begging the universe to kill me in my sleep every night but nothing happens. I just want to fucking die already so I can be free from this hell"

lonely,Alone. My whole life.,"Alone. My whole life. - I know a post on Reddit won't gonna explain shit but I'll give it a try. 
Me and my twin brother live together in college. 
I haven't got a lot of friends, nevermind best mate pal sort of friend. What I have is a twin brother who I stay 99% precent of the time. Basically, I lived my whole life with him. It's not the best experience. I don't get enough time for myself. Think of when a moment from your life when you wanted to do something, you just wanted to do it because you wanted to, and you had the talk to your parent about it or your partner. That's how my life feels, ALL. THE. TIME.
And it's not like you have eachother support or something else because in our relationship, it's kinda cringe to talk about this things. And it's almost impossible to start doing it now cuz it's weird. 
Back to the point. As an individual, I feel like I haven't developed at all. All of my friends are his friends. An example: 
I started talking with a girl 7-8 months ago. He didn't knew about this for 80% of the time. He eventually found out. I don't know how but he did.  I thought I alone made a connection with that girl, just me. No. The next time I see her, my brother gets involved and talks to her like he knows her for an year. It's frustrating as hell."

I can't find people I don't know where to go they usually drifted to me before and now all I find is people wanting me for money. I'm so lonely I don't just want a friend I want a partner to prove that I'm worth something someone to see me when I can't see myself why is that such an impossible ask out of life

I don’t mind living alone, expecting not text messages or whatever. 

The thing that makes me truly sad is when I find something so funny or so interesting, my first thought is ; “ I have to share it with someone “ and then it hits me like a rock in the face, « bruh you have no one to truly share this with ». 

That’s pretty tough I hate when it happens, I really become self conscious about my condition but it’s only with this particular context so I’m truly wondering if I’m okay being alone like that, or not..

lonely,(18m) I'm terrified of making friends,"(18m) I'm terrified of making friends - Hey I'm Connor, I'm not sure where to start this but here we go. Quarantine really messed me up mentally, I wasn't exactly a social butterfly but I had a  decent handful of friends that I thought actually liked me. But then the Quarantine hit and I was kinda forced to complete the last 2 and a half years of high school online because of my mother's immune deficiency. Shortly after Quarantine started, like during the summer, all of my ""friends"" stopped talking to me because I just wasn't around them anymore, I tried reaching out multiple times but it always led to nothing but stale conversations. Now 2 years later of pretty much only being around my family (we don't really have a good relationship either) and my partner who is also more of a social shut-in like me, I'm terrified to build relationships with people. I feel like I can't communicate properly to anyone and I always mess up speaking, I'm just not used to it anymore like I was. I have many interests that I wish I had people to talk to about but I feel like I have to shut everything away out of fear of rejection or even repulsion towards me, I know my thoughts are irrational but they still effect me mentally to the point I'm afraid to even make basic conversation with a cashier at a store. Does anyone have any advice to help me get through this, or even if you just want to chat feel free, I'm just sick of feeling like this"
lonely,Tired of being alone,"Tired of being alone - I know I’m not the only one who makes mistakes and regrets them, the whole world does. I make so many to the point it’s really just a joke. I used to feel better when people told me things like “I’m sure everything will get better”, “one day you’ll find that person “ or “don’t worry it’s gonna be ok” or just like things along those lines (for some reason my minds gone blank). Anyway, I’m just so sick, of hearing these things over and over again. 

I’ve been waiting for that day to come, and people say “oh you’re so young you have so much time ahead of you” but I don’t know if I want to wait that long. Being lonely and being alone seem like two totally different things to me. Sone people WANT the solitude, but it’s only because there are so many people around them, they’ll never get tired of peace and quiet if it’s gonna be like that. People like me however, don’t want to be alone.

I used to be one of those people, enjoying the time by myself but now it’s getting extremely lonely with only my thoughts to keep me company. I have family, I have a few friends sort of, but why is it that I always end up alone. “I’m sure more people will like you”, “I would want to hang out with you” then why don’t you? I mean, stop trying to be nice if you don’t mean it.

I’m just sick of it, I’ve had enough. If I really am a good person and am deserving then where is my share? It’s ridiculous that I’m still alone. I try, yet no one seems to want to be there. And some of my real friends go to different schools. Even then, it wouldn’t be fair to them to always have to rely on them to keep me from falling off the edge of my own consciousness.

Most people are oblivious and naive, these are those same people that say these things because they aren’t the ones having to go through it all. Why can’t I just have more propel around me? More people who genuinely care? I don’t want to be one of those back up friends for them when everyone has left them, I just want to have a real friend. Someone who actually cares."

It’s very disheartening to think a lot of women think this about “all men.”  I can’t help but think maybe it’s their choice in men.  Hopefully without sounding like a incel, to me it seems women say they want a “nice guy” but then continue to date jerks.  

It just seems women say they want to dare a certain type of guy, but then don’t talk to the type of guy they say they want."

lonely,I don’t want to be alive any more.,"I don’t want to be alive any more. - It’s nothing new. I’ve had severe depression even before I knew what depression was. I grew up by isolated with little social interaction as a child outside of school. 

Once my dad left my family all I had was my mom and my sister growing up but once we got separate  rooms I would stay in my room morning till night over the summer ( we weren’t allowed outside by ourselves, which meant we never went outside) and watch tv never moving from in front of it. It made be feel numb. It made me feel nothing . And I liked it that way. 

I discovered porn around 13 years old and would watch it incessantly. I would watch it ones again to feel nothing but also to mentally put myself I. Those peoples shoes as someone who was attractive as wanted and desired when all I’ve ever felt, even now was invisible. Doing that plus being ashamed coming from a Christian background I began to mentally berated myself. Hate myself. Would even avoid mirrors  at one point as I thought I was hideous and grotesque to even look at. 

And I was so severely depressed and anxious in school I wouldn’t even talk when people would ask me my name. I made one friend in middle school and we are still friends now but I think we wouldn’t be friends if I had a backbone back then because she didn’t treat me well at all back then. I am fiercely loyal to my own detriment, but looking back I think it’s because I didn’t want to be alone that I took so much crap from others. 

I came out of my shell more in high school. Even had a boyfriend for half of senior year , the summer, and in the first semester of college. But my depression and anxiety made me feel unlovable. I loved him as much as a teenager could and I thought he would be the one I’d marry. I had no interest in dating. All those tv sitcoms like boy meets world gave me unrealistic views of the world. I though your first love was your last love. But no he broke my heart and treated me like I was nobody, like how I always felt and my depression got worse.

I went to college, sabotaged that because of the severe anxiety of being around more people than I was use to  and being on my own for the first time in my life made me so anxious I would come home every weekend to be with my boyfriend. The only one that could make me feel better at the time 

I dropped out my first semester got a job but would whole myself up in my room on my free time feeling more like a failure than ever before. 

I joined the army late in life as a means to get out as I was slowly but surly losing what little friend I had. I wanted to know I could have some stability when everything else in my life fell apart. 


Fast forward now and everything has fallen apart. My depression is at its highest and I can’t go on."

People only come to me when they need something for me, and I will be gladly help them and be there for them. Then once they don't need me anymore, they leave me alone and it makes me feel like a shit and I feel so pathetic.

lonely,Watching movies and tv alone,"Watching movies and tv alone - One of my favorite things to do is going to the movies or watching Netflix in bed.

Now alone, I just miss those times so much."
lonely,The corrosive nature of loneliness,"The corrosive nature of loneliness - I’m really struck by the ongoing corrosive nature of loneliness.  Bit by bit it robs one of joy and perspective.  I’m “older”, and I took a buyout from my employer of nearly 30 years to move to a different city to be with the love of my life.  To make a long story short, she’s been diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer (an ultimately terminal condition) as well as as the beginnings of rheumatoid arthritis.  This plague of illness that she’s confronting is really just “hollowing” me out emotionally &amp; physically. I go through the motions of daily life, and endeavor to be as strong &amp; supportive if her as I can be… but it’s all a facade. Bit by bit, day by day, there’s less joy and hope.  Physical intimacy has crumbled away because of her health. I’m still working, which at least keeps me occupied during a workday… but once work’s done I’m left with an ever-widening chasm of hopelessness &amp; loss. She really “gets” me - which compounds the pain. Can’t see a way forward after she’s gone."

lonely,Why do people like to pretend to be interested?,"Why do people like to pretend to be interested? - I'm just sick of trying to establish a relationship now. I hate having to work up the confidence and effort in a relationship only for the person to not even try or at least let me know they're not interested. In the end, I'm the one always left broken and looking stupid while the other continues with their day. 

Like if you don't like me then straight up say ""I'm not interested"" and let me off rather than giving me false hope in nothing. That way I can at least know I tried and I can move on with at least knowing rather then being left in the dark only to recieve the news later. 


As why I'm ranting, I just recently got a phone number from a girl I thought was really sweet, beautiful, and overall a good person. So here I go, making myself look like an idiot and try to talk to her and try to put effort into getting to know her thinking I was doing alright, only to lead to again failure. When I tried talking to her, she genuinely seemed happy to talk and was overall kind. So when I told her she had a nice smile as a compliment to her without expecting much in return then to just compliment her, I was alright with leaving empty handed and just move on. Then she makes the daring move to offer her phone number which I felt so much joy and excitement from the offer, which I did take. 

Anyways, next day I try to text her with no response which I thought was reasonable. Next day I try again with again no luck. I wait another two days without trying then finally I try one more time today but this time to be more daring and decide to call her. However when I did, I was greeted to a slightly annoyed and confused person on the other end (which is reasonable since I've been texting to their number like two or three times already). I obviously tell them I have the wrong number and I hang up. That was when I realized she gave me a fake number to me. She could have left me alone or just ignored me but no, she wanted to rub salt in the wond by giving me false hope in giving me  a fake number only to be made an idiot as a result. I don't understand why she did that but I feel like absolute shit and overall feel like I've lost hope in just finding a relationship. I feel like an ugly person with no chance of being with anyone special. I think after this incident, I just confirmed my fear. I think I'm just not going to even bother anymore. I'm sick of trying only to be ghosted or made a fool in the process. In a way, I've lost hope in people and just lost confidence in myself as a result. 

Anyways that's my rant/situation. I give up. I'm done. No more opening up to people like that anymore."
lonely,i waited,"i waited - and waited and waited, but he never came

year after year of looking for him and waiting till the right moment finally appears, and still nothing, just the same old feeling of emptiness in my chest and dread in my head

at this point just being awake feels like a complete nightmare, and i wish i was just exaggerating but it feels like that, like no matter what i do, its always hopeless, like someone just grabbed you by the ankle when you were so close to getting what you've always wanted and wont let you go, sometimes more and more hands grab you, sometimes its just one, but they never let go, and you cant do anything about it

but i still tried, still talked to new people, tried to be friendly, did all that stuff, just tried and put myself out there and waited like everyone else's said, and even so, still nothing, after years and years, i still have no one to show, i still cant say that someone actually, truly loves me

i hate feeling like this, i hate not being good enought for anyone, i hate waking up everymorning not knowing if today i'll finally be happy again or i'll just kill myself, i dont feel like i want to try anymore..."

It feels like I'm the only person in the world. Like I'm so alone. I KNOW that I'm not. But knowing, and feeling are two different things. I wish I felt like I had a place in this world. I wish I didn't feel like I do now. So worthless. Replaceable. Like there's really no reason for me to be here. Ever since losing my ex, a new sense of loneliness came to me. I felt truly loved and wanted with him. Like I had a place here. Like I had purpose. I had something to look forward to everyday. Now I do have the good days, but also have those bad days as well. It's quite difficult. And I wish it wasn't. But hey that's life right? I just want to feel alright for once. Like I did when I was younger. What happened? To that little girl who always had a smile on her face and was ready for anything the day had in store. Nothing could hold her down. Dampen her light. Burst her bubble.

lonely,What moves you away from suicide? Asking because i cant help.,"What moves you away from suicide? Asking because i cant help. - 

foremost i know internet is not a safe haven and people will judge you no matter what all are you passin through, but i can't help.
iam so lonely, i intensely wish if there someone who i can say this all, could just make me happy. but by fate, i have'nt anyone.

lookin at my story, it was yeah, kinda normal middle class stuffs. born poor, grew up poor.. everything i have experienced back in my life was poverty
and my family was always broke. so it would be pretty evident for you that i haen'nt any privileges growing up like going for a amazing vacation, pretty clothes etc...
still tho my parents had hope in us( i have 3 siblings, glad i remembered it now lol) and admitted us into an english medium school(thats how you call it in India/ great pride if you're in one).
about my parents, mom is an homemaker and dad is in abroad. all the money they saved was thrown into our education. guess their decision was'nt bad eventhough, atleast i can write in english right?( i believe).
and then i just passed my high schools with a good grade(yeah ngl) , got admitted into an engineering college( what did you think an indian boy would choose otherwise lol).sophomore was not good enough, made some freinds ... and all of a sudden this pandemic got us and just had to move to home.

this part of my life; this part is called *happyness

yeah, that sentence is a minimum, i was so happy. i fell in love with this girl (not mentioning her name becuase i still love her , but i wont get here from this day( 4th may|her wedding)),
i was so happy that days( god! i'm gonna cry) , we talked like 6 hours a day(for 3 years,can you imagine?). we shared everything. we were new into these relationship scenarios we havent dated anyone before. we loved each other unconditionally. i had never made her felt desperated, and she did always mention shes so happy safe with me.
i dont know i felt so in love, i couldnt even survive a more than 4-5 hours without her. i just needed to know where is she and is she safe(please dont think im toxic, i've never demanded anything from her, i just request and she would inform me where she is). we were so cute each other , we even cried each other. i play with her, ask if shes fine always and she also does the same to me. i dont know if y'all believe this but we had only 3 real dates during these 3 years(1 for 1 lol).
but we didnt need that cos we were transparent to each other and knew everything bout each other.

new season of my life:
i dont know how to say this, iam gonna shed tears if i try to explain what i've been through, what all previously happened. in a contrary, in all of a sudden her father fixed her marriage on may 4th(for those who wonder, i just knew about this a month ago(april i guess)). i was in utter pain, didnt know what to do. already mentioned i dont have much freinds, so i just thought myself and decided to call her father.hands were shakin, my heart was just gonna rip out of my ribcage when he took the phone and say hello. that was the most heaviest hello i've ever heard. but i need to save my relation right. i just put up some nerves and responed.
we talked and i somehow said things to hime( i mentioned iam her boyfreind, but in a subtle manner). he didnt agree and threatened me he would meet my parents.i didnt afraid, bc all i had in my mind was her.
he cut the call, but after sometime just called me back and said shes crying bc of you. i have to speak with your parents about this.
and..
i knew he wouldnt agree bc she was so rich and iam, pathetically poor. who would marry his girl into a poor home. so he became mean to me and said this is'nt gonna happen. i was so broken, thought this world is gonna end now( atleast mine).


i dont know if i could complete this, maybe this is why because nobody wants to hear me. im so sad rn, hey internet people: this is my story so far.

ps: last week i got a notice about my 25k college fee due( aapproximately 300$), if i paid it in a month, i would not get mu graduation. asked many for help, tried to lend. no one helped. asked in my home, my mom just literally cried, how i could even ask her again.
if i cant pay that fee, i wont be graduated this year. so it means , i would have to go a daily wage income for a year and can get graduated in the next year( only i've 25k and i'm alive to expereience that all). i dont know if anyone gonna help me.just watch everything i had in my life drowning away. some often i think about suicide, i know its terrible but i cant help. please god!.

So I've started to really like a girl in my class.

By really like I mean as in I constantly think about her, as in I wrote her a poem, as in I made a drawing of her... stuff like that.

As I said in the title, I'm a loaner: never had any real friends, I don't like talking to people so I usually don't unless I really have to, I've never liked any girl in any way and no girl ever liked me.

I don't like this feeling. Except on a few occasions I haven't talked to her at all. There's a long story, well I think it's long anyway so I won't tell it here.

My social skills are almost inexistent, I have extreme social anxiety, and I become weird or stupid around pretty girls (this one in particular, others... not as much but still).

A friend I could climb mountains with 

A friend that trusts me and I trust them so much we literally think alike

A friend which id give my god damn life for and he’d (hopefully) do the same.

A friend I could grab a beer with .

A friend which I could participate in a joint mission with risk (which enhances trust) in which brings both of us great fulfillment and strengthens our friendship in great and deep levels.

A friend to play with the dog with.

God bless this friend, if he’s in my future, I hope you come soon 😭.

lonely,i've ruined my friendships because of my ignorance,"i've ruined my friendships because of my ignorance - I'm a young male, still in High School, i'm, admittedly, a little stupid too. Almost 4 years ago I meet a very important person on Discord. She was around the same age as me and because of her I was introduced to so many other people that meant so much to me. I had never been in a friend group like this or have so many people care about me before. Over the years I never planned to be apart of a relationship with this individual. My feelings said otherwise. At the time I had already come out of a pretty important and admittedly short relationship with someone. So she and I started a dynamic. She previously stated that she was ""love sick"" because she herself have never been in a relationship, and I happened to have a lot of traits that she liked. We started the whole thing in roughly early October of 2021. It meant everything to me. I realized that this was the woman I loved. She was irreplaceable. We had ups and downs but we both appeared to enjoy each other's company a lot. My infatuation with her got in my way with being a good person. I focused so much of my energy on her and that dynamic that I feel like I just became a worse person because of it. Mind you she's extremely important to a lot of others that I used to consider my friends as well. It was in mid March that she put an end of the dynamic. At first I tried to be mature about it and just simply move on. That's what would of happened if I wasn't so codependent on her affection to help me. I felt alone again and it tore me apart. I let it get in the way of my mood and I constantly brought it up in conversations just between the two of us as some stupid and unknowing way of guilt tripping. One night she just had enough. And left me. Alone. The next day she said she just needed a break from me but that doesn't feel like the case anymore. I last spoke to her back on April 1st and she just seemed so angry at me and didn't appear to want any sort of friendship back. She only went with the whole dynamic as a way of helping me cope because she knew how much it hurt me. It was nothing more to her than that. I haven't spoken to her, or anyone else in that friend group since then. I've fucked up so badly and I just want to fix it. I cant go a single day without thinking about it and i've isolated myself from so many things that I used to enjoy. I let my infatuation with her get in my way so now i'm further away from her as I was even close to them. I cant cope
with it. I just can't."

I excused myself properly and she told me to just forget about and that she doesnt wanna talk rn but its kind that i excused myself this way.

The thing is, she hasnt been responding. She just leaves me on read so i told her to text me when she wants to talk and meanwhile i'll leave her alone.

I just dont know what is gonna happen. She is the best friend i've ever had and i regret so much what i said to her. I dont know what i'll do if i lose her.

Plus im not that close to my other friends or at least not to the same extent and i dont have an SO..."
lonely,it's 4am and I'm having an existential crisis.,"it's 4am and I'm having an existential crisis. - Seems like every time I somehow manage to get someone to like me they end up losing interest in a matter of weeks, if not days. I've often wondered if it's because I can be overbearing but after trying my best not to be I don't think that's the case anymore.

Maybe I over share and that scares people away. Maybe I have an off-putting personality. Maybe I don't have many, if any, future prospects and they can tell from a mile away that a future with me isn't realistic.

It's really easy for me to simply blame my appearance but I see a lot of ugly people in happy relationships.

I've come to the conclusion that I'm repellent to people because of who I am as a person. A depressed, desperate, fat loner with no future. I really think I should just throw in the towel and stop bothering people as its just making things even worse than if I had just continued to isolate myself."

lonely,Lonely but wanted,"Lonely but wanted - I’ve been in and out of depression for the past year. And since I’ve blocked my ex I’ve just been feeling lonelier than ever. I have followers on social media, fans on sites that want to date me but I’m still just lonely. I’m a naturally introverted person, it’s like when you look a certain way people just expect you to be a certain way. But I’m just in and out of depression, feeling anxious every day I wake up and just trying to not feel so alone. Sometimes I just want to pick someone and settle so I won’t be alone but I’m not that kind of person and I don’t think I’d be truly happy like that anyway, and I’m just not connected with anyone irl, nearly all of my friends have backstabbed me to the point that I just don’t want to even try to care about someone anymore. I get a little jealous too when I see people that treat other people like shit but are married with an amazing partner and have friends that love and support them, it just makes me wonder why do bad people get good things? I guess I’m just venting.."
lonely,What’s your story?,"What’s your story? - Hello to those of you reading this post. I am curious, what’s your story? For me it started in 2020, my graduation year of high school. We were supposed to go back to school in April but the rest of the year ended being online. I had social media and was consistently on it, checking content every minute of the day, texting people, posting random things on my spam account where I considered people who were my ""close friends"" who followed it can only see. It was just overall very silly and fun for me back then. Then one day I decided, what if I just deleted all my socials. 

Reason was is I wanted to do more in my life than just stare at my phone and pick up a hobby or two. Not to mention, it can help with mental health and with college starting a couple of months I wanted to focus more on school. So I did it. All my socials were gone. I thought my ""friends"" were going to reach out to me since they had my phone number. Days, weeks, months passed by and nothing. People who I thought were my friends, who saw my spam posts of me venting, ranting, my personal stuff, never did reach out to me. 

Well I did have one friend who stayed with me and of course I am happy but devastated. So many people who I talked to school, have their contacts, never bothered to reach out to me. Especially this one person who I knew practically my whole life. I am a person who reaches out first but I stopped doing that now. Eventually I came to accept that people come and go, while some decide to stay. Once I overcame that I became happy and spent most of my days alone. 

Then Fall 2021 rolled around and that would be my first time going to live on campus, since I did remote online for a year. I was anxious but excited because that means I can finally become social in the way of face to face. Turns out I have lost all my social skills and developed pretty bad anxiety due to not leaving home. My only friend goes to the same school as me and they have a pretty hard time telling how I feel since I don't talk much. I haven't made any friends either this whole year. So it hasn't been well if I'm going to be honest haha. Me and my roommate are on pretty great terms but now we drifted apart. It's to the point where I see her when she comes back from her friend group late at night. Like an hour before bed but I naturally become distant when stuff like this happens so we don't even talk. Even if they talk to me I just nod my head, give non-vocal responses, or just say one word things. It's just a thing that's been with me ever since I was a kid when I haven't had any socialization in a while.

So as of now, I spend my days in my dorm all alone, doing my schoolwork, watching my shows, listening to music to entertain me, check my plants. Stuff to keep me busy at least. Sometimes it get's pretty bad that I don't talk for hours and until I make a sound or say something, I surprise myself haha. 

But now, knowing that this semester is almost over with a couple of weeks left, I can go home. Where I can hangout with my siblings as have fun and be myself around them. That's the only thing that's pushing me during finals season. I know it's probably way too positive of me but I look for the good in my future. I'm hopeful that I can find people who want to be with me and if not, it gives me more time to learn more about myself. It's also okay to feel bad just as long as you don't give up is what I tell myself. 

So that's my story on how I'm lonely. It hope it doesn't bother you with how cheesy it is at the end haha. Thank you for reading this far and take care! (°▽°)/"
lonely,Wish I was someone's priority just for once,Wish I was someone's priority just for once - All my life I've been people's go-to person when it comes to venting or seeking advice. That friend everyone says understands them best. But nobody ever treats me like a genuine friend beyond that. Someone to be around for the sake of being around. A priority. And once I stop acting like their emotional sponge they're gone without even a second thought. It's soul-crushing. It's like I'm not even a person.
lonely,Nothing,"Nothing - I feel nothing but a persistent angst. It’s like the worst apathy known to man. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I’ve only interacted with my parents and my brother. None of them understand me. It’s like I live with acquaintances. I spend all my days in the repetitive cycle of going to school, coming home and going straight to my bed. I’m cursed with a brain in overdrive, it never stops. The existential dread. Will I be alone for the rest of my life? Will I be able to provide for myself in the future? I have an immutable fixation with the idea of death and its inevitability. Though I’m not sure what lies beyond death, but whatever there may be, if anything at all, is incomprehensible. Could there be eternal suffering waiting for me? I can’t comprehend non existence and it scares me. Meanwhile, here in reality, I’m lost. I have zero self esteem and am insanely socially anxious. I have zero friends. It’s like I’m already dead. I know I could never do it, despite being backed into a corner. I look to the world and see nothing but greed, nonchalance, irrational thought, cruelty, and bloodshed. If there is a creator, why?"
lonely,"Unattractive, unlikeable, or just unlucky?","Unattractive, unlikeable, or just unlucky? - I’m () about to graduate high school and it’s really weighing on me that I’ve never been in a relationship. I have wonderful friends whom I love very much but I guess they don’t fill the gap I want filled? I know I should be grateful that I have a good support system and that my situation could be worse and I’m still young and I’ll find somebody someday but it gets harder and harder to keep my head up every time I get rejected by a boy. I’ve had SEVEN “not looking for a relationship right now”s in a row and I know my logical course of action should be to spend time with my friends before I go out of state for school instead of searching for someone who can hold and kiss me and won’t be in my life for very long but it hurts, you know? I genuinely don’t where I stand when it comes to desirability so it’s very hard for me to gauge what I’m doing wrong, if I’m aiming out of my league, or if I’m just unpleasant. Sorry for the rant."

I don't enjoy smoking weed, it makes me super parnoid. I do drink a bit but I just don't like drinking alcohol, and im starting to do bodybuilding, which alcohol tends to hinder. I find myself spending most my time working out, working on school or my part-time job, or playing games alone. I have started to just stare at a blank screen after losing games, and have this feeling of emptiness. Maybe it's just the lack of a sense purpose in my life, but I just feel empty and numb. I have a girlfriend and she has been one of my only real friends as of late, but she is her own person and naturally can't be around all of the time.  every once in a while the feeling is overwhealming not to the point where I would kill myself, but to the point the thought of an end to it all is pleasing, soothing, maybe even erotic in a way. I don't know what to call this feeling, or even what exactly it's coming from, all I can do is just guess. so I was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar and could share their thoughts and experience."

And I try to make conversations and sometimes they're ok but that's really it. I'm surrounded be other people but I just couldn't feel more alone.

lonely,32F. I'm stuck in the hospital. Does anyone want to talk on the phone.,"32F. I'm stuck in the hospital. Does anyone want to talk on the phone. - I'm 32, female, from Texas. I'm in the hospital again. :(
I have an aneurysm and have severe head pain and they're worried it might rupture. I'm alone at the hospital and well, lonely. 

Here is what I look like:
https://imgur.com/a/NBXMaIL

Was hoping to find a male to talk to on the phone or something to pass my time. 

About me: I read a lot. JG Ballard, Thomas Pynchon, Bret Easton Ellis and stuff like that. My favorite book is Infinite Jest or Crash. 

I really like, idk what to call it, indie music maybe? 
Elliott Smith is my favorite musician, followed closely by Conor Oberst/Bright Eyes. I also love Wilco, Tom Waits, The Shins, Elvis Costello and stuff like that. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for mid 2000's emo as well. I know the words to every Fall Out Boy song, that's not a brag really, more of a confession. Lmao. 

I used to write about film and television for a living and am heavily opinionated on this matter. My favorite film is Punch-Drunk Love, not because I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan or anything, my love is more for Paul Thomas Anderson and the film speaks to me in some way. Other films I love include: A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Royal Tenenbaums, Escape from New York, The Warriors, A Cure for Wellness, Ghost World, Alien and Aliens, Naked Lunch, Dead Ringers, Flatliners, The Machinist, I could probably go on forever with this list. 
I am not really into anything Marvel or many super hero movies or shows. I love comics and have about 150 long boxes full of them. My favorite superhero is The Flash, but I can't stand the TV show, minus Tom Cavanagh, yeah, he's hot. Haha. 

I am sorry I'm rambling so much. I'm on a lot of medication and bored and trying to fill my time in some way more meaningful than watching hospital television. 

If you want to chat message me and maybe we can chat on the phone to fill some time?"
lonely,"Is there one or multiple factors, personality traits/flaws that can determine if someone will be FA?","Is there one or multiple factors, personality traits/flaws that can determine if someone will be FA? - I wonder what we are all missing. I don't believe the looks argument. Yes, if you're good-looking, you're highly privileged, and life will generally be easier, but that doesn't guarantee 100% success. Plus, I see unattractive/ordinary people in relationships all the time. The majority of western populations are obese, which doesn't seem to heed their success in achieving a relationship.

It's so bizarre. A lot of the people on this sub work hard. Much harder than your average person but are still very much unsuccessful. Is it some personality flaw we all share? Just a general inability to connect with other humans at a deeper level?

I feel like we're all our own version of the loneliest whale—the whale with a call that cannot be recognized, leading to a life of solitude."

I try to make friends but it never get past small talk and never really find much in common with other women. I don't like shopping or talking about golf or the latest iPhone or the blause that has to match my nail color. I have 2 horses so I spent all my free time with them and just tal to them. I ride western and where I live they all do dressage so that makes it where even at the barn I can't really make friends.
I don't even have childhood friends since my parents did not allowed it. I never get phone calls nor birthdays or Christmas and new years wishes for people.

I've never had a sig. other and probably never will so I want to ask what is love? I know it's more than an emotion. It's a feeling. I wish I could feel it but the few times I thought I felt it, it was just one way feelings so that's not love, but unrequited wanting someone that didn't want me. I wish I could feel love. I wish I could love someone and they love me. That still hurts even after I gave up. I see people in public who love each other. I see on certain Reddit boards people who love each other. I'm surrounded by love but I will never have it. It requires someone loving me. Love must be the greatest thing ever. I'm sure I will get lectured about loving myself or devoting my entire life to being better, but I'm past that. Since I'm a lonely, pathetic, piece of crap who is so damaged, even if someone does tell me they like me, I will assume the worst. I just wish one time, just one time I could feel love. Romantic love, not the love you have for a family member or anything similar. I hate myself for being unworthy of love. That will get me lectured to as well. Well, you need to think better of myself. No, I don't think I will. Do any of you know about love coming from a lonely guy who has never had someone who loved him?"

I accepted I’m just not attractive &amp; hoping for a car accident or something to end my life. - I’m feel desperate. I’m a 28 years old woman who has never dated or kissed or even asked out.
I was cursed with an undesirable body. I have a prepubescent body. No curves. I’m talking seriously. No curves at all. I don’t need a bra. I haven’t any boobs. It’s literally a flat chest. Narrow hips. I’m all narrow. All narrow. Thin curveless thighs &amp; legs. I don’t look like a real woman. I look like a boy.

After those years I gave up on finding someone who genuinely finds me attractive.

I’ve been bullied my entire life. Even nowadays I get terrible comments from people about my weird figure.

No men notice my existence.

I’m an invisible woman."

lonely,when should I accept I'm no one's type,"when should I accept I'm no one's type - I just turned 25 in Jan. And I can count on one hand the amount of dates I've been on. Always first dates, never seconds. 

I consider myself pansexual because I'm open to dating anyone, regardless of gender. I have very little dating hang ups, and I'm not expecting or wanting a perfect person. Just someone I have something in common with, share the same humor with, and who wants to build a future together. I don't have a physical type, but attraction is important, but I have a wide range of what I find attractive. 

I work hard, have a good job (optometrist), my own place (condo), have interesting hobbies (art, music - writing, instruments, performing, soccer - forward, dancing - salsa &amp; swing), cooking/baking) just to name a few. 

I truly feel like I'm no one's type though because no one stick around. Constant ghosting, being left on read, no matches, rejection in person, etc. I push myself to be out of my comfort zone because I am an introvert. My hobbies are what get me out of the house and office.  

But I've never found anyone who wants anything long lasting with me. I think I'm just not attractive enough or tall enough or something... Everyone around me is beautiful and they have no issues finding people who want to be with them. But when it comes to me? *Crickets*

I've asked all my best friends why they think this is, and they always say they don't know...they always say cliches ""One day it'll happen for you"" or ""it'll be worth the wait"" 
But idk, I don't think it'll happen for me. No one looks at me like ""damn, I want to be with him 😍"" but that happens for everyone else I know.. it's isolating because my friends don't understand what it's like. 

I feel like I did something terrible in a past life and I'm being punished in this life by being invisible romantically to everyone. 

I think I'm at the point where I'm just not going to try anymore. Just give up and accept that I'm no one's type, and I'll end up alone..."

She dropped out last year and left me alone at school, nobody ever talked to me. I signed up for online classes so I would’ve have to be so sad there. 

I feel like a loser. No friends, bf left me, and I don’t even have good grades. Nobody cares about me, my best friend never checks up on me. She’s too busy posting on social media, gettin high, gettin drunk, and having fun. I’m envious of her looks, her life, everything. 

I was starving myself for my ex (stupid I know). Now that he’s gone, I’m just starving alone. I literally hate myself because of that asshole, but i love him still. I’m so desperate for friends. I just want someone to care :,| I’m so alone, I just want to melt into my mattress."
lonely,Disabled and Conflicted (31 F),"Disabled and Conflicted (31 F) - I am lonely, but because of my degenerative health issues I’m very limited in what I can do and my flare ups are unpredictable, so in the past when I have made plans it can be very tricky to keep them. 

I don’t feel like it’s fair to date and I feel so guilty when I call my friends/ family to catch up and can’t tell them any positive health news when they ask. I try to stay positive and better myself through PT and pursuing a full diagnosis, but I feel like being in contact with me is such a burden. Honestly, sometimes I avoid people because it’s so emotionally and physically draining to keep up a healthyish face, so people see me as a person am not a health condition. 

I really just wish I could talk to someone and not worry about being “too much”.

I've distanced myself from my friends and family.  I have no lover. I feel very lonely. I am unable to reach out to someone for help.  Negative thoughts have taken a toll on my mental health. I constantly hear a voice that tells me to kill myself or that I'm worthless, good for nothing. And I am starting to believe that. I'm unemployed while all my friends are living a good life with a good job. I do feel worthless.  I get anxiety attacks now and then and little things like planning for something small makes me anxious and I end of procrastinating it. I feel really stupid. Interviews makes me anxious. And if an interview goes bad I just keep criticizing myself over and over again. Nights are the toughest. That's when the negative thoughts are at their peak. It's just getting difficult and I feel that killing myself might be my best option now but I don't wanna die. I'm afraid if I'll ever be happy but I still wanna live.

lonely,Love is almost nonexistent,"Love is almost nonexistent - Real, uncynical love, motivated only by desire to connect with another, untouched by narcissism or power games, does exist, but its rarity is almost impossible to overstate and anyone who is sincerely seeking it will find it purely as a matter of luck.

Because it is no longer socially acceptable to physically speak to people you don't already know, I finally decided I would put genuine effort into some dating app profiles. Got a few matches. One doesn't respond for three days and then with a very apathetic low-effort answer. Another doesn't respond. A third responds, exchanges two messages, then ""thank you for your time."" I hardly think anything of the first two but the final is just depressing. Not only was she uninterested, this person (who listed ""Mental Health Awareness"" as one of her passions) first had to match with me solely in order to dismiss me with a flick of the wrist. The casual and flippant cruelty exhibited by these people allegedly looking for human warmth is breathtaking. 

People are not human beings on these apps. They are objects worth only the amusement they can provide the other user. I've known for years these apps are demeaning and degrading wastes of time, especially if you are an average-looking man, and I cannot believe I deluded myself into thinking it could be otherwise. I will never attempt to find someone via those channels ever again. 

Because these loveless profit-based apps are now the only socially acceptable way to meet someone, this effectively means that the doors of love (such as ""love"" is when everyone treats fellow human beings who are only looking for companionship with such disregard) are closed to me. As an introverted man who is not especially confident or outgoing, I will never be loved or accepted for what I am. I have the option to play a character who is confident and outgoing, and then, if I'm lucky, someone might grow to love that character (not me). But actual, uncynical love, from someone who accepts that I'm not the most confident in social situations, is unattainable for me. And I am not allowed to express these thoughts to anyone other than anonymous strangers or a therapist who demands 22% of my income to tell me that I need to learn to be happy alone."
lonely,"Met this guy online, blocked him because I panicked. I made a mistake and I don’t know what to do.","Met this guy online, blocked him because I panicked. I made a mistake and I don’t know what to do. - So. I met this guy, let’s call him J. He’s 18 and I’m 16 but at the beginning of our conversations I told him I was also 18 just in case he was lying. I didn’t think we’d get this far. Anyway he thinks I’m applying for college and other educational pursuits similar to that. We’ve been talking for weeks and I’ve gotten to know him really well. When he asked me more about what it’s like at college for me I panicked and blocked him because I couldn’t answer his questions. That was 3 days ago. I know what I did was unfair to him, but at the same time its not even that much of an age gap. Is what I did justifiable? I related to him so much, I know what he looks like, what his music taste is, shows he likes, his family, things he feels but can’t tell anyone else. We confide in each other, and now I feel really lonely. I miss him even though our friendship was only around a few months long. Did I make a mistake? This isn’t the first time I’ve panicked and thrown everything away. No, not romantically, he just felt like a real friend after many years of feeling so alone. The sort of loneliness even when the room is full? I have friends and people close to me I guess, but I’m always emotionally unavailable and I don’t usually make an effort to go that extra way with them, because the always care about material things and how they look rather than just wanting to talk about how things really are. And now we’ve grown apart, I’d rather be alone than with them because it sometimes feels like no one really understands me. But, J did and now I’ve lost that… I don’t know what to do, this isn’t just about ruining a friendship, it’s also about how I’ve just never truly felt so fucking alone. I guess this is more of a rant at the same time, but I just want someone to talk to, to relate to, to be good with me, and me them."

lonely,Single and Lonely,"Single and Lonely - So I’m 25, with a bachelors degree, and have been single for about 5 years now. I have mastered self love. I take myself out on dates all the time, movies, theme parks, travel, dinner, brunch, you name it. I spend my free time trying to better myself, I’m financially independent of my parents. Support my friends in their endeavors and make new friends often. 

I am ready for serious relationship. Family connections and friendships are great but Those aren’t fulfilling that romantic void in my life. 

I’m tired of hearing “oh it will come when you least expect it, continue loving yourself and you will attract that special person, put yourself out there more” 

I am on dating apps, I am always out and about dressed cute, I work remote so I try to work often in coffee shops etc. And I’m just convinced now I may be destined to be alone forever. I know that’s dramatic but it’s just how I feel.

I’ve dated different men for a series of a few months here and there but nothing ever blossoming into a true, committed, long term relationship where we can fall in love and see each other in our futures. 

Im sure no one has advice and I understand that. But I just need to vent a little because I get tired of hearing the same things from both men I’ve dated and friends and family that root for me. “You are so great, beautiful, smart, any man will be lucky to have you” okay? then why are zero knocking down my door and why are zero dudes also not stepping up to the plate when they, themselves, are the ones that see me in that “ any guy would be lucky to have you” light? 

I don’t want to think I’m giving out that sense of desperation I try to keep things cool and coy when meeting new men and I don’t ever try to rush them into something like exclusivity. Sigh. Don’t know what else to do other than doing what I’m already doing."

Although I'm way moved on and I never think about him anymore, every once in a blue moon he'll appear in my dreams? In the dream he likes me back, and honestly I feel so amazing in the dream? Like an odd sense of fullfillment. But then I wake up and feel so pathetic and embarrassed. I can't believe that's still a desire I have, even if it is subconscious.

lonely,Somebody fuckin talked to me,"Somebody fuckin talked to me - Super cute girl in my chem class actually fuckin talked to me. I don’t get it.

Me and my lab partner were prepping for our lab final, just in public near a public computer. She walked up and asked for help with doing hers. And that was fucking terrifying, I can barely keep my shit together with my lab partner. I was psyched up and ready to do stuff with him cuz we scheduled it ahead of time, so it wasn’t as bad. But then she shows up, and I’m at first flustered cuz she’s cute, but then I’m just freaking tf out in my head cuz this is a new person I’ve never talked to, and if I’m gonna help her then I have to put forth ideas that might be wrong and might embarrass me. I know I looked like a fuckin beaten puppy, I just hope I didn’t do anything stupid aside from being an anxious pos.

But yeah, that I chalked up to my lab partner. He’s confident and personable, and he’s helped people before. The thought didn’t even really cross my mind that I was what she wanted to talk to, I was just an impediment. But today, I was waiting on another class, and she and her partner happened to be working on their prep outside the room I was waiting on. And she walked over and asked for help again. My lab partner wasn’t there, I was just alone and listening to music trying to pretend I didn’t notice they were there, but she still asked for my help. So it wasn’t just my lab partner. I guess it could still be that I was just the best option they had, not that I was a good option. But this girl is pretty bold about asking questions in class, and she’s asked plenty of stuff to the professor after class. I’m sure she could’ve asked him.

Idk. I’m confused. I’m not good at this, I just pretend to be. Why would she ask for my help? She’s smarter than me, I’m sure, and her lab partner is, too. Is it possible they really could actually use my help? It seems ridiculous. But the only alternative is that she *wanted* my help, which seems even more ridiculous. As bad as I am at school, I’m so, **SO** much worse at life and being social.

I guess with either option, I should feel a boost to my self-esteem. Either I’m academically valuable to her, or I’m socially valuable. But I just feel more self-hatred, mainly cuz of how much I wish I could be socially valuable to her. And especially because I have a crush on her now. I hate myself so much for that. I don’t deserve to even imagine that she might care about me, I’m just a worthless failure of a person. She’s super cute and has actual aspirations, I’m trash that’s just here cuz I don’t know where else to be. Not only do I feel I’m not worthy to even imagine such a situation, I feel gross for it. I’m sure if she knew I wished for that, she’d be disgusted. Declarations of affection are only compliments when they come from attractive lips, they’re insults if someone like me speaks them. They don’t make the person feel happy and warm and fuzzy, they make the person feel gross and exposed and sick.

And I feel that bad just for having these fucking feelings. I don’t want to feel like this, I want to be able to just see this as either her normally having a question, or normally wanting to be friendly. But instead, my fucked up head can’t stop wishing that it was some romantic gesture. I *know* it’s not, I’d have to be clinically insane to genuinely think that asking for help on a problem is romantic. But it still *feels* like it is, because my stupid love-starved mind is so desperate that it lunges at scraps.

I’m so mad. If I was someone else, if I was someone *better*, I could’ve offered her my number in case she needed more help, or I could’ve asked more social questions and participated in small tap that indicated that I enjoyed her company instead of only focusing on the problem. But no, no, what I did was look like a mouse in the claws of a cat, stick perfectly to the problem, and dart away as soon as I could. The best I managed was to squeak “good luck tomorrow” on my way out. Fucking idiot.

Why couldn’t I just have a normal fucking mind?"

lonely,I can’t fix these problems anymore,"I can’t fix these problems anymore - I lashed out at a friend again. I felt hurt and abandoned yet again as they and a small ‘clique’ of other people in my online gaming community went off to do their own adventure together. 

The 4 of them went off and there was room for a 5th person and instead of asking me or anyone in the larger community-group to come along, they found some random person instead. It sounds insignificant when I write it out, but it’s a continuous pattern of this friend only involving their ‘clique’ and no one else, unless it’s convenient for them.

I told him off because it feels like me and everyone else outside of this clique are just on the sidelines, and they rarely involve other people outside of their group. Because I know that if the roles were reversed, I wouldn’t think twice about trying to get a friend in for that 5th spot. But this friend didn’t, nor did any of the other 3 in the clique.

What hurts a lot is that it makes me think ‘Why am I not good enough?’ I could be a great friend. But they don’t try to involve me. They don’t talk to me. They talk to each other so how do you even get a foot in the door? 

It’s like I’m trying to prove I’m not a horrible person, astonishingly, and they don’t even give me an opener to try.

But, I lashed out again (not the first time) and told this friend it feels terrible to be looking in from the outside and see them have fun without me.

A day or so later, I apologised. They’ve not said anything in reply yet. I don’t regret what I said because it’s the truth and it’s how I’ve felt for the past several months. But I do regret lashing out.

I just want them to be friends with me like I want to be friends with them. I don’t think that will ever happen given that I’ve yet again kicked the hornets nest. And I don’t know how to fix things anymore because they don’t seem to care about me that much."

Anything, but it's never enough to end it all...feels like soon but it never comes. So I must like it, being this way. Hatreds cool it's just not enough to kill myself over. Id never get away with it and in any case I'll never willingly forfeit my life. So it really is a curse to live, my hatred just grows...that's all I am living hatred...nothing will ever be enough. The answer doesn't exist...I wouldn't be satisfied..and bc I hate all I can think of is death. That's right, there's no use. This is just it"

lonely,One night stand,"One night stand - I lost my virginity a few days ago in a one night stand. I had a great time and I really cherish the experience, but really wish I could do it with her again. I left her my phone number when I left in the morning and she hasn't called or texted me. 

I randomly saw her again at a bar and she didn't really want to talk... She came up to me twice and said hi and touched my shoulder but when I tried to talk to her she would always be in a rush to get away to her friends. I didn't even have a chance to tell her how amazing our night was.

I found her on Facebook and I sent her a friend request but she hasn't accepted it.

I don't understand why she is doing this. I thought we both had a good time and in my opinion we have unfinished business. I wanted that night to be the start of something more but instead I am home alone just thinking about her. It feels like such a waste. We would be a great couple."
lonely,I dont have any friends at all.,"I dont have any friends at all. - I had a close friend only once, then after I found out that I'm not actually her best friend as well, I didn't considered her as my befriend anymore. Since then, I've been totally alone. This year even my normal friends either moved to other cities cuz of the university, or moved to other countries for living, or just became junky drug addicts.

 Now here I am, absolutely no one to talk with, no one to go out with, nothing.
Every once in a while I remember the good days of when I was the guy best friend of that girl, at least in my mind, and it just makes me feel even worse.


Being an Introvert and having trust issues, I have no idea how am I supposed to find new friends. 

After this recent holiday where I live, I felt really good, tried to push back this depression, been more active, went out more often alone, but it just doesn't work, the black dog came back to me tonight and Im writing this in total darkness of my mind.

lonely,Friendless,"Friendless - (25M for those who may wonder.) 

Hi. As the title may make it obvious, I pretty much have no friends. I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone but I went to a different school growing up and the people who live here now are nothing like me (A lot of people do drugs here pretty much as a way to fit in and socialise and I am not into that at all). I do have an amazing gf which I live with but I cannot help but feel the need for my own friends like she has, I have always been quite quiet and I do suffer from anxiety so making friends hasn't been easy. I have always kind of described myself as a social chameleon, I can fit in anywhere but I will inevitably usually fade into the background. I do like the idea of having friends from other places around the world and at the risk of sounding rude I wouldn't mind not feeling the pressure of having to meet up in person a lot due to my anxiety as this can be kinda stressful for me at times. 

I do enjoy playing games and I have been part of a few Discord servers in my time but they always seem to have already established friend-groups within the server so it deters me from trying sometimes as I feel like I'm just butting in..

Basically I am wondering if anyone else relates and has any words of wisdom to an outsider like me or would like to chat or play some games together, anything would be appreciated! Thanks for taking time out to read this if you have, hope y'all have a nice day/night wherever you are. :)"

Do these people prioritize anyone else at all or they just don't prioritise people? Or should i just grow up and not care much about people?

The kind of person who actually makes people happy and makes their lives better by just existing. The kind of person who people miss and notice when she's not there.

Until one day I told him how I felt and I’ve accidentally have told him I loved him, he never gvae me a response back to it, but after telling him everything he told me that he was sorry for “leading me on” and that he’s not ready to deal with my “package” (my son). What hurts me is that I’ve been spending times with him and I’ve fallen for him, just so he could tell me that? What should I do? I don’t want to cut it off but i’m not happy with what we are.

lonely,What does it mean to be alone? Philosophical (no) reflections.,"What does it mean to be alone? Philosophical (no) reflections. - In this post, I'm a little lazy to think about writing, so Google Translator will do it. He always helps me, but here he translates 100%

You can't call me lonely, except for those who stay at home forever. Since I play games I have a few internet acquaintances, it's hard to call them friends. I had someone to throw memes, sometimes I even had a lot of communication (for me it's 3-5 people with whom you can correspond almost every day). And when I lost that opportunity, people left me for a variety of reasons. I began to feel the same ""loneliness."" So I still have a good friend and a couple of cool internet ""friends"". But there are no more messages ""Good morning"", ""How are you? What happened, what are you not writing?"". And here I think: Am I sick because I'm alone? No, it's not true? Because I have no one to confront? I have someone to talk to, 5 more chats in the Telegram on various topics. Because most of the time I sit at home I read, listen or play something. I don't communicate much in reality, but I chose it myself.

Is that why I'm lonely? No, probably but I feel something like that. Does anyone have such feelings? While writing this he came up with an interesting idea for writing a mini-work. I write a little prose, but most likely I will not teach here because I write in Ukrainian, Google translator I doubt that I can handle this"

The person I love will never return my feelings, just like the time before and the time before that. I don't deserve to be beaten this hard, no one does. Why does something that for most people is obvious, look so unreal and unreachable to me? And I swear I tried, again and again, but pain leaves a mark. Those who succeeded on first attempts, will never understand. After every failure, it gets harder and harder, darker and darker."

I don’t want to give up finding someone to love but it’s really hard when the past 4 people I have been romantically involved with/ sleeping with have ghosted me and never checked up on me again. Thought dating guys was my mistake, met a girl off hinge last week and we slept together (I’m a girl and was my first time with another girl). She seemed really into it and we texted a couple times after that but it’s been 4 days since I last texted and nothing… I know it was only new and we barely know each other but the constant rejection just hurts so much. I feel like giving up because I feel stupid for thinking that anyone would actually like me and care about me.

TLDR: can’t decide if the possibility of finding love is worth the pain of constant rejection and being ghosted by people I thought I had something special with."

I miss him. All I do is cry when I should be doing something about it."
lonely,I’m stuck in a constant cycle of loneliness and pushing people away and I don’t know what to do about it,"I’m stuck in a constant cycle of loneliness and pushing people away and I don’t know what to do about it - The only saving grace here is that it gets shorter each time. Used to be I’d sink almost a year with a person before reaching the point where I had to cut them off, now I don’t make it past a couple weeks. I told the most recent person I’d been talking to online that it was best if she stopped messaging me today. I know it was the smartest thing for both of us, I thought about it a lot, but it doesn’t stop me from getting that feeling of regret, knowing that once I’ve said something like that I’ve turned it all dramatic and I can’t go back and change my mind because of that. 

I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I don’t have anyone in my life at all, never had friends, only member of my family I liked is dead and I don’t talk to the rest of them, I can’t have relationships because of my issues, so obviously I get lonely and when that gets really bad I cave in and let someone talk to me about shit. But I don’t know why I don’t learn, I’ve gone through this same loop so many times and it always plays out the same way.

Logically, there’s just no circumstance where it can work out. I can’t be lighthearted or carefree and take it as it comes at all anymore, it feels like an act so the longer I try to just be a “normal” person making jokes and having “fun” conversations, the more drained I feel talking to that person, so I avoid them. And it also feels like that’s not who I am anymore, so I’m betraying my personality and who I want to be by acting like that.

So I the only things I can talk about without feeling like I’m faking something is the serious shit that pertains to my traumatic history and mental issues. But I don’t want to talk about that stuff with anyone because it makes me uncomfortable and it always leaves me feeling alone and misunderstood even when they “get it”, so I’d rather just say nothing at all. So I know there’s nothing I can talk about without feeling drained or worse about everything, but I can’t think of any way to combat the loneliness than by trying to talk to people, knowing full well it’s fucked as soon as I open my mouth.

Just feels like I can’t win. I’m either stuck being alone and feeling lonely, or stuck going through this same cycle, having it turn out the exact same way every single time and somehow never fucking learning my lesson. It’s just so draining trying to maintain this type of shit, it’s a constant stressor and I do feel relieved once I get to drop people and don’t have to deal with navigating it anymore, but I also just end up feeling more and more nihilistic each time because it’s just more evidence on the pile that this shit doesn’t get better, and that despite the years of therapy and countless medications or whatever, that it’s an issue that only gets worse as time goes on and I have to push more and more people away and cut them off."
lonely,Ten year older men reaching out,"Ten year older men reaching out - For context I'm 20F, I know fully well that men can be lonely too and want friendship but I found a site for local people to seek friendship and most people that have contacted me have been men who are closer to age of 30. 

I'm a lonely person and I know loneliness that men experience isn't talked about enough etc but I'm bit scared that some of them aren't contacting me because they want friendship. Some woman also on the site pointed out what would I even have in common with people who are 10 years older than me... and while I do think people can have friends who are older &amp; have things in common, I haven't been a adult for a long time so I don't really know how friendships work outside the school setting.

Not to mention I already know some people aren't interested in me because of what kind of person I'm, so I feel like I should be careful when interacting with these people. 

So what do you guys think? Am I being just sexist or is there a reason to be worried?"

My family was not ok with me dating someone and they turned their backs on me and refused to have any contact with me. This person I was with ended up to be an abusive manipulative person who told me constantly that he enjoyed hurting me. I attempted to come back home but was locked out of the house with my belongings put in the garbage. I never reached out for help as I was abandoned by those who were supposed to love me. I’m trying to be ok but each day it is a constant battle. I just feel so alone on this planet.
lonely,It’s different for men,"It’s different for men - First, I have a lot of close friends. But as a man. You walk through emotional lows alone. You don’t get that shoulder to cry on when your heart is broken. The advice is always the same let’s go have a beer you just need to find someone else. The standard responses are the only ones you get.  No one really wants to hear how truly devastated you are, or how you cry yourself to sleep knowing you weren’t enough no matter what you tried.  If your an emotional hurricane inside you don’t have anyone to ride out the storm with.  It’s a sign of weakness to feel that down and not be able to just pick yourself up. And if you don’t have that special someone in your life or kids to take care of every day becomes a repeat of the last. But you just put a fake smile on your face and say “I’m good” or “alright” or “ok” when people ask how you are because they don’t really want to know."
lonely,Been a rough few weeks 18M,"Been a rough few weeks 18M - So I've been talking to this girl for a few months and I began to have a crush on her. Then one day she tells me that she had a crush on me and you don't understand how happy I got. I'm not exactly the best looking guy out there and this was the first time anything like this was happening to me. So after she told me I told her how I felt and the next day we got together. Everything was going well I did everything I could possibly do and after  one week she started messaging me and it was off I could tell. She then messages me later on that night that she doesn't love me anymore and loves her ex. Then gets with her ex... this hurt me so badly. Everyone just uses me and I can't do anything about it. For so long I blamed myself for pushing her away but I didn't do anything wrong. Gave her all the attention, gave her all my love and for what for her to get back with her ex. This happened 3 weeks ago but still hurts me. I just can't trust anyone again. She pulled me out of lonely life and does this to me. She was my best friend, my everything and I just don't know what to do it hurts so much."

I have no friends, and no I’m not exaggerating lol, I really have no friends. I’m gay which makes it even harder to find friends because every guy thinks I wanna fuck him, when really I just wanna hangout and have fun with someone. I’m not trying to make a sob story, I’m just telling it how it is. There’s no sugarcoating my shitty ass life lol. I just don’t understand why life is like this, like this is miserable.

No heat on my body in my cold empty bed. Nothing.

It feels like I tunnel I can’t get out off, like it just has no end. And being gay in my situation is already struggle enough. Not even a friend can be this person, because that implies having friends who care.

I just want to feel something again…"
lonely,What's the point of living?,"What's the point of living? - What's the point of living 
If all you do is grieving?
You wake up in the morning
And all you do is mourning 
You go to sleep at night
Without no hope in sight
You read facebook and think
""God, my life must stink!""
You try to find a listening ear
But all you get is rejection and fear
So all you can do is wonder
Is it really worth the bother?
There must be a better place
Where there is no greed and no race
Somewhere you can find some peace
Without worrying about your lease
A place you can just close your eyes
And never deal with scams and lies
No diseases,traffic or money
Just the joy of milk and honey
I really want to get there soon
I hope it's not as far as the moon
I dont want too much pain involved
But once I get there - PROBLEM SOLVED!"
lonely,The weird vibe I got was right,"The weird vibe I got was right - Historically I have not had close friends. Acquaintances, yes. Friends, no.

I have had a friend group over the last two years with 3 other people. Talk every day, hang out a few times a month, two of them have come and stayed at my house for a week each, all was good.

Except I had this vibe that I was the pack mule of the group. They liked me if I was being funny or being useful, but that there was something fake going on.

And I was right. And I’m kind of totally heartbroken. A B and C were on a trip with me, I had to run an errand and asked them when and where to meet them for dinner. Told me to go to D’s house. When I got there, he was pissed I was there, told me I wasn’t invited but he supposed I could stay.

Come to find out, the second they told me to go to D’s they turned around and went to dinner without me. Changed the group chat name to some inside joke from dinner. Showed up to D’s, wouldn’t even look at me, talking about what a great time they had. 

They are now gaslighting me, telling me I’m overreacting by cutting them out. It’s pathetic and sad, and as much as I don’t want them in my life anymore, it’s so hard having nobody to share my day with."
lonely,Love Life Struggle,"Love Life Struggle - A little bit about myself, i’m a 25M virgin, no love life and i live on a resort type island. I suck at going out and all I typically do is go to work, go home, watch some porn and just pass out. Rinse and repeat. 

It’s quite peaceful to be honest, living on my own but recently something in me is just screaming. I’ve never had a love life, just some makeout seasions here and there but nothing further. No one but family saying they love me and it kinda hurts. My heart aches each time I see a happy couple or a family. The place where I live is very limited to what you can do to socialize and most people are tourists anyway so nothing ever lasts. 

I dont think ill ever be in love or rather fill the void thats in my heart currently. I think im just so used to being on my own my entire life that im incapable of loving. I truly think im going to die alone, the reason being a lot of people saying im too complacent. I think the frustration is really getting to me and i just cant take it anymore.

lonely,Diagnosing the Roots of Modern Alienation,"Diagnosing the Roots of Modern Alienation - It wasn't always like this. There weren't always so many of us. Think about the old couples who've been married for decades. We wonder how they did it, and often their advice seems lost on us. Overly personal, quaint and lacking the modern perspective. We must ask ourselves collectively not if we are able to ""make it work"" (especially since so many of us can hardly seem to find someone to even begin to fail with), but are we able to we recreate the conditions that led to their happiness? 

In the past, communities were more tight knit. Depression was unheard of, if it can be believed. Of course, there was sadness, but its prolonged, often seemingly rootless modern manifestation was not. Family was more emphasized, even to the point where marriage was a family affair. I'm sure many have heard that in places in the world where arranged marriage persists, its success and happiness level is in fact not less than our divorce ridden western ""marry for love!"" landscape. Of course, the vast majority of aforementioned western old couples we know weren't arranged. But they were also more engaged in real life, something which probably is a boomeresque eyeroller to many readers, but there was actually more life worth living before we all collectively retreated into the media which has surged in recent times, be it on a computer or television screen. 

Indeed, this sub and all of social media in fact is merely a surrogate community. Ironically the internet's promise of connection has alienated us further, by tempting us with the promise of curating our communities only to have them not measure up to a physical one. People had to interact with neighbors, among other real life community members, before the web. Maybe they were annoying but out of necessity, people compromised with each other. Neither felt they were the main character with a Flanders or Dinkleberg who'd be better written out. On top of this, they had a physical space in common, which probably means more than similar music taste or even sense of humor. And this meant more than just one next door neighbor, it was a whole neighborhood that saw a lot of each other and came to see the community as an organism they had a responsibility to maintain. This applied to both childrearing and being part of a local workforce. Society was a group project, not something astroturfed by corporations and a government completely unaccountable to the consent of its governed.

The media saturation peddled by said corporations also has the detriment of mental sugar rush. The upvote, the like, the retweet, and even the coom, we all live for these tiny, artificial moments of validation. Our dopamine receptors rely on the constant stimulation of both these and whatever media we binge, consoom, daily. It's very easy to see how this overexposure quickly fries the capacity for pleasure. But more specific to the loneliness aspect, the social media mediated, technologically soulless abstraction of ""the soul"" from the physical. Humans did not evolve to have our emotional needs satisfied in text. Each day someone posts on here longing for contact. But the question is: do we have the strength to kick our addiction? Must we tear it down so it is no longer a social requirement to have a smartphone?

So I return to the core question: can we be as our grandparents were? What will it take? In my view, the diagnosis is simple: ask ""what's different now?"" and compare the less lonely days of our ancestors to the situation we're in now and assess with clear eyes whether or not the progress has improved things. It's the treatment that will prove difficult. Can we allow the technological (and social) conditions to stand if they are indeed the root of our collective alienation? And if we cannot, what can we do to replace them?"

lonely,An Open Letter to Photo Boy,"An Open Letter to Photo Boy - I've liked a guy on and off for two and a half years. For all that time, I dedicated myself to the idea of him. Looking back on it now, I wish more than anything I could go back and warn my sophomore self not to fall in love with him. Because when I fall, it is not a small thing. I put my heart and soul, my time and thoughts, my hopes and reality, into the idea of a person. This is the story of the time it happened.

Dear Photo Boy:

Did you know I walked up an extra flight of stairs every day for a full year to get to class? I could ignore my aching feet after a long day, because all that pain washed away when I would pass by your class. Every time you saw me, you would smile and wave. Then I would wave back. Like clockwork. Did you know that those waves were your greatest weapon?

Dear Photo Boy:

Did you know that when we would have an assembly, I got less and less interested in the actual performances? Instead I would silently search for the aisle right in front of the stage, where you would be peeking out with your Nikon D3500 to get the best shot for the yearbook. Did you know I hate the yearbook?

Dear Photo Boy:

Did you know what you were doing when took a picture of us during our project and made it my contact photo? How about when you moved your desk next to mine in class and gave me an earbud so we could listen to music together? Did you know what you were doing when I said my hair was messy for Homecoming and you brushed it out of my face? I hate the feeling you gave me. I hate the suit you wore, and I hate the dress in the bottom of my closet that I cannot touch. Because all along I thought it meant you liked me. You never did.

Did you know what you were doing when you fell in love with my best friend?

I didn't. But I do now.

There is something about a broken heart that needs someone to blame. But who? Not my friend-- she had to keep her feelings for him a secret for months because she was afraid to hurt me. Not any of my other friends-- I couldn't open up to them, so they never even knew. And as much as I want to-- not Photo Boy. Because he never saw me as anything but a friend, and I never told him otherwise.

Dear Photo Boy:

Like I tell myself now, I no longer love you. But falling out of love is not a linear decline; it comes in waves. Like when I catch a glimpse of Her phone in class and see months of text conversation with you. Or when you ask her to slow dance at Prom and she asks me if I think you 'like her or not'. these are the moments where I feel myself slip. how DARE she ask me for crush advice with him? a year ago I was counting WAVES. Do you know what I would have done with a single text? But then again, I can't be mad. You didn't choose me. For reasons I will never know, reasons I will spend staring at the ceiling at night over, reasons I still can't understand-- you chose her. and more than anything, I want to see her happy. Because she is my *best friend,* and she is dating the boy she loves. Now my job is to let go of the past for her. But above all, for myself.

Sincerely,

A friend."

Regrets I have made.
In this lifetime my debt will not be repaid.
I just want some happiness.
Some peace on this earth.
Because I've felt misplaced.
Ever since birth."

I'm wasting the best years of my life wasting away alone in my room because I have nobody to talk to or no one. Everyone else at uni is going out every other night with all their friends and getting on with life and living it to the fullest.

I'm sat alone weeks on end without having an in person conversation with anyone i cant cope anymore its fucking soul crushing what can I even do, what's the point in living if this is what my life is going to be. What a waste of a life.

loneliness is the worst thing imaginable, just torture. I dont know what to do, sad thing is theres so many people in the same position this post will most likely get ignored."
lonely,not feeling love towards anyone,not feeling love towards anyone - anyone else have multiple bad experiences with intimate love that other kinds of love like between friends and family or just the love of life has left you? or you know you care about someone but don’t feel it inside and so you can’t express it to them in the way you like?
lonely,I used to be miserable. Now I’m just bored,"I used to be miserable. Now I’m just bored - I used to be miserable. Now that I’m on antidepressants it’s been replaced with nothing… complete emptiness… is it better? I mean, I guess. I don’t cry myself sleep anymore because well I can’t cry anymore. I still feel sadness, anxiety and a desire for some purpose in my life however. 

I feel like I tried my hardest to set up myself for success despite my flaws. But it was to no avail, I’ve simply come to learn there are flaws in my character that make unlikable. I’m not a bad person, in fact I have a lot time for people and have never intentionally went out to harm someone. I just cannot connect with people. How many times do I have to put myself out there before people stop gaslighting me and telling me I don’t try hard enough. I mean understand why they offer me the same generic advice, because it works for them. I do take care of myself. I shower every day, have a nice hair cut, nice style, go to the gym. I’m not a good looking guy but I don’t think it’s my looks holding me back it’s something deeper.

I’m just out of solutions… I can’t hold a job… hell I can’t even get past interviews these days because of my awkwardness. You read on linkedin about how “progressive” these companies are regarding neurodiversity but it’s all virtue signalling bullshit. Being awkward and behind socially is essentially a death sentence. People treat you like a murderer a creep, all because of something you can’t control.

To sum things up I’m just painfully tired and alone. I’ve felt this way my whole life… like I’m missing something… that I don’t belong. I’m entering my mid 20s and already done with life. Will I kill myself? Most likely not. But my god I do struggle to see how I can handle another 50 odd years of this living hell.

I’m not special in anyway. But I just don’t think the same as most people. Everything I’m surrounded by feels so superficial and vapid. I try reach out to people but I get ignored a lot

Instead of me doing all the work and nobody showing any interest in me as a human being why is it that I have to do all the work of chasing people should not be this hard I never was this hard years ago. But it really hurts like a knife being stabbed in your heart and twisted seeing others being happy the relationships their families and their friends and here I am with absolutely nobody and no hope feeling that hopelessness of not finding any buddy for myself to be happy for once again I don’t get it I don’t understand what is so bad about me that people can’t just try put a 50-50 effort into getting to know me and instead of me doing all the work.
lonely,"Just turned 20: Identity Crisis, Anxiety, Feeling Alone","Just turned 20: Identity Crisis, Anxiety, Feeling Alone - I need an opinion:

Growing up biracial, I always identified more with one race. Half white half mexican. My parents don't have friends, my mom is an immigrant. I am the only daughter, 10 years older than my brother. The small amount of extended family who I grew up with were all mexican and spoke spanish. But now they are very distant. I grew up in pre-dominantely hispanic San Jose. I picked up all the spanish I could, but I always felt different. I wanted to fit in somewhere so bad. My close childhood friends all moved away. My highschool friends were all mexican/hispanic. But I never let people in my life get close to me because I was insecure about being biracial and my family dynamic. I felt boring and weird, scared of being judged/rejected. During covid I got really isolated and find myself now with no friend group. My parents moved as soon as I started college so now I live alone with my grandma.. I feel sad and alone, craving connection. I have anxiety and consider myself a social introvert. I'm a weird mix between shy and outgoing, but definitely struggle with being vulnerable, communicating, and opening up. All I want is some consistent connection and to finally be able to just relax.

Any advice?"

lonely,Meant to be?,"Meant to be? - A thought that keeps popping into my head like a nasty pop up ad from the 90s is that some people are just meantto be alone. Some people are there as a prop for others and only serve as a grim reminder on how life could be different. I'm always looked over and only called upon when needed but never wanted. I don't get invited out unless I'm there to solve a problem or just out of pity from others. I feel like I'm just a side character with no life outside of work but not for a lack of trying. It feels as if I'm just there for others to point at and say ""at least you're not that lonely werido"". 

I want to change so I did. I got fit, got a hobby and good job but none of that changed the fact I have no friends and no end to this loneliness. I want to feel wanted for once. I don't even care if I'm plan B I just want to be included. I just feel that the reason why I'm still in the same spot is because it was just meant to be. If you belive in a God you can say it's in God's plan. If you belive in science it feels that I'm the prime factor. If free will is to be belive I feel I'm proof that we are constrained within our pre determined path even if that path is being alone."

I just feel so lonely all the time, heartbreakingly lonely and I don't know what to do. My boyfriend constantly tells me ""he doesn't love me"" and he's only with me because of our living situation.

 My Mother who used to show me unconditional love has pushed me away since getting re-married recently to a man who doesnt like me, my Grandma who used to be my best friend when no one else is around has severe dementia and isn't the person I know and love.

The friends that I do have will never put me first and I have to practically beg them to spend time with me, something I just don't have in me anymore. I always try to make new friends as well, go into it with a positive mindset but I somehow always get let down. I even recently got a dog hoping that would bring me something, but no, he ignores me even though I show him nothing but love all day, every day and pines after the boyfriend I live with. 

I just don't see the point in living, I feel like I'm purely existing at the moment and don't worry, I'm not suicial because I annoyingly have an instinct to carry on no matter what, but I really just wish someone would love me for who I am. I know a lot of people say this or think this, but I really do think I am a nice, kind hearted and genuine person and I have so much love to give, to just receive it back would be great."

To have someone who without me reaching out will genuinely say ""hey"" or ask ""do you want to do something or play a game?"" just before my youth is gone and I hit thirty, I've almost lost hope I'll actually get a girlfriend that I've fucked up all my chances. I don't have anyone around me who would fit the criteria of playing a game with me and still being a woman, who I connect with or feel connected to, there's just nothing or get something to be declined because of life (which is usual for me, I always have had to sacrifice for something good in life only once in a blue moon when it matters for serious things has life thrown me a bone without a sacrifice from me) so please if anyone has any magic way to fix my life or make things go just a little bit more my way for even just a few years please share"
lonely,When a girl says she lonely.,"When a girl says she lonely. - Sot there's a girl that I'm seeing now that says that she is lonely but I know that she romantically misses me for times that I'm not there.  I was just curious just by the nature when women using that word ""Lonely"" is more than 50% that they want their lover with them or is it that they wish they have more friends in being able to socialize more. I know Lonely can mean many thing to many people. So I just figured I would get general consensus from what your redditors think."

I dont feel loved and I don't think i've ever been loveable enough, im disposable and im mentally ill.

I dont see how mental illness is seen as interesting and cool but when u display the symptoms people throw u away like nothing.

I dont even get to explain myself, I guess I dont need to since im truly a bad person.

The self hatred comes from somewhere, its not being insecure its knowing myself.."

lonely,I don't exist,I don't exist - I'm so lonely and fed up of people.  No-one wants to spend time with me then they complain that I'm never around. I asked my only friend if they wanted to go see the new Dr.strange film on Saturday and instead of politely saying thanks but no thanks  they were pretty rude about it. I haven't seen them for years and really hoped to see them. This comes at a time when the only person I've ever loved has left and my depression is crushing me. I just want someone to see value and worth in me but that'll never happen so I'd rather be dead than carry on like this.

lonely,If you feel like chatting send me a message.,"If you feel like chatting send me a message. - Last time I was here, I was in a rough spot and some people from this subreddit helped me to feel less like a sack of potatoes and more like a human being, which was really nice for a change..! So I thought I'd tried to return the favour. 

I'm a 25-year-old guy from Europe. Who spent most of my time alone and at home, since I have been dealing with a mental condition for the last 5 years.
I've had a psychosis which was induced by burnout and have been diagnosed with depression a couple of times in my lifetime. I only have my personal experience regarding mental health, so I'm no medical professional of any kind. However, perhaps I can at least lend an ear to someone and listen to someone, who feels like they need it at the moment. 

Lastly I'd like to say that we can talk about anything really and don't feel pressured to introduce yourself, if you'd like to remain anonymous then I am totally cool with that. 

Thank you for reading my post, and if you'd like to chat send me a DM! Otherwise, take care!"
lonely,Not having friends makes it hard to make friends..,"Not having friends makes it hard to make friends.. - I've been broke for a long time..
And all that matters is money, so people didn't want to talk unless I was employed.
Only ask how I've been to find out if I had a job yet, and then start throwing all this talk about how expensive something and that's why they need a job.
This didn't bother me at first.. but my mental health has been declining for years, and has locked me inside myself. My brain is in a knot, and I'm not able to do simple tasks without experiencing extreme levels of frustration and anxiety.
After losing too many jobs to my mental health, I thought I'd take some time to work on myself..
But I've always had trouble finding help for myself.
I'm not neurotypical, but haven't gotten a full diagnosis.. though, therapy in my younger years suggested I get tested.
Nobody is helping me navigate this insurance system, financial system, or helping me get around much..
They just complain about how expensive it was the last time they had to deal with it, and give me absolutely no sense of direction.
But.. really, I'm not worried I cannot get a job..
I'm worried that all this loneliness and depression and drug use, and alcoholism is going to permanently leave me this way..
Lost, and a waste of everyone's time and energy..
It's going to kill me, and is very much on its way.
People make me feel like a loser, because I need my hand to be held through all of this..
And it's embarrassing because I always wanted to be a big and strong man.. I'm just not."
lonely,Almost always suicidal after therapy,Almost always suicidal after therapy - Am suicidal a lot in general but hits different after therapy. Because my therapist is a woman who gives me support and validation and is easy to talk to. But i know she would never date or want me. And that support and validation is just her job. No woman will ever want me. I'll die alone. What a sad fucked up existence. My survival instincts kick in from thinking of suicide and its been stressing me out. I just want this pain to end man. I'm tired of it. Don't write comments acting like I can change it. I have treatment resistant depression and no women ever wants me. I can't force anyone to like me. I worked on myself for years and didn't help much. I'm tired.
lonely,Yes it may be a cope; but I rather still do it,"Yes it may be a cope; but I rather still do it - Hobbies are a cope. Skills are a cope. Travelling is a cope. Making money is a cope.
Getting educated is a cope. Writing a book is a cope. Biking 100km is a cope. Knitting a sweater is a cope. Baking a 11-layer cake from scratch is a cope. 

Yes. They are all copes. But here is the thing. I rather be an educated, successful, skilled, well-off single person living the best life he could over a single person who accomplishes nothing. I want to be a single person I can be proud of. That I'd be proud to date. That I can honestly say that s/he's the one who lost out by rejecting me.

Yes it is painful and hurts. But I rather be a hurt forever single never to be loved person with accomplishments, skills, wealth, and degrees to his name than one without all that.

Then once my time is up I can ascend to heaven proud of what I have done during my short time here and enjoy eternity with my true soulmate (I like to pretend heaven is true, another fun cope)"

One person who can ask me, hey, do you want to go out tonight? If it's a girl, one person to put their arm around me and tell me they care about me. One person to hug. My life would instantly improve. The feeling of someone hugging me or touching me in general would be massive with me letting out all of the negativity that has built up over my life. It wouldn't be all one way. I would be there for them when they needed someone. All it takes is one person. If anyone asks me, you shouldn't depend on someone else for your happiness, being alone for as long as I have means I do need someone to make me feel better. Someone to make me feel less lonely and that someone in this world IRL, in person cares about me and wants to spend their free time with me. They aren't a professional only talking to me because they are paid to. This person would want to be with me because they like me. I wish I had that person. Every day I wish that person existed."

I'm doing ok right now I work nights at a grocery store and that's pretty much it right now. But that doesn't mean I dont have big aspirations and goals.anyways I grew up really fat and was the fat kid and it didn't help that I smoked weed and had a loner mentality but still ""nice"". but since I was a fat nice loner stoner I never dated girls because I was fat and no one want that so I never thought of dating. But I'm 20 now and I've lost all the weight and you dont have any obligation to believe me but I'm not ugly I would say I'm like decently attractive but I dont know what to do and I just feel alone because I'm 20 and feel like I dont get out there I might be alone forever. I've tried dating apps but I dont have the best phone camera and idk if my bio is that good because I dont get matches and I'm not saying I have any right to meet a girl but there's gotta be a way idk were to meet girls and if I did what do I say I dont wanna be weird and I feel like I have such a good heart and all I want is a long life with a family but idk how to start that. Like I've been contemplating suicide because all I do is smoke weed and stock grocerys and I feel more alone everyday but I keep telling myself no and idk I'm overthinking but I act so happy and laugh in front of people because I don't want people to feel bad for me or worry but I feel like I have to say something because I'm truly alone

When my friends had their birthday,I took care to make it somehow special. A cool gift, baked a cake or even just a heart-melting text/postcard. It wasn't much,but it came from heart. The unexpected moment of emotional investment was always worth it. It shows the other person ""hey, I took some time to make this moment a bit special, because I care about you. Just to make this little moment beautiful and maybe,maybe even forget how horrible things in the world are.""

Maybe,i am just naive and I should grow up,but i hate to see people not care about other people anymore. 
I just needed to let this out.

I'm also busy with my own life so I understand that we cant always respond straight away. But when you reach out to friends and get nothing in response, I question my own importance to them. The issue is I made some mistakes in the past which effects my friendship. Long story short me and my ex are in the same friend group and it got messy. 

I'm working on my own mental health and being assessed for bipolar. But am I an awful person for my past? Is that why I'm so lonely and people avoid me?"
lonely,"I need people, but my tolerance is low","I need people, but my tolerance is low - While in therapy, Im understanding my patience is low for others. People tell me I’m a great listener, but I’m not. Im often not present because I find people talking for long periods draining and uninteresting. If the subject isn’t about something I find interesting then I’ll get irritated. 

I have an acquaintance that vents nonstop about her life and anytime I bring up something about me , she somehow redirects it back to her. I find this is true with most of my interactions and the pattern has turned me off to socializing, yet I need to feel connected. 

I have no one in my life that ask me how I am and really listen without putting a timer on me( therapist). I’m starting to believe that’s an unrealistic dynamic but yet people say I give that to them. I used to but not anymore. I remember listening for hours as my high school friend told me about her life , asking questions and more questions, but when I realized people didn’t even care about my life …. I learned to be a fake listener. Can anyone relate to this? How do you cope ?"

lonely,Missing the electric touch and stuck in the dark,"Missing the electric touch and stuck in the dark - I usually enjoy some romantic movies especially one with gay male mains because they are like me. But things have changed. I’ve been dealing with this starvation of touch for 3 years now. I just watched “Heartstoppers” and let me tell you it feels like my heart is going to stop, for the wrong reason.

Being touched is like a electric shock, something I miss so much. The show depicts every time the two boys touch as not just a connect. but a spark. I spark I wish I was able to have with a man. I found myself crying at the happy ending because I have no spark in my life.

No one to embrace in my arms anymore with a simple hug. No hand to hold when things get scary. No shoulder to cry on when shit gets real. No one to snuggle with when it’s cold outside. No one to sit next to after a long day. No one to let me feel the heat of another’s body. No spark.

It’s hard to think of a happy ending or even a even a neutral ending with something always missing in my life. It seems now even feeling the fur of a blanket or heat of a fire can’t substitute the real human connection I crave. Everyone around me seems to be moving with life while I am stuck behind in a tunnel with no way out, waiting for something to light the void. Something I haven’t had in a very long time. I just keep working and studying to try to ignore it but it is always lingering over me. I’m stuck in the dark with no way out."

After it happened I felt like i was at peace i had no hatred , regret or love towards her at that moment. I did something that she always tried to show me that it is possible to make peace with someone without hating them by learning and moving on . I might miss her again which is normal but the truth is the dead can't come back to life , broken can't always be fixed . Sometimes letting go is the best thing we can do yes i loved her i always will but i can find love again if i try . 

I always thought it was impossible for me to move on from this and I'll always live with this pain inside my chest of memories and decisions i made .  but today while listening to songs i remembered one song we both used to love till now i was avoiding everything related to her but today I faced it thinking i might cry or get depressed and i played that song . As it started playing all the memories came in front of my eyes like a dream then at that moment i felt lucky i even got to have those moments with someone regardless of all the pain . It felt easy and possible to let go.. she always told me it is possible to let go . If she saw me today i know she'll be proud. 

Even if in future  I'll have a hard time to let go I'll know it is possible maybe not now or tomorrow or day after that but it is someday"
lonely,Numb,"Numb - My sisters all have cute nicknames by my mom. I dont. I leave my room for the first time in the whole day and ask a simple questions from my mum. I get rude, sarcastic, attitude filled retorts and taunts back. Not answers. I go back to my room, where I’ve been all day, upset and crying. My sisters talk to each other and not me. They make fun of me. When i ask them why they’d say a certain thing about me, they’ll scoff at me and ask me why I’m getting ‘aggressive’ when all i did was ask: why? My friends don’t message me unless they need homework or help studying. No one asks me to just hang out. When they do, no one really talks to me or takes pictures with me. I message my ex boyfriend friend and ask to talk. Im the one imitating conversation and telling him how much I love him and how amazing he is or for him to just give me 5 minutes cause I want to listen to his voice cause I miss him. I take a picture with my family and see how I look. I feel sick in my stomach and feel the burning in my nose that signals to me to run to my room before I burst out crying. I want to do nothing but sleep, but when i sleep longer than 5 hours, i get night terrors and wake up in a panic and feeling sick I am not wanted, or needed. I am tolerated. I am not the first person in someone’s mind when something happens. I am the afterthought."

In my very very close friend group, everyone else is best friends with someone else in the group and I’m always the one left out. They have secret conversations, they’ll randomly giggle at inside jokes that I don’t know and they’ll dismiss me constantly. I’m pretty sure my family would choose their partners over me. I know this sounds selfish and self centered but it’s just how I feel. I promise I’m not mean or horrible to any of them, everything I do is always in service to someone else in hopes of pleasing them.

lonely,nobody gives a fuck about you (The truth that hurts to hear),"nobody gives a fuck about you (The truth that hurts to hear) - There are so many topics covered like metaverse, ""what will the world look like in 2050"" with that futuristic vision. 

The reality is that it is not ""quite like that"". 

A society where you are only attracted by values. Anyone who is at a disadvantage in this competition is completely lost and ruled out and will have to see a therapist. 

Everyone has their problems and everyone is just worried about themselves. There is no ""humanity"". Just pure interest. 

Most jobs are very boring and repetitive. 
I've spent a lot of time alone and now in the process of giving up some addictions like gambling and pornography I see how my situation is. 

I'm someone who is considered ""highly functional"" and at the same time treated like garbage. This competition is so unfair. 

To be so below everyone else. 

Right now there is a ""party"" at the university and as I am a useless, human trash I will never have the opportunity to meet someone and live these ""good times"".

My social interactions, my appearance, my voice... It makes me cry all day

I also can't get over the insults I took in the past in high school. ""He won't be anyone in life"", ""He has his family to take care of him"", ""He has a problem""

Just to summarize my problems in a small equation.

Aspergers * extreme social anxiety * loneliness * anhedonia * depression (dysthmia) * Non-existent social skills * (babyface + nerd stereotype) * despersonalization = Most fucked up person on the planet of my age in more developed regions.

I have no chance
I'm dead."
lonely,No friends to hangout in school,"No friends to hangout in school - I do have friends but they’re all from different schools. Though I do have one from the school that I am studying at but that (best) friend of mine also has their own set of friends. 

Since we’re on different courses and have slightly different schedules, we barely meet each other for breaks. Plus, there isn’t any reason for me to feel petty about it since her set of friends are her classmates and it is technically essential to befriend them to help with projects, etc. Tho, it still kinda hurt. Like, we’re best friends and I’m alone but you said that you felt bad when you left your classmates to see me to go on a break.

On the other hand, despite being invited serval times by my classmates, I was able to tell that they were doing it out of pity. There were times we ate together back then for a while and my existence meant nothing to them. The fact that they walked off even when I have not finished my lunch— 

Anyway, in my new class, I did not want to make new friends as they already have their cliques. It would be extra for me to randomly join them. Being alone is alright but the loneliness that comes with it got me feeling things. 

And, it’s just sad to know that someone would hang out with me just because it was convenient for them and when their friend came along, they push me aside."

Not saying you all (or neither I - tho I'm sexy as fuck nevertheless) are top models, but like, maybe don't put yourself down and you will be more approachable? You all never considered that your attitude makes it worse than it is?

Funny part one of my friend has been my friends for way over 14-15 years and now I feel that she tends to forget about me when we are our with other people. She says that she doesn't know she is doing this so I have talked to her about this many times but now I have given up. My other friend is a bit more sensitive and when I talked to her I thought she genuinely understood my side but today I find out they have gone out again and didn't even bother asking me. It is not like I am constantly cancelling on them, in fact I have always gone wherever they want to go even if I feel like I might not enjoy but I went just so they won't forget about my existence.

Lately I have also started to pay a lot of attention to my weight or specifically how my belly keeps in getting bigger whenever I eat something. I never used to pay this much attention, I have tried to stop eating but always end up eating unhealthy things. I realise that I am not too heavy and some people might think I am being ridiculous but I don’t like to see my stomach blow up even if it is by a little.

Hear me out.

For the past 3 years, I have been feeling this inexplicable sadness. Sometimes it gets worse and sometimes it fades. I can manage the sadness; it doesn't make me feel too tired, or render my brain completely useless. There are some days im uplifted but other days I feel dead. My therapist said she would not put a name, but js place it as ""I'm mentally tired.""

Last year i did go for counselling and therapy after telling my parents. However, the effects of the therapy wore off soon after it ended. At that time it was quite bad and i almost took my own life. There were also penknife marks on my hand. After seeing the way my parents reacted, I decided that I don't want to hurt them again by opening up to them that therapy hasn't worked. Anyway, if end up taking meds for this, there is a high chance I can't attain my dream job in the future. 

I don't really have anyone to talk to in school, and my friends generally have other friends too they can talk to. My parents don't find friends important, and I just wasn't happy. I got into a 6 month rs. The girl got toxic towards the end and my parents found out and made a total shit show over it. Frankly, I js haven't been happy in a long time. I have made 1 close friend  and she's the sweetest, but I do want more friends, and friends I can be closer to. 

Loneliness is the big problem here. Not too many people are there who can understand me. Besides, I don't think my life is as tough as others in this subreddit. People tell me I'm a nice guy, but in my heart, I just can't believe that. I've caused lots of pain to others. I don't think I am as good as what other's say. I need to live up to their expectations.

I've been dying to get to know and love someone since my breakup. On top of that, not many people seem to want to be my friend, simply because I take a friendship too seriously, and also I score As is most of my subjects. Sometimes, I really feel like flunking my tests, but it never seems to help me get friends. 

I've been indoctrinated to believe that relationships and friendships aren't as important as studies. I haven't had a close friend for the past 15 years (im turning 16 btw). 

Thanks for hearing me out. Does anyone know what to do for the unexplainable sadness I feel? Is it just me feeling lonely most of the time?

(Note: I am religious, and I seriously love my religion. Its the only thing from keeping me going insane and genuinely ending my own life. I love what He is doing for me, and I accept this as a challenge and I know He wouldn't give me such a challenge if I can't get through it.)

Stay safe everyone."
lonely,40M Anyone just want to talk?,"40M Anyone just want to talk? - I’m married and have a steady job. It actually pays fairly well, but somehow I’m still just scraping by paycheck to paycheck. My wife works as well, but it barely helps. I’m sure that most people would think I have nothing to complain about, but in spite of the things I have, I feel empty inside. I dread going to work everyday. My job is boring as fuck. I’m alone 90% of the day. I don’t talk to anyone. I steered myself into this job because it pays fairly well. I did like it at first, but now that the challenge has worn off, I hate it. And now I can’t escape it even if I want to. I’d like to go to school and find my way into another career, but my schedule is inflexible and I’m on call. I can’t save any money for the life of me, between mortgage and car payments and all the other bills. So quitting to go to school is out of the question. So here I am, trapped, bored at work, and just wanting someone to talk to. 

I almost feel bipolar. I’m fine when I’m at home. I get to work on all the things I want to. Whatever projects I want. I get to actually think and accomplish things. It’s just this other half of my life that drags me down. 

Anyway, I’ll leave this up for a little while and see if anyone can sympathize and just wants to have someone to talk to like I do.

lonely,It feels impossible to do anything to help my loneliness with the issues I have,"It feels impossible to do anything to help my loneliness with the issues I have - I wish I could just remove whatever pointless part of my mammal brain is responsible for turning human contact and touch into a need. 

It doesn’t serve any purpose for me at all, I don’t need it for my survival or anything, and so all it’s doing right now is adding internal conflict to my head since I don’t like people and I don’t want to be around them, and the type of person I want to be would have very little to do with people, but the pangs of loneliness and touch-starvation still hit regardless of who I want to be, and how much I can’t stand people. And it either leads me to do stupid things I regret and that don’t represent who I want to be, adding to my internal chaos and self-hatred, or I have to push it down and ignore it until I become crippled by how alone I feel. And both outcomes contribute pretty heavily to my underlying, constant suicidal thoughts.

It doesn’t matter how much therapy I do or how many medications I try, nothing makes a difference to the fact that I don’t like people and I can’t connect to them. 99% of people are just garbage. But even the ones that “get it” are problematic to me. I can’t feel or maintain a lasting or deep connection to anyone. I don’t feel comforted by people telling me they relate to me, I still feel misunderstood in some way. 

Even the few times that I have had relatively positive experiences with people for a while, it always ends one way or another, and most of the time it leaves me feeling confused, angry and bitter. I can’t “let go” of it, no matter how I try to frame it in my head, or who I talk to, or how much therapy I do, or whatever else I try. I’m always just left with more memories that I don’t want to think about, places I can’t visit anymore, songs I used to enjoy but don’t want to listen to, movies I can’t watch the same way, and everything “good” about it turns to shit with hindsight and I just want to forget the whole thing ever happened. 

I can’t seem to just enjoy things for what they are or take them as they come, because my head just doesn’t work like that, I can’t look back on the time I had with those people with any fondness at all, it all gets tainted for me. And it makes it almost impossible to see the point in engaging at all, because I’m not going to get my needs met either way, and 100% of my previous interpersonal relationships have fallen apart in the past and I’ve got nothing but bad memories and regrets to show for it. Doesn’t leave much room for wanting to try again, just makes me feel like I’m not learning my lesson, which is that people aren’t for me.

But the alternative is awful too. For over a year now I’ve been completely alone, apart from my sister who I talked to occasionally, but she died just over a month ago, so I really am 100% alone now. No friends. No family I trust. No one at all. And it works for a while, but eventually the loneliness and touch starvation grows until I can’t push it down anymore, but I can’t do anything about it either. I know that interacting with people will only make me feel more alone, so I end up doing really pathetic things like holding onto a pillow in bed every night, pretending it’s a pretty girl who loves me and wants to be there. Just makes me feel pathetic and weak, not at all the stoic, independent person I’d like to be.

I just wish there was a surgery or pill or something you could do in this position, when your mental issues are seemingly untreatable and only worsen as time goes on, and they prevent you from being able to get these needs met. Something that could just remove the need entirely, so I could just be the person I want to be, and not have to deal with any of this, just be 100% independent and capable of fulfilling all my needs completely on my own."

I don't expect anyone to reply to me.

I feel like a fucking loser. - I (F24) never thought my life will turn out this way. I’m in my mid-twenties, I only have a few friends and never been into a relationship. I was builled when I was younger for having acne and it fucked up my confidence and self-esteem ever since. I’m having a hard time socializing since then as I’m scared people will hurt me again which is why I don’t have that many friends and never been in a relationship I believe. I finished my studies last year (which was so fucking lonely because of COVID and being in a new country where I knew no one). I came back home after my degree and ever since I have been isolating myself and I barely leave my house. 

It’s sad but I feel like I need to be in a relationship so bad to not feel like a fucking loser anymore. I want to feel desired and loved by someone. I feel like I need men validation so bad right now to feel better about myself but I’m scared to put myself out there and be rejected. I’m spending hours every single day hating myself and finding new flaws on my body. Since COVID started I haven’t meet new people and I feel like I don’t even know what I look like to other people if that makes sense. Do people think I am ugly? Am I average? Are some men attracted to me? Am I pretty enough to be loved? These questions are driving me insane. I’m almost missing the times where people will bully me because at least I knew what people thought about me and I knew what I could potentially change to be more attractive which is fucked up I know. I feel like I don’t look as good as I could potentially be and it makes me sad.

Men keep saying that women have it so easy and that they can easily be in a relationship which makes me fucking depressed because I’m wondering what am I doing wrong? I went to the doctor today and at some point he asked me if I’m on the pill and it made me feel so bad because this is the life I’m supposed to have as a 24 years old, be in a relationship and having sex and possibly thinking of having a kid soon. 

I just want to feel normal and have a normal life. I want to feel loved and build a life with someone. I feel like I’m wasting my life.

Throughout school, I was bullied relentlessly. Changing schools didn't help either. I've never really had friends. Work colleagues, classmates, etc but never any real friends who I say had my best interests at heart. I was lucky to score my dream job out of school at a large multinational entertainment company but I stuffed that up as covid hit and had to move back in with my parents. Eveything I worked and dreamed for had vanished.  2 years of no job, no one to talk to, and no friends drove me insane to the point of several attempted suicides.

Eventually, I took work up in a warehouse. I became even more depressed and eventually moved out of home after the abuse came back. Now I'm living in a city with a bunch of housemates with who I don't speak to. Unfortunately they do not share the same values of cleanliness, and lack of drug-taking. As a result, I've become even more depressed and extremely lonely, confideing in my room for 99% of the time when I come home. 

I've also come out to my immediate family as Bisexual but I can't shake years of internalized homophobia (Thanks to the media and my school years) towards my sexuality and see my attraction toward men as a negative attribute in the eyes of women if I ever were to date a woman again. I agree that toxic masculinity exists and that there is no stereotypical ""Real man"" - However, I'm left feeling worthless in the eyes of a potential female partner in the future because of my sexuality. I have so much love to give to someone regardless their gender. - this feels quite pathetic. 

I'm trying. I can see a small glimmer of hope at the end of the tunnel. This year I want to start studying finance or cyber security governance at university and I'm hoping that I'll meet more like-minded people there but I'm incredibly socially anxious. Almost as if the lockdown period has made me weaker. I honestly can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy and I'm starting to think about suicide daily. It's almost ""too casual"" of a topic for me. 

I'm seeing a new therapist this week but that will take time (If they're the right fit). I'm really trying and I don't want to kill myself. I really don't want to. 

But the isolation is worse than death itself."
lonely,I just wish someone understood me,I just wish someone understood me - Nobody including professionals except for my last one understood me and used the one size fits all advice. I wish someone would understand what I've been through. I wish someone understood what it's like to try and fail. I guess I'm too different. I'm just frustrated that people don't understand. Does that make sense?
lonely,I'm just done..,"I'm just done.. - I've been single for 2 years now (almost 30 months). Just a never ending cycle of working, and sleeping. I enjoy my job but.. I want more. I feel like I'm spiraling deeper into depression. I started having feelings for someone recently and it actually was really fun but we broke it off last weekend after only 3 weeks, it didn't even last a month and I miss him.. maybe I just miss the affection but idk..idek where I'm going with this actually I'm just tired, can't sleep and am feeling even more lonely than ever. Just want someone to talk too that I genuinely care about. 
I don't even really consider it a relationship but I did care about him, now he's mad at me. Waking up is so much harder when no one cares..

The relationship was long distance tho I should say, we had been friends on Xbox for a few months, and just started talking one night. He lives in a neighboring city and is actually only about 300 miles away so ig I kinda thought something could happen out of it. 

It's whatever. Thanks for reading my nonsense. If anyone wants to talk, I may be awake for another hour or so.. goodnight everybody :)"
lonely,I moved out hoping it would get better,"I moved out hoping it would get better - It's my 4th week living alone. This has been my dream for god knows how long. When I finally got the apartment, I completely neglected every responsibility in my life and spend the majority of my freetime planning and working to make this my dream home. I felt like this could be the chance to make some changes in my life.

After the first week of living there, I already knew that it's not gonna happen. Hell, it might even get worse. Back home I had my parents and my brothers but here I have absolutely nobody.

I don't have friends that I could invite over. No girlfriend. Most of my family lives too far away to come visit regularly and my parents and brothers are the only people that sometimes come over.

I thought that the independence and freedoms that come with living alone would help me get out of my comfort zone and make me go out more and socialize. And even though I'd love to, I don't know where to go, where to meet people and even how to do it. I'm terribly introvert. 

Being in my mid 20s doesn't help either. Want group of friends, no matter how small, is all I want."

This nightmare experience!..this has to be fucking hell lol BUT NOPE it's even worser than any fantasy torment anyone can concoct.

lonely,i feel like shit rn,"i feel like shit rn - I am the second choice. The temp to stand in until someone better comes along, friendship or relationship wise. I’m disposable, insecure, submissive, i have attachment issues that make me mentally fucking ill, I don’t stand up for myself, I’m easy, weak, a failure, why why why why why why fucking why couldn’t I ever just be fucking normal, why??? I just want to scream because not one thing has ever gone my way and I’m just fucking losing it, my life is such a fucking joke. I hate myself so fucking much and how people have and continue to make me feel I’d rather just not exist than continue to feel insignificant to people I just want to love me. I just want to disappear into thin air, nothing would change, nobody’s life would be affected, that’s how insignificant I am to everyone in my life, so unimportant and worthless. I don’t want to die but I just don’t want to be here either. It isn’t living, it’s just existing and everyday feels like so much. It’s so exhausting going through this every other day feeling like a nobody and a failure."
lonely,I hate feeling so fucking lonely because all I really want is to be alone,"I hate feeling so fucking lonely because all I really want is to be alone - Things just work better when I’m alone. I wouldn’t say I’m happier, but I’m never happy so that’s not really the goal. But things just feel more functional. Being around people just makes me feel like I’m having to grit my teeth to get through until the social interaction is over, and then all I want is to go shut myself in behind as many locks as possible in a place where I know no one can reach me. It usually takes all my effort not to say or do something that goes against who I think I am or who I want to be, and when I do slip up and say or do something like that, it gets added to my internal conflict and self-hatred that I always feel.

I’ve found that I only really like the idea of people, how they appear in the fake scenarios I daydream about from time to time. But reality is never like that, in reality people are always disappointing or frustrating or hard to deal with or they let you down constantly. Always leaves me either just having to tolerate and go along with shit I don’t want to because I don’t have the energy to fight it, or I do have the energy and end up feeling like I’m beating my head against a wall.

I know that I’m better on my own, that I’m more myself, I’m more mentally stable, and I feel less self-hatred when it’s just me. I have zero friends, no one I even talk to at all anymore because I ghosted the last people I knew over a year ago and have been avoiding social interaction as much as humanly possible since. Only consistent person I’ve ever had in my life at all was my sister, but she got hit by a bus just over a month ago, so there is literally no one anymore.

But the frustrating part is that I can’t seem to escape the overriding feeling of loneliness that comes from living like this, even though I know for a fact it’s the best thing for me on every level. I play out scenarios of running into people I used to know at the gym or something in my head on a loop, even if the scenario involves me being angry at the person and probably walking away without even talking, because it’s still some type of meaningful social interaction. 

And today I was walking out of a store and the greeter at the door said goodbye to me and I just had this overwhelming feeling that she just looked so gentle and sweet, she wasn’t even exceptionally attractive or anything, but it just made me think of how much I’d like to be able to just have someone like that hold me and let me lean on her for a while. But I could never do that, I don’t even like people knowing about my past or anything like that, so there’s no way I could ever bring myself to break down like that in front of someone else. I’ve tried to talk to people about the stuff that makes me uncomfortable before and it make my skin crawl and they always treat me differently, even if they become more caring towards me or something “positive” like that afterwards, it makes me feel sick.

I just don’t know how to stop feeling like this, how to stop getting these extreme pangs of loneliness and touch starvation, or at least lessen them so they’re tolerable and don’t put me at risk of doing stupid things I know I’ll regret. I’ve been in therapy for almost 3 years across multiple different therapists, multiple different types of therapy, been on more medications than I care to remember and none of it helps at all. All I want is to be alone and not have to be overwhelmed with this shit all the time."

lonely,Loneliness - advice from my struggles,"Loneliness - advice from my struggles - The Goal for those on this sub is to overcome loneliness, my advice is to understand it and no matter your plans or solutions maintain the Stockdale Paradox on your path, lest you get lost. 

Kurzgesagts explanation on loneliness is one of the best available. It can help a lot of people if they heed the advice given:

[Everybody feels lonely sometimes. But only few of us are aware how important this feeling was for our ancestors - and that our modern world can turn it into something that really hurts us. Why do we feel this way and what can we do about it?](https://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA)

To properly heed any advice, you must employ the Stockdale Paradox:
-&gt;To succeed you NEED to honestly face your reality while at the same time have faith that you will prevail in the end. &lt;-

You Must maintain both Faith in your success (seeing it as inevitable) and an honest view of your paradigms (clear unbiased perspectives and understanding) if you will overcome your loneliness, 
there are no alternatives.  

I hope the best for all those that read this post, [you are not alone](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=340&amp;v=GxPNprgqR48&amp;feature=youtu.be)

lonely,How do I even find someone,"How do I even find someone - I get up, ride to work which makes me suicidal and more depressed every day. I get back home like 8 p.m. eat something and browse internet for an hour or two before Im too exhausted to do anything and go to sleep.

And the day starts over. 

Ive never been in a relationship, or had any good friends because Im very shy to new people. 

I cant imagine actually finding someone, even on my one day off per week Im too exhausted to do anything. 

I just dont see any reason why would I continue this shitty life, I dont have any motivation to live anymore.
Ive lost all hope of finding love and being happy.

I cry and hug my pillow, and dream about having someone to talk to, hug and fall asleep with every day.

So right now all I have is my friends. I make sure to check up on all of them, make sure they know I’m there for them when they need me. I’m tired of always being there for people and no one’s ever there for me. Now I don’t do it because I want it to be reciprocated. I’m a very caring person. I want my friends to know that they are important to me. But my friends wouldn’t give a damn about me if I disappeared. Each one of them has someone who cares about them. They’re in relationships or have other friends as well. I just wish someone paid attention to me for once. Asked me how my day was, checked in on me, I’m tired of being that person for everyone while not even one person can do the same for me."

I just feel like every guy that shows interest feels kinda underwhelming or is only interested in sex. I don’t like going on dates so dating apps are not for me. So i guess it’s my fault for not putting myself out there. I also refuse to hook up so i constantly find myself craving some type of affection. I guess i’m writing this so someone can tell me if i should just keep going like this or i should put myself out there even tho it feels sooo not natural to me. Or idk maybe i’m just venting"
lonely,I've never belonged anywhere,"I've never belonged anywhere - At my first school I was that one lonely kid that didn't fit in but drifted between the social groups. I didn't fit in with the nerds or the cool people. I just hung out with whoever would have me on that day. Its like I was a ghost and just nobody noticed me. I very rarely got invited to peoples houses. I didn't have one solid friend at that school. 

My second school was slightly better. On my first day I was mediately introduced to a friend group by someone I knew from the first school. It wasn't all bad. It did feel like the only group I ever belonged to, but it was only for the last 2 years of school. I clearly still had some issues though because I was eating myself to death. There was a fish and chips shop close by and I bought chips almost every day with the box sizes getting bigger. It was to the point where I had to get my gall bladder removed because I had gall stones. I'm slightly better now and I don't eat as much. 

College was the worst. The first year my group had a fight and nobody got along. We all split into groups and I temporarily joined the group of people who I supported but that didn't last too long and somehow I wasn't included in anything they did anymore. Then covid happened. The last 2 years if college was pretty much online so I had absolutely no friends that wanted to hang out with me. I didn't get invited out once. I don't feel like I made a single real friend at college. It was also the same story again of drifting between groups before covid. 

Now I've graduated and I'm sitting at home job hunting. I'm trying to find something that will help me get started in life but its difficult. I'm still friendless I'm still lonely and its crushing me. It feels like I'm drowning. It doesn't help that all of the best friends I've had in the past have drifted away. I do have one online friend at the moment who is great but they have a life too and it would be unfair to expect them to give me all of their attention. I don't know what to do."

lonely,I went too far….again.,"I went too far….again. - So to put it simply, I went through a lot of loss in the last six months. Divorced, lost my cat to a tumor, several friends and I’m alone. 

I have been trying to date lately but…

I make good conversation. Things have gone well with most that don’t ghost or stop responding. I have had a couple dates. 

This weekend I thought I had it good. Met someone, all things clicked, had a really good time. Then I went into all the things I wanted and to have and where I saw it going…because I’m lonely af and being with people I enjoy has lately turned into “please love me because I’m doomed to be alone!”

Well, this isn’t the first time. At least this time someone responded to tell me how it made them feel and why they wanted to run. 

I’m incredibly sad and lost. I just wanted to let it out I guess. I didn’t want to be divorced. My cat was my best friend. I can’t seem to stop nuking connections with people.

lonely,"I don't want to be sexist or anything, but I think girls don't understand how much they can affect a man emotionally.","I don't want to be sexist or anything, but I think girls don't understand how much they can affect a man emotionally. - For a little context, i was lonely all my life. When i was 14-15 i would cry to my dog saying he was my only friend. I've never had a girlfriend, and i also just kissed 2 people in my whole life. 

I met this girl online, after a month i fell in love with her and she said she was in love with me too, we talked about everything for hours and hours, she made me feel like that was real love. It's hard to describe and even harder in English (I'm from Argentina), but the chemistry we had was beautiful. She always told me how beautiful i was and once we would meet she would kiss me and Hug me and be together and all this beautiful things that gave me Hope, because that was the first time that i've ever felt something like that. She was perfect in every aspect, and was too good to be true.

The problem? More than a 1000km between us, but she promised we would meet soon and i searched for a job just so i could have the money to meet her even sooner.

As soon as i started working she started caring less for me, chatting less, and... i think i spoiled you the end. She said ""the distance hurts me"" like she didn't knew from the beginning how far apart we were, stopped talking to me and started dating other guy. 

A year ago I tought i could eat the world, now i don't even want to get out of bed.

Had a lot of projects, hobbies. I was passioned for the things i did. I did want money, new clothes, a sports car, have my own apartment, be with girls, have fun.  

Now the passion is gone, i don't even try flirting with girls because the answer is always the same. I wanted a gaming pc for years and step-father bought me one with all the things i wanted, i turn it on maybe once a week and i play videogames once every 2 months or so.

I'm also in college and i won't pass this year, sorry grandma.

I know I'm not the only one that has passed something similar, so if a girl that did something like that is reading this, fuck you. You can't barely understand how lonely a man can be, maybe you were (like me) the light of hope that he was searching for his whole life, thinking now somebody was going to truly love him."

i can't help this feeling. it's just who i am. even with a loving, supportive, fulfilling partner i still feel incomplete and lonely. it's the absolute worst feeling, because you know you have it better than others. *you* have a partner how *dare* you feel lonely...but it's just something that can not be helped.

lonely,Nobody values me or see worth in me,"Nobody values me or see worth in me - Like the title says, i've been experiencing all of my life that nobody wants me as a friend or as a partner, and i can't understand i think i have good qualities, i mean i'm not perfect but it seems like nodoby sees it besides me, i try so hard to build something with someone, but it always ends up in nothing, and i know that all the pain i have is because i feel lonely and isolated, i haven't been hugged in years i don't have a relationship with my family i'm always on my own, i've tried having different personalities, i've tried being myself i try for other people to accept me but it never happens, i don't want anything extravagant i i just want someone to hang out with, i don't know why i haven't been able to have that, people are always mean, indifferent to me, or just say some kind words out of pitty and leave because they don't want to be my friend, i've been trying to portait this person that's always happy and positive in attemps of making the other person wants to stay but it never happens and i've been feeling extremelly miserable for about years."
lonely,I can't connect with anyone.,"I can't connect with anyone. - So on the bright side I'm finishing school soon and starting a new job in a new field that I'm really excited about, but I feel like the only friend I have is my boyfriend and even with him I can feel alone. I'm a 25yo female who has spent most of my adult life working in bars as a server. I can put on a pretty good performance of being an extrovert and get along well with everyone I meet, the problem is outside of work though I'm a huge introvert, I don't like drinking , I smoke pot but only by myself. I feel like everyone I meet has such frivolous interests and only wants to party and I don't get it. I spend alot of time alone and perhaps I like it best that way but I long to find people my own age who share my same interests and who like to think a bit more philosophical about things. I also feel like alot of the people I try to make friends with are just plain idiots and it frustrates the hell out of me. Anyways thanks for reading, 
Sincerely, Loner Layla"
lonely,Why are we forced into existence?,"Why are we forced into existence? - I just wish, I was never born. I just feel so lonely, even if I’m not alone. I feel like crying the whole time. How are people even able to be truly happy with all the suffering, we are forced to witness? How am I supposed to form deeper connections and don’t feel alone, if nobody gets me? I would rather die now, than having this crushing feeling of loneliness for the rest of my life. How do I know, that I just can give up and end it, instead of prolonging my suffering?"

I’m a fool. 

This is painful

I feel very numb to a lot of things happening around me.

As if the anticipation of graduating was taken away. 

I had so many plans..


But she left me.

I feel alone"
lonely,I keep hurting myself by falling for a boy who doesn't care,"I keep hurting myself by falling for a boy who doesn't care - Soooo I'm in college and during first semester I was hooking up with this guy.  He's really funny and we have so much in common, but we were just hooking up.  I always had to text him first and would be straight up avoided sometimes, but I couldn't help being into him.  He just makes me feel all fuzzy when I see or think about him.  I never told him I wanted more because quite frankly I don't think he's into me whatsoever.

After a few months I saw him again at the bar.  Apparently, he was really happy his friend started talking to me so he could.  He asked how I've been and about my bf (who I've been broken up with for a bit now) and why I haven't been snapping him.  He was being all flirty and I brought him back with me once again, but this time he asked to stay the night.  He has never stayed the night or even asked to.  And then he sat and talked to me in the morning before crawling back in bed to sleep more together.  Haven't seen or heard from him since and vowed I wouldn't snap him first again, but I really want to.

I know he doesn't see me like that.  Honestly, I'm not even sure if he's actually attracted to me or just thinks I'm easy.  If I tell my friends how hung up, I am they'll be so disappointed I let it happen again.  There's only two weeks of school left and over summer I could get over him.  I just don't wanna have to.  I like talking to him and hearing his goofy laugh.  I think I'm definitely getting my hopes up thinking anything more could happen because then I just feel so sad after.

Anyway I just don’t feel close to anyone or feel like I can connect with others on a deep level even though I want to. I’m not close with family or with my siblings and it’s hard to be myself around anyone I’m related to also I’m very shy, awkward, and even anxious around them. Half of the people in my family doesn’t even know me and I don’t know them either so there’s that and I never really had friends like ever just acquaintances or people who claimed to be my friend, but they definitely were an acquaintance not a quote on quote friend lol. I don’t even know how to interact with others irl due to shyness and anxiety so that’s why I do everything online, but even when I do come across people on other apps who seem like a cool person I could see myself getting to know and eventually becoming friends with it never works out because they always end up boring, dry, take forever to reply back, or leave me on delivered or read rather on the app were talking on or if we exchange numbers. I’m Im tired of people saying how interesting of a person I am and that we have things in common, but they never put that energy in actually talking to me more so we can become friends or even close friends. It really makes me feel lonely seeing people being close and connecting with others and having all these friends to hangout with and text meanwhile I have no one. I guess I’m just this person that people chat with when they’re bored but no one seems to wanna get super close with me…."

The foul tasting liquid stings my tongue, but I don't care. Years have gone by, and nothing has changed. I'm still alone, and the only thing that has changed is the reasons why.

2 friends are dead, 1 killed himself and the other died in a wreck.

1 friend has just shut everyone out.

4 of them just decided to leave me behind.

I can't seem to hold relationships either. I have everything they say a girl would want, height, guitar, kindness, but I'm still here alone.

The question that haunts me. Am I not worth remembering? Am I...

lonely,finally working alone...,"finally working alone... - I've been employed since I was 14. I've always worked hard but the most difficult part of maintaining a job is always been the people. I don't think the way other people think which makes it almost impossible to work in a team so I try to work alone as much as I possibly can. Now I'm a truck driver and I get the solitude I have always craved or so I thought. I read another Post in here where someone was talking about still having imaginary friends that they talk to and that they think they're way too old for it but so many others said that they still do the same thing... For me it's the characters in Star Trek Voyager... I don't know why I didn't even like Voyager that much. 
My way of thinking is something that comes packaged with high IQ, low social awareness, and a high intolerance for stupid people... Yet I have come to see that the more intellectually unaware people are the happier they seem to be and the more socially accepted they are. I'm pretty sure some part of this is a function of having a face that always looks worried. That even when people do talk to me and I talk back it seems like within a few sentences of alienated myself somehow and as far as I was aware I was being nice. Usually they tell me they have no idea what I just said. Sometimes though they will respond to a single word I used completely void of the context it was spoken in have at me. Like I blew some sort of hate whistle... 
If you feel like me talk to me. It would be nice to talk with someone who perhaps won't traumatize me. I'm not judgemental, I just want a conversation with someone who is on my level. I want to talk with someone who makes me feel less alone. The more I talk to these people out here the more alone I feel."

I'm so ingrained within my daily routine of working working out and wasting time on the internet. I go to sleep and do it again. Everytime I think of going out and meeting people I get flooded with self defeating thoughts and ends with me staying with what I know rather than going out. 

Is going out alone going to help? I'm a very timid person with crippling anxiety so the thought of approaching anyone in any setting is jarring. I always think that they don't won't and will never care for me and would be best to leave others alone because of that. 

I need advice. I need help. I need a friend..."

lonely,It sucks when you know what your problems are…,"It sucks when you know what your problems are… - …but have absolutely no way to change them - and have tried everything. 

Like I know why Im alone. Im too introverted and dont have that strange social anxiety to keep the convo going. 

I also cant relate to a lot of stuff that people are interested in. And things I like I dont want to talk about. I dont feel close to someone if I do have 2 or so many things in common. Like an example is I like to watch baseball - but only live. And I dont know many players and I know absolutely no history about them or numbers. I just like the actual sport being played. I dont have any affinity for celebrity things or wealth as entertainment. And Ive sat mostly in 2nd row behind first base seats like 1-2x a year but everyone I have taken doesnt like even watching the sport. So I dont go anymore bc I have no one to go with and baseball fans are usually die hard people whom know all the players want to see certain teams face off and all their numbers. 

I also am really bad at pretending or faking interest as all I got is smile and nod. And you do it 3 times in a row etc. 

Im an introvert and also prefer talking about facts or science. New inventions and discoveries. Or how something works. I like pets but I dont really want to hear about peoples pets at work - or tell them about mine. I like experiencing the animal and meeting ur pet is the only part that Id be interested in. One ex friend I told a year and a half ago that Im adopting a cat! And they went off on a tangent about things I need to start doing right away like brushing their teeth. I dont want to hear any of that. Id first say have you ever owned a cat before? And Id say yes 3. End of that chat. Would be my happy place.

Like how asking what kind of music I like is really a pass. IDubbztv has an episode on it that describes my feelings about that to a T. Its not a way to get to know a person or relate to them."

lonely,finally becoming at ease with loneliness.,"finally becoming at ease with loneliness. - I have been feeling a little happier recently towards my loneliness. For the first time in my 21 years of existence I am starting to accept my situation. For the majority of my life I felt distressed by my lack of friends and romantical partners. I tried to come out of my shell at a couple occasions and talk to people but it never really worked out that well, I just find it very tiring and stressful to try to make small talk and get to know someone closely. I have some online friends that I used to know personally before I moved, but we still talk and play games together, I enjoy their friendship since we already got past the awkward phase which seems to never end whenever I try to make new friends. Anyways, for the past week or so I have been feeling completely at ease with being friendless/loveless, its like I have finally realized that it is not worth trying and that even if I did have friends it probably would not make my life significantly better. I guess my brain has logically put 2 and 2 together and I unconsciously stopped caring. Let's just hope it lasts."

So the third time he told me I needed therapy and this never actually crossed my mind. 

Then I started thinking how my brain always fixated for social contact and a loving partner, especially right before sleeping my brain starts creating all these scenarios of me having the life I wanted. But then it hit me.. the reason why I am losing sleep for the last 6 fucking years is because I am so fucking alone.

I wondered when it all went down. I remember being a happy and smiling child, you only have to look at the photo albums. And then, in my early teens, no more smiles. 

I am 24 years old and I have never experienced life. No friends, never had a partner and a family that consists of my divorced parents and my brother. I am empty. Empty of love, empty of passion, empty of life. I am so empty that I even feel like I am invisible. People in the street literally walk over me and I am easily forgotten. 

I feel like a failure and that there is no future for me. With each new big step in my life, I tell myself that it will change. New people, new environment and nothing changes. I make efforts to be more sociable, to be interested in others, to pay attention to my appearance and I remain invisible. 

I won't go into details, but my life is myserable and I am determined that I have no future. I am not desperate, no. That would imply that I have expectations and am disappointed. I simply have no hope. I don't expect anything.

Right now all I have is p*rn (trying to quit) and maybe talking to a drunk girl at a party. This is like eating nothing but junk food. Lately I’ve been depressed, bitter, and on-edge. Lashing out and using things to cope. 

Yeah I’m a guy, but I’m very meak. I need physical, emotional, and spiritual intimacy. I need someone to snuggle with, someone to share my life with. Someone who will reassure me that she loves me.

I hate ppl who say „Before you date anyone, or before you go into a relationship, you need to learn to be alone with yourself“ BRO IVE BEEN ALONE MY WHOLE LIFE AND ALL IT DID WAS MAKE ME SUICIDAL AND SOCIALLY ANXIOUS. I get that it helps ppl who are surrounded by so many ppl they have to choose who to date or to hang out with, but do not fucking tell this to me. Honestly im so lonely, im jealous of ppl who take having friends and/or a healthy relationship for granted. Im jealous of anyone with friends tbh."
lonely,How I feel less lonely,"How I feel less lonely - I see a lot of honest yet overwhelmingly negative content on this sub. So I just wanted to add my perspective / a kind of mantra I've been saying to myself to get me through. I hope no one takes this the wrong way as I am just trying to be encouraging and obviously don't know everyones situation. 

Yes I am lonely, very terribly lonely, and I want nothing more than to meet my future husband. I want to have someone to hold and care for, someone to share the experiences of life with, to share my authentic self with and everything that I think and is in my mind. But this will not happen by magic, everyday I must either work on myself to be the best version of myself that I can be, or work on meeting new people. If I have to focus on school or work at the expense of my social life, then I will go to a cafe, and desensitize myself to making small talk with the barista so I can get better at socializing. If I have to stay inside to work I will take time to learn more about my psychology and read how to be a good partner in relationships. When I do have time to go out, I will be brave and try my personal best. I might feel anxiety, face rejection, or just not vibe with anyone. But I will put myself in situations that I enjoy the activity anyway so that if I don't meet anyone, I still have a good time. I like going to the art museum so I might as well go when they are having an artist talk event and chit chat with other people there. Maybe I will meet someone, but worst case I will have some good convos and enjoy myself. If I'm painting I can take my paints and canvas outside to the park to be in vicinity of other people. It might not seem like much, but over time  it adds up. You will have better social interactions, feel less anxiety, meet new people (some good some bad) and most importantly of all, avoid falling down a pit of dispair and self pity. I remind myself I am a unique person which means I don't make friends or connections with people easily. There are some things about myself I can not change, and many things that I wouldn't change even if I could. I like my perspective on life, my weirdness, and the path I have chosen for myself, even though it is objectively more difficult. I focus on the fact that I don't hate myself, I just want to grow as a person and meet my people! Life for me will be more like running around collecting rare pokemon than having an instant group of friends and connections, and I can learn to enjoy that process. 

I know what you are going through right now feels so hard, and so overwhelming, but wallowing in your own loneliness is actually the easy choice. The harder thing to do is to try and do something about it every single day. Most of us can, and so we should. So I encourage everyone on this sub, in addition to acknowledging and sharing the experience of being lonely with others, also share your successes. 

Today I went to a restaurant by myself to eat and felt very lonely, and pretty overwhelmed with the feeling that I am getting older and the one thing that matters more to me than anything else, finding a life partner, hasn't happened for me yet. I started to sink into feeling like something is wrong with me, questioning why my past relationships ended and feeling like everything was my fault, ""I should have tried harder or just stayed and been unhappy so at least I wouldn't be alone."" I felt pathetic about how much I daydream about being in a happy relationship with someone. But then I actively chose to focus on the fact that I have grown so much. I went from completely alone with absolutely no friends and very limited contact with my family, to having one really good female friend who I can talk to and share almost anything with and a better relationship with boundaries with my family. If I can grow enough as a person to make and maintain one long term friendship I can make and maintain one partnership. It might not happen when I want it to, but it will happen and *I* will make it happen through my actions."

lonely,24F,"24F - I have no friends or family. I got divorced a few months ago from an abusive ex husband, but it’s still been a good year and a half since I last had someone to talk to……

In whatever process of healing myself I went through, I’ve lost literally everyone. I have a great job and an adorable puppy, but I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I have no one to travel with. No one to get dinner with. Simple errands feel like chores.
I enrolled in a masters program, but it’s online so I don’t even get that interaction… I feel like I’m going crazy

It’s embarrassing, but I even started a profile on one of those “sell your panties” websites to meet other lonely people, because I figured I could send my belongings to someone else who is also lonely. And that maybe they could benefit from having some “girlfriend” items around? Idk I feel SO stupid for it, but I’m just lonely.

What else to do?"

lonely,Feeling a little down and thought writing about it might help somehow,"Feeling a little down and thought writing about it might help somehow - Dating is really tough in this world, at least when it comes to having a genuine connection with someone. I (25M) have had two long term relationships in my life. The first, I never should have been with as we had NOTHING in common, but she was cute and I had been chasing her for a while. Also, I was seventeen. You live and learn. 

The second relationship was a much more genuine connection and I am so thankful for her being in my life even though we wanted completely different things by the end of it. 

Aside from those I have had dates, and flings, and complicated stuff in between, but nothing that was tangible. 

I've been on dating apps for a while now and after several, uninspiring dates, I recently went on what was probably the best first date I've ever been on. I've never felt some comfortable with someone so quick. The next two days she didn't text me back and I felt miserable. Then she did text me back, explaining that she simply didn't feel the same. 

That's how the cookie crumbles. I think finding a person a person in your life that you ""get"" is such a special thing, but also... It's not everything. 

You have your family. You have your friends. You have little things like books, and movies, and music that you enjoy. Maybe it's tv show or a sports team. Maybe you have a hobby. At the end of the day, we are individuals no matter what. It's easy as all hell to feel ""incomplete"" without someone to share your life with. 

So I think what I'm saying is put yourself out there, but don't feel too bad if you're not having any luck. I think a lot of humans feel the same way. The same frustrations and short comings. It's rare to find something real and you'd be surprised to see just how many people are settling. 

Focus on yourself and what you enjoy and what makes you feel alive as best as you can, because waiting to live your life for a second person, in my opinion, is no way to live.  Enjoy yourself. Love yourself.  We're only here for a short time."

lonely,Stopped Initiating,"Stopped Initiating - Everyone from my wife to friends has stopped initiating anything with me. My wife when it comes to happy time, nah. For friends no invites to hangouts, no meme, no vines. Oh, unless I can do something for free for them. No one says hi, no one says they want me around. I'm an awesome guy, do anything someone asks of me within reason. Works out, will eat anything, will talk about anything. I'm the nice guy, glass half full, positive, will talk you down from dumb ideas. I feel like I deserve a lot more then what I get, but alas I don't really complain about that. 

I just wish people would initiate with me. Ask me to do something (that involves them, not baby sitting). Send me a funny text or meme. Tag me in a vine or tiktok. Anything. Maybe once every two weeks or so someone will ask me to do something. Sometimes I can, sometimes I can't. 

So I've now stopped initiating. I'm no longer initiating anything that doesn't directly benefit me in some way. Sex, friendship. Because I shouldn't be the only one doing this. 

I'm a great guy for both my family and friends. I just don't understand it.

lonely,"A ""friend"" ghosted me and told me I don't try hard enough when I told them I can't afford therapy","A ""friend"" ghosted me and told me I don't try hard enough when I told them I can't afford therapy - I've struggled with depression and anxiety and crushing loneliness for years now. Student loan repayments and other life issues that have happened to me have only magnified all of it as the years have dragged on. As it is, I basically have no one and the few people who do show up in my life inevitably disappear soon after.

Once a ""friend"", a very tenuous definition of one but still someone I talked to on and off, offered to listen to what was bothering me one day. After telling them about some things that had been really weighing on me, instead of just being supportive and trying to be a part of my life to help with the loneliness, basically just said I was ""too negative"" and didn't have any fight in me so I should go get therapy. After I explained to them that I literally couldn't afford it when I'm already struggling because therapy is expensive, they said that if I actually wanted my life to get better I would find a way to make it happen. When I was just like ""that literally isn't how any of this works"" they ghosted me and haven't spoken to me again, in years.

I'm so sick of things like this happening, because this wasn't the first nor the last time something similar happened. People offer to be there, but what they REALLY mean is that they want to feel like a good person by doing something but don't actually care enough to give you time out of their lives. So they throw some generic zero effort ""advice"" at you and pat themselves on the back, then when you say that it doesn't help, blast you for being too negative or some other nonsense.

If nothing else it exemplifies how few people care unless you serve some kind of direct benefit to them, and how few understand or care to understand how lonely and crushing life can be for others. I guess in the end I'm not worth caring about anyway."

lonely,missing out my teenage life,"missing out my teenage life - i remember when i was a bit younger, i would witness people my age as they're living their teenage life, experiencing many things for the first time, and wondering why i just couldn't enjoy what other people do. wondering is it because i look ugly? or is it because I'm such an introvert that it's hard for me to make friends? and why do i like boys? why do i do like girls too? wondering if something is wrong with me? for the longest time i hated myself for those things.

it's been couple years since then. while i do still hate myself at times, i finally able to accept myself as who i am. but it took me so long that i missed on so many things in life, because i was just confused the whole time. I know I'm unattractive, I guess I can try my best to look better. I know I have trouble making friends, I guess I just gotta force myself to socialize more. I live in a third world country and it is pretty conservative and I am not straight. What the fuck can I do about that? 

seeing teenage story makes me extremely depressed. i know it's ironic because I've been replying to some thread in this subreddit positively as if i even know what I'm talking about. but it's just fucking suck i wasted all those years doing literally nothing. not that even if i know myself then what i know now, i can do anything about it. i want a normal life. why am i like this.

i have a family. i have roof over my head. i don't have to work to earn money. am i selfish for still wanting more? why do i still feel lonely. it's the loneliest i have been. maybe because i know i can't really be myself, and have to keep lying to myself, and making sure no one knows. I've done that for years. but why is it becoming so hard to do so. I'm tired. I just want to be free, but i can't.

I'm so lonely.
I have friends, but i am lonely. i just want someone to love me. god why am i so desperate? is it because i know no one will ever give me love? why do i have to keep living like this. i don't like it. i don't enjoy every seconds of it. i hate my life. i hate myself. i hate that I'm like this. i hate that i was born this way. i am hopeless. i just want to be loved. i can't enjoy other things in life knowing i will never be loved. i hate myself i hate myself i hate myself i really hate. myself why do i exist. all i do is suffer..  

im so lonely
it's getting too suffocating

i cant keep living like this
i don't have the energy anymore
im tired

lonely,I feel broken and I feel like no one likes me because I am broken.,"I feel broken and I feel like no one likes me because I am broken. - Hello, I am 25 and I feel like I have no friends. I spend most days alone and I do not like it. Somedays I feel overwhelmed by my emotions and all I can do is cry and harm myself. I don't know what to do anymore. Why does it seem like making friends is easier for everyone else but for me, it is a struggle with me putting in 99% of the work and getting little to no benefit. I am left wondering why. Why do I work so hard at making friends yet I am still alone. I do not understand...

I am considering giving up and just accepting the fact that I was born to be alone. I feel trapped in a loop of being broken and not having the skills or the support to fix myself. I do not know what to do anymore. I just am alone so much of the time and it brakes me. 

Not to mention all the trama that I have to deal with. From childhood abuse and isolation. I find it hard to love myself when all remember was being bulled. Whether that be my sister, kids at school, teachers, or even my parents. I have so much trama. From kids in my elementary school saying that they would rather kill themself than date me to high school bullies making fun of me. Teachers use to blame me for stuff like valium or spreading lice (never had any in my life) to constantly saying ""stop giving your mother grief"" (That was said by my elementary school special ed teacher). I feel like I have too many trams and I am having a hard time dealing with it all. 

How should I go about making friends?

Where should I look for love?

How should I improve myself?

How can I be not alone so much of the time?"

lonely,My only friend got a boyfriend..,"My only friend got a boyfriend.. - I () want to preface this by saying that I am very happy for my friend (also ), she deserves to be with someone and has always wanted to be in a relationship. She’s my most favourite person in the world, it’s just sad that now I am not hers, possessive as that may sound.

There is a part of me that has never felt more alone. I rarely see her now as she always goes to see her boyfriend (who lives a few hours away), and even when I do see her it feels like he’s all we talk about. That or my love life (nonexistent) which gets frustrating after a while.

Sometimes it feels like she’s tired of being around me, today she passively mentioned that I make no effort, which felt sort of unfair as lately it feels like neither of us have. After a while of having my invitations to go out ignored I’ll admit I’ve stepped back a little. Thing is I have no one else to run to and that used to be okay, but now when I acknowledge that around her she seems judgmental. 

I want to make other friends, I just seem to be atrocious at it, we both used to be. However now she’s grown out of that, whilst I still remain face down in the dirt. I don’t resent her, but hanging out with her makes me feel inadequate, I don’t know what to do.

Today she also said she wouldn’t come out with me for a while to save money for a trip her and this guy are going to go on. That felt like a stab to the heart - some sort of confirmation that she really wants to be with him more than me. 

I know romance is important, but I can’t help but be sad that it comes above all else."

To feel their presence and know they care about me. To experience the warmth of their hand, the coolness of our arms brushing against one another. Leaning her head on my shoulder, letting me know that she trusts me implicitly. Holding her tightly, protectively. Having her hold me, to feel close and connected.  

Holding hands. Hugging. Leaning on one another for physical and emotional support. I want to experience these things, more than anything else in this world.  

But I can't. I never will. Because I am my own worst enemy. Why does it have to be so painful, to know you will never experience the dream you hold most dear?"

lonely,"I'm so lonely, dude.","I'm so lonely, dude. - For almost 27 years of being alive I tried to fit in many times. Have quite a bit of friends because of that, wonderful people. I play games with them every now and then but back when I lived closer we used to hang out and eat out irl or watch a movie. 

Even then I feel so lonely. Friends can only do so much, a person needs to find genuine connection and I always feel so out of place. Maybe I should just let go of that idea and allow myself to become normal but I have tried many times and it never made me feel alright. It feels so uncomfortable and limiting.

I find it so weird how a lot of people can easily connect with others, maybe they're just comfortable with themselves that in any situation they find themselves in they're okay? 

Am I the weird one for feeling so extremely out of place? I just don't get it. I've only ever felt complete once in my life but life ain't like the movies so it ended and that was almost 6 years ago.

I keep wondering when my moment would click when I'm fine being where I am and okay with whatever tomorrow brings and find enjoyment with that peace. I feel so out of touch, this is something teenagers worry about not adults like me?

I have a job where I'm actually really good, got a place to myself which isn't a big one but that might have to change soon to a smaller one if I ever get forced to work back in the office or I quit.

I've always felt like life was supposed to be simple however I cannot at all control this feeling that I have. It gets very overwhelming sometimes and I don't really know how to deal with it.

Life is really short and I want to enjoy it. I want to be a father and raise my kids with a wonderful partner. That's my end goal.

But I just think that I'm too odd to ever find someone to have a family with. I am slowly losing my reason to live, I find it rather sad that I wake up with a heavy feeling of extreme loneliness more often now than ever.

I don't know what change I need to do anymore, I feel like there's nothing for me out there. I don't want suicide to be my end but it seems like it becomes clearer and clearer now."

I think because I don't have a close relationship with my mom that I can't connect with others because I never learned how. For example, I'm talking to a girl, seriously, for the first time. I've always found girls attractive but never found a girl I liked as much as her. I constantly need reassurance from her and feel as if I need her. 

I am capable of being alone but not having any friends or family I can talk to, hurts.

It truly made sense and now I understand why I am the way that I am.

I F25 was sexually abused by some people during my childhood.

Since then, I've been hypersexual. Started masturbating at around 9. I fantasize about having sex despite being a virgin. I have not even kissed anyone yet. Shit, I imagine all things like tying someone up and pleasuring them. 

It might be weird but that's my truth. But still, I won't have sex just to have sex iykwim. I still want a connection. Perhaps love, yet I feel like I'll never deserve it. So, maybe one day I'll just say FUCK IT and do the wildest things with the first guy I find attractive.

**How you view failure.** Do you view failure as an embarrassment? Is it something you should avoid at all costs?   
 

● What if you viewed failure as simply a step along the way to success? **Failure just means that the approach you used didn’t work.** It’s an opportunity to re-think your process and try again. If you keep learning and making improvements, how can you possibly fail in the long-term?

● The way you view adversity plays a big part in your overall wellbeing. How do you view setbacks? – are they personal, permanent and pervasive or temporary situations to be built upon?  What view would be most useful to you?  
 

**Values.** Suppose someone valued charity, kindness, and modesty. What type of life would they lead? Suppose someone else valued freedom, adventure, and courage. Now, suppose a third person valued money, power, and greed. It’s easy to see how these three people would lead very different lives.

● What are your values? Do they support the life you want to live? Or, is your life in line with your values?  
 

**Beliefs.** Beliefs frame how you view the world. What you believe about yourself may be limiting. Beliefs evolve through time: do you believe the same about Santa Claus now as you did when you were six years old? 

● List some of your beliefs about the world, yourself, and life in general. **How are those beliefs helping or hurting you?** What beliefs would be helpful for you to develop and enjoy the life you desire?

**Attitude.** Do you expect things to work out for you, or are you primarily pessimistic? You’ll be less likely to try to do something if you have negative expectations. A positive attitude can help with your patience and ability to persevere when things aren’t going well.

● Consider how your attitude is impacting the results you’re generating in your life.  
 

**Gratitude.** Giving yourself a reminder of what is already working in your life can positively impact your attitude and expectations. It can also reduce anxiety and benefit your perspective.

● Take a few minutes from time to time to list the things you’re grateful for. Notice the small things – they’re often, actually, the big things!  


**Thoughts.** Our thoughts are under our control, though it might not seem that way. It’s easy to prove this to yourself. You can choose to think about an ice cream cone or a green cow. You can choose to think about anything you like.

● It’s valuable to take control of your thoughts. **If you’re predominately thinking about negative outcomes, you’re going to struggle.**

● Monitor your thinking, keep things in perspective. Note those recurring, unhelpful, thoughts: challenge yourself to challenge yourself. 

Changing yourself internally can support you in living your best life. **Without making those inner changes, any behavioural changes are likely to be superficial.** You’ll be constantly fighting yourself – and that’s hard work!

Inner changes align your thoughts with your behaviour: you with the world around you."
lonely,Here I am,"Here I am - Follow me down 

Sorry I’m late."
lonely,In love with my best friend,"In love with my best friend - I fell in love with her the moment I saw her. That was nearly 30 years ago. We have very similar tastes and personalities and we genuinely enjoy each other's time. The friendship was pretty open (not THAT open), we would sit by the fire together and chat for hours.  I would hold her and we would support each other with our relationship problems and other life issues.  We would see each other many times per week. I adored her but I also knew she was WAY out of my league.

And then, one day, I decided to tell her how I felt. As I expected, it wasn't something she was interested in but what I didn't expect was that it would change our friendship forever.

Gone were the frequent outings, the multiple text messages per day, the chats by the fire, all physical contact except for the sterile hug one gives to someone they don't know very well. She stopped telling me about her relationships and other life issues.  All interactions became very acquaintance-like, devoid of any emotion or feeling. Our IRL interactions dropped from multiple times per week to maybe once or twice a year. I would get occasional ""how are you"" texts but if I actually tried to tell her how I felt, she would shut down the conversation quickly.  She did NOT want to talk about it.

Over the next 10 years or so, I was sort of able to convince her that my feelings wouldn't get in the way of our friendship so she opened up a bit but nowhere near how things once were.

I was never really a very emotional person. But as I got older and mid-life kicked in, my crisis kicked in full speed and I started having emotional feeling I had never felt, including love like I have never felt. 

Over the past few years, my friend has had to go through some major personal tragedies and there would be days where I would spend them with her helping her out with various things. Just being near her would give me these intense emotional highs.  Any physical touch, no matter how platonic, was electric. I stopped seeing her age or physical attributes and started seeing the most wonderful, amazing, and beautiful woman I have ever seen. When she makes eye contact with me it feels like I am listening to an orchestra full of rainbows. I am literally high on emotions and hormones.

That high of an emotional feeling doesn't happen without a crash.  After a weekend together helping her out, I sit here at my desk at work with this indescribable emptiness and tightness in my chest. I keep staring at the text message notification to see if I got one since that last time I looked 5 seconds ago. The 40 ton pressure of loneliness is just relentlessly crushing my soul and I cannot stop it. I cannot get away from it. I can't just stop loving her. I cannot work, I cannot relax. I have severe withdrawal symptoms. 

When I am with her, it makes me so happy. All of my worries and concerns are just gone. But once we part, the sadness and emptiness returns along with the realization that we probably only have a handful of times left to be together.

It is torture. 

thanks for listening"

lonely,The last time I was happy was when I was 12,"The last time I was happy was when I was 12 - I’m a 21 year old girl, well, I guess woman now. I still feel like a teenager. I’ve experienced little fleeting moments of happiness but it’s nothing in comparison to the hell that is my life. I fear that nothing will ever get better because it’s been the same for the last 9 years. I don’t feel like telling my life story because I’ve told it so many times and it doesn’t matter anyway. I have no friends, no passions, no anything (hence my username). I share a room in a toxic household. I have no idea who I am because I’ve had no room to explore since I was a kid. I feel fake, everything feels fake. I’m a shell of a person and I’m scared."

lonely,I’m never going to be happy,"I’m never going to be happy - TW: suicide attempt

It feels like every step forward is ten steps back. I thought that when I finally started my dream job things would sort themselves out - I would make friends and work a job I love. But in the month I’ve worked there I feel like everyone hates me, my best friend has pushed me away and now hardly speaks to me, everyone I used to work with, who I thought I was friends with, has cut me off and has told what few friends I had to cut me off too. I feel ugly and fat and horrible. 

I last tried to kill myself just over a year ago, and now I’ve spent the whole long weekend depressed thinking about killing myself. It’s not like anyone would miss me. I have no friends and even my mum hates me. I’m never going to be happy and I’m going to be alone forever."
lonely,overwhelmed and stressed out,"overwhelmed and stressed out - I'm feeling extremely pathetic writing this post and seeking for genuine friendship,  i used to be able to cope with having 0 friends my entire life, bc nobody needs to be friends with ugly and depressed girl. 
But now it's difficult to me to go through difficult situations alone, i just wish i had female friend"
lonely,"We need people, but I don't deserve them","We need people, but I don't deserve them - What does one do when there is no hope to break your loneliness? Pets are awesome, but my dog doesn't provide the companionship that I crave. Its not that its impossible for me to find dates to begin with (although I do struggle in that regard), but its my personality that makes it impossible for people to stay with me. I'm cold, disingenuous, quiet, uninteresting, lazy, arrogant, and not nearly attractive enough to disregard even a single one of these qualities. I don't blame anyone other than myself, of course, but what I cant stand is the constant optimism from others who don't know me intimately enough to properly judge my ability to appease others romantically. Perhaps its true that one day, long from now, I could change myself into  an attractive personality, but I am not some 14 year old child just beginning my experiences.  decades old now, and don't find the prospect of beginning my dating life in my 40s, let alone living until then, to be very comforting. I don't want to say that everyone deserves to know what romantic love is within their lifetime, because to do so would be a lie. Some people are just monsters who deserve only the sword or the rope."
lonely,I feel so alone.,"I feel so alone. - I used to think I didn't need anybody. Like I'd skate through life on my own, and never look back. I thought I could make it.

I can't. And I don't know how. It feels like too much, all at once. I'm so lonely that it actually hurts a little; there's an invisible hand reaching into my chest and just squeezing my heart. I feel so alone. No one's ever told me that they cared about me, or that they loved me. I think I was still a kid when I figured that out. It's weird, you know. You grow up watching all of these TV shows with happy families in them, where no problem is ever too big to solve. You grow up thinking *love's the answer*. And then you just grow up, period, and realize *Oh*. *No one actually loves me*. It's not a happy, loving home. It's a house full of strangers that used to coo over you when you were born, strangers that won't look you in the eye anymore now that you're 20.

I haven't had any friends in years. I haven't laughed with someone else in so long. I haven't had anyone to hug. I haven't had a conversation last longer than an hour. I haven't had someone to trust. It's not for a lack of trying, either. They say you're supposed to make best friends for life in college; I haven't found anyone like that. People tend to avoid me. I've tried everything to fit in, even with my anxiety. I try to be normal. To be the kind of person people talk to. Nothing works. I've tried making friends online, too, but I think something's wrong with me. I try so hard, but something's wrong. I can never keep friends for very long. I end up saying the wrong thing or I take too long to reply, and everything falls apart. I can't do it. It just hurts everytime, so I've stopped.  People reach out to me, sometimes, when I share a little bit of myself like this. But I don't want to be someone's charity case. I don't want people to befriend me on the merits of my heartache and struggle because that's not who I am. I don't want to be that person. I want to be a friend. But I don't know how. No one ever teaches you these things.

And here I am. I'm so pathetic. Some days, when I'm feeling dark and gloomy, I resort to going on anonymous chat sites for conversations. I figure that's easier; they're just one-off chats, anyway, and if I can make someone's day better, then that's great. It's simpler. I don't have to be afraid of getting left behind or abandoned, because it's a total stranger. We talk about our days, and that's it. But then, socialization becomes a necessity, a bar for me to fill. Other days, I just talk to myself. I pretend I'm two people. I text myself on one account, and reply with the other. I practice having normal conversations where everything goes well, and I say all the right things. And then I stop, realize what I'm doing, and feel even worse. 

Recently, I read something online that made me think about myself, who I am and why I find it so hard to socialize. It's such a big thing. I want to tell someone about it, but there's no one I trust. I want to open up to a family member, and say *hey, I think something's wrong with me; hey, I think I have autism*, but I can't. I don't think they'll care. I don't think it matters to them. I'm so tired.

And that's me, all told. I thought it'd help to lay my soul bare like this, where no one knows my name. It's easier that way. I don't like associating any of these Real and Present Problems (yes, capitalized) with me. With my identity. I don't like that this is me. Tomorrow, I'll probably feel a little better. I'll draw, and I'll write, and I'll cry, but I'll live tomorrow. It's just awful that this isn't a phase. It's a cycle that never ends. I hope things start looking up for me somehow. I've almost forgotten what my own voice sounds like when I'm not crying."
lonely,it feels like nothing will ever get better,"it feels like nothing will ever get better - i've been struggling with my mental health for years, but it has never been this bad in my life. i'm genuinely so alone, isolated from everyone. i have no motivation to get out of bed, go to school, or go to work. i just want to lay here and cry, to sleep away each day. the mental anguish i am going through is too difficult to describe with words, and i wish i never felt like this. i wish i did things right. i wish someone loved me. i have thought about suicide in the past, and it has never crossed my mind as much as it has recently. i'm tired of living like this, i wish things would change, i wish i wasn't in constant pain. everyone around me looks so happy, they have things to do, people to be around. i have nothing. i could genuinely lay in bed for over a week and the only people who would say anything would be my boss. i can't stand living like this, i wish something would change. to all of those out there who are lonely, i know the feeling. i don't know why i'm pushing on and still staying here."

It was normal at first since summer brakes are just fun, but now it is painful aince I have gone 6 years without any friends of any kind. I don't want to be alone, but now I am starting to feel a sort of numbness. I am no longer caring when anyone leaves. I am startijg to lose my emotions as well. I don't feel happy, but I am also not really sad. I feel emotionaly ambiguous"
lonely,I wish people were excited to see me,"I wish people were excited to see me - Literally no one cares when and where I turn up. No people do. Even when I come home after a 12 hour shift or something, the family dogs just ignore me as if I've been home all day.

I’m only 14 so I hope i wont always feel this way but I feel so out of place, no matter where I am I feel by myself. In school I choose to sit by myself I distance myself from potential friendships , at home I go in my room barely having conversations with my family. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, why I do those things that hurt myself in the end but it sucks. I don’t know why I do this to myself."

I just know that whenever I do get into a relationship, I am ALWAYS getting hurt and disrespected, therefore im giving up on all of that. Men don’t have the same intentions and boundaries that I do in dating and I’ve accepted that and will no longer try and search for “the nice guy that will show me love and appreciation that I deserve” bc they don’t exist.

lonely,Adulthood and Loneliness,"Adulthood and Loneliness - ""Adulthood is low key lonely af. Everyone's busy. Everyone sucks at texting. We all just work all day to come home and sleep to wake up and work again. On weekends you catch up on things you couldn't do during the week. It's all stupid lol."" - Neqina Wright

Adulthood is tough for every teenager. Going through the uncertain and unpredictable phases of life at this stage, from which our personality and dynamics of behavior are moulded, we are developing with age and time. Social situations etc make us react to them which mould our emotional responses and this in turn adds to our emotional growth. Many teenagers are confused and perplexed with the changes they go through, it is tough for some to even comprehend, and tough for some to even face.
Even though being surrounded by tons of people, many of still feel that void within us, something that is still empty no matter how much we try to fill the gap with the presence of people. Maybe it is not such a great feeling after all, but it does definitely keep one wondering for the rest of their life. The void makes one think about their existence in this hustly bustly world surrounded by people, from which we obtain happiness in their presence, while us being alone are left with thoughts of loneliness.
How would one overcome this void? Is it something us humans can get over? Is loneliness something all of us humans suffer from? Why does the feeling of being lonely, being all to ourselves not keep with the concept of self-love and self-growth?
I hope people get more clarity with themself and their loneliness, i hope they overcome this and enjoy their own company for not everybody, except a few people whom we seem to get a reciprocation of maintaining a relationship from, are the ones that would define us and  social circle.
Happy to hear about perspectives and opinions of different redditors here.😁"
lonely,Homesick and depressed,"Homesick and depressed - Hey guys,hope you all had a great weekend.so…I live in Oregon and it’ll be my two year anniversary of living here in August. I grew up in Santa Cruz California and I miss it every day and lately home is all I’ve been able to think about. It’s such a magical place,I mean it truly is. I left my heart there and the only real “friend” that I have. Me and hun haven’t been in touch in quite some time now. We both stay busy because of work related stuff and what not so it’s understandable but I often just feel like happiness is far behind me now and an eternity of loneliness has positioned itself for good. I work 50 hours a week,therefore I don’t have time to even think about going out to meet new people or do anything spontaneous even as much as I dream about it or would like to. All I can seem to find comfort in is sleeping and spending time with my dog which isn’t even much now given my situation. I just miss home non stop. Constantly. 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I’m in southern Oregon and about an hour and a half from the ocean as opposed to growing up where I did and being a two minute walk away from the beach. I miss waking up to that fresh salty breeze flowing through my open window,the sound of seagulls,sea lions,the late night and early morning fog…watching the surfers,sailboats,stingrays swimming close to the shore. Going to the wharf for an amazing warm bowl of clam chowder. I took a drive to the Oregon coast about a month ago and was so disappointed. The long drive being one thing,but the atmosphere once I got there and a million other small aspects made the experience enjoy so pleasant. In fact the journey made me more depressed. My heart remains back home. It’s an 8 hour drive which isn’t bad by any means but it’s not something I can take time out to conquer whenever I please. But I am on a mission to get back as soon as I can. I watch videos almost nightly on YouTube just so I can watch and listen to the waves crash upon the cliffs over in the west side. Or to listen to the laughter of the couples or the children having the absolute time of their life while walking the boardwalk. That was me at one time 😓 I watched said videos before typing this and broke into tears. I just needed somewhere to vent and I’m hoping it’ll help a bit. Hope you all have a great Monday!"
lonely,I don't know,"I don't know - I hate myself with a literal passion, everything I do is stupid I continue to make things worse for myself and never make the right decisions.

I have no forms of social media anymore because I don't feel comfortable being in touch with other people anymore, no one should have to waste their time listening to my shjt that's irrelevant and stupid. I don't know where I go from here I get nervous whenever I'm out the house and I work a 8-5 5 days a week just to waste all the money I make on drink and drugs whenever the weekends comes around because for some reason it's the only thing that temporarily helps but ends up being permanently worse after each time because I hate myself more and more every time. I don't know what to do I'm not getting help from anyone, probably just smoke a joint and let it go away for a few hours, and repeat.and repeat, til I can't.

I don't want attention or someone to care I just need to say something every so often or I feel like I'm going to burst, people caring just makes it harder I dont deserve anyone too I've done it to myself but talking my mind seems to be the only therapeutic thing I've found other than getting high"

lonely,I really need a Doomer/Wojak friend(s),"I really need a Doomer/Wojak friend(s) - I'm alone since 2016. Never left my house except for college/work because of my parents and their habit of instilling fear regarding people, trips, etc. The thing with loneliness is that at first it kinda seems easy and comfortable but for some people like me, after a few years it will start acting like a trap from which you really want to break free. So getting a partner is pretty out of reach for me due to my looks and my conversation skills. Also people tend to ignore/ghost wojaks/doomers so getting a normal friend is also out of reach for me. The only option now is to spend the rest of my life alone.

But what if I have at least another wojak/doomer(s) by my side and me for him/her/them? At least we ain't gonna be alone. At least we have someone to curse at life together, hangout and do stuff that you never could do because you didn't have friends, etc. In fact, even better, I would love to be part of a group of wojaks/doomers hanging out together.

So if you are a wojak/doomer and you live nearby(Bangalore India) and aged between 20-24 feel free to DM me. Please don't suffer alone. Let's suffer together and slightly reduce the burden of loneliness 🙂."

Because there are so many people I thought that someone out there must get on with me and could be my friend I just have to find them.

But I’ve met so many people, and I’m realising that maybe it’s not true. There isn’t anyone in the world who I get on with in the way I want. There might be people I could be friends with but not super close, spending all our free time together and never getting bored because it’s the funnest thing to do.

People always say that nobody’s special, there are loads of people just like you. But actually, no one is like you. And if you’re a social freak like me, there’s a good chance no one in the world has enough in common with you to get on with you. 

The hope that I might have a friend one day keeps me going, because it seems possible. But maybe it’s not, and everything I work hard for and live for just doesn’t exist in real life."

lonely,I feel like I'm missing out on being a teenager sometimes,"I feel like I'm missing out on being a teenager sometimes - (sorry for any errors, I'm writing this late at night and I'm tired)

 Rant:
Hayo, I'm a 15 year old girl. I've been homeschooled for 4 years. it started off great, and I still enjoy it because I can learn things the way I want to and I don't get bullied. But, at the same time, I have become extremely lonely. I have 0 in person friends who are my age. (And yes, I do get out of the house. I take in person teen Martial Arts and I go to local concerts) whenever I attempt to talk to another teen, they look at me like I'm a complete freak. I'll try my hardest to introduce myself, but it always comes off as cringey and weird. Some people will blame this on .e being homeschooled, when really, I know of a lot of homeschooled teens who actually have friends. I have never been good at socializing, even when I was in public school. I have always been awkward and different. All of the public schools near me are trashy and complete shit, I wouldn't feel safe going to public school. I live near the ghetto... too many gangs. 


Now it's been getting harder than ever to deal with the loneliness. I have a lot of online friends, and they are all going to school dances, chilling at the mall with friends, going on dates, going to parties with friends.. and I have to admit. I'm extremely jealous. Don't get me wrong, I love my life. My parents are amazing, and I go to a lot of great concerts. But at the end of the day, I wish I had someone to hang out with and actually talk to In person... Like my age.. who's genuine, and not fake. But again, I'm just really fucking shitty at introducing myself.. Especially in groups of multiple people. I never know the right things to say.. I wanna give a good first impression.. but I also don't wanna lie. People will always tell me to just ""be myself"" so I do, and then I get viewed as a freak. I really don't know how to handle it. It's always just a loose loose situation for me.


When I was younger, I always dreamed of being a teenager. (From watches TV shows, movies, reading books) Now I'm actually a teenager and im experiencing none of the things that I think a teen should experience. For fucks sake, in 15, turning 16 fairly soon... and I haven't even had my first kiss yet! Or anything similar. Infact, nobody has EVER actually even thought of me in a romantic way. I fell like I've been lied to my entire life by media. Altrough.. other teens (including homeschooled teens)  are experiencing the stuff that media shows.. so I really don't know. I'm trying to stay hopeful, but it's really not working out. Any advice is strongly appreciated."

But I'm losing intrest now, losing intrest to live anymore. Idk I'm just 18 i got parents but they're usually busy with their work I've had no one since a long time now. There's this girl i like but I'm afraid of taking a chance on her cause i think I'm not the right guy for her with all this corrupted mind and suicidal thoughts it'll be a suffering for her. I'm more of a hopeless romantic reading philosophy and showing intrest in magical things which are pretty much impossible at this moment in this world. This is not the life i wanna live, i don't need people tbh i just need that one person for the rest of my life, idk but life sucks at this moment for me.

The main reason I am depressed is because of how lonely I am, I’m in High School and I’ve never had/did anything romantic with anyone. Every time I try to talk to a girl romantically I always get extremely nervous and I’m very awkward which doesn’t help. I have two friends that are girls but they are online friends so it’s easy to talk to them, they are my best friends and are both extremely nice. I have feelings for both of them but they obviously don’t feel the same. They just think of me as their Best Friend and It wouldn’t go anywhere anyways because I don’t know them IRL. Every time I see a couple in public or on TikTok I get extremely Jealous/Sad because I see how much they love each other and I just wonder why I can’t have that.

My relatives all went on a trip together and were lost at sea, lost everyone over night.

Love of my life betrayed me.

Haven't been able to bounce back and I feel myself becoming bitter, bitter, and bitter.

What am I fighting for? My purpose? Why am I surviving?

At this moment, I just feel cold, alone, and dead inside.

There was this lady recently who made me feel like I levied levitated when she smiled at me, had to catch my balance a few times with things she told me. To me, she was my lighthouse under a beautiful night of constellations shimmering through the storm I've been experiencing.

All that to say that she hates me now and that lighthouse is now beyond the horizon.

In the end, it seems that everyone has their game and can't really be honest about things anymore.

So here I am, alone, pondering why am I even here anymore."

lonely,Trying to help my wife make friends,"Trying to help my wife make friends - I’ve been with my wife (dating - marriage) about 8 years now. Throughout that time she’s always had a serious difficulty making female friends. It makes me feel terrible because I have a healthy amount of close guy friends, but she has no girlfriends she can consider close. Particularly speaking there’s a friend group that I have been friends with for about a decade (3 married guys). I’ve also known their wives for almost as long. They’ve all known my wife for quite some time now, from the moment I started dating her really. The issue is that all their respective wives seem to take absolutely no interest in truly being friends with my wife. And although I can understand how this is bias coming from me, my wife is one of the kindest, funniest, down to earth women I know. She’s very outgoing and positive and everyone I know in my life loves her. Even the wives of my friends, on a surface level get along with her and seem to like her as well. I’ve seen her initiate conversations with all of them, invite them out, try to ask them questions to get to know them better. All the things you’d expect out of someone who is sincerely trying to make friends. The issue is that when it comes to a real friendship forming, it never happens. They are in their own world amongst them 3, and never include her in outings, group chats, photos, etc. It’s become an issue because my guy friends invite me and my wife to do things with them regularly, but my wife feels perpetually out of place because she can’t break the clique barrier that she feels is there. Furthermore, my wife isn’t a desperate, people pleasing type person, so if she feels she’s being thought of as not good enough or excluded on purpose, she closes up and it becomes hard to convince her to give the situation a chance. I’m at a crossroad because part of me feels like I should have her express her feelings to the girls (seeing as that we have such a long history), but at the same time I don’t feel like it would help anything, because it might just be seen as a desperate attempt for approval. At the same time, I can’t just cut off my friends because not only won’t that help the situation, I know it would make my wife feel terrible. But I can feel this situation is reaching a breaking point with her where she will simply cut them all off and I’m not sure how that will affect my relationships. Of course if that’s what she needs I am willing to support her. But I would like to avoid buring bridges. I can admit that there are some issues that I can identify that may be at the root of the problem. First of all, these aren’t all my best friends. Only one of them is. That friend has always told me that he and his wife see us as their closest friends, and that now that my wife and I are married They see my wife as a sister. But that has never actually been the reality in relation to how his wife treats mine. She’s cordial and we hang out from time to time but there’s never any real connection that forms between them. my relationship with these guys has fluctuated not because of any issues we’ve had but just because they’ve always been in different phases of life than me. For instance they all started dating their current wives before I dated mine. They all got married around the same time whereas I married my wife 1-4 years after they did. Now they’re all having babies and we don’t want a child. Also, my wife is Trinidadian, and all their wives are Hispanic so they have an underlying connection that they don’t share with my wife. Although I don’t think that it’s right that those differences should make it so hard for us all to get along, my wife is convinced that it might have something to do with ethnic background. Not that she thinks they’re racist but she thinks that the fact that they’re all Hispanic has added a layer of difficulty to them accepting her as a friend. I’ve never had issues making friends with guys and I’ve always been perplexed at why it seems many women tend to have issues making good friends of the same gender. From what I’ve observed their friendships tend to be competitive, shallow, and full of insecurities. So it’s very hard for me to connect to her situation and give her good advice. I’ve done all I know to do to keep her patient and positive with the situation. And of course I can’t nor do I want to force her to try to get along with people who are clearly not interested in her value as a friend. I’m hoping someone can help me navigate this situation."

Imagine being taught this kind of stuff at the age when you're supposed to socialize a lot.
I thought everything would change after entering high school and I would live a colorful life. But things got even worse. I got more and more introverted. Because of my poker face none would approach me.

lonely,Living in fear,"Living in fear - I had a really rough childhood and it has left me scarred in ways that I can hardly put in to words. As of recently, it has gotten to the point where I am having nightmares that continue to increase in frequency as well as intensity. Tonight, I want to try for the first time in a very long time to articulate my daily struggle in hopes that maybe it is heard. Here’s also hoping that maybe venting will help me cope. 

Every single day without fail, I live my life utterly terrified of other people. I can’t be in a room full of people for too long without getting extremely anxious. My heart beat picks up, my mind starts to race, and I lose my focus. All my emotions get pushed aside so I can appear as though I have it all together. When I leave the social situation, I’m always asking myself whether or not I came off to them as a bad person and I begin shaming myself. I also have to physically catch my breath and comfort myself on my worst days. 

Whenever somebody even so much as looks at me, it feels as though they can see all of my flaws and are judging me for them. This leaves me feeling ashamed and it makes me wish that I were just invisible.

Loud noises startle me so badly and can even almost send me into a panic on my worst days. This also happens if people are loud around me. If someone shouts, I presume that they’re yelling at me and I get this sense of dread and shame. This also happens when someone around me is mad or sad. I also worry that it’s my fault and it results in the same emotional response. 

Because of these issues and more, I do my best to avoid talking to other people as much as humanly possible. I can’t even make a phone call without my anxiety rapidly spiking to panic inducing levels. I put up so many walls in fear of being hurt. 

The worst part about it is that I don’t always like this life I’ve chosen for myself. I try to tell myself that I can make it on my own and that I don’t need anyone’s help or company, but then I look around and I see people forming friend groups. I see other people communicating happily and without worry or shame. God how I wish that I could do what they do. They always make it look so easy. 

Making friends is so extremely hard for me. It’s made even harder by the fact that I’m plagued by the sense that none of my thoughts, feelings, or anything hold any value to anyone. Not to mention I also have this fear that someone is going to come out and say the harshest thing imaginable to me and just destroy me. Is it silly that I worry about that more than about whether or not someone will physically hurt me?

I’m not sure if these paragraphs make any sense, but I just needed to get it out there somewhere. Daily life is such a huge struggle for me and I am just so tired of suffering like this every day."
lonely,I wanna feel loved.,"I wanna feel loved. - I don't think I've ever felt true love before.. from anyone. And I think it's part of the reason why I feel like I'm so hard to love. Even my brother told me ""you're hard to love"" and ""you're not lovable"" years ago and it's something I've held on to and will probably be something I'll never forget.

It's just upsetting because I do everything in my power to love on and make everyone happy and feel loved, but yet I'm not lovable? Yeah that's hurts.

I feel like I push people away because I don't wanna get disappointed. I'm very easy to please.. literally the smallest things make me happy. I'm trying not to be hard to love, but I don't really know how the proper way to do that is. I just wanna be truly and genuinely loved. And I'm terrified I won't ever have that or feel that."

     I have a coworker, who moved up really fast in the company and became my boss 7 months in. He kept saying his gf and I should hang because we’re so similar. Having not had a healthy/real social life in awhile, I gave it a shot when she eventually asked me to chill. It was kinda awkward and she felt like she was asking me all the questions, but it felt like it was a really one sided conversation on my end as well. Anyway it went the worst way I possibly could have imagined, and we didn’t dislike each other she had a nice vibe but we didn’t exactly hit it off. This was my first chance in awhile and I sucked at it. I want to try it one more time and if I don’t like it I’m done. But I can’t help but feel like this is gonna be my life forever. Lonely asf.

I kinda liked her then but I wasn't really sure. And then I cut her off sometime between then and now. Because she basically treated me like someone she can just hit up to game with when there's no one else around. A second priority. At least that's what I felt like.

Now I woke up from a romantic dream involving her. Nothing too x rated but basically a textbook romance with kissing hugging etc. And I don't even remember my dreams 99% of the nights.

I don't think I'm gonna do anything about it. I cut her off and she lives too far for me to have a proper relationship where I'm at in my life (barely 20, no car nor license, late work times in retail)

I’m a social butterfly. I have a lot of acquaintances in my life, I have no problems socializing or meeting people. But for some reason, no one wants to be close to me for very long. I don’t know what I’ve done to become so deeply isolated. Why doesn’t anyone see the value in my friendship, or want to partake in all the fun, love, and excitement I have to offer…. I just want people to be close to. Best friend(s), family, a significant other, even my own child doesn’t really like me much of the time. I try so damn hard to please everyone, to be generous and courteous. I love life, I’ve found so much joy in everything it has to offer.

They hangout in the middle of the night and when I have to get back to my dorm it’s like 3am and I get scared and tell them if they walk me back but they don’t want to. So I kinda avoid hanging out with them during those hours. 

I just spend all my time alone in the dorm in silence. Sometimes I forget how my voice sounds like until my roommate comes back. I don’t know what to do most of the times because I lost interest in my hobbies. 

I tried to make online friend and online dating but it ended up being bad because it overwhelms me so much that it spikes up my anxiety.

Anyways that’s a summary without the extra details. I’m glad I’m currently in finals season and then I’ll be back home where I feel comfortable and at peace for a while."

I heard her yelling at him and crying while he was yelling at me. I feel like shit. I just cause drama and I feel awful about that, but I just do before I think. I know I am irrelevant to her life now but I don't know how to meet new people so she's still extremely relevant to mine, at least in my head."

It just makes me angry seeing other people have fun."

lonely,I wish I had someone I could just say random things to,"I wish I had someone I could just say random things to - It’s exactly as the caption makes it seem. I wish I had someone I could just say whatever to without being judged or feel like I am bothering them. I don’t have that many friends and the ones I do have don’t really care. It’s probably a me problem that I don’t have friends but since I can’t pinpoint what’s exactly wrong with me, I can’t solve it. I just want to have someone to tell dumb shit to, like how much I want to move to a place with a lot of rain, or how I’m still not over my ex, or how I wrote a folk song about bugs. I’m lonely. I’ve never been close with any family. I’m so isolated from my siblings that I’m essentially an only child and they’re strangers to me. My dog doesn’t even hang with me that much. I’ve never had anyone who has wanted to be around me first, I am always the one to ask to hang out, always the second choice when someone asks me. No one really cares about me, or if they do they haven’t made it clear. It’s a disease. A chronic illness. I have always had it and probably always will. The only thing I want is for a person to want me, to like me, the way I like others. I personally think that thats not too much to ask for, but I guess I’m wrong on that as well."
lonely,I just want the world to die,"I just want the world to die - Everything brings me pain and serves as a constant reminder of how fucked up I am...how I don't belong here, anywhere. There's nothing the world has offered me but pain and lies and I fucking hate it all. Why can't it all die? Why do I have to kill myself for it all to end?...I know it's entirely my problem, my warped, fucked up perverse  perception of reality. My life..it's just mentally exhausting to live. Hating without reason, trying to escape it, to better myself and failing. Almost like it's my fucking destiny...why do I have to look like this? Feel this.. I don't want to fucking be this but there's no escape. No answer, I'm just cursed...I don't even want to die..anybody. I just can't appreciate life in any case. Its a nightmare I can't escape"

Once again, I have nobody. I spent my childhood having next to nobody, you'd think I'd be ready for this.

But... somehow... I am filled with dread and despair."
lonely,Did the pandemic affected your social life?,"Did the pandemic affected your social life? - I wonder if I’m not the only one but it seems thd pandemic really affected me in a way I become so introvert and loney.

Before the pandemic I used to have plenty of friends, a relationship and also, I felt with more positive thoughts. But nowdays, I feel less talkative with others, I feel nervous to talk to others, and I wasn’t like that before. I broke uo with my girlfriends, I fought with my friends and I constantly fighting with family members. It seems overthinking thoughts are more often nowdays than before and I’m always thinking about hating others."

lonely,I don't get it,I don't get it - In my year and a half of college I made 2 true friends. 2 people that I hung out with outside of class or sports people that I hung out with just to hang out with. They were the thing that kept me going every week. The reason I pushed through shitty day after shitty day. Then one switched to online school and I didn't hear from them anymore. Then when we stopped having class together the other disappeared as well. It's not a distance issue we all live within 30 minutes of campus. I just don't understand how two people could be my whole world and to them I'm basically nobody. At least not somebody important enough to keep up with and put any effort in.
lonely,"if they want to, let em","if they want to, let em - If they pass you up and dont want to be your friend, let em

If they dont want to date you. Fine, let em eat shit haha their loss 

If they leave you on read and dont give a shit, let em 

If they dont see your value, let em FUCK OFF 

If they want to reach out and know you, LET EM. 

If they wanna be an emotionless shell of a human being all by themselves, let em

If they want to give you their time, energy, and love... let them... 

You deserve amazing things. Understand your value. You gotta let people show who they really are, for better or worse. 

Its gonna be alright."

lonely,Never had a genuine friend or any female friends,"Never had a genuine friend or any female friends - This might be all over the place. But I never had a real friend growing up. It was always my twin brother by my side but we go through the same thing in a way. School and soccer always kept me from trying to make any genuine connections and conversations with anyone. I made “friends” in school but never hung out with any of them outside of it. Never went to any parties or other functions partly due to my parents, but it still made me feel some type of way. I see my “friends” now doing stuff with people I know while I’m here at home doing nothing or studying or training. It started to weigh me down to the point of me being envious to my older sisters who talks to their friends every day or hangs out with them every weekend.

I don’t even have a friends phone number on my phone besides my family’s or work related numbers. I’m 24 now and it’s becoming painful how lonely I am. I’ve actually tried going out to events, bars, or other social settings to make friends but it’s so hard for me. Especially having social anxiety, it’s like I can’t never put my best foot forward. It’s even harder trying to talk to women. Im just unlucky or something I honestly don’t know. Is it how I look or come off to them? No clue. But I never grab their attention. It’s not hard making conversations with others guys as I had small group of in HS, but majority of my friends in college was from me being on the soccer team. 

But it’s more like people knew who I was from something than knowing who I am as a person. It’s hurts when even my parents ask me why don’t I don’t hang or go out friends and I have to tell them that I don’t have any. I do love talking to people. Either deep, thought provoking convos or silly dumb ones. I have lot I want to speak on but I don’t want to make it so long. I just found this subreddit and felt like it was the place for me. The only thing I have going for me know is my love for music and trying to make music and my family.I just hate being a loner and want to make real friends who understands me and have connections with, both men and women."

lonely,lonely and introverted,"lonely and introverted - I'm struggling to understand my emotions. I basically  cut everyone out my life for different reasons. I still have my family but no friends. I just cut off my ex of three years about a month ago. (Emotionally draining and toxic) 
I cut off friends for different reasons such as remaining stagnant and no making efforts to better themselves 
Or just realizing they weren't my friend as much as I was theirs.
It feels amazing to drop all of those connections, but I'm struggling. I'm struggling with wanting someone or a group of people to do things with or share experiences. At the same time I have no desire or energy to reach out or maintain a conversation with anyone. This has bothered me since i cut my ex off. Im not sure what I'm looking for writing this but it feels good to let it out somewhere I know someone will see it. I miss having connections where I feel free to share secrets or feelings. Again I have my family who is super loving but I don't feel comfortable being myself like I did with old friends. Rant over."

Why should I stay alive. There's nothing for me here. There's nothing I enjoy in this life. The only things keeping me from blowing my head off is a mix of not wanting my pets to miss me and fear that there's an afterlife. I don't want an afterlife I want to cease existence completely. I feel nothing but bitterness and hatred towards the world. The only thing that can make life worth it would be if someone loved me but that's also the one thing that's completely unobtainable. God someone just end my fucking life already. Kill me already. KILL ME ALREADY
lonely,is there?,"is there? - Whenever I write something on the google search bar, a part of me feels relief that some hacker, agent or whatever is watching me, and that there is someone, that knows what I think.

i told myself after him i was gonna be alone and its for the best but it also sucks not having someone to talk to romantically but thats just something im going to have to release. i dont NEED a guy to talk to."
lonely,Feeling lonely af,Feeling lonely af - Sunday’s are probably the days when I feel alone the most because I never have anything to do.

Everyone was busy today so I mostly just stayed in bed just sleeping.
lonely,I don't even know how I still have the energy to wake up every day.,"I don't even know how I still have the energy to wake up every day. - So basically I've never posted anything on Reddit before so I hope I don't mess up. I'm basically gonna summarize my story from approximately 3 months ago. 

I am a 14 year old male in high school right now and my life has been a mess ever since quarantine. For an entire two years of my life I didn't speak to a single person. All my friends have forgotten about me except one.

I met this one girl who invited me to sit with her and two other girls. We became friends and I was still depressed and felt horrible everyday. At the same time during lunch, I was bullied by this group of people and they were horrible and I felt horrible everytime.

This one girl in that group of friends, hugged me for the first time in my life. That feeling, I miss it so much, my entire week felt amazing just from that. She stoped after like two weeks and only hugged me four times. I felt horrible after that, I was wondering what I did wrong. I've been hugged two more times by one toher girl since then, and one of those times was when I started crying in class. I love my four friends so much, if I didn't have them, I dont know how I would survive.

I introduced one of those girls to my friend that was a guy and after only after like a week of knowing each other, they started hugging everyday, and holding hands and stuff. They were doing that as friends by the way. I'm so jealous of them and wish I could do that with her.

Now, I'm in my room and I cry every single night from saddness and loneliness. I know I should be grateful for at least some friends but the stress and everything is too much for me.

If you actually read everything thank you so much for spending your time, I spent so long writing this."

The greatest thing that ever happened to me gone. I would give anything to see him again talk to him just one more time. I'm so depressed and lost without him. The pot to my lid
lonely,I am so depressed,"I am so depressed - One of my friends that I haven’t seen since January invited me to go eat with him and another group of friends. And I know them all but it’s just that I am usually a quiet person and I don’t do well in big groups. I should of said no but I didn’t want to turn down the offer since he invited me. The whole time at the restaurant, everyone was talking to each other and laughing, meanwhile I was on my phone scrolling, playing games extremely awkward.. everyone having a fun time except me… I feel left out and a outcast. The restaurant was packed and everyone had a group of friends and they were all talking, laughing and having a great time… 

I am so lonely and depressed, I want a girlfriend but my conversation skills are terrible. I’m in my last semester of college and graduating this month, I have been in college for 5 years and not once have I found any new friends or got to know a girl. I dont even know how to strike a conversation or hold one, I always leave right after class ends and go home. I’m so tired and exhausted…"
lonely,Just hurts,Just hurts - So I never really was able to show emotions as a kid and now as an adult I can’t cry I don’t feel anything. Emptiness inside fills me but I just want to be loved. I wave to people in my neighborhood but they don’t wave back. My GF left me last month idk why. 7 years down the drain it was horrible now that I think about it she would never ask how my day was she hardly cares about me the way I care about her. And now I have no one to talk to haven’t told anybody she left. I self sabotage my self to feel hurt. I took my savings and spent it all at the casino but I just got mad for about two hours then woke up fine. I use to drink a lot till I’d pass out on previous break ups because I was so sorry for myself because I couldn’t get any other girl. Then got duis and quit drinking will be 3 years this month. I went out to the club last night got a Red Bull and tried to talk to some girls but didn’t pull any. I started working out last week too so hopefully it helps. No one ever even calls me to see how I’m doing and I’m dying inside but the hurt never comes out I feel it turning my stomach and heart pain frog in my throat head throbbing but idk where I’m going with this just something I can’t tell anyone because I have no one to talk to…

lonely,I dont understand,"I dont understand - So tomorrow is my birthday. I turn 38. Ive been divorced for over 10 years, no kids and  few friends, and super small family. My familiy put together a shitty cake for me yesterday and rushed through the celebration to move on to their own activities. I understand others have their own things, but man, it was painful. And today has been lonely and painful and I have nothing planed for tomorrow other than work… I don’t understand why life has turned out like this for me. I have put myself out there to find a relationship but everything seems to fizzle out … and now i feel old. I feel like i was a good catch and now i missed my opportunity. I have tried being positive and not focusing on that too much.. but i have to come to terms that my life is just me my job and my dog… my dog has been with me for 13 years and she is slowly fading which is super hard to think the end is coming, and so even more loneliness and heartbreak is in the horizon. My heart is broken by my view on what life should look like.. and by the people who have come into my life and chosen not to stay. Ive tried to be strong to keep going but i dont want to wake up tomorrow to 38 with the same life ive been having. I pray to God to let me see my life’s purpose so that i can be ok with my loneliness but i can only feel my heart’s desire to be loved and married again . I cant stop crying rn.  I feel like everyone else is too busy for me. I reach out to friends and extended family but everyone’s always postponing plans we make or just busy… some people dont even answer. I feel bad, man i just feel like shit. Im not an introvert, im outgoing and friendly, im not shallow and work hard i dont ask anyone for anything, i support myself,  and im not horrible to look at… i don’t understand i really dont.

I'm a learned extrovert that spends quite a bit of time on the computer and just had the brilliant idea to try to meet strangers online! (wouldn't my mother be so proud) If you'd like someone to chat with, I'm pretty much open to talk about anything you'd like. You can tell me about your favorite or newest hobby, about your favorite book, or you could even vent to be about what a dork Bill from accounting was this week. (Darn Bill!)

Incase you'd like a sense of who I am, here's some fun facts about me:

* I live in the midwestern region of the USA.
* My favorite food is pasta. Just give me noodles plus an absurd amount of sauce and I'll usually be happy.
* My newest hobby is game development. Very early into this, but I'm learning a lot!
* Sadly I have no pets... Not allowed to have them where I live but I'm real close to sneaking a dog into the situation.

Hope to hear from you soon! Even if you're just passing by and don't care to respond, I hope you have a great day!"

lonely,I genuinely don’t understand,"I genuinely don’t understand - I don’t understand how someone is so lucky that they can become attracted to someone who will like them back. I’ve never in my life experienced where I’ve had a crush on someone and they liked me back. I’ve never experienced falling in love with someone, never held hands, never hugged someone and it pains me that I haven’t. And the fact that some people say relationships are overrated or it’s nothing special when they’re in one or have been in one hurts me more. Every time I’ve liked a person it’s always been one sided. I just want to experience the happiness of falling in love with someone or at least being able to like someone who likes me back. Is that too much to ask?"

lonely,I never learned how to have a real connection with people and at this point I don't think I ever will,"I never learned how to have a real connection with people and at this point I don't think I ever will - I was a military brat growing up and that definitely contributed to this. When i was in first grade, one of my only two ""friends"" was mean as fuck to me for no reason and the other friend like her more. In 5th grade my two new friends liked each other more and would do stuff like go to the movies during their sleep overs and never did that with me, then they both left me for other people in middle school. The new group of friends I met had known each other basically their whole childhood up until that point. 

Thats how it's been my entire life. I try to join peoples groups but i can never really make it in and eventually they just fade out of my life. 

I decided I was gonna put myself out there and actually try to make friends when i went to college, but that still happened. I literally got replaced by someone who was more popular than me. 

Now im a junior. I thought I had something with this classmate, and eventually we started having casual makeouts. It's pathetic, but it's the closest i've had to a serious relationship. She even convinced me to be an RA with her over the summer. 

Lately she hasn't been talking to me as much. I wanted to get food after dnd with her and she completely blew me off and got food with her roommate. I was worried I was starting annoying her, but decided i was being anxious and over dramatic. I got the confidence to ask her if she wanted to room together during the RA thing, sure she would be excited, and she just said ""I'll think about it,"" and i tried to save myself by saying ""that's okay, i'll be fun to meet new people with the randomly selected roommates"" and she like the message and didn't say anything else.

Obvs there's more to my relationship with her but i'm p sure it's over at this point and I don't know why. I don't know why it's so hard to make friends and foster that kind of relationship. I don't know why it seems so effortless for everyone else and I can barely keep up with having more than 2 people in my life. I dont know what's wrong with me and I don't know if i'll ever be able to fix it. I cant live like this the rest of my life."
lonely,"It is the work that is saving, comforting me, and giving me pride","It is the work that is saving, comforting me, and giving me pride -  Unfortunately, but I have to admit, I am not obsessed with work, but the research works are saving me from being lonely. That is so weird to find it.

After joining the Ph.D. journey for years, my personality is being totally changed. I used to talk with people, hang out with friends, drink in the bar, and enjoy being crowded with strangers without feeling awkward. But now, I prefer to be alone and am afraid of the loud downtowns on weekends.

What are lefts to me are only the research, experiments, and papers, which make me feel safe.

I don't know how to describe that. But feel that I cannot recognize myself anymore.

Whenever one of them posts something new about their life on FB (like new job or new boyfriend), I'll congratulate them and ask them more about it in our group chat. Well apparently that rubs them the wrong way and they think I'm being nosy and invasive by asking them simple questions about their lives. I got into a fight with 2 of them this morning since they were hating on me for asking questions. I'm pissed at them and hate them now. For anything in the future, I'm not going to bother asking them any questions at all about their lives since they're so pissy about it. I was just taking an interest in their lives like any normal ""friend"" but whatever. Obviously we're not as close as I once thought we were."

lonely,The truth about my loneliness,"The truth about my loneliness - I'm a 25 male from Tunisia, my culture encourages sociable behavior and puts great emphasis on community values. I felt disconnected from all the social fuzz ever since I was a little, on the surface I had friends and a normal community life but deep down I didn't really trust people and always felt ashamed of myself, probably because of my parents and because of my own internalized thoughts and patterns of thinking. Things were fairly normal but started slowly getting worse and worse until I got where I am today, I'm 25 and I only have one close friend and few meaningless acquaintances and old friends from my town  (I cut off so many close friends because of my radical borderline reactions and behavior sometimes).    


I'm not quitting on my life, I crave friends and I want to fix all the mistakes I've made and cure my social anxiety, but my own thoughts are blocking me, and this is the point I'm trying to make: I feel like I lost the opportunity of having ""true social life"" which is in my definition being a true part of the local community (my town) and having connections in one way or another with all the people there, basically like any other person in town. I feel like I want to have solid roots and a deep connection with my town before I can go out to the world and know different people, I don't have that connection, and because of that I feel ostracized and a ""no body"", I say to myself how can a person have a future without having a past? Without having an origin? That's how I perceive my culture.  


Possible solutions:

\- I completely start over in a place far away (could end up really bad).  
\- I try to reconnect with my community and I sacrifice more years of my life and more energy that could be used in different things such as investing in my career and making money.  
\- Accept the situation, suck it up, and get out to the world knowing that I will never find myself where I want to be.

lonely,Loneliness (?) is slowly consuming me,"Loneliness (?) is slowly consuming me - Hello everyone

Firstly, I want to apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors, english isn't my native language

I'm not sure where to start, so I just do as I feel like..

I don't have many friends. In fact, there's only one person I consider as a real friend- everyone else in my life just seems to be a temporary appearance, which I might even get along with, but won't ever create any deeper connection to- probably because of my own fault

At the moment there are some people I might call friends, but those are only very loose connections, and it's feeling more like ""better acquaintances""

And there's also someone I'm chatting with since quite a while, but we actually don't really know each other because we met on reddit. That was quite a comfort because I actually felt like I got along very good with this person, but somehow this changed at some point and now we're barely chatting anymore.

Although I'm not completely socially incompetent I really struggle to approach people, get to know them and afterwards actually keep the friendship going 

With my more introverted personality, especially in my past, I allways was rather shy and reserved in presence of others, and even though I managed to make some friends at school, I lost contact to them pretty much the same day I left school.

Overall, I feel like social interactions sometimes still challenge me, but I got better in handling them. That does mostly only apply to superficial contact though. 

Due to all of that I feel like I have only comparably small experience in basically any subject that requires social skills, what really causes me to feel somewhat inferior to others. 

When I think of my life in retrospect I can't really find a point in which I was happy. Of course I'm not always sad, it's not like I can not enjoy anything, it's more like my general state of mind has been overshadowed by some melancholic feeling since I can remember. It's sometimes more, sometimes less noticeable, but always there.

Now I'm 22 years old and I feel like my life is already over- I've been feeling like I'm just existing for more than the last two years. Like I have no purpose

I sometimes ask myself if my severe loneliness is the only cause for how I am feeling, but I'm not sure about this. That's also the reason I put the (?) in the title.

The thought of my life going to stay like this makes me anxious. It feels like my current state slowly but surely consumes me. I'm losing interest in things I used to like, I barely can sense excitement or joy for things and overall my whole emotional state feels kinda dull. 

I don't think that I am depressed, at least that's what I assume. But I do think that I'm on the best way to actually getting a depression if it goes on like this

And the best part of all of this is that I am completely aware of the fact that I am the major problem in my life, so I can't really blame others for my situation, and if then only to a small degree

I honestly don't even know what my first intention of starting this text even was. Probably to feel less lonely by writing something instead of just staring at the ceiling

Thanks for making it that far, kind stranger"
lonely,I just can’t make friends and I’m so sick of always being alone. I’m sad all the time.,"I just can’t make friends and I’m so sick of always being alone. I’m sad all the time. - I’m so sick of being alone and having no one. Literally NO ONE. 

Throughout my 30s, I had friends. A lot of them. 3 of them (sisters) were my very best friends since I was 10 yrs old. Well, at 10, the eldest of the 3 was my age, in my same 5th grade class, and we both rode the same bus to and from school. And we lived a path through the woods to one another’s houses. I was a new student. With a mean older sister who has never wanted anything to do with me. We lived in a huge old house, with wings, and a library and shit. But it was my grandfathers home. He was cheap and cruel - aside from the mom beatings and locking us away in the attic, it was a very ‘Flowers in the Attic’ kinda family vibe. 

Those sisters see each 4 yrs apart. So the the other 2 and I bonded over time - real friends as adults. Both had -our families. Both had outdoorsy fun-lovin’ adventurous dads who loved to joke around. They were the sisters I wished I had had. I never understood why my own sister was so rejecting of me. She always has been and it continues to this day. 

In my 30s, I hung out with a huge group of party types, hippies, Grateful Dead lovers. Grand ‘ole time. Falling in with them was like a fate I look back on and realize, wish, had I just shown up 5 mins later, or left 5 mins later. If I’d just stopped for gas or to bring some beer, or simply drive just a tiny bit slower, maybe hit 1 single red light on the way to my 30th bday party at the condo or the above mentioned friend… my whole life would be different. Better. Showing up, at the moment this girl was leaving…I knew her sister from us. As soon as we passed one another -I entering and she exiting- she wouldn’t have targeted me, cornered me and pushed me to go out sometime and give my # to her. She just happened to have stopped by there with someone’s friend. It was a fluke. 

And she pushed a friendship forward with me to the point where I could go along to get along or be cruel. So I did the former. She was a good friend at first. ….within months it became clear she was a raging alcoholic. The first time we hung out, I showed up to this party she invited me to and found her screaming and hysterically sobbing demanding to know where her bf -who was clearly hiding from her- was. 

I said to someone who knew her once and kept saying she was crazy and unstable, that she’s been a great friend so far; that I believed she was just going through some stuff. He said “‘she’s always going thru something”.

Within the next year, I’d become completely entwined with the aforementioned huge hippie group of friends she hung out with. They became my friends…but more aquaintances. It also became readily apparent that she either had bi-polar disorder or - the more likely - Borderline Personality Disorder. Though vastly different, the latter - when coupled with extreme alcoholism - can present as extreme manic episodes followed by extreme depressive episodes. 

And when I say extreme alcoholism, I do mean just that - extreme. 3 duis and a 3 yr license suspension kind of alcoholism. A 2yr nursing degree that she will never be allowed to b licensed to a professional nursing job, nor allowed to work in any type of true caregiver capacity since the above is evidence of addiction and abuse ….of anything. And she does do many other drugs.

So thru my 30s she was in my life and became a horrid friend thanks to the bpd stuff. She set me up with the man I was supposed to marry. And deliberately manipulated events or got involved resulting in many long term and painful breakups. We got engaged when we both realized it was all her. She then managed to turn the above 3 bffs since childhood against me. My best friend the oldest refused to come to my wedding and then said things about me that made no sense and said she didn’t want to ever be my friend again. 30 yrs she was my best friend. She made her sisters choose. So I lost them all. 

The group I’d hung out with for a decade…stopped inviting me out. Even some of the closest friends I had didn’t even invite me to their weddings, while she - the literal gold medal winner of alcoholic disastrous scenes any and everywhere (a night where she showed up, was 100% guaranteed to end very badly and it always did even at weddings). Yet, I was ostracized from my entire group. My 3 best friends turned on me. And she even managed to turn my cousin - who was like a little sister to me me- against me. She blocked me 3 yrs ago and I still don’t know why. I haven’t heard from her since….but it all came back to that girl. 

Due to the constant drama she caused in my relationship with my bf and then fiancé, even tho we’d both cut her out. We went thru a tough few months during our engagement for other reasons. But it just SEEMED like it was a constant thing. It wasn’t. We’d been fine for 3 yrs. But it still felt like this was another huge problem like the ones before. At this point we’d been together for 6 yrs and in the midst of our wedding planning. Even my dress arrived on this day. 

So that night he said he was going to bed, I said I’d b in in 10 mins and when I got to the room, he was gone. His stuff was there, lights on, his personal car was there. But his work car was gone. …I never saw him ever again. 

This August, it will have been 3 yrs since.

I lost every single friend I ever had. And I’ve been living alone for the first time in my life for 3 yrs. And when my dad fought Covid for a year on a ventilator and then died. Not one single “friend” I ever had called, texted, sent flowers to the funeral home, or eve bothered to show up….including the ones that grew up in our home. Despite me being their for them 100% of the time when EACH of their parents died. Not a single word from anyone. I went alone. I sat in the back alone. And then I left alone. 

I go months without speaking to other human beings. My phone doesn’t ring anymore, I don’t even charge it for days. When Indo….I’ve missed nothing. I don’t even get texts. I could literally have a heart attack, a stroke, or choke or something. ….and I would b a rotten corpse before anyone even knew something was off. In all likelihood, I’d b all bones, just a skeleton - no one in my life or family even comes looking for me when months go by without a reply from me….and I almost always reply immediately if something comes thru because I’m so lonely for human interaction. Still…not enough for anyone to give a single shit of concern If i never reply. I’ve evn let my phone get shut off….nothing.

This Xmas, the only text I got was my 15 yr old nephew saying “hi aunt [name]! I’m so excited to see you tonight for Xmas! I miss you! You’re coming right?”

I think I’ll remember that fas having been one of the worst moments of my life for as long as I live….having to tell him that I love him and miss him so much, but that I wasn’t going to be at Xmas, because I didn’t know anything was even happening. I told him “they probably just forgot about me”. Maybe they did… or maybe they just pretended to one another and to themselves that they did, when they simply didn’t care about me enough or want me to Be there at all.”

That was the worst part about losing my fiancé. His family called me daughter and acted like I was to them. They said i was. They always wanted me around. …and I never heard from him….or them …..ever again. I felt like I lost a family that actually loved me. That sucks pretty bad still. 

So now I have no friends. And haven’t heard from a real friend since spring|summer 2019.

I try to Be the best friend to people I can be so they never feel the way I feel. But it doesn’t matter I guess. The shittier people are, the more People seem to care about them. Idk."

Nothing has stuck. - For one, I'm glad this subreddit exists because this is by far the most common feeling I experience every day. It's crazy how difficult it seems to have gotten to make friends these days. I've tried probably over ten times this year. Conversations don't start unless I start them and never last. Starting to really hate texting because I keep getting ghosted. Never mind dating which I somehow keep failing out, apparently even just making friends is just as hard.

I'm sure she didn't mean it but this girl I dated and then stopped because she wanted to be friends instead... I felt shamed because in her words she couldn't understand why I feel the need to talk every other day or so. Sheesh sorry I'm not as independent and can't go a week without wanting to talk to you. And apparently several other of my friends are like this. I get there are people out there like this. Respect. But Idk, I didn't like the way she questioned me like that. 

It's hard finding friends who are willing to talk a few nights and hang out like at least once a week. I don't even know where to go to meet new people. Seems like online is the only way to meet new people, friends, dates, and if you're lucky not get ghosted.. 

I love bird watching but there's no birding groups near me. I love hiking but no hiking groups anywhere close to me. The most social I've been this week is when going to the coffee shops and talking with the baristas and I don't wanna bother them and their time if I wanted to be friends with them. 

Like I've always heard it said that you need to be happy with yourself and love yourself first. But do the people saying that mean that you have to do that in practically isolation? 

All I can really think of doing is just setting a daily schedule for enjoying myself, reading, writing, exercise, watching good movies and shows, and having good me days. But like I wonder how I can refrain from getting sad even when I'm having hundreds of productive ""good"" days if it's just spent alone with myself all the time. Anyone else ever wonder this?"

I've already lost my motivation and I feel more lonely than ever.

I do happen to be lucky and I have people to talk about my things to but it all feels pointless and selfish. I just can't talk about anything to anyone. If someone asks me how my day's been I cannot answer with anything else than ""Oh just fine what about you"". I just can't believe that anyone would actually understand how I'm feeling and I'm not able to explain it myself either.

I have a family and I'm even in an actual good relationship and I'm so grateful for it all. But I still feel so lonely. I can't find a way out of it and I feel so dumb for even considering feeling lonely but I can't do anything about it.
I'm lost and I don't know what to do. Nothing helps and everything hurts.

I'm not sure if this is the exact subreddit to be venting about stuff to because I know there are some actually lonely people here and the last thing I want to do is trigger someone etc.

lonely,any lonely teens on here?,"any lonely teens on here? - I’m wondering if you’d like to join a Reddit group chat :) I’m , people we have so far are , , and ."
lonely,Glad to see I'm not alone.,"Glad to see I'm not alone. - This my first time posting about something this personal and I'd never thought I'd get to the point where I'd be trying to talk to random people on reddit about my personal problems. 

A little about myself:
I'm a 31 year old male. I've have the same job for 10 years working at my parents business where I make very little money because it's a non skilled job. Even then I tend to become lazy and I'm still late for work often even after ten years. To be honest if it wasn't my parents who were my boss I'd be fired a long time ago. 

Even though I use to have friends and girlfriends in high school my crippling anxiety and depression ruined that and I did nothing about it.

Even though people say I'm a good looking guy I've pushed away all of my friends and most of my family. When I get off of work I go straight home and just hang out. My friends stopped trying to hang out.  Also because they all have started a family and most have kids and it seems like life is passing me by so fast it makes my depression worse. I only sit at home and smoke weed and play video games with my brother and sister online sometimes. I've become addicted to porn and I'm very impulsive. I've also become addicted to pills in a bad way. 

During my twenties I've had one girlfriend a few years ago when I was 29 and she was 19.. it lasted a year and the relationship was toxic. She ended up cheating and leaving me.. making me feel that much more of a loser. 

I started to lose my hair because of my addiction and stress. I let my health go even though I'm skinny and semi fit. 

My social anxiety Is so bad that I won't even leave my house if my neighbors are outside for the fear of them striking up a conversation and me telling them that I'm a single high school education loser with no motivation for my future and no goals. 

I just want to be better slowly but surely. Any encouragement would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you for taking the time and reading this."
lonely,No One To Stand Up For Me,"No One To Stand Up For Me - A lot of the time I catch myself daydreaming about someone standing up for me. Someone noticing I'm left out, someone reaching out and pointing out where things aren't right in terms of how I've been treated. Someone giving me advice.

When I was young, I noticed people actively helping others get farther in life (introducing them to potential dates, helping them get job interviews). I have to do absolutely everything on my own. No one to help me make any decisions or give feedback. It's just me, myself, and I."
lonely,I'm on another planet,"I'm on another planet - A different plane of existence from everyone else it seems. All the people I come into contact with, all my life and not a single connection formed...I'm empty on my own. I don't feel like a person or alive at all. Life genuinely feels like a self aware dream where everything is easily discardable except the fact I can't connect w a single being. So more like a nightmare I can never awake from, hell even...I even hate ppl but I still desire them. I dont even understand them..I'm incapable of caring but I just want them. It doesn't make any fucking sense. I can't connect w ppl and still. That's why I'm fucking cursed. To live an empty existence and desire what I hate"

lonely,Have a partner and daughter but no friends,"Have a partner and daughter but no friends - I stopped drinking a few months ago, but even before then, I’d barely seen my friends (pandemic, having new baby etc). 

Now, I may as well be invisible. 

I literally don’t do anything apart from work (from home), go to the gym and go out with my partner and daughter or on a date with her every other week. 

It sucks - she has her friends that she goes out with and I genuinely have no one who asks if I want to do anything anymore. 

Just venting."

I just saw the scene where Fleabag shares a bed with her estranged sister and they just silently hold each other and that set me off so bad.

It’s so weird how I have good family and friends but still feel so alone and desperate for someone to hold me.

I just want someone to do those things for me because they really want to rather than them thinking I need it. Idk"
lonely,why?,"why? - Why do I let my self get consumed by thoughts of what others think of me even though I know I'm the last person that goes through their minds.

I don't want to be annoying. I'm what I call socially awkward and find it hard to make friends, I feel like my current friends are either too busy or they just 'put up with me' 

I try to keep myself busy with reading fantasy books, playing game on my switch/pc or even just watching things on the TV, but it just gets repetitive and I feel like I'm stuck in a endless and meaningless loop.

I'm stuck and don't know what to do. I can't keep relying on my husband to entertain me, he has his own friends and I don't want to interfere.

Maybe I'm depressed, maybe I just need a someone to talk to? I don't know, I suck at this."

lonely,Context for loneliness,"Context for loneliness - When i was a kid I was raised by just my mum after my dad committed suicide when I was a year old. Really I'd say my sister raised me. My mum was an alcoholic for a large part of my growing up and would spent most days in bed and most nights talking to people on a C.B radio. There would be times where she would disappear for weeks at a time, there would be times where we'd be locked in our rooms with the upstairs electricity turned off so we had no light and times where my birthdays were forgotten. I used to have a fond memory of visiting my sisters school one day and all the other girls in class looking after me, but I found out when my mum passed away that it was because she moved in with a guy  and his kids in a differnet town and didn't tell us. We used to pay for electricity back then putting money into a meter and we had no money so we'd spend the nights by candle light playing board games. We had a gas oven and we'd eat fish cake sandwiches. I remembered them as fond memories, but the reality - wow.

Growing up I was always guarded. I couldn't let anyone get close and fully trust them and this put a lot of people off. When I allowed people in I would scare them away when they saw the real me. The amount of times I would warn people and be reassured is too many to count. I worked at a place for 5 years and only two people knew my private life. One left after 6 months and I didn't speak to them for over 10 years and the other was killed when a car hit him. I remember my boss hearing me talking to my then girlfriend and not believing I was talking to someone and taking the phone from me to confirm I actually had a girlfriend. When that place shut down I didn't say goodbye to anyone. I went to the work party, but didn't have a group to talk to. I tried to get drunk, tried to join in and even tried to dance, but it felt so forced so after an hour or so I left. I remember seeing a woman I sat next to called Charli walking towards me a few weeks after and said ""hi"" and she blanked me. I'd sat next to her for 5 years, helped her make my Yoko Littner cosplay outfit inbetween calls. Helped her when she passed out due to suffering from panic attacks. Blanked. 

But it didn't surprise me really. It's just par for course."
lonely,I’m tired of dealing with everything,"I’m tired of dealing with everything - This is just a dump of how I’m feeling. I have struggled with the feeling of guilt since I’ve been a kid. Watching my family work hard to earn every single penny to hearing my mom talking about how grateful we should be and that we should be cognizant about where we have reached and from where. 

But instead of feeling grateful or anything, it would invoke this feeling of guilt every time I would have “fun”. All I’ve seen is my parents prioritize spending time and money on things that are “needed” than what they “wanted”. This made me also always question this feeling of having fun and whether it was right or wrong. Somewhere I realize now that coming back from college to me home country and city and spending time with my family again, I started internalizing this again. I stopped myself from being in positions where I need to spend money to enjoy my time. Whether it be going out to club (which is an activity deep down I do have fun in as well) or going on a trip with friends, I would overthink and feel like I don’t deserve to have fun. Lately, I have started fearing such situations, I feel excited making plans but scared to follow through and go. Im working on this lately changing my mindset from productivity to being happy, but everyday something reminds me that I’m not worth anything because I may not have a direction in life.

I know this entire thing doesn’t make sense but idk this is what’s in my head and I just want it out. I feel so many things these days, I’m tired. 

I feel alone: I know we are alone in this life and that reality is what you make of it, etc. but lately every second of my life im aware of that fact and it’s only made me feel more isolated and lonely all the time.

I feel guilty: I feel guilty of being the bad guy in my parents eyes, I feel guilty of not spending time with them but I find myself in a constant debate with myself about if I want to or not and somewhere I always choose the latter. But I’m tired of trying to fix stuff, I’m tired of facing this issue. Im always aware of the flaws in my parents and that is a struggle I need to get out of where I need to accept them as human and also accept them. But somewhere that acceptance hasn’t come yet. All I see are flaws that make me irritated everytime I spend time with them.

I feel lost: I feel completely lost in life. I don’t know what I like, I don’t know what I want to do, I don’t know how to disassociate productivity with my life, I don’t know how to live honestly, like not in a suicidal way but in a I don’t know how to be happy in life anymore. One second I feel good spending time with people, the next I feel completely alone and lost. I don’t know how to get out of it either.

I feel tired: I’m just tired of dealing with all this, I’m tired with chasing after happiness, I’m tired of just having to make the most of where I am. Idk I’m just tired. I struggle to get out of bed 99% of the time, I struggle finding the motivation to gain control of my life, I just feel tired.

That’s my rant. I know I need to work on this and I am, slowly, but I am. I guess I’m not looking for any answers or any judgement but just someone to open up to. I know I may not be the best of people and I have a lot of flaws too but yeah. I just needed to get this out of my system."

Sitting in my room moping, that’s what it will be like. I can’t even begin to think about summer, I sat by myself all summer last year while “friends” had a blast and posted it everywhere.

Wherever I turn, there's always a one genuinely or seemingly happy couple, and literally everyone's bragging about their partner or crush. Which is a fairly normal thing, but still... You know I've always been that friend who gave killer relationship advice but never had a relationship of their own. I'm tired of pretending to like listen to people vent about their relationships. While I'm sitting there, an absolutely hopeless case in relationships, they have the AUDACITY to vent about their relationships, and over a really small issue! I either get extremely angry at the universe and want to shout ""You stupid ****!"" to their faces or just get depressed and start to think about what's wrong with me. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely have no issues looks-wise, and even consider myself fairly pretty, and try to seem confident, but hell, I've never even received a single compliment from the opposite sex while all these woman out here finding me pretty and saying they don't understand how someone has never liked me!

lonely,Watching Heartstopper and Young Royals reopened so many wounds I did not want to revisit.,"Watching Heartstopper and Young Royals reopened so many wounds I did not want to revisit. - These gay-themed flicks always get to me. There's not a single day where I did not cry right after watching them. I hate that I could never ever live the life they have and instead I have to make peace with the loneliness since that's all I ever got. 

You know what sucks? I never even had problems coming in terms of my sexuality or even bullying. I never really minded it all because I know back then that being yourself is powerful. But is it tho? How come that I am still single after all these years? Not even dated nor in a relationship? 

I envy people like Nick or Wilhelm because they get to experience what is it like to be loved by a man and who would stick to them even if they are figuring themselves out. That there are people who would literally do everything just to make them happy, even if they cannot reciprocate properly. I wanna have that life. I know I would reciprocate, maybe even more. I would never hide my love. Yet, I am not even given the chance to be with someone. 

Loneliness is such a huge storm I could never escape. All I can do is distract myself from even feeling it. Drowning myself in my hobbies, work, and studying but then at the end of the day I am left no choice but to confront that loneliness back. At this point, I am tired and defeated.

For 15 years i've tried to be friends with multiple people, yet they never wanted be my friend.
For 15 years i've tried to find a love one, yet i have get laughed on for my miserable attempts.

I don't want to try anymore.
It's obvious, that there is something wrong about myself, or the people i have unfortunetly needed to be dealing with. Sounds like im playing the victim, but how else could i say it...

I hate social media (mainly instagram, tiktok, twitter, facebook and snap). People who use those apps makes me sick to my stomach. Its not right, that a person like me, who tries to be happy, tries/tried to make friends for about 15 years can't find one, yet, people can be friends or start dating someone completely random in minutes. Its like people likes to talk with some completely random, but they don't understand the concequences on what they throw themselfs at, and its really a shame...

Its better be alone, far away from others, even your family members, since its all about being In social interactions these days... I hope i die alone without nobody knowing/caring, since well... If we are honest, who even wants to remember a failure? I bet nobody.

Lastly. 

I know this post is gonna be deleted from here...

I know that people are gonna see this and ofc the want to ""be friends""... I think its littlebit too late at this point... I have wasted too much time trying to find people both irl and here on reddit &amp; discord.

I know how stupid i am as a human.

I know you get a good laugh when you read this awful post...

I will gladly be alone for the rest of my miserable life.

She's also my roommate so even though I'm out of town I know I'll see her later today. Regardless of all the logic and rational thinking I still woke up and can't shake this feeling of utter loneliness and almost a feeling of abandonment. 

Have you ever had your dreams shift you into such a state? How'd you deal with it?"
lonely,I’m done here,"I’m done here - There’s two types of people on this sub, lonely people who know what they need to do, are actively doing it, and come here for a much needed boost so they can continue putting in the hard work. Then there’s the people who are lonely, blame it on everyone else and refuse to take responsibility for their situation. It’s the worlds fault in their eyes, and they deserve everything they don’t have but the world has taken it from them.

To the former I have a few parting words, keep on pushing, it’s painful now, but your hard work will pay off. Keep on grinding, placing yourself a little more out of your comfort zone every day and just force yourself to talk to people. Little steps every day add up, and the momentum you carry will only continue to grow.

To the latter here are my parting words, get a fucking grip. The world is not your enemy, you are just being weak. Your existence is not pathetic, the choice you make to let it rot away is what makes you pathetic. There is not a super breed of humans who get all the social attention purely based on genetics and hereditary factors, most of them worked bloody hard to get where they are, and a lot of them will have faced the same challenges as you. The difference being they had the courage to overcome them. We all have immense strength within, it just requires effort to use it. Stop finding the easy way out and stop giving up, and if you are adamant in doing so, you have no right to complain about anything other than your own lack of courage and will. The world is not out to get you, you are just unwilling to do the work to be a part of it.

Some advice to everyone, try to get off this sub. In the short term sure it helps, but it also reinforces bad patterns and a mindset of extreme cynicism due to the fact everyone on here has seen the absolute worst of people. There’s a whole world out there waiting for you, go out and seize it. Good luck everyone, and goodbye."

I've spent weeks advocating for myself trying to raise enough money to save my own life through an online fundraiser ( https://fundly.com/nursing-home-patient-needs-help-asap ) and I've raised next to nothing!  I've shared it all over social media and no one cares.  I get it, no one wants to donate money to a stranger or help save a loser nobody's life.  It's fine though, finally excepting the inevitable truth of dying is almost somehow easier.  It's just better this way.  I've just run out of fight, so I'm throwing in the towel, I'll wait for death to greet me.  As they say, f**k it and whatever.  😥"
lonely,maybe it’s to get back at me,maybe it’s to get back at me - I truly felt like I lost my best friend. maybe it’s better for me to not talk to him anymore. Maybe it was all a mistake and I’m just a complete piece of shit. My friend who meant more to me than anything didn’t say hi to me today when I made efforts to say hi he just completely ignored me like how I ignored him. And I can’t feel too much like shit cause maybe I deserve it. He is usually happy go lucky and whistles but now it’s not the case. I feel like I just did everything completely wrong.

lonely,My Melancholic Malady,"My Melancholic Malady - This everlasting loneliness has intensified. To exist is to experience pain. I have learned there’s a difference between pain and suffering, I have yet to learn what is the point of enduring the pain. I try so hard, it’s difficult just being here. It feels like I will never actually get to a point where I will be comfortable in my own skin. I try to help others, I go on apps and websites where people go vent to strangers, it’s a pleasure to listen and help. I try to make friends. Everyone leaves. Even when they tell me they won’t. Even when everything seems good and well. Everything falls apart. I was not destined to be happy. I was not made to experience anything except disappointment and betrayal. I deserve all of it."
lonely,"Crazy, how you can have people but still feel lonely","Crazy, how you can have people but still feel lonely - I don’t understand why I feel alone. It’s somewhat frustrating.

Never had one person I could just go to for anything. Maybe it’s me."
lonely,Extremely tired,"Extremely tired - It’s been 3 years now ever since i had a friend, when the pandemic started i went into full isolation.
my previous group of friends were all fake anyway but it was tolerable because of me being busy at that time, but now.. although i have good grades my dream college didn’t accept me, so i’ve been empty as hell for a year now, knowing that i failed compared to my peers, and understanding that i’m really no one, no friends, no dream, no freedom(i live in the middle east), no passion, i’m trying again, but i just feel hollow."
lonely,My best friend(and also my ex) now hates me even though I didn't meant to make him upset,"My best friend(and also my ex) now hates me even though I didn't meant to make him upset - So we were best friends,then i catch feelings for him and told him so we became partners,i loved him more than anything and i still do.he also used to tell how much he loves me and how much i mean to him but the thing is i was too nice to him. I have done anything that you can think to make him feel better. He was even suicidal once and after i talked to him so much and we get into a relationship,he told me that i can be the reason for him to go on. 
But after just 1 month of our relationship,he told me that he can't do this anymore and he wants to have that friendship we had back. I accepted even though i really wanted that relationship and even though i had told him how much i need him in those days because i had nobody but him
But on that day, I told him something and he really got upset(i didn't mean to make him feel bad at all i always tell him that all i want is his happiness) i told him you didn't talk about our relationship to other girls maybe because you didn't want to lose them if they had a crush on you(it was kinda a joke actually)
And then he didn't talk to me for few days and when he came nack to talk he said so many terrible things to me like i actually told him something so bad. I apologized so much and he got better with it but now he tells me he still hates me even though i still tell him how much i love him
I don't know maybe i was too good to him so that's my fault 
also sorry if i have grammatical mistakes"

lonely,The stress of being lonely manifests for me in devastating cycles of binge eating.,"The stress of being lonely manifests for me in devastating cycles of binge eating. - And I do not mean some unplanned ice cream in the evening after a particularly unpleasant day. The cycles can last even for a few weeks when I eat nothing but binge food. Particular products do not matter, I do not care about sweets and have binged on boiled &amp; unsalted potatoes for example; it is only the mass and the quantity of food.

Ironically, cycles of binging are mixed with two or even three month periods without a single incident. It seems I can only function for that long, and after that I need to ""recharge"" with distorted and harmful, yet functional and semi-logical mechanism of binge eating. Call it willpower or depleted neurotransmitters, but living day-to-day life with a fundamental need that has never ever been fulfilled requires a lot of it.

I know there is some criticism to the hierarchy of needs theory, but it seems it applies to me. I cannot derive happiness from middle blocks in the pyramid and work on achieving the top blocks, if there is a huge empty space at the very foundation that I cannot fill. The only help seems to come from my lizard brain that attempts to patch up said hole with binging on food, but it is only temporary."

Before college I lost my friend group to 4 suicides and 1 murder… He was shot in the parking lot next to my school over $20 of weed That he was selling.

Now my confidence has gone from a near 10 to a 0. And I've got the features that are apparently good looking, the life that kinda lives up to it. Own my place, car, motorbike and used to have a boat.
Everything seemed right but I'm still so lost and don't even put myself out there.

I'm talking the people who have been single for a while or like me have always been single because nobody has ever been interested in them. I used to believe I would when I was younger but life experience has taught me, there is no one. You can disagree and I won't say you are a liar because you could truly believe it. Most people will probably find love. It's 4am and I'm alone. I'm too lonely to fall asleep and probably will use an ASMR girlfriend roleplay because I'm that pathetic.  I just needed to vent."

lonely,anyone relate/ have tips,"anyone relate/ have tips - Hey little 3 am rant,
tldr; I'm very lonely and have never started a relationship, how can I make the first steps

I have like zero social skills, I don't know how considering I had a decent childhood, I had some friends at school and one friend at home, was never the popular kid but I talked to  people nonetheless. I have almost no connection with my family because I can't open up to them so I just sit and speak in one word responses like a robot. I believe I realized how bad I am socially around 8th grade when I first began to go downhill mentally. Before then i just assumed everyone was like I am. I struggle with everything socially, but I improve the more I do it. I still struggle with telling people how I feel about them. I just can't get it into my head that someone could possibly like being around me like I like being around them. I'm 16 and have never been in a relationship, I'm like the most no bitches ass mf around lmfao but I just can't push myself to fix it.  I have even had girls that have told me they are attracted to me but still don't believe it. I think I'm just deathly afraid of rejection for some reason. I've begun to rely on temporary ways of coping (drugs, masturbation, etc) instead of stepping towards a relationship. I understand that the fact that I hate myself is probably the big thing holding me back from being in a relationship, but I don't want to fix it. I don't want to love myself for whatever reason. Apologies for the whining, I suppose I'm just asking if anyone has any advice."

We still live together but on opposite ends of house and there’s no intimacy. The last 2 nights he’s come to get our son at my parents and gone off on me screaming and berating me. One of the things he says is I’m trying to do something with one of the guys in my class because he added me on fb. For reference the guy is gay and my husband won’t get that. The other thing is he slipped up because he’s always said to people he’s never been physically abusive but last night in front of my family he made the mistake of saying he had been drunk, in a rage and busted up my face a few years back. He’s charmed all my friends and everyone thinks he can do no wrong. I have no one I can really talk too who doesn’t know him. I have very few actual friends and they are always busy with no time for me recently to go get coffee or catch a movie. I feel like I’m losing my mind.

After countless amounts of dinners, drinks, fun date plans, etc. It just wears you down physically, mentally, and emotionally.

I know that people say hookups make you feel more empty in the long run but in a weird way it feels empowering to give fate the big FUCK YOU and embrace the fact that that life hasn’t given you that one person (yet, hopefully).

lonely,Having a hard time accepting my life as a loner,"Having a hard time accepting my life as a loner - I’ve been a total loner for so many years now. Tbh I haven’t had a single friend since I was 14 and every year since then I just feel more and more isolated and more and more like a social outcast/reject. 

I struggled a lot in high school with bullying and because of that no one ever wanted to be around me, I’d get made fun of and beat up all the time. I just felt so left out because I was never invited anywhere, no one would hang out with me at school, I never went to things like prom or anything, and I obviously never experienced what it’s even like to be in a relationship.

I thought things would change once I went to university but the social dynamics were almost exactly the same. Everyone had their friend groups no one was really there to make any new friends. I tried joining some clubs but it really didn’t change anything. I felt even more invisible and unwanted going to uni and I’d feel so sad whenever I’d see people with their friends. It’s gotten so bad that last fall I decided to drop out, mainly because I wasn’t studying something I cared about but also because of my nonexistent social life. 

Now I’m 21 and I have nobody in my life and everyday I have such a hard time accepting that this is what my life is. Every time I look at people I knew from school on Instagram posting themselves with their friends or just seeing people outside I feel so depressed and jealous like “why doesn’t anyone want me around?” I feel like I’ve missed out on so many experiences because of this and now as an adult I feel like it’s impossible for any of this to change."

I have this another ""friend"". We have been friends since childhood. And HE also didnt wished me. 

You do so much for other and you realise you are not special to anyone. You feel like you and other person has something good and special bond. You finally have a friend or something. You enjoy with them and be happy with them. You put so much effort towards other and you get nothing. You are never someones special. You are nothing to them. 

Seriously, lonely people knows the value of love and relationship and thats why they put so much love towards other."

lonely,"I'm the ""back up"" friend","I'm the ""back up"" friend - I have friends, sure. But all of my friends have better friends of their own. Very rarely am I asked to hang out or get random messages just wanting to chat. If they want a bigger group of people to hangout, then yeah sure then maybe I'm invited. 

The most recent thing that STUNG was just the other day I was hanging out with my friend who we both call each other best friends, and have for years. We have a mutual friend who just got their own apartment and she was reading her calendar and read off that their house warming party is coming up. I had no idea. Nobody mentioned a thing.

My big issue is that I'm a pretty reserved person, but I'm really social with the people I connect with. I LOVE to be with the people I truly get along with and i love parties, which I never get to go out (i have nobody to go with!!!). I'm just so sick of making the move to try and befriend someone. Its hard enough for me to find someone I really vibe with. Nobody ever tries to learn more about me or advance our relationship to a genuine friendship. I feel so fucking alone and unliked. Idk how else to make friends or seem interesting enough for other people to approach me."

Something I can make a Pinterest board out of. I think that if I have friends all my problems will go away and I'll be super happy. Obviously that's not realistic but having friends sounds so good. A lot of people don't realize how lucky they are to have someone to talk to everyday. Normal people usually fantasize about what their future partner or house will look like while I'm just imagining having a friend. I want to have a little friend group with like 6 people.

it’s just hard seeing my friends living in nyc and dallas, etc. all together having so much fun and i’m just here. i went to school in georgia and moved to atlanta afterwards and it honestly fucking sucks because no one is really trying to meet people since most people have their friend groups from college here. idk why i’m even posting this i guess i just want to vent…i’ve always considered myself a social person but this past year has been so difficult and has made me feel like maybe i’m not as social as i thought i was. i mean i probably haven’t don’t a great job putting myself out there but i’m just not happy here it sucks"

lonely,"I just got sober, but feel so lost, feel so abandoned by the world, feel so spiritually empty, and am trying to figure out how to motivate myself to work and not just give up on life","I just got sober, but feel so lost, feel so abandoned by the world, feel so spiritually empty, and am trying to figure out how to motivate myself to work and not just give up on life - So I got sober from meth, alcohol, weed, caffeine, and tobacco 2 years ago. Something about the way I work internally meant I had to be all or nothing about it. Unfortunately, I suffer from severe chronic back and neck pain, as well as jaw pain from tmj, and I have been taking something called kratom for the past year for the pain. I haven't really decided if it is a relapse or not. It is definitely addictive, but it is the absolute only substance I take and without it I'd be in so much more pain.

I feel like I long for a mentor right now, or a spiritual leader, or something. I am so lost. I'm crying right now, as I write this. I don't know what to do now, I don't know how to find purpose anymore. For the past year I have been treading water, living off my measly SSI payments and starving myself to make it each month.

But I live in the world of distraction. I live to be distracted, I can see it so clearly. Starting to take kratom, I feel, might be part of the problem. See I was sober completely, and I had to have my wisdom teeth removed. My face got way too swollen afterwards, and they put me on codeine for a week. During that week, my back pain completely disappeared. Once the Codeine ran out, for an entire month I remained sober. I took 3 Aleve per day for one month, but relative to the absolute painlessness of being on Codeine, Aleve couldn't compete. Relatively I was in extreme pain. Somehow my body had acclimated to the pain before Codeine, and I dialed with it by excercising once every 3 days, but since I couldn't handle it after that first month of Aleve I started to buy kratom. I have now been addicted to kratom and nothing else for a year.

Before I relapsed on the kratom though, I had been experimenting with removing porn and social media, and video games from my life. Something about being on zero addictive substances makes your mental addictions suddenly stand out strongly. I caught myself slipping away to the bathroom to jack off whenever I faced a difficult decision or stressful situation. I realized I was using the porn as a way to ""feel good"" to counteract ""feeling bad"", just like I used to drink alcohol whenever I was stressed out before I got sober. So I had actually spent 90 days free of jerking off, and I had deleted all my porn, etc. But after the codeine ran out of my system it was suddenly open season on porn use, it's like I returned to it with a vengeance. Same with video games and social media. Just scrolling, making sure to avoid thinking about all the terrifying things at all costs.

I feel like I need an acid trip, I fear I traumatized myself with my last meth binge. It was horrible, and it was the first time I was put out on the street by everyone I loved. My best friend, then even my brother made me beg and pander to him to avoid getting kicked out. I lost all sense of stability, and I can still feel it, I do nothing but fear right now, all I can do is be terrified I'll end up on the street again, terrified that no one will ever love me. I am completely removed from my authentic self, I have no clue what I am supposed to do now.

Because of my physical disabilities and especially the tmj, which, after almost 20 years now of neglect has become horrifying, I can't talk for more than 5 minutes a day anymore. So I can't get any job where I'd have to talk. I am starting to feel so cut off from the world.

I am feeling horrible bitterness. I see people leading normal lives, and complaining about things they experience that I can't experience. They complain about problems with their friendships, and I feel like I have been avoiding my friends because of the jaw issue specifically. So it makes me hate those people, I loathe them. I feel neglected by the world, left to rot.

A lot of this probably has to do with the fact that I have been pretty isolated for the past year. I pretty much only speak to my therapist once a week. I have a brother, but since he got a new girlfriend he barely has time for me once a month. Otherwise I stay in my room. I am terrified of people. I don't want to be. But I feel like something is missing in my brain. The peace that I found the first time I got sober (2 and a half years ago), I completely destroyed when I relapsed just to get help again. I was told that I couldn't get more help unless I used meth specifically again, so I did in a desperate fuck it moment, just to get help. Because I was thriving there, and they released me to a shelter and I wasn't ready for it and it was terrifying.

But now I find myself battling with myself. I don't know what to do. I dropped out of UC Berkeley 10 years ago, was diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic two years later, worked in bars and restaurants ever since. I really do miss learning, I used to be so good at it. I feel like I can't get myself secure feeling enough to focus on learning anything, but I don't know if that's true. I doubt my intelligence every day. I fear that my drug use has destroyed my intelligence and that I am no longer capable of returning to school.

I try to motivate myself to learn coding, or design, or something that I used to be good at, but some voice within me tells me that I am not supposed to just work, something about living in Berkeley has me feeling like I'm selling out somehow by working. But when I'm not working I spend all of my time worrying about how to make it to the end of each month, skipping meals to make it every month. Surviving with only $150 to spend on food each month after rent.

Part of me thought the answer would be to buy a car or van and live with it. I could borrow money maybe and then if I owned the place I lived in then I could spend the full SSI amount on food each month. But then I'm like If I had enough money to buy a van, I should spend it on fixing my jaw. Get orthodontics or whatever it takes.

Then I'm like just learn coding to get a job to fix my jaw, stabilize myself, and then I can decide what I really want to do after I do that for a little while.

But my therapist just discouraged me from that plan, when I told it to her a few days ago. I think she was trying to help me, but she used my inability to remain motivated as evidence for why maybe I just didn't like doing these things I said I wanted to do. And it really fucked me up in the head man. How am I supposed to change when every time I am about to they say ""how can you be sure you want to do this when historically you haven't done this?"" That's why I always had to move friend groups, so I could be new people over time.

I used to be so busy, now all I can do is think about what I should do, but never do anything.

I personally think the answer is to just do something, literally anything, just pick it and see if I can let the world fall away and start focusing on it like I used to be able to. I think putting so much emphasis on what to pick is what fucked me up in the first place. At Berkeley I had changed my major 6 times, and felt horrified of the decision because I feared that whatever I ended up with would be the last thing I got to study. When in the past my skill was being able to study and be good at a variety of things. I was the kid who won the math olympics, and also tutored English, and was good at drawing. I didn't believe in the science/math/artsy person being different, and I didn't want to have to stop learning. But Berkeley put so much pressure on me and told me if I didn't pick soon I'd run out of financial aid in one semester, they said I was already above the unit ceiling because I had taken too many classes and I already had enough credits to graduate, I just needed a few more classes for psychology in particular and I could finish. But I didn't feel ready. And then of course I started hallucinating and had some freak outs and the whole things just ended and I couldn't return until I paid back my grants for that semester so I just stayed out because I didn't have $6k.

And here  years later, feeling like an absolute loser. I spent 8 years drinking and working in restaurants and bars, and now that I'm sober and my pain has caught up with me I feel incapable of continuing to work in those fields, my body can't handle it. So if I'm going to work I need to use my mind, but I can't pick what I should do. I wish I could just live with my parents for a while and just spend some time learning anything just to test the waters, but my parents are toxic and I've stopped speaking to them recently. And I doubt that decision every day too, but my therapist supports it because I'm incapable of saying no to my dad, so at least if I don't pick up the phone I can't be controlled by him.

But that leaves me with no one. I feel completely alone. I used to have my brother but now he's never around because of the girlfriend, so I'm left with nothing. I left Facebook a few years ago because I couldn't handle it, but by doing so I cut myself off from my old college friends.

I've just made so many horrible decisions. Isolated myself out of fear too many times, and now I'm left broken and alone with no one to comfort me or guide me. I'm starting to think being controlled by my dad would be better than this, at least he still likes me sometimes.

I'm so filled with hate lately. I know the answer is love, but I'm filled with hate. I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/a1lcp9/comment/eaqx6uv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) when I got sober the first time, when I felt so at peace. Something had clicked in me, I felt. Now I look at it and it feels like it was written by a different person. I can't make eye contact with people anymore, I can't do anything but fear what they are thinking about me anymore. What have I done to myself. I regret so deeply smoking meth again, I was harder on my body and mind that time than I had ever been before.

And I can't tell if I can't focus on things now because I am clouded by fear or because I damaged myself beyond repair. I have been set free by acid in the past, it has allowed me to clear away the chatter and clear my mind and focus, it might be able to help me again, but I do not think I am in a good enough mindset. If I were to do that I'd have to reach out to some old friends first.

That's one plan, I searched and searched, and recently found the phone number for this one old friend who had previously helped me gain some peace of mind.

The problem, and I know it's the problem, is that I am waiting until I have figured something out to do things again. The revelation that set me free the first time I got sober, I think, at least, was that I was willing to try to do things whether I felt ready or not. Now I always feel like I'm not ready and so I never do anything. I am nothing but a pot of doubt.

But working isn't spiritually dead, right? You have to support yourself, right?

To be totally honest a big part of me wants to check back into a mental hospital. I've been in several throughout my lifetime. This is starting to feel like one of those times where I would benefit. I'm just so terrified of being turned away. It happened twice. But I need somewhere to start, I don't know what is best for me right now. I'm not sure if I have to live off disability for the rest of my life, or if I'm actually capable of coming out of it.

Something feels so wrong about coming out of it. Or trying to motivate myself to come out of it. Like is it so wrong to motivate myself to learn coding just to earn money? Something seems so spiritually bankrupt about that. Like I'm supposed to be doing what I love or something, right? Do I love it? I used to love just learning everything, I would try learning anything, and make it a challenge to wrap my mind around it. The thing is I haven't been doing anything I love either. So it's not like by not learning something to help me earn money I've spent more time doing what I actually love. I spend my time in a waking horror. I feel terrified of everything, I need to find some breathing room. My therapist just recommended medications again, I think I'm going to say yes to trying it this time. I'm living in a world of distraction, like I said at the beginning. I'm not doing things I love, I scroll through endless tiktoks and feel hateful and angry at people being happy and living their lives and expressing themselves because I cannot. But I do it anyway, why? Why do I keep distracting myself like this when I feel so horrible? Or I will play a video game and hate myself the whole time. I cannot quiet my mind at night anymore.

I stay up all night a couple times a week because I just can't fall asleep, it feels like something horrible is about to happen and I have to figure out a solution to something. So my mind just spins, and I need to find peace.

If you have any guidance I'd love it. Especially about getting some mental peace. I tried to meditate to sleep and the way I did it used to work but it doesn't seem to as well now. I try to focus on an invisible point above my eyes, and then any time I start thinking about something I visualize the thought dissolving and then keep doing that until I kind of stop trying to think and then hopefully find some mental quiet. But lately like with the jaw pain and stuff it just comes through it, the thoughts come anyway.

I feel terrified to post this because I have come to expect hate from others. I feel I will be mocked for being lazy and not figuring it out by now, etc. Please be kind, I am trying to change, I don't want to live in the world of distraction anymore, but I don't know how to find what I love, and I don't know how to learn again, I have so much doubt in my ability to even try learning.

And I honestly just want it to come faster cause it’s a challenge waking up every single fucking day of my life. I keep getting these stupid pain in my heart like there’s a thousand needles poking it simultaneously and I get them everyday and they just hurt so so much. I also wish I saw my therapist more often I’m not even sure if it’s even good I see her like monthly and she canceled last time so idk.

lonely,my friends just make me feel worse,"my friends just make me feel worse - I argued with a couple friends 2 months ago and decided to stop talking to them, the friend group quickly broke up and it came to the point where I was talking to one or two friends.

It was like that for a month and I had felt less anxious and my self esteem felt better, I also could make more time for myself and generally just felt better.

2 weeks ago I decided to forgive them and get back to talking to them and to be honest I just feel way worse.. they make me feel ugly, stupid, disgusting and unfunny all the time.

I wanna go back to being alone, it's not that bad."
lonely,they wouldn't understand,"they wouldn't understand - I am a 19 year man, I can't tell my whole childhood story, but I can say what I feel in result of said stories.
I feel excluded, I feel like I am destined to be alone, and I feel that anyone who I connect with on a deeper level, will get dissapointed by me, sooner or later. I've always been teamed up on as a kid, which isn't the easiest experience, always find myself being abandoned by whoever I get close to, with smirk on their face ""what a shithead""
I ve always had a small circle of friends, but recently, I understood that they aren't really friends, they are just available people, the same as I am to them, the first invitation from any other person and they try their hardest to ditch the group. I have a girlfriend, I love her very much, we are in a long distance relationship, it doesn't help right? especially when physical touch, and tenderness is a very important need for me in a relationship. She wouldn't understand what it feels like, she is constantly surrounded by other people, always having the best laugh with the best supportive, most fun friends, she is in a band on campus, enjoying the company of many friends, and here I am miles away in a house with a roomate that we hate each other's guts, we literaly don't talk. She is already strugling with her own problems and it's not fair for me to drop a ""I am very lonely and you will leave me sooner or later"" bomb. I used to be able to be ok in my own lonesone, I used to code for up to 15 hours a day play guitar for another two, and practice knives throwing at the tree, I was not happy but I accepted it, I accepted that I am destined to be alone, and I didn t think about it that much, I d occationally cry myself to sleep, but I was okey the next day. but ever since I started dating, I can't function without her in my arms, and taking care of her, I know this is text book codependence, but I can't solve all my problems, sometimes you gotta accept your mental fuck-ups and love with them, right?
Here I am with no one to talk to, no one to tell what I feel, miles away from ""friends"", family, love, and studying the hardest major in the country"
lonely,How do you tell people you're lonely?,"How do you tell people you're lonely? - How do you tell people you're lonely? Like for one it's one of the most embarrassing things to tell someone. Secondly who do you tell? Your parents? They will just give you shitty cliche advice and then you'll have to face them with that embarrassment every day. Your friends? I have literally one friend who I'm even remotely close enough with to tell that to, but then what? That just puts more pressure on their already stressful life to feel like they have to deal with my problem. And then instead of just getting to hang out every time we get together will be a therapy session. Also I feel like telling your friend you're lonely is a huge insult to them, but maybe that's because I have issues with how they treat me as a friend anyways. Then there's this, the anonymous option. Yeah it's nice to write all this out and get some advice but let's be honest, none of you know me and none of you know how to get out of this, we're all just stuck here together, the blind leading the blind."

I dread it when they call bc I have nothing to say to them? We have nothing in common so it's just awkward small talk for 5-10 insufferable minutes. On top of that, I value humor probably more than anything in a person. Of course I can have serious conversations but in general I'm laughing even when there's not shit to be laughing at. But not everyone is like that and not everyone gets my humor in particular. So when i'm talking to someone who can't match my energy or doesn't understand me it just becomes draining bc I end up having to basically shrink/hide myself in order to not look crazy.

lonely,The worse part of being alone is having no one to help you.,"The worse part of being alone is having no one to help you. - a week ago ago while walking back to work i fell and sprained my ankle, the pain was absolutely unbearable i couldn’t put any weight on my leg at all, i was on the verge of tears in the middle of the street with nowhere on sight, the only cars that passed by didn’t even bother to slow down, I didn’t had any money for an uber much less an ambulance and my contact lists consist of my own number, and my favorite pizza place (my family cut contact with me, long story)

I knew i had to move so i sloooooooowly walked by way back home, when i woke up the next day the pain was way way worse, I had to improvise and make my office chair my wheelchair and i move around on it, while it’s mostly fine, the exit to the yard where my dogs live has steps so i had to let my dogs in to feed them since I can’t maneuver around, the dogs has been pissing and pooping all over and I can’t clean properly so the house stinks terribly which irritates me to no end since im a little obsessed with being clean. they tried to play with me or want to go for a walk or go outside but i can’t take proper care of them and it gets on my nerves, i still love those dogs with my life and if it weren’t for them i probably wouldn’t be here.

At some point while sleeping my glasses fell through the crack of the bed and the bed, i psychically cannot move the bed and i cannot reach my glasses, so I’ve been mostly blind for 2 days, im a normal guy, relatively young and fit young not very fit but im not fat or anything, but today while i was on the bathroom i couldn’t pull myself up, didn’t  matter how hard i tried, i just couldn’t take it anymore and i started crying like i have never cried before i have never feel so powerless i just couldn’t hold it together anymore, i realized i could die right here right now and no one would know, no one would come to my help for weeks, no one would take care of my dogs, no one would claim my body and hold  a funeral and my death would have 0 impact for anyone that ever knew me.

This desire appears and disappears out of nowhere, but it is very distressing."
lonely,I accidentally got a shitty haircut and now my chances are over.,"I accidentally got a shitty haircut and now my chances are over. - Long story short, I’m 14, in 8th grade, and it’s almost the end of the school year for me. There is this girl who WAS interested in me, but only because of how good I looked with my hair. I’ve always been this laid-back and chill hippie type of dude who happens to love the ‘60s and shit, so naturally my hair resembled George Harrison. This reflected my personality very well and I felt comfortable because of that. Until it started growing past my shoulders which is not even my style. So I decided to get it all cut off. Now it’s not that I look bad with a buzz-cut, (although that doesn’t match my personality because it makes me look like a fucking douche which I hate) though my barber messed up (nothing personal to him) and now my hair just looks uneven and awkward. The next day that I saw her, she just looked at me and laughed. She hasn’t talked to me since. But that’s not all! Even my friends mocked the way my hair looks, all because my barber fucked up and didn’t even give me a proper cut. So in the meantime I’ll be depressed until about high school probably when it grows back, knowing that I chose to cut off all my possible chances. TL;DR, My barber fucked up and now everyone treats me like shit including the girl that was previously interested in me.

EDIT: Once I grow out my hair again, I wonder who will be laughing then."
lonely,Am I lonely or depressed,"Am I lonely or depressed - I live alone and I’m alone a lot. I work from home. I see my friends maybe twice a month. When I’m around other people that I enjoy I feel “normal”. I don’t have the overwhelming feelings of sadness when I’m around my friends and family. But when I’m back by myself I just feel so down. Im really not sure why I’m sad so much. 

Anyone else feel like that ? What do you think it might be"

The way I feel totally depends of them and I feel awful for that, i can’t make myself feel happy so I need someone else for that."
lonely,I am 19 and never dated before,"I am 19 and never dated before - I am 19 years old, I have never dated a girl let alone kissed a girl before. Never been to a party and dropped out of college 3 months in. I am extreme over thinker to the point where when I eventually do decide the opportunity is already gone. I have ruined ever potential relationship without knowing why. at the end of the day when everything is done. There’s no one I talk to about my day, no one to share about my goals and I feel I am doing all this for nothing.
Main reason was in my junior year of high school I decided to test myself and see who’s truly my friend so I wait to get spoken to first before talking. Big no no, I ate lunches alone, I was never picked for group projects, I didn’t go to homecoming or was invited to one party. I ended up graduating with only one friend. To this day he is my only friend. On the weekends I just usually work or sleep all day. I don’t really understand how to fix the damages and really go out there meet new people with every time in my mind I feel like I am bothering them or I think they want to end the conversation so I do it for them."
lonely,who cares,"who cares - I am so bored in life. Just got out of a relationship I didn't want to get out of because of long distance, some other factors too, and now all my good habits like gym, running, healthy eating have turned into fast food, more fast food and lying in bed watching tiktok. I just moved so I don't know anyone, scaredness or confusion in a new place is a factor, and tbh I don't think I will know anyone here because I'm 34 and everyone my age has a family and someone to come home to and ofc this makes me miss my ex, while my tiktok continues to blast narcissistic tiktoks and relationship tiktok in my face at full blast. 

Excuse me while i take this melatonin on this wild Saturday night and watch Harry Potter put me to sleep. I'm going to the gym early tomorrow whether I like it or not."

lonely,I will not have friends after middle school,"I will not have friends after middle school - So, I'm at the end of middle school and I have zero friends. When I was at primary school nobody wanted to be around me because they thought that I was weird, then when I was in 5th and 6th grade, I tried integraiting in all sorts of groups, but nobody actually accepted me because I am very masculine and they didn't like my hairstyle. After COVID came and when I returned to school at the end of 7th and the start of the 8th grade, things seemed promising. I cut off the friend group that I had in 6th grade and started staying with another, but they didn't look very intrested in being friends with me and the things were very one-sided, for example they almost never do the first move, I remember that I didn't talk to anybody in my class for almost 2 months, but nobody actually cared, or are intrested in learning things about me and I thought things changed since 6th grade, but no they piked up on the way I look. I have one month left of this, can you give me some advice?

lonely,I'm just a sad clown and nobody knows,"I'm just a sad clown and nobody knows - Everyday i joke around with my friends. I am the one trying to be funny. The clown. Everyone thinks i live a happy life and i don't give a fuck about anything.

Till i come home and i just am exhausted. Exhausted of life, trying to make everyone around me happy and forgetting the main thing... Making myself happy. Sleep deprived every day. Living on caffeine to study and workout or do something during the day. Staying up late at night listening to music. Lonely as fuck, don't feel loved, feeling guilty for everything. I just wanna feel loved. Always feeling like a dissapointment. I just wanna cuddle someone and just admire being loved. Nonstop body dysmorphia. Everyone asking why i always wear a hoodie and i just say i don't know cuz i don't want people to know the truth about me. Don't want anyone to worry or bother anyone. Nobody knows. No one takes me seriously anymore. No one. They just think i am a clown. Nothing else.

Bad childhood. Abusive father. Every childhood nigh cried through.

I am proud that i lived through really dark thoughts about leaving this world 1 year ago. Laying in bed with a knife next to me. My only motivation to not die wad that i don't want anyone to be sad because of me, and that i am fucking scared of the pain. I feel fake.

I am fucking lonely. I have a ton of friends and i still am lonely. I don't know what will make me happy....

Held my emotions in so many times that i am not able to cry anymore. Last real cry was 2 years ago.

Most of this started because i lost my best friend. Never felt ""satisfied in life"" since. Scared to find professional help. Don't wanna make my parents worry."

I’ve been single for several years not and each passing day it gets harder and harder to find a reason to keep going. I’m not suicidal or anything so no need to worry about that, but I havent felt the touch of another person in so long I don’t know what to do anymore. I tried telling myself I like men to make finding someone easier, but the few guys I talked to just wanted me for money. I feel like all I have to offer is my wallet and I don’t see a reason to keep trying anymore. Just become a hermit and never leave me room. I’m so tired of trying to better myself but I don’t have anyone to talk to or express my feelings too. I’m in to very niche things and I see other people happy with their partners and I’m just here lone doing my best, but it’s clearly not good enough, and at this point I don’t think I’ll ever be good enough.

I have a good career. I enjoy some gaming, playing guitar and I'm into cars. I also try keep fit and healthy. Barely drink at all.

but my biggest downfall is I just can't come across as likeable or interesting enough for people to invest in me in terms of friendship.

No matter how hard I try I just sort of feel I come across as awkward and mundane. I don't know how to explain it,  in group gatherings I sort of just blend in the background. It's not like I'm shy or don't make conversations its just that nothing I say intrigues people into wanting to get to know me. It's tough to find good friends in this world especially when you can see people don't really take an interest in you. It makes me feel less important than other people around me .

Customers will give me their phone number where I work they are acquaintances I don’t even know but they don’t even reply back to a basic simple text message if I was dead nobody would care or miss me. Same goes for women on dating apps gaining a woman and then having a nasty attitude with you just simply for you wanting to get to know them it never goes anywhere because they all have excuses why they won’t reply back to you why they won’t get to know you hence why I don’t have a significant other hence why I have zero friends and then people look at me a Wonderwall why don’t you have any friends or family because people are selfish and self-centered and scum and I don’t want anything to do with people anymore I don’t like humanity I don’t like this world and I’d rather not be a part of the human race because I don’t feel like I’m anything like any of these people don’t even put me in the same room with them because I’m not in the same.category I’m nothing like the scam people at all then only are concerned with themselves and only themselves and nothing else.

It’s as if me not being in their presence in their face means I’m either invisible or non-existent and when I retaliate and shut out and spitefully don’t reach out to others it just highlights to me how dispensable people make me feel, it’s as if I’m nothing.

We hadn’t talked for a month. I felt like he was replacing me with two younger coworkers and kinda pushed me aside. I got the courage to finally talk to him again but I feel like something is truly off. I wish I could tell him the truth and just tell him I have feelings for him but I’m so scared to be rejected all over again but why would anyone ever want to be with me.
lonely,"So, what's exactly my point here?","So, what's exactly my point here? - I don't know how these things work but I just have to let this out. I just don't understand myself anymore. I just turned 25  and it seems I didn't have any self improvements at all.

Well for starters, I'm plus-sized/overweight like my entire life, well, I started to gain weight when I was 8 I think, thanks to my brother who challenged me on who can eat the most rice, well, I won, I had 10 platefuls, yeah seriously, then I found out it was just me all along who's into the game and ever since then I became that Fat Girl. I love my family but they didn't seem to help. I don't know if you can it call it supportive, but they always encouraged me to lose weight and they're sooooo VOCAL about it, like you'll-never-hear-the-end-of-it lectures kind of thing, comparing you to other skinny girls, calling you a cow, you know, those kinds of things. I guess I just got used to it. Like I said, I love my family but your family's your worst bully(did I say that correctly?)

 So, it became my issue and I always get offended and defensive when my weight gets called out, especially in school. I'm not a bully, but I sure damn know that I wouldn't let anyone, especially stupid boys, bully or undermine me, like, I remember punching so many guys wayyyy back elementary and highschool just because they're making fun of me, calling me names. I mean, you're the only person who can help yourself and forgive me for choosing violence. 

I guess that's why I have very low self-esteem, lacks confidence and I don't take compliments well(I'm just gonna deny and contradict your compliment) . I guess, when things start to creep and get into your head, you start to believe and eventually, just live with it...

Most people know me for being funny and friendly but I'm super duper shy, gets easily anxious and hates being the center of attention(duhh) because in my mind, when people look at me, all they see is this fat girl. Fat. Fat. Fat.
I mean, I tried to embrace the idea of being plus size and curvy (but honestly, for me, plus size and curvy are just sugar-coated words for fat, I seriously don't mean to offend people, it's just my take on it with all of the years of being one) But, at least there are times that I felt confident about my body, provided that I'm wearing decent stylish clothes. 

It took me yearsss to build up and have that confidence, but it could also crumble down with just a single negative thought or criticism. It all goes downhill when you start to compare yourself to others. You'll just end up asking yourself, why do I even exist?

 It came to a point where I avoid looking at mirrors, especially those big ass mirrors in the malls, fitting rooms or anywhere wherein you get to see your body's reflection and just feel ugly, disappointed, ashamed, disgusted and so on. I think that's when I stopped posting pictures on my social media, stopped taking selfies and letting someone take pictures of me when going out with family or friends. I still call myself lucky because I have my friends and family(not all of them obviously) who got my back and understands me.  

I've never been in a relationship or even on a date, like none, whatsoever. Sometimes when I get asked if I ever had a boyfriend or been in a date, Im not sure if im gonna be embarassed or offended by it. The last time someone liked me was this boy when we were in 3rd grade, and I rejected him; considering the fact that I'm not even pleasing in the eye, but yeah, karma's a real bitch haha.

Of course, I also want to be in love and feel loved, it's just that romantic relationships are just sooooo foreign and alien to me. Like, I could never imagine a guy liking and falling in love with me. With me! Im such a hopeless romantic and I can imagine myself being clingy in an acceptable way. But Im scared of guys, and I always have this fear of interacting with them, like what I said before , I always assume that they all think and see me as the fat girl, fat, fat, fat. Also, I'm boring as hell, no interesting hobbies and super awkward. 


I might sound desperate but ... It just get so freaking lonely. Like it's not even funny anymore, like, does the universe really hate me this much? ""You have your friends and family to love you,"" bitch don't even start me with that shit, that's different.

I may not be alone but I am definitely lonely.

No hands to hold, shoulder to lean on, hair to play and mess, cheeks to pinch, ears to whisper stupid things and sweet nothings, back to massage, lips to kiss and body to hug, spoon and cuddle with. Is that too much to ask? 

I know that I'm still ""young"", still gonna meet a lot of people and I have a lot of things to work on myself, like self-love and acceptance, ugh. 

So, to my future SO, I just want to say: Duuuuuuuuuuuude, where the hell are youuuu?? How long are we going to wait for each other? Im dying to meet you."
lonely,What should I do in this situation?,"What should I do in this situation? - I have a bestfriend who’s a very likeable person &amp; someone who I love and value in my life and would do anything for if it came down to it. I’ve known this person for about 5-6 years and we’ve had two fights which lasted over a year each fight. The first two years of our friendship were extremely good, lots of communication &amp; hanging out and going places. After those two years things went downhill tremendously .. she would screen me, cancel plans when I’d plan ahead of time, make excuses saying she was busy or tired all the time, not text me for long periods at a time (like 2-4 months) and I would purposely wait to see if she would text me out of the blue but never did. I would be the one to initiate conversations almost all the time. So I kind of got fed up with the relationship being one sided and deleted her off everything because I felt as if my presence didn’t matter to her and she didn’t care about me. I did this 2-3 times during our friendship and she got really frustrated with me because I would essentially dip without saying a word to her. I felt as though I had always been there for her if she were to ever need anything but felt like she wouldn’t return the favour because she didn’t ever check in on me when I was severely depressed and suicidal even though I told her about it. She would basically say “me too” and sort of joke about it but also in a serious way. She’s told me a few times she doesn’t really care to have friends or talk to anyone &amp; that really broke me hearing but I never questioned her .. afraid that it could be directed at me. Her reason for never texting first was “I have to work on myself before I can put in work to others” kind of deal. Which makes sense but she’s done this for years. I was always respectful to her and kind to her so I don’t know why it felt like she abandoned me. I would overthink like crazy for months and cry for quite some days just thinking about how things could go back to our first two years of friendship again but I don’t think it’ll ever be the same. Fast forward to today and she still seems to have the same bad habits. Ignores my text for days, cancelling plans, seems to only want to stay at home, barely making an effort to text me. The thing that keeps me around is that when we do get to hangout it’s almost always fun and good vibes between us. We get along very well and I feel like we can actually listen and talk about random stuff no matter how crazy it is. She also has bad communication with other people including her boyfriend so it also makes me think I’m overthinking. Her bf is also my best friend I basically view him as a brother. Im curious if she is taking our friendship seriously and actually cares about me because I’ve been hurt by previous friends I thought cared about me. When I truly care about someone I am willing to help them in every way possible, psychically and mentally if I can &amp; I feel like if they cared about me they’d do the same? I keep overthinking things because of the lack of communication on her part and it puts me in a really dark, depressing mood which is why I don’t know if the friendship is worth it.. Also she never ever texts me when our friendship goes sour, I would always have to be the one to apologize first and try and win her friendship back. I think about this a lot and don’t know what to do or how to act so any help is appreciated."

lonely,Struggling With Feeling Accepted,"Struggling With Feeling Accepted - I'm temporarily in a bad spot right now and I feel like the only person in the world going through what I'm going through and I just need to say something to someone. It seems like where I am I can't have a conversation without the conversation turning into an angle.

I'm an atheist but my family and community is Mormon. I love them and they love me but they can't seem to accept me. I have the personality of a 1950s day time television dad - positive and hopeful -- and especially very little grunge. I've been described as ""Jared Dunn from Silicon Valley without the tragic backstory"". I grew up in one of the most Mormon places on Earth and there is very much a social binary that exists here. Everyone assumes I'm LDS just because I'm a happy looking guy although I struggle more than I let on. I have a strange personality -- which people like -- but I stick out. I have tried to exist in both universes but I feel left out of both (although I originally felt accepted before \*coming out\*). Dating is a nightmare because I'm not interested in doing weed and being drunk every Friday night. More often LDS women seem drawn to me and I seem very Mormon but I'm radioactive as soon as I tell them I'm not LDS.

I'm trying to be and do what young people should be and do at 21 and I consider myself mostly successful. I'm in school and I have a great job with great prospects for the future. I try to contribute to my community and be the best person I can. Despite these things I get told that I'll waste my life. That I'm not becoming the person I need to be and that I'll lose sight of all the things that make me great. The people who tell me things are trying to love me and help me by pointing me in what they believe to be the right direction. On the other side of the coin, I'm told that I should leave those people behind -- ""fu\*\* 'em"" they don't have a monopoly on what's right for your life -- I should remind you that I am fiercely compared to grunge-less Jared Dunn --""What do they know?""

Generally, the people saying ""you'll waste your life"" seem happier, more successful, and definitely more confident lol. I find it hard to not be fully accepted anywhere. My family is afraid that I'm trying to be grunge (which I'm not). I try to just accept myself but sometimes it's hard when you are truly alone in what you believe AND how you're perceived is in direct odds with how those with shared beliefs are usually perceived.

I guess this a little different from most posts here. I'm fairly social but I always feel like I'm looking through a window into personal lives of those around me rather than being invited into the entryway on either side of the coin. I want to love my family and respect myself but those seems often seem at odds.

 I always feel like I'm in this lurch and I just felt that I needed to tell someone."

Just to focus on studying for my last year of high school. The result is that I no longer understand anyone, and no one understands me anymore.  Even my friends, family and everyone I knew before.  I feel like a senile old man who has no interest in this world and is about to die.  Now I only see the world as ugly, without distinguishing features, without taste.  Likewise, everyone will probably see me.  Only now can I understand the last scene of the movie Father when this old man asks to meet his mother, I also want my mother, I want my mother.

Going to the movies, playing videogames, reading, drawing, writing, gym, focusing completely on my goals... basically doing whatever the f*** I wanted. 

Then I met this girl, and she became important enough to sacrifice my time and hobbies to spend time with her and her hobbies. It was better than I imagined; better than I ever thought I deserve.

Love, sex, cuddling, dating, texting... all the things I thought I'd never have were happening to me, it was perfect, she surpassed all my dreams and expectations.
The only problem was I didn't surpassed hers...

I've been suffering for 8 months, and I'm trying to accept things just now, but I don't think things will be the same again, not even like they were before her.

Personally I just want to show people love, i always try to keep a positive attitude but most people just act cold infront of me. I have no friend that does not judge me or who i can text anytime i only have people who i know. I also have another problem which is that i smile a lot infront of some people for no reason it can be anyone. I try to control but it does not work. I wish we could hug more people and make jokes with them without seeming mentally ill. But there’s one thing im happy for and that is that i do get genuine hugs back from three people i know and that is the best feeling"

lonely,"Trying makes it worse, change my mind.","Trying makes it worse, change my mind. - Honestly, I think I will just stop trying. Stop trying to get to know new people. Stop trying to find love.  
Trying makes it just worse, you feel even lonelier when you get constantly ditched by people. I sure would like to have friends who aren't always busy (I'm at an age where people marry, build houses and have kids) or even some who are more local, so you could hit them up and spontaneously do stuff. I sure would love to have someone I can love, share my day, cuddle at night and build a future together with. But in the end, while I know nobody will kick in my door, I feel so much better when I just live my life without bothering with this, sure it's lonely at times, sure I would like it better if some things where different, but I pretty much got ghosted by everyone I was talking to again, so why bother? I did some chores, I went grocery shopping, bought some games, played one, watched some shows. It's not like I don't know what to do with my time, I could keep myself busy for years. It just sucks to know that it would matter to no one if I disappeared tomorrow. It just sucks to know that I will never have the things I wanted from live."

I've been feeling lonely for a very long time and its just getting worst everyday. Having friends with partners dont really help too, it just makes me feel like i have a problem.

I still know i have qualities and im just proud of the person i am but im starting to have doubts again...
Im telling myself : maybe im doomed to never be loved, maybe im not good enough to be loved, maybe I'll just die alone.

Its hard because my friends also know that im a great guy and that i would be a fantastic bf but ive been single every single day of my life despite the qualities i have.

Anyway, im just scared to become extremely sad again because of it 🙃"
lonely,Met a woman yesterday from a meetup,"Met a woman yesterday from a meetup - Its odd but I was the only one who showed up yesterday. The meetup group is more towards in conversation about philosophy and life. Anyways we exchange numbers and shes inviting me to come by and hang out with her at her house tomorrow and probably meet the rest of her friends.

What I lack the most is friends who I can really connect with from a deep level and understanding.. I’ve always told myself I would go out and make new friends that I needed a new circle of people who I can connect with.. but I was too scared or felt awkward that I kept reverting back to connecting with past friends and these friends weren’t good for me because of how superficial they can be.. and even hanging out with them makes me feel lonely and even sleepy by how bored the conversation gets.

I went from having 6 friends in my inner circle to needing to gradually disconnect and part ways from each of them due to our own level of change, interest and lack of understanding for eachother.. I was finally left with zero friends.. I just wanted a more real connection with those whom I consider as friends.


But yeah for those out there try the meetup website or app and find groups that you can relate with. Whether it’s going for a hike, bike ride, yoga, meditation, movies, bowling, friendship. It’s all about connecting with those of likeminded."

lonely,how to get over shit,"how to get over shit - Back a year or so ago, I used to have a really, really good friend that I had known for almost a decade. We were close on another level to me at least. Constantly doing stuff on weekends, always trying to find time to play games if we cant meet. We both were like brothers really. Now he was like really important to me because it was sort of my escape. Parents are relatively strict, school sucks, homework, etc. And I think he felt the same. I didnt really have any other good friends or friends in general other than him during that time. God I just cant even begin to say how happy and fun those times were, like it was clear to anyone to be honest. We were practically family. 

Now the change

Well, so my biggest regret like 2 years ago, is that we were in High school, and I made a bet with him, because we both were pretty shy, to go any try to ask out our crushes. Well, you can probably guess how that went for me, but happily for him, he was successful. Now I didnt get mad at him or his girlfriend then, and U still am not even now. But soon after, he basically forgot I existed. Id attemp to talk to him, but he eouldnt talk as much, he was always tryna do stuff with her. I full understood, thinking that they both just met, and are getting to know each other better. ""He will come back and talk to me eventually, right?"" Wrong. I just kept telling myself that for as long as I could until i really had to accept the fact that we are not friends anymore. I thought I had gotten over him, but I really havent. It has been almost a year, I still feel really sad about this. I dont know what to do"

Is it just the human nature of always wanting more?  Never being satisfied?
I’m not beautiful, not just saying that. There might be beautiful things about me on the inside but I’m talking about on the outside. It’s unfortunate but I don’t know why it’s bugging me so much :(

Is it because I’m always surrounded by beauty? Is it because I love all things beautiful? I honestly don’t know.

I’m trying to be rational and say that even if I’m not beautiful that there are other things to enjoy in life. I don’t like being bitter. I try to talk through my thoughts and rationalise but that doesn’t help.

lonely,Forever on my own,"Forever on my own - This is kind of spur of the moment.

I can't 'see a therapist' because I feel none have understood me, one would say it's autism/bipolar/adhd/follow that thought!!/desire and then another would say the complete opposite. Was forced to see people who I felt had no understanding and feel there are no solutions. I am terrified and beat myself up everyday.

I'm angry at losing things important to me that I can't get back. My siblings who abused/enabled and destroyed me are getting their happily-ever-afters.
I've had delusions that ruined my life, but no one to tell me or care until I realised myself....too late.

At this point i am just feeling so lonely that I don't even feel anything. People can come and insult me but I'll not feel anything. The only people that I know truly cares for me is my mom.

lonely,You have to do stuff to make friends and you have to have friends to do stuff,"You have to do stuff to make friends and you have to have friends to do stuff - I've been trying to reach out to people again recently but I keep just getting ignored. The reason for this (if I had to guess) is that I never finished school and have never had a job yet because of serious mental health issues. Because of this I can't really talk personal stuff and I don't have any work/study talk to chat about. I avoid talking about anything depressing about my life - dysfunctional and abusive family, lack of work, no special or even basic skills - because I know that's just not a good idea. I leave these things out but usually they come up eventually anyway. They'll ask what I do and I don't feel comfortable lying or changing the topic if they're asking directly so I'll tell them I'm jobless and not studying. Even “friends” who are former NEETs will start avoiding me when they hear stuff like that, I guess it's a red flag.

This means I'm left with a very small selection of things to talk about and a high chance of being dropped as a friend because all I have are memes and talking about media I've watched/read. I want to change all this but it seems like it needs to be all at once. I need to do some kind of volunteer work but in order to do that consistently I need better mental health, which means I need to have more friends, but to have more friends I need improve my life, but to improve my life I need more friends, etc. I know there's other stuff like meditating and exercise that you can do on your own but overall I have to do all these things at once and maintain it all in one go or else it's back to square one. I've managed to do some of these things for periods at a time but never for long enough, let alone all the stuff I've never done.

I'm not trying to be self-pitying about this, I know its my responsibility that I've failed (and continue to fail) at keeping, it's just I never see much talk about how if you aren't in the loop on these things then you can't escape isolation. Whatever, that's enough of a ramble."

lonely,Will I always feel lonely?,"Will I always feel lonely? - So I used to be a lonely kid, I didn’t have many friends, and got bullied quite a lot. But, when I got a little bit older, and finally graduated out of my emo phase, I stopped getting so much hate and actually became quite a social butterfly. Im now at uni, I have lots of close mates who I hangout with all the time, and who I can talk to and vent to. Basically, I have everything that 14 year old me thought I wanted, the only problem is I still feel the same loneliness I did back then.

I still feel like no one really cares, and I still feel like no one understands me. Even though I have the connections I wanted, none of them feel real. I jus feel extremely separate from everything that’s going on around me. The best analogy I can think of is…(this sounds bad but hear me out) all my relationships feel like owning a dog, (hear me out). Although the dog loves the owner, and the owner loves the dog, the two will never be able to truly understand each other. So imagine all your friends were dogs, u might love them and they love you, but you’ll still feel lonely, and want a more understanding connection. 

I’m not saying all my mates are too dumb to get me, or anything ridiculous like that, the analogy works the other way round too (I could be the dog). My point is that I jus don’t get how other people work and I don’t think they understand me either. It’s like everyone else is on a wavelength that I’m not apart of, and never will be, like they all get something that I don’t. 

It feels like I crave a type of connection that either doesn’t exist, or is just unattainable for me, and that’s what hurts and scares me the most. 

Any advice or similar experiences will be helpful :)"
lonely,"In my 20s, lonely while surrounded by people and friends. I feel like watching a movie through my external character.","In my 20s, lonely while surrounded by people and friends. I feel like watching a movie through my external character. - Hey, 

I felt like posting here even though loneliness i experience is not conventional.
So I've gone through a mountain of shit despite my young age and eventually found peace of mind by ripping apart my beliefs and habits which I felt limited me. Some years ago I experienced a moment of clarity,no-self, whatever you call it. I saw through my beliefs about myself and about the world, and for a while I was no-one in my experience.
So now I'm left with no beliefs and I observe life living me instead of the other way.

This led to lasting peace of mind but now I can't really connect with anyone because everything kind of lost meaning when there are no beliefs. I just exist and am and this is all I know for sure.

I used to trust in science but even that assumes that there is a physical universe out ""there"" and it doesn't really question the reality of reality.

So while I have some friends and a loving family, the relationships feel like bunch of thought-made constructs and information coming from the senses (hearing and seeing). No-one gets the 'true' me, the awareness and never can. Observing the external world with mind empty of thoughts is calming but lonely. I feel like this transition is irreversible and sometimes I wish I could be immersed in my character and the external world again.

So this probably sounds ridiculous but it would be interesting to talk with someone who gets what I am talking about. I live peaceful life with my dog in the woods. And yes let's go with assumption that I am sane. I have no problem with this but would love to connect with someone who resonates. I only feel peace and gratitude which is awesome but I miss the immersion.





TL/Dr: I don't trust my thoughts and have no beliefs ---&gt;  I am a no-one feeling a bit disconnected from the external world and other people. If you resonate, feel free to pm me:)"
lonely,i just want to let out how lonely i feel,"i just want to let out how lonely i feel - this isn’t really a question or scenario but i guess i’ve just been feeling really lonely recently and not sure what to do. 

i’m 23F and recently all my close friends have been getting into romantic relationships or creating those relationships too and i’m still hanging around. 

I’ve been single for 1.5yrs and have never felt more confident in myself. i’ve always had (and still do) have the mentality to never push or ‘search’ for a relationship because it will come at the right time. i guess i’m just sick of being alone and not having someone around who i know cares. 

i’ve been getting caught up in “talking” stages and there is a specific guy i am interested in, but despite our interactions and cute messages/care he shows me i have this sight that it’s just to continue as a fwb situation. now my previous relationship has resulted in a few trust issues etc. but i guess i also am confused/ feel more lonely and worse because i don’t know his intentions and just don’t want to be used. 

i know a lot of people will encourage me to discover a new hobby/figure out my life but currently i am happy with the future i have planned (job/studies etc) and have been succeeding so far. i also have ADHD so i tend to either fixate on something for a month and leave it, or i just can’t get into anything such as a TV show, movies, readings etc.

This makes it really difficult for me to communicate my issues and when I do I feel like I have to tone it down because I’m suppose to be the strong one in our relationship she can’t handle too much because otherwise she’d spiral. 

Even when I’m not okay I still have to push through and do everything because my lows are low but her lows are lower. I don’t really have friends that I can talk to because well they just blame her or judge her and I don’t believe this is any of her fault.
