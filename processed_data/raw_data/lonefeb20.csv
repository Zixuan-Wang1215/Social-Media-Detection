lonely,Since the weekend’s here...,"Since the weekend’s here... - and I have no one to spend it with, friend or girlfriend, I’ve decided to do something fun with myself. Staying in the house all weekend is crushing to be honest, I need to experience the open world.

I’ll be going to my local mall today, likely to watch a movie of my liking. I may be alone, but at least I’m not dying in my house all weekend.

I think lonely people like us should try to enjoy life with ourselves just as much as with others. Any comments will be welcome!"

lonely,20M with serious social anxiety,"20M with serious social anxiety - I'm a college student. I have been a loner for almost all of my life. When I joined college everything seemed fine but days past I feel like really alone because I am staying away from my parents no one is there for me. Can't even talk to a women I don't know is this something of a serious problem. I get freaked out when girl talks to me or else I try and talk to women. I can speak if it is professional but I can't make friends I never made a conversation with women. I love women they're lovely creatures but I don't know I get a panick attack when I talk to them this doesn't mean that I am good with boys.

I seriously don't need any relationship just wanted to make a friend who is a girl not a girlfriend. I can't make a conversation though but if it was tech I can speak forever."

lonely,I suck and I don't understand why,"I suck and I don't understand why - I'm lonely, but I avoid people because I'm afraid of disappointing them. I feel like talking to people about my problems scares them away and everytime someone reaches out to me I'm scared to continue talking to them. I feel like I'm nothing more than a burden and everyone else is too busy to help with my problems. As a result I just hide in my room and refuse to text or talk to anyone unless they initiate first. I don't feel like I'm important or necessary, I just feel like I exist. I'm scared to bother anyone even if they tell me otherwise and idk what to do. I've been told that I talk too much so I try to listen but when I listen too much I get told I don't open up enough and criticized for it. I'm just so confused. I don't know what I'm doing wrong."

I hope you all make it someday, and I hope that I do too."

lonely,It's just always there.,"It's just always there. - I... am lonely. In everything, really. I suppose that's why I'm posting. It's just this constant feeling of looking behind me and realizing that there's no one there, watching my back. People come and go in my life like revolving doors. None of them get close enough to touch (though there have been almosts). There's no connection. I want to know people, to love and care for them but there's absolutely nothing, no time where it ever feels even somewhat mutual. And it's just this long, long thread of loneliness that roots back to my earliest memories. If I chose to die tonight, there wouldn't even be much of a point in leaving a note. Who for? My parents? God knows I don't understand any aspect of my relationship with them anymore. Maybe my brother, but even then, he's too young to understand. There wouldn't be much point to a funeral; my mother would probably cremate me and send my ashes to the wind to be alone there too.

It's just frightening. I'm just as alone in a small conversation as I am in a crowd. I'm alone amongst acquaintances, people leave in pairs and groups right in front of me. And it's not like I don't put effort into trying to meet people, make friendships. But inevitably, all friendships stay acquaintances until they disappear altogether. There's nothing, just like trying to hold water in my hands.

I've gotten used to it. It's like a third arm at this point, a pointless appendage. I work alone and I live alone. And when I'm with people, there's this constant, visceral itch that occurs, like _'none of them will ever see you', 'they will never know you', 'they will never love you'._ Almost like a learned fight or flight instinct that I manage to suppress and ignore.

And that's the real kicker about all -- I don't always think about it. I don't always think about this stupid fucking appendage. Sometimes I can almost call myself happy, spend months dispelling my depression and working towards my goals and distracting myself with hobbies. I set my standards high and force myself to live up to them as best I can and ignore that loneliness. It's so easy. I'm doing it right now. But it's terrifying how easy it is. I shouldn't be able to forget something so looming, but _I can._ What does that say about me? I'm always one fucking step away from a nervous breakdown and what? I have to live like this? I don't want to live like this! But fixing it feels so hopeless at this point. If I rip off an appendage, won't it just bleed out? It's certainly not something that'll scar over.

Anyway, there's not much else to say. Perhaps I'm being a bit melodramatic but I don't really care at the moment."

lonely,Damn,"Damn - I don’t know what to think anymore. I’ve recently come to terms with the fact that I have persistent depressive disorder which is evident from my mood swings, lack of appetite, persistent sadness, etc. I’ve known for my entire life that I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I don’t think I can take the thought of being even more “disordered”. This year, after all of my friends left me because I wouldn’t vape and smoke weed at the age of 16, I’ve decided to work on myself and push through this constant, treacherous anxiety but over the last few days I’ve realized that it was my sole motivator, and now the depression is starting to take hold. My grades are dropping and I’ve never felt more alone, I don’t fit in with everyone else, no one will understand me, which is why I put on my daily facade."
lonely,I'm sorry a year is too late,"I'm sorry a year is too late - A year ago, I was head over heels for a girl.  It didn't seem to go anywhere so I tried to be friends...I still felt like I was being pushed away.  I was so hurt because I thought she was sweet, kind, funny, smart, understanding but I got over it when I was done with being pushed away.  Since then, I've gone through a breakup with another girl...almost 6 months after my relationship, when I'm almost healed, I saw her where she worked and we said hi...I kept my distance.  She reached out today, we texted and she congratulated me for grad school and tried to be kind and initiative...but I'm sorry, the ship has sailed.  I will be your friend but I'm way too hurt...I'll keep my distance, thank you.  You're still great, but that was painful man."

lonely,Starting to wonder what my purpose is here.,"Starting to wonder what my purpose is here. - I’m a 28 yo female and I feel like I have no one that actually cares about me or wants to put in effort into being my friend. If it wasn’t for my family (sister, mom and dad) I would probably try to end it. It’s such a disturbing thing for me to type that because until now it’s sort of been a repressed thought. But lately it seems like it’s looming over me. Every guy I meet ends up using me for sex, it never turns into anything meaningful, when I try to make new connections with friends it seems like it just falls through and they don’t initiate hanging out. When we do hangout out though we have a great time, which I actually think makes it worse because I feel like they must just see me as replaceable when I see them as a valued friend. I’m almost always by myself on the weekends just walking around the big city exploring alone. And the depression from being lonely doesn’t make it any easier to make friends."
lonely,Drinking alone at a bar tonight,"Drinking alone at a bar tonight - Well all of my regular buddies have all paired off now so I'm usually stuck staying at home playing games or watching TV. But tonight I wanted to go out and do something, but as usual they were all busy with other things. So I decided to go out anyway. I figured I might be drinking alone but atleast I'll be in the vacinity of others so it won't be too bad. But somehow this is worse.

I'm just here listening to every one else with their groups, talking and having a good time. It reminds me of the times my friends and I used to have. 

I know this situation is more than likely temporary and as my situation changes I won't always be alone. But tonight, right here, right now, this sucks  and I just wanted to vent a little bit.

So here's me raising my glass to anyone and everyone else who is alone right now and wishes they weren't."

lonely,Struggling with social media,"Struggling with social media - In October, I deleted the vast majority of my social media accounts. I had two reasons. The first was the data collection/privacy issue. I don’t like my privacy being violated as a condition for using a service. The biggest issue though was the alienation that’s often cultivated by social media. I didn’t feel connected to anyone in my friend list apart from my immediate family. I felt like it just added another layer between me and the people I was supposed to be connected to. So I deleted them. 

Now it’s almost March and my loneliness is arguably worse. I’ve not had any contact with anyone outside of my immediate family since and while I know I’m partly to blame, I feel like I’ve made the issue I had worse. At least before, I was interacting with my friends, even if it was filtered and commodified. Now I’m more alone than I was and I have nothing to show for it. Not sure if I should make a new account so that I can get something, anything."

Some info about me: I live in the United States, watch too much youtube, and am always trying out new games. I like to listen to a lot of music but my taste is mostly alternative rock and alternative pop and such from what I've been told. I have social anxiety and it really has an affect on my life. Because of this I struggle to socialize with people in real life and as a result haven't had friends in a long time. I'm not 18 yet and I'm not in school either (that's a story for another day) so I don't have any other option but to look for friends online (at least that's how it feels). I have a good time talking about almost anything so feel free to talk to me about whatever you feel like. Thank you."

No you then notice they stop replying at a normal time and then you're lucky if you get a response ins 24 hours. You figure they're just busy so you let them be but you see them playing everything you used to play together with someone else or without you. You don't say anything because you don't want to be ""*clingy*"" and eventually they stop replying completely. you message them again and they completely ignore it and you're back to being lonely wondering if you're just boring, annoying or both :)"
lonely,"My experience with Loneliness, and severe Social Anxiety.","My experience with Loneliness, and severe Social Anxiety. - This is going to be kinda long, so sorry in advance if it looks like a wall of text. This will probably get buried, but I greatly appreciate anyone that sees, and reads this. 

So, here it goes:

I'm about to be 17 years old, and fortunate to have 1 friend, and a GF (long distance), but generally I don't talk to anyone. For the last 3 years of my life I've been endlessly falling into an abyss. Seemingly, my misery won't end until the day I die.

It hurts seeing the connections others have, and the endless amount of stories they have with the people the hold dearest. I want a story of my own to tell, but I'm too timid, and shy in nature to do much of anything.

The truth is, I've had really bad social anxiety my entire life. I'm not on the spectrum or anything. I'm just too reserved. One might think it's because I want it to be that way, but in all honesty, that isn't the case. I desperately want to make connections. I want to have friends, and I want to be able to socialize with others. I really do love talking to people, and it's the only thing that brings me happiness anymore.

Talking has always been an issue for me. My social anxiety makes me so quiet to the point where people might actually assume that I'm mute. Whenever people do try to talk to me, I usually seem uninterested, or unfriendly - usually because of how nervous I get. I feel so pathetic that I'm afraid that my girlfriend will leave me because of how shy, and quiet I am. I feel like my heart crackles whenever I consider the possibility.

I spend every day staying in my room doing nothing, but dreading life. I've contemplated ending my life to escape my pain. I feel like I'm at the end of the road, where this is as good as life is ever going to be. That I'm just going to be sad, and lonely forever.

So, that's my take on life. Not much else to say.

TL;DR: Living life in a lonely bubble, unable to escape. Severe social anxiety has crushed everything left in me."
lonely,From extrovert to complete loneliness,"From extrovert to complete loneliness - First ever reddit account and post.

I will try not to make this long and write my life story.

When I was younger I always thought I had a lot of friends both close and regular school friends. I wasn't a really popular kid that join all the teams and clubs but I had a decent group of friends and I used to be fairly extroverted and had a very close friend group of 5-6 people. At the time my family was a complete mess always fighting and hating each other it was really depressing coming home so I only had my friends. The last year of high school when I was 18 was probably the best year of my life. This was when I smartened up and got my grades up while at the same time enjoying time with my friends. I grew up having a lot of social interaction whether it was messages or hanging out etc. 

I went from the happiest year of my life to the worst year of my life. I entered university with high hopes but there was a sudden financial situation so I could not pay for a dorm or a place near the campus. I had to commute nearly 5 hours a day (6 if there was bad weather). I got really bad depression that year from loneliness, family, and meaningless studies. I didn't meet or talk to a single person other than when I was asking the prof some questions. 

And now I'm 3 years in, nearing 21. I added 3 facebook friends since graduating high school. I only keep in contact with 2 friends from high school and my other close friends completely cut ties with me (still don't know why). Whenever I try to think of a happy memory it feels like such a distant memory. I spend my weekends and rest days alone in my room for my entire waking hours watching movies or playing games and only coming out to eat food. 

Sorry for the long post everyone."
lonely,"If you have grandparents, give them a call","If you have grandparents, give them a call - I’ve been posting this in quite a few subreddits, this is a realization I came across just a few days ago and it changed my view on a lot of things and I think it might be relevant here too.

Hi, I’m 20, I’ve got pretty young grandparents compared to most, 70. They are both well alive, except my grandfather appears to have gotten to the beginning stages of Alzheimers. In my teenage years I always blew calling my grandparents off cause I thought: “I don’t  have much to talk about anyway, what’s the point?” “I’m busy with other things; gaming; hanging out with friends doing nothing productive..

Well, I read a post earlier about this and it resonatod so strongly that I felt the need to make another one so that it might teach people and make them think of it, just like I did.

I can’t speak for everyone, maybe your grandparents were shitty, but for those who have great ones; give them a call — they’ll love it so much, it’ll be the highlight of their day. These are people who have been with you since the beginning . If you’re feeling bad, call them: tell them about it. You’ll might feel a bit better yourself. Family is the most important thing to them, they can say they love you an speak the absolute truth. And no one wants to feel alone, and older folks nowadays are especially so. Try and think of you yourself being that age.

It doesn’t have to take that long, 5 minute of your day, you honestly can miss that. I would like to qoute a meme that inspired this post: 

“Don’t text these girls tonight that don’t want you, text your grandma goodnight and tell her that you love her.  It’ll make her week.”

Cause one day you won’t be able to call them and hear their voice."

lonely,I had a dream,I had a dream - A dream where I was with a girl that I caught feelings for. Her personality is amazing. She told me how she was going to break up with her boyfriend twice but they’re still together. I wish I could be with her. Anyways my dream was that I was at a football game. I saw her and since I know her I went to go say hi. For some reason I gave her a kiss on the forehead and I immediately realized my mistake after doing that. She didn’t appreciate that from me. She got mad at me and left. I went into my car and sat there. She saw me from the distance and came to talk to me in my car. She was telling me something. I wanted to tell her that I had feeling for her and wanted to be with her. But as soon as I was going to tell her she left the car. I said “wait I need to tell you something important” but she said I have places to be. There I was sitting in my car heart broken. Ill be lonely forever. This dream it felt too real...

Also I not purpose hurt one of her friends emotionally. I just don't know what to do anymore im alone and want nothing more than to just die."

I get it. I tell myself I'm a useless, forgettable, and worthless person all the time but seeing it in action just really knocks me down emotionally especially because now I'm seriously trying to make an attempt to better myself but in the 2 days pushing through social anxiety and self hate I feel like there's been more crushing blows to my self esteem than ever before.

I used to have friends and was very social when I was younger. I have quite possibly the best girlfriend even though she lives 18ish minutes away but we still make time. I get bullied at school and I’m very often alone, I recently cut myself but I regretted it, I was wanting help and I’ve even asked for it never came. I’m lonely at school even though some people will say hi. I’ve witnessed 2 divorces , my dad moving 2 hours away from his kids when it happened, my stepdad (my father figure since I was 10) divorced because my mom didn’t accept him saying he didn’t want to live in a house with my reckless sister and with no rules being applied to her. I have been getting made fun of since the 5th grade. I’m autistic but it’s not like I’m in a different classroom bad, I have very bad anxiety and I always worry. I think I’m depressed and so has my therapist. I want to have people who ask to see me and help me through living in a house with my mom always taking her anger out on me (yells at least 3 times a week) for me being awkward and my anxiety. I know this is all over the place, dm if you want to help/learn more ig. Thank you"
lonely,Some poetry for all that feel down &amp; a rant,"Some poetry for all that feel down &amp; a rant - To all the r/lonely redditors. Life is miserable and difficult enough, do not make it harder for yourselves.

I know it is a bit ""depressing"" that I am using these poems to motivate us, but to hell and back, if that man wrote these masterpieces then the light must truly exist.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb07yIAKyuQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb07yIAKyuQ) 

To everybody that feels down, to whom that cannot see the light, do not give up the good fight.

Life is the most significant adventure that we will experience. We come alone and we leave alone. 

We are not special. We are not beautiful and unique snowflakes. We are not entitled to anything, except what we conquer and yet we may lose it if we blink, cause life is not forgiving. Relationships are variables-struggles that need constant attention, nothing is static, everything is evolving, giving to much will result the same as when giving to little. Do not be afraid to give, but do not give ONLY for to receive.

Act on what you want and not on what you might expect that may go wrong. Do not let your mind work on the principle of anticipation. Fear not of interacting with people; fear not of rejection by others; fear not of failure. Fear only when, letting yourselves down; wasting your energy on thoughts that only drag you down; not accomplishing your goals; not achieving your desires.

Drop everything that holds you back, ""friends""; emotions; things being a certain way; being a certain person, let your fears, insecurities and idiosyncrasies  burn like deadwood. Make your goals sharp and clear thus specifying also your failure for which you will be mentally prepared. Remain humble, have self control and an open mind.

Suit up, keep your head up no matter what comes your way, and go out into the world, interact as if it is your final day. No matter what is thrown at you, do not give up, train yourselves both mentally and physically, better yourselves with each passing day, play the long game in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

A whisper from someone who fell many times and has risen again, from one that lost his higher purpose in life - my guiding star - but will find it again no matter what.

I’m in college so I’ll talk to whoever’s sitting next to me or whatever but then that relationship disappears idk what I’m doing wrong how is everyone else out there getting all these friends?

It’s been years since I had a friend group"
lonely,"Yeah, I feel very lonely","Yeah, I feel very lonely - Idk how to word this, but two days ago in bed, I actually started crying when I thought about it.

I'm currently in college but I'm only friends with former High School friends. One of them goes to my college but we only share one day and don't see each other often, so we all chat via Discord, and at times I'm ignored and I'm the quickest/first to answer a text. We rarely all see each IRL, and when we do it's always treated as a special event. Most of the times I'm literally just hanging out in my room by myself.

I'm introverted, I do need my ""me"" time, not gonna lie, but sometimes I run out of stuff to do and the loneliness starts to overwhelm me. Just last year I finished HS, and my college class is small by comparison, so the people I see each week has dramatically decreased. I don't go out much, I don't meet up with my friends often, do stupid stuff etc.

And I know love isn't everything in life, but I seriously lack it. I'm dating someone rn and everyone's pressuring me to make the move and make it official etc. but I'm too inexperienced to do anything, yet I do want a partner. I never even had my first kiss yet. It's a huge step for me.

Because of this, sometimes I relate and get quite attached to NSFW because it's all the intimacy and love ( \*that\* kind of love I mean) that I have.

Sorry if I rambled a bit, I just wanted to put my feelings out there"

And one thing that comes to mind is the church. The church was a olace everybody could come and was always open and didn't charge anything for you to come. You could just sit and reflect with other people also searching for answers. That's the deeper connection i miss in my life. My only problem is I feel alienatied to the church and no one in my generation associates with the church that I know off. It's like it's something ""outdated"". But I still like the idea of coming together with people searching for something bigger than our shallow day to day worries."

I go to my favorite bar where they know who I am but the only thing is. I don't really know people. I don't have any friends and when I want to make them I just can't keep in touch. So what is do is go alone to the bar. Always order the same drink and sit back look at people in the room.

Is that weird? Or am I just overthinking the whole situation?

I had to explain to him that I don’t have any that lives with me and that my cats are my family. L O L.

I eventually meet two other people. After feeling so low, meeting them really gave me hope. I felt that same closeness in our friendship that I thought I would never get back. However, when I started high school I started to feel like I was the “throw away friend”. They did stuff without me a lot and it got to my head. Long story short, we stopped talking and once again I lost two close friends. I feel like it was a huge mistake to let that friendship slip away, even if I did feel like I wasn’t included. I don’t really feel like I can be myself around my current friends and I am not that close with any of them. Sometimes I feel like my current friends don’t care about me and I chalk that up to just me being selfish and expecting more out of them then I should be."

we live in a hyper-sexualized society, to say the least. we’re living in the rise and fall of hookup culture, and i see all of my peers out passing themselves around like a church donation plate, but i’ve never even thought to involve myself in any part of it. it seems like whenever somebody is interested in me (and i use that term loosely), all they’re looking for is some cheap meaningless hookup. i don’t want something shallow; all i’ve ever wanted is somebody to hold, and to talk to, and to understand - but it seems like nobody wants you unless you have something to “offer”.

what are the odds of a perfectly good person wanting to be with somebody like *me*, anyway?

i’ve avoided crunching the numbers. all i know is that it’s a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction, and those odds aren’t in my favor. i’ve held out hope that somebody could really love me for who i am, even if for nothing more than the sake of my own integrity - hell, i’ve never even kissed anybody - but what if it’s all just some sort of self-absorbed idealistic fantasy? what if i’m spending my youth trying to hold onto my principles, waiting for somebody who doesn’t even exist in the first place?

lonely,I only feel peace in sleep,I only feel peace in sleep - I only feel peace when I'm asleep or I'm laying in bed. Literally every other time I'm in pain or lonely or tripping over my life and how I ended up or just hating existence and consumed with my worries and problems. I wish so bad to just be that sweet little kid again who looked at the clouds and listen to happy music and enjoyed the sun. It's like I've entered some ice world and I have no shelter no clothes I just keep slipping on the ice freezing in the dark and searching for light.

Been very serious ever since I was a little child. Which made me unfun ig. And I've only made a couple friends in the last 2 years. There's this invisible glass wall between me and the rest of the ppl around me. And noone has tried to get to know me in uni, even tho I try to put myself out there. 

Out of the blue comes this guy that legit shows interest in getting to know me. And he told me he thought i was cool. 

I don't know why this makes me so happy, but it does. Maybe I'm not that bad."

lonely,Why do friends do this?,"Why do friends do this? - I am a shy dude, I keep to myself, I like my alone time but I play video games on weekend nights, a year ago I met a bunch of people online who I didn’t know were going to be my best of friends, I only have one friend irl but that’s it, he was in this group, we all knew each other so well, they were my second family, they were my brothers. One month ago they all blocked ME expect my irl friend. He was also blocked. Without a single clue, gone just like that. College has been hard for me but this is worse, I know it happened a month ago but getting over them is hard enough I have game clips with them, we had so many good times together. I miss them, i since then have tried to make new friends but it doesn’t work out because they don’t have the same humor or interest as me. I am just sad and lonely. My irl friend has been busy we barely get too see each other, we tried to make a plan to go to the movies but it was canceled because he couldn’t make it so I had to watch the movie by myself, I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s hard real hard to have friends gone without knowing what happened."
lonely,Completely Isolated.,"Completely Isolated. - I've never been good at making friends. I get along with people well enough, but getting truly close to others has always been difficult. I have never had a best friend and I currently have no real social life. The only person I can talk to about most things is my therapist and even then, I keep some things to myself. I've been getting involved with a group of people that meet twice a month, but I've yet to connect with any of them and don't have any interaction with them in between meetings.

My relationship with my family isn't terrible, but there are so many strained connections that I honestly have begun to have an almost sociopathic reaction to them. I sometimes feel like I just feel nothing towards them and don't really feel as if I fit it. Just about everyone has had a huge blow-up with someone else and with all the divorces in the family, I have never really known what it's like to have the whole warm fuzzy family experience.

I got divorced a little over two years ago and it has been almost a decade since I was single and trying to date. Of the few actual girlfriends or just women I have dated for a bit, most of them weren't in my life for that long so, to be perfectly blunt, I feel inadequate. My ex-wife more or less made me feel like I am bad at sex and I am now so terrified of any physical connections that I doubt I will ever have sex again. It doesn't help that I can't get a 2nd date let alone a 1st one with any of the few matches I have  had on OLD sites.

My social anxiety, unbelievably low self esteem, and general lack of interest in living has made even the thought of going out alone a terrifying prospect. I don't drink that much, I don't smoke, and I don't do drugs. I am not a fan of bars or dance clubs either. I have always been a shy, geeky, homebody. I feel more comfortable in small groups doing things like playing board/table top games, watching a movie, or just hanging out. I am in my 40s now, so staying out till 3am isn't that appealing unless I am really have a great time.

I pretty much have been doing nothing but work and sleep and work and sleep since I moved into my apartment. Online Dating sites have proven completely useless and I have never ever met a person organically. I can't get laid if my life depended upon it. At this point, I never see myself getting married again, let alone having a girlfriend again. I don't see things like having kids and buying a house in my future.

I can already hear people saying that I probably shouldn't even be thinking about dating, especially not when I am pretty much on the verge of wanting to kill myself every day. I don't want nor do I expect anyone to come into my life and fix me. However, it doesn't change how soul crushingly lonely I am all of the time. It's almost the weekend and I have nothing planned. I have no idea where to go or what to do. I will most likely get out of work Friday night, order a pizza, and then have a few beers and watch something on Netflix. I'll spend the rest of the weekend at home alone, barely able to get out of bed before noon, and ultimately not setting foot outside because... well, what the fuck am I going to do?

I just don't really care what happens anymore. If I knew for certain I'd be dead by tomorrow, I wouldn't even bother getting up to piss. Nothing has made a difference. I just feel empty. I have nothing to offer anyone. All I want is for it all to end."
lonely,I want to tell it,"I want to tell it - Today, the girl that I love, said that she want things tranquil between us... maybe my feelings played with me and I wanted all fast with her... but the possibility of having a relationship with her is impossible... despite the fact that she says it might be possible...

Anyway... I feel like I’m destroyed again... I’ll never get something special with the girl that I love or maybe a future girls

I just wanted to say that I wish I were enough for them, I wish I were all that she wants and need... but I’m not, and I have to continue here, being her friend as I promised, despite it hurt me... and I don’t want to miss her friendship

lonely,Always the friend,"Always the friend - All my friends have abandoned me, i was not a good friend at times but it turns out ive been undiagnosed and unmedicated bipolar 1 most of my life. 

Diagnosed in sept 2019 after i hung myself. Finally returned to the real world after soending over 2 years in a apartment in a small town where i literally knew not one person. 

Somehow i ""went for it"" during a manic episode and asked a girl out im really into at work, of course she wants to be friends, story of my life. Its not her fault though, i knew i had no chance, self fulfilling prophecy i guess. But ever since the rejection ive spiraled into hell. When i work with her all i feel is overwhelming failure, pathetic, inadequate, and unwanted. 

I am truly isolated, i smoke weed all day and thats it. Once i get bored of weed im not sure what ill do, probably try to take the nice nap, im tired of it all. Fuck bipolar fuck racing toughts fuck it all"

You eat your fast food of choice because everyone’s gotta have a last meal right? You get back home and your room still looks like garbage, your DMs are still dead, your body hasn’t improved, you feel tired and just want to lay down again. Honestly this was a stupid idea, I’m never gonna improve, this is just who I am, I’m just gonna have to learn to accept it and hope someone accepts me for it and loves me this way, yeah, that’s how it’s gonna be...

lonely,everyone hates me,"everyone hates me - First it was middle school, where I let the person who I thought was my best friend walk all over me and then abandon me, and left me all alone. Next, it was in high school, where I was left alone by a person who I also thought was a close friend of mine, saying she felt ""unappreciated"", while she was the one who didn't respect me at all. It doesn't help that at home I have a horrible sister who does everything to hurt me, and parents who say they'll listen to me and my problems, but really won't. I just wish I knew why everyone always ends up leaving me, all alone. Im left to my horrible thoughts, which just make me want to do some horrible things. First was cutting my hair, then it was cutting more of my hair, and then it was some urges to take some pills everyday, that weren't really mine. (I didn't take any because I couldn't find any). I try to distract myself with stuff I may like to do and things that ""interest me"", but I've just slowly realized that nothing interests me anymore, and all I want to do anymore is just stay in bed and sleep. I'm really sorry for this rant, but I just couldn't stop myself, I just to distract myself before I did something I would regret later. My mental status has just disintegrated so fast over the past 5 years, and I always act like I'm okay and happy because I just have to. Just so no one has to worry about me in the end. Im sorry"
lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."
lonely,I crave constant social interaction,"I crave constant social interaction - I constantly crave social interaction. Once I get it, I don’t know what to say. I’m socially awkward and I’m an unattractive overweight guy in his 20s, so I’m not the type of person most people want to spend time talking to. I don’t blame them. 

I have a number of good friends, but I text/call them daily, and a lot of them are getting tired of my shit. One of my good friends told me to stop calling and texting her yesterday. It hurt to hear that, but I understand where she’s coming from. I ask a lot of people and I don’t have much to give in return.

I’m not suicidal or at risk of harming myself or anything like that. Just lonely. If any of you good people out there want to talk, let me know. I would love to talk to someone. About anything. Got a new job and want to tell some random internet stranger about it? Awesome. Your SO is stressing you out and you need to vent? I’m here. Just let me know.

I wish I could just have at least one person that actually wants to be my friend. One person that actually reciprocates the feelings I have for them for once in my life. I try my best to be a good person in every way, but being ""good "" or ""nice"" isn't good enough, it's the basics of being a decent human being. There is nothing that sets me apart from anyone else, which is why people don't care about me and is probably the reason why I've never had any friends or a partner."

I dont find myself attractive at all and these things have been just reassuring me that I'm not attractive at all.

So... pretty fuckin lonely for 2 years. I'm a junior in high school. I've struggled with social anxiety a lot. It's getting better. Actually it's so much better. Just I don't really know the point of recovering from it. I guess I feel better. I'm still shit at socializing. I guess. 


But the more and more I think about it, I can't see myself able to build close relationships/friendships. I just can't. I can really only see myself as the guy you get answers from, the guy who helps you out, gives feedback, etc. Like I'm just there... kinda sittin' around. Terrible feeling when you feel like a tool.



One of my worst habits, because I'm very nonconfrontational, I make an appearance around someone a lot. Like if there's someone who I would wanna be friends with, or someone I like, I'll walk by as much as possible. Shit sucks.


I'm a filler. That's it. Nothing else to it. I'm disposable. I'm replaceable. I know that I matter n shit but fuckin c'mon.

I was paranoid and accusatory of everybody who were my friends. Overtime I did made some aquantiances, but never let myself get close to anybody in real life. 

I was afraid of people leaving me, so I tend to push away before bad can happen.

The last close friend I had I lost over Christmas. I decided to not talk as much to her, and ignore her because I had to leave before I get left... it felt so eminent to me... Only reason I have to explain this fear is because I lost lost something on a much larger scale... Imagine losing your own house to a natural disaster event... Even before that I lost friends to suicide, and got kicked out of my family for questioning my sexuality at one point. Being told I wasn’t to set foot in their house and that they hated me. 

Every issue just kept snowballing, manifesting itself into a bigger issue. 

I tried to message this friend months later by saying,”Hello, wondering how you been because it’s been awhile since we talked which is my bad of course. I understand if you don’t any contact with after ignoring for no apparent reason which is wrong regardless of the reason. Anyway I hope you’re doing well.” 

I message her because I knew it was wrong what I did regardless of fear, and knew I probably did hurt her, I loved this girl...she the closest thing that reminded me how things use to be, the old times I secretly missed so much. 

I hate myself for ignoring her and pushing away.

Despite years of friendship, she decided to just ignore my message which I don’t blame her for. Not at all. I just hate that my friendship had to end like that. 

I kept hoping for months she responded to that texts, and nothing as I deserved.

I am undeserving of her friendship, and the  friendship of other people.

I am trying to make more of an effort in real life though, but not sure whether I’m truly ready. I felt like I have grown and changed, yet I worry at times."
lonely,37 and missed out on life?,"37 and missed out on life? - TL:DR: 37 male, one long term relationship, zero success since then, looking for tips moving forward...

 

A bit of background, I was the guy in high school that you either didn't know was there or was getting bullied. Even worse I had to change high schools every year while my parents were getting divorced...so I never really made relationships or had the chance to date. The few times I reached out to girls I was brutally made fun of or led on. Those interactions led me to isolate myself even more, but honestly it didn't matter as I was in no position to try dating with my family life.

 

After high school I put myself through college. It took me much longer (11 years) than average to finish my degrees, but I got there and now have a great job (software developer). While I was working one of my part time jobs to pay for college, I eventually met a girl (I was 23 at the time) and we were in a relationship for nearly 10 years. The relationship ended abruptly for me when she wanted a ""break"" and that ended with her getting married to another guy six months later. Apparently she had been cheating on me and I didn't realize it.

 

I didn't let that get me down and I used the breakup as a reason to work on self-improvement. I started working out and getting into better shape. I lost about 50 pounds and my self-confidence was at an all-time high. Eventually I decided to try to get back out there. People (my one single friend and coworkers) kept telling me to try online dating. I don't have much of a social circle, so this seemed like a good idea at the time. Fast forward three years and online dating has ended as a total failure. I have had zero messages/matches this whole time. It wasn't due to a lack of trying as I tried multiple apps and sent thousands and thousands of messages that ended with nary a response. I recently started deleting my dating profiles to not focus on it as much.

 

I turned 37 a few months ago and beyond having a good job I feel like life has passed me by with my only having one relationship. That combined with being so unsuccessful with online dating has certainly not helped. I recently started attending various meetup groups and trying a few new hobbies (dance lessons). That has helped at least in meeting some of my social needs, but I guess I'm just wondering if anyone can relate to me and/or offer any advice with moving forward in meeting women?"

But then there’s me, I can’t make friends because my autism just takes over.. I don’t know what to say and I’m afraid of what others think about me. I have problems with emotions aswell due to my autism.. it’s difficult for me to understand and see how another person is feeling.. and it gets in the way so much.. Is there anyone who has this problem? Or knows a way to deal with it.. I’m really desperate because everyone here in highschool has friends."

lonely,"Trying to come to terms with the fact my ""friends"" are acquaintances at best","Trying to come to terms with the fact my ""friends"" are acquaintances at best - Apologies in advance, as this is gonna be really rambly, I'm having a rough nite. 

I have never had a real proper friend my whole life. All the ""friends"" I have ever had have been due to convenience or when I was a kid, orchestrated by adults. A few bad experiences with people I thought were friends and one particular toxic person has ruined what little ability I have at making or retaining friends.  I feel so very isolated and I don't even know where to begin and try to get myself out of here. Its hard to see people you consider friends going out and doing things with each other while you sit at home and stew. I have really isolated myself in the last year as my mental health hasn't been the best. My social skills are at an all time low and I'm not even keeping in touch with people I grew up with. I'm so ashamed of my inability to make friends. It has gotten to the point where I sit in the toilet cubicle in college for an hour or two just so no one sees me on my own. 

Today has been particularly hard. In one of my college classes, we were put into groups for presentations. I vaguely knew the people I was put with and tried to chat to them, but their lack of response set my anxiety sky-high. After the class was done, all of these people in the lecture hall were chatting to either their friends or people in their group they had just met while I was just standing there. I could feel my stomach curling as I hurried out. Then when I got home I opened Snapchat to see a few of my friends had gone out for food. My heart just dropped. I have to come to terms that even though I see them as my friends but they see me as that girl they know who they are friendly with but that's it.  The thing is if I did go out with them, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it cause I feel like I'm walking on eggshells trying to keep them interested in me. They are really lovely people, so I don't hold anything against them. Still hurts though. 

I know this might seem a bit whiny and like I'm looking for pity, but I'm not trust me. The last thing I want is pity lol. Just wanted to get some things out of my head into the open. (I feel kinda better now I've wrote this)"
lonely,"For the first time in my life, I admitted to the first friend I had made in several years, that I was depressed, and I know no longer have a friend...","For the first time in my life, I admitted to the first friend I had made in several years, that I was depressed, and I know no longer have a friend... - I have been depressed and lonely since I was 15, (I’m 18 now), but as I got into university, things were finally looking up, and I was making a friend for the first time. Long story short things fell apart, she no longer wants to be my friend and told me that the whole thing had been awkward from the start. This wasn’t said in rage or anything, she said she had no hard feelings, but just did not want to continue. Things had kinda been awkward and I had come off as far too intense at times. 

This was upsetting, but I got on with my life, focusing on school, even though I was now completely alone. Slowly, I started to fall back into depression again, as I had nothing in my life to look forward to anymore. I just did not see the point in going on, and I kinda had a mental break. I really felt I had no one else to go to, and I thought people were meant to “reach out” and “talk to somebody”. She’s pretty much been the only person I have had any real connection with, and have related to. So I sent her a text telling her that I was feeling depressed, lonely, was struggling to get out of the bed in the morning, and needed someone to talk to, because I felt “I had nowhere left to turn”. She responded saying “Hi... sorry that you’re having a hard time, you can text me. But yeah like you said I don’t have advice but you can text...”, and I thanked her but it was late so I went to bed. The next day she texts me again saying “Sorry but I have really been thinking about this whole sending me texts thing and it isn’t going to work. It’s just stressing me out.” 

This devastated me. I have been dealing with depression alone for many years, and when I finally try to reach out to somebody they won’t even listen to me... Is my existence that worthless?? I don’t know what to do anymore... I really am not in the position to join a fucking club, and if another counsellor tells me that, I will snap. I am so lonely, and it’s not because I can’t talk to people or anything. I can and do. I just never manage to build and maintain friendships because I was unlucky enough to be born autistic and with parents who seem to care so little about my wellbeing, that they decided to manipulate me into being an emotional pawn in a divorce, before moving me across the world 4 times, forcing me to lose all childhood friends. 

I can’t do this anymore. I’m going to fail this semester. Not because I don’t do well academically, last semester I nearly got straight As. I just do not see the point anymore. I have no aspirations, no motivation, nothing to look forward to, and the worst part is that literally the only person who cares, is my mother who happens to live on the other side of the planet. I live with my Dad and I have told him but he really does not understand, and sometimes doesn’t seem to care. Because of how busy the school counselling service is, I won’t see one till mid-march. I was thinking about getting one outside of school, but it’s very expensive, and never seems to help based on what I’ve tried before. My Mum suggested I drop out of this semester and go down to her, but I can’t repeat this semester. I’d all be much easier if somebody just cared, if I had a friend who would go through the pains of showing that they care, and appreciate my existence... I know I am lucky enough to at least have one parent who cares (even if she does live across the globe), to be academically intelligent, and to be born in an upper middle class family, but I am not happy. I don’t see he point anymore. I am so tired of being alone..."

And it's not like I'm looking for a relationship or anything among those lines, just having someone around that would be open to listen to issues or having the opportunity to listen to their issues and I guess being hugged or hugging someone would feel good right about now. I don't know, it feels like I'm blabbering a bunch of nonsense, but I guess venting here is ever so slightly therapeutic.

""The hardest task we shall undertake,

So I took a break, and discerned that,

there is no structure, rhyme nor reason,

no justification, for life mimicking the changing seasons.

Though we all wish for an eternal spring,

we complain through the sunshine,

that our life is now boring.

Though we wish to forever cradle our innocence,

we are too ashamed accept its existence.

Though we wish to be loved, held or seen,

we rush to kill our desire, 

lest we come across as clingy, needy or even mean!

I have soaked in, many a beautiful sunrise,

and even more lonely sunsets.

I have walked the most beauteous fields,

and suffered many pestilences, to get here,

to get to your eyes, 

that helped me break my mask,

to get to your eyes, 

through which empathy so easily manifests,

to ask them to accompany me in my task.

Though I must confess, sometimes

I let my frustration transform me into a boorish bore,

not because I didn't try to put myself in your shoes,

it's just that I am so tired that I can't  walk any more."

lonely,Friendless for ever,"Friendless for ever - I don’t know what exactly my problem is, the only clue I have that it might be social anxiety.

I’m basically dumb, boring, annoying, have no social skills; basically unworthy of having friends.

However, I was truly blessed to make some great friends. Really good people.

I lost contact with them all. I felt so paranoid that I wasn’t important to them. No one has ever called me a ‘best friend’. I never felt for once that I’ll keep them around. It felt as if they were forcing themselves with me. Like they only kinda enjoyed, because, well, I was the only one available at the time.

I never had anyone to call me like multiple times to meet, to travel together, to hang around. Most of the time, I had to be the one to initiate and plan.

Eventually, I had a panic attack. I blocked all of their numbers and social media. I basically wanted out. I didn’t want to be around people who could just leave of ghost me, or simply say “I was busy”.

I know that I’ll never become important to anyone. I never maintained friendships because I’m just not a good human being.

I’m sick and tired of being alone, of seeing all of these people hanging around with their friends... I wish I was a sane person and kept the good company that I had.

I have no one in my life to share what I feel with. So why not posting to strangers on Reddit?"

lonely,Why am I that one friend who always reaches out first?,"Why am I that one friend who always reaches out first? - So, I'm 20 years and I've been feeling incredibly lonely lately. I don't get that get sad when I think about it, and I barely cry anymore but it's just that I keep having these weird feelings... I usually get over them by keeping myself busy, but sometimes it's not enough.

Now, it's not that I don't have any friends, I do have a handful of close ones, but I'd consider myself extremely introverted; meeting new people and making friends is almost impossible for me, all the contacts on my phone are people I've been talking to for 3+ years. 

I'm kind of used to myself by now, although I do wish I could be extroverted most times. The problem comes when I interact with my actual friends. They are all amazing people, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I do feel left out. I know that they all have a lot of friends other than me (they are all extroverted and love meeting new people), but sometimes I feel like I'm not enough of a good friend for them as they are to me. Considering that they've said multiple times that I am their best friend, the whole situation makes me even sadder. 

Some examples of why I think like this:

1. I'm always the first one to text them. I usually don't mind it that much, but sometimes it does get tiring. If I don't initiate conversations, days can go by without someone texting me. I know that some people assume that once you do that, they just wait for your texts, but on some occasions literal weeks go by without hearing from them, when just less than a year ago or so we talked every single day. It just sucks so much to constantly be asking them how they are and what they are doing but no one asking you back.
2. Even when I text them, they take so long to reply... I'd be fine with this if they were busy, but it's really not like that. When I'm with them, they're constantly on their phones and social media. The worst is when you've been waiting for a reply for a few days but they keep updating their social media accounts and even being active in group chats (ones that I'm also in).
3. They never update me on their lives. They could win the lottery tomorrow and I wouldn't have a clue about it unless they post it on the internet.
4. Never replying to my ig stories or other social media accounts. Now, I know this sounds really childish, but I always see them commenting on someone's pics or tweets super nicely, while I get absolutely no response. It just makes me feel really bad about myself and my relationship with my friends.
5. Always making plans, just not with me. It takes a lot of convincing and talking to plan something where I participate, and on some instances I don't even try to talk to them about it if they don't bring it up; it gets to the point where I just feel annoying whenever I suggest stuff to do.

I try to understand that they obviously have lives of their own, but sometimes I think that how they interact with me is just not it?

Have I talked about this with my friends? Yes, I have. They did not react well. Their respones were almost heartbreaking, but I really try not to think about it. Basically, they made me feel as if I'm the one in the wrong, and they convinced me so well that I really think that I'm the actual problem. At this point, I think there must be something wrong with me, although deep down I know there isn't. 

I might be insecure in myself, but I never talk about this problem with anyone, I already know what the outcome is, and after months of the same treatment it just makes me feel so meaningless. I feel as if I can't reach to anyone right now, all I have left is to work on myself as a person, be better and do good on my own, but it gets so, so lonely sometimes."
lonely,I haven't had a real conversation with anyone but my boyfriend in five weeks,"I haven't had a real conversation with anyone but my boyfriend in five weeks - I moved in with my long distance boyfriend in January and I haven't talked to anyone else since.

I still haven't found a job and I won't be able to afford school until I do. I don't have a car or any money, and I don't know anyone in the area.

lonely,lonely on my birthday. It only seems to get worse,"lonely on my birthday. It only seems to get worse - I turned 23 today and I just feel empty. 

When I turned 19 I was living with my best friend, had a decent job, had people around me that I could actually talk and relate with, but I felt terrible most of the time. Being around people makes me alert of how ‘not like them’ I am. My birthday rolled around and I was miserable. 

I turned 20 and everything was worse. I had to leave my friend and take care of my mom who’s depressed and an alcoholic. Living in that apartment was hell. My brother was becoming addicted to meth, my mom was  always at work or passed out on the couch in a drunk coma, and I was working, coming home and wondering what the hell my life was before crawling in bed.

Things seem to be getting better but I’m not happy. I can barely talk to my coworkers, the couple of friends I have I’m starting to resent because they are becoming distant from me or annoying because they’re the only people I see. I can’t relate to them. My best friend and I barely even talk anymore and it makes me feel like I’m losing a piece of myself as he’s been my friend since we were kids. 

I feel like shit. When asked why I don’t want to celebrate my birthday, I was finally honest with my mom and told her I don’t want to celebrate another year of me being a waste of space.

In short, I’m a lonely 23 year old guy who can’t talk to people, has never had a real girlfriend, and punishes myself for not being able to relate with anybody around me including my family. Every birthday I’m just reminded that another year has gone by and I’m still a socially awkward loner that has accomplished nothing. 

Maybe that’s dramatic, I don’t know. I just needed to vent."
lonely,Things don't make any sense anymore,"Things don't make any sense anymore - If you are reading this, I believe in you that you will reply me back. 

I am a 21 year student that has no social life at all. I do have my college friends, but I live with my parents without any friends near my house thus I am rarely involved with any social occasion. 

As a result, I spend my whole day alone in my home, where I pass time by internet surfing, watching TV, gaming etc  

I also feel that my isolation is causing memory loss, as I cannot remember what I did the previous day. I also feel that I lack common sense and cannot do easy tasks like shopping, trading without making silly error &amp; as result my parents worry about my future

It seems that lacking social contact &amp; not involving in soical situations has made me dumb in real life even though my academics is great. 

I almost never workout, my weight is about 57 kgs and height being 175 cm . Basically I am underweight for my age. Small stature also responsible for lack of confidence in social occasions ( basically college )

Often I feel that I can't contribute into logiacal arguments. Sometimes I feel that things don't even make any sense to me. 

I had just cried before I wrote this down. I really want to change circumstances around me, but I don't want to feel like I am loser &amp; let down my parents.

Please, help me out with this !"
lonely,ok,ok - talking to my friends or really anyone in general makes me want to sew my mouth shut. nobody cares for what i have to say and if i do say something it’s annoying. wish i could just disappear.
lonely,Hiding my feelings,"Hiding my feelings - Before i start complaining i wanna clear out that i don't feel extremely sad, i think my life is good, but sometimes i feel a bit empty and lonely.

I've been all my life telling all the people i know(family, people of my life) and also to all the people that had asked me that being lonely it's not a problem for me, that i don't care about not having who to talk with about the life, that i don't need who to do things with, but it's not totally true, i don't know exactly why i hide that i really want to meet people, i really want to have somebody close to me, etc.. :c and i don't know if it's too late to confess, or even if finally sharing that feelings now would change anything. 

That's not the only feeling i usually simply avoid to admit, but it's the one that i most hate to carry in silence.

I pass the days daydreaming about things that will never happen."

lonely,No job. Feel empty.,"No job. Feel empty. - I've gone a long time without any friends. I've been isolated for a while. (Fortunately not now.)
I've been forcing myself out the house every day for the past two years. In the process, my social skills have become unbelievably strong. I also earned some close friend. My sanity has been restored.
When i had no friends, every day felt like I was losing my mind. No where to go, no goals, no aspirations.
Thank God day and night that I have these few friends who i see every night at the gym.
My number one objective now is to HURRY UP and get a job. These friends of mine wont be around forever. They will eventually move on with their lives and i will end up alone In my room again. I cannot afford to lose this solid routine and social structure I've erected. I am NOT going back into isolation when I've managed to come SO far. The job is my only missing piece to having an amazingly meaningful life. Human beings a built for constant stimulation.
Remaining dormant for HOURS a day cannot be healthy for The mind. My anxiety kept me from applying for jobs. I worried I would get overwhelmed by the sudden introduction of responisilbility In My life and end up quitting. I do not care anymore. I WILL look and apply. Whatever temporary discomfort i may experience will be due to the fact that I have not worked in years. If i choose to remain idle, I know. What few friends I habe WILL leave and i will lose that structure and go nuts alone in my room. Im 26 years old."

lonely,a birthday wish to me,"a birthday wish to me - i was diagnosed with severe anxiety way back in May. it was July 29 when i was finally prescribed with antidepressants. my hoards were starting on August 1, i was away from college, social media from the first month of 2019. but nobody gave me a shit when i had not gone to college to collect my own examination entrance card. no one gave a shit. and i was on medication fro. July 29. that shit never mattered but it was some weird stuff going on July 30. i started singing Happy Birthday to me at about 7 pm. and i remember i had a crying tone, but i wasn't crying, i didn't shred a tear, but it was a crying tone, i lied on bed, kept singing Happy birthday to me.... happy birthday to me........ because it was my birthday that day, and i was on medication, medication for anxiety, and nobody, not even my parents wished me a happy birthday, that day it hurt somewhere inside.... I don't know why but that day i really craved for a birthday wish from literally anybody and none wished!!

I’m used to it though, I live with many disabling conditions that aren’t pretty but ear pain always just wipes me out, must be because it’s so close to the brain that playing it all “outta sight outta mind” is harder.

I’m sure relationships aren’t perfect and take hard work, but I see people spending time with their partners and getting support and companionship and I wonder what’s so wrong with me that no one’s ever expressed interest. I’ve expressed interest, I’ve probably asked more guys out than most women have seen in their lives and had a reputation as a weirdo in my town for asking out every guy. The answer is always no."

lonely,Living in my head.,"Living in my head. - I've been pretty lonely for the majority of my life, but this past last year it's really peaked. It started with just weight gain, but I was focused on my studies and living life generally ok. Now at this start of this year, it's gotten worse because I'm falling into a deep infatuation and delirium with celebrities and online influencers. I'm living inside my head with the alternative lifestyle I know in reality I wouldn't be happy with, for an example doing something related to media that would put me into the focus of my crushes, but really thinking about my daydreams I start to realize it's the group/friends ideal I want more than the romances. 

I do understand why my crushes are so intense, it's because I admire them for the life they've created themselves rather than ""love"". But just daydreaming about them just makes me feel happy, enough that I can't stop. It's frustrating and embarrassing, to the point where I ask myself daily why I am doing this pointless activity in my head? 

I'm seeking someone to talk to tomorrow, but I hope this will just stop over time."
lonely,I don’t know where to ask this,I don’t know where to ask this - Am I a bad person for having feelings for one of my closest  friends? I am known them for around two years now and I started to feel this way a few months ago. I am not sure what to make of it because it’s the first time I have felt this way. I know it’s my fault but it been really painful talking to them sometimes.  I mean in a way with someone like me  with no relationship experience has no chance and it better I just don’t tell them. I don’t want to leave/ghost them without saying anything because I know it’s wrong. But and that same time I feel like I should not bring it. I feel really bad because in a way I feel I betrayed their trust.  I don’t want our time to just be seen just me being nice to them because I am interested in them. It’s because I really do care about them as a friend and idk what to do honestly.
lonely,Help,"Help - I'm so very tired ever moment of every day no matter when I go to bed or when I wake up. I'm not motivated to do anything and all of my friends are drifting away. Only one of my hobbies really consistently interests me anymore but its not something I can do often. I feel empty and hopeless. I'm sick of everyone at my school and my head is turning into a dark place. I love music but recently nothing has sounded as good as it used to. I constantly feel like i'm going to puke. The pure thought of having to wake up tomorrow is stressful enough but the thought of having to get out of bed and actually go to school and deal with people terrifies me. I want it all to be over with, I want the headaches to go away."

lonely,Escape from loneliness,"Escape from loneliness - When one is lonely, then one may get so intimidated by one’s loneliness that one may not dare to come close to it. That one may not dare to probe deeply into it and go to the roots of it. And if one doesn’t go to the roots of feeling of his loneliness, he will feel that loneliness is a shallow phenomenon which can be treated with superficial ointments.

So one will say, “I am feeling lonely, let me call up someone.” And one will think that a little bit of electronic socialization will do the trick. Or one may say, “I keep feeling lonely, let me get married.” Or one will say, “Let me change cities, and move to another place where my community, or my friends live.” Or one may just say, “Let me switch on the television, or visit the shopping mall.”

This happens when one is afraid. This happens when one is not courageous enough to understand his own thoughts and feelings. And that requires no wizardry. That requires plain, old-fashioned courage.

“Yes, there is something that I am missing, but what is it? Am I really missing that T.V. show? Seriously!” But one behaves as if the T.V. show was the reason why you were feeling uneasy. So, he switches on the television. One behaves as if a walk around the park, or a new dress, or a bout of physical intimacy will help relieve the situation permanently. “I am feeling a little queasy. Alright, let’s have some sex.” That will put you to sleep, but then the same cycle will be repeated the next day. This is when loneliness is not understood. This is when mind is taken as something to be afraid of.

Then one tries short-cuts. Then one tries being a doctor unto himself and that is quackery. Ever seen those guys at some pharmacy who go there and try to prescribe themselves out of their ailments? They would stand there and ask the retailer, “Which drugs are in circulation these days?” And he would say, “This and this…” He would say, “Okay, fine. Alright, give me that one.” As if they are ordering food from the menu. And often, patients are less scared of the disease and more scared of knowing about the disease.

If you can go to the roots of your own loneliness, then you will not be duped into running after objects, then you will not be tempted to give yourself superficial treatments."
lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."
lonely,I feel at peace with ending my life and I feel happy for the first time in a while,"I feel at peace with ending my life and I feel happy for the first time in a while - This world is not worth living if you have no friends or people who care about you. The mundaneness of everyday life is made worth it by the experiences and connections you have with people who care about you. None of my friends reach out to me on their own and I know my family doesn’t give a flying fuck about me, haven’t contacted me in ages. I’m not mad at anyone, in these situations some people perceive someone having suicidal ideation as a fake spiteful attention seeking attack. I’m content now, my dog will do better off with a sibling of mine. Some people don’t belong here and it’s a harsh truth I’ve accepted. I think people who’ve met me will do just fine without me, and will even thrive. It’s like the classic line people always say- “get over it and move on”"

lonely,My Friend has depression,"My Friend has depression - Hey so its a long story i would like you all to be comfortable around and get ready for it.

So all of this started in October last year. I was  and i was coping with loneliness isolation and sadness and FOMO (I am in school) so recently me and my friends opened up and had a frank conversation with our German Teacher 30F on an excursion and we made her a friend of ours.
So when i was going through all this around the end of October... I reached out to her for help. Soon she was supposed to be going to Germany for a month on scholarship. So i reached out to her we talked and i shared all my thoughts my feelings of loneliness etc. We would call for one hour on daily basis.

It was November. Both of us are Scorpios even though we do not firmly believe in Horoscope because it is lame we did believe in saying how similar we are because our sun signs are same and we are a lot alike in behaviour and thinking etc. We continued talking daily and we would ask each other about our day, meal, etc virtually everything. Around the end of November when she was supposed to be back... She threatened me that she would rather settle there than coming back to India. And it was that moment i did all in my power to convince her to be back. It all happened at its own her words made me feel like losing a part of myself.

Now this is December none of us knew we would grow a bond so strong. We were like each others best friends there won't be a day when we wouldn't talk and share all the shit that went on bitch about colleagues and students we don't like. We were each others salvation. We promised to keep out our personal friendship from our professional relationship in school. But it didn't work out for long. But anyways it doesn't matter.

Now in January we went through a lots of ups and downs... We were in a tough spot were our mood swings were dependent on each other. Like we would be in a very pissed mood towards the world if we don't talk to each other and vent out our day.
It went on like that. Around mid January i found her to be ill. She didn't look like herself lately so i insisted her on getting tests done. She was reluctant but later she did and we found out she had multi vitamin deficiency and after a clinical test she was diagnosed with depression. I have always been supportive to her since and i didn't leave and always told her that i am there for her just like she was there for me without questions.

Now in February i have my Board Exams around the end of the month. So she wouldn't share her loneliness with me her sufferings with me she believes she would divert me from my exams and be a reason for me to not succeed. She's taking all her meds and still she isn't like feeling good. She's irritated by almost anything. I wrongfully asked her if she would want to distance me from her. She raged and told me that it is me and just me that she's talking to. She has been ignoring her family her childhood and other friends but she is only opening up to me.
Here i am trying my best to help her overcome this because she means someone to me and i cant imagine my life without her.

Lately i have been feeling a connection with her i just can't do anything in right mind without thinking about her. I feel like i like her but i dont know how i should work this out. I mean we publically flirted in class room once or twice. I just cant afford to lose her help me out. And also help me help her."

lonely,I miss the days when I was happy alone,"I miss the days when I was happy alone - A few years ago I was just so content being alone. Work, gym, hang with dog, repeat. Every waking moment was pretty much spent exercising/playing sports or hiking or taking my dog on rides. 

I had friends, like the guys I played sports with, or my co-workers. But I didn't hang out with anyone. Didn't want to. I liked the idea of getting a girlfriend, but I was basically aromantic and was fine with that being a fantasy. 

When my dog died, I realized how lonely I was, so I started making friends, going out, meeting girls. Fell in love with one, she broke my heart. And now I hate being alone. I need someone near me all the time. I practically beg my friends to hang out, I go meet people every night (despite my loner ways I've always been good with people, can start up conversations with random guys anywhere or charm girls at a bar or whatever). 

I'm with people almost all day long, but I feel so utterly alone. I go flirt with a girl at a bar, it's fun and exciting, but then I'm usually too drunk to make something if it. When I do spend time with girls I quickly lose interest. Sometimes I lose interest even when we are hooking up (super awkward). 

I guess I'm a Demisexual, and that sucks so bad. I just want to love someone, but I don't know how."

I know it’s not a family issue (I have a really supportive family) but when I am out and about I look at couples and people having a good time, it totally kills me inside. The feelings of jealousy, frustration and sadness is really hard to bear.

Does anyone know what I could do to rectify this? I try meditation which helps to a certain degree but I feel like there is this bullet hole in my heart.

Hi, Im Nolan, and this is my story, before I die. 
I am currently in Highschool and probably won’t make it till graduation. When I was younger, around 5, I liked trains and dinosaurs.  I liked pizza and watching movies, Playing in my backyard, petting my cat. I went to a catholic school, at first. I never had any friends, everyone always avoided me and treated me like shit. I was too young to notice. 

Then I was chosen to switch to another class, several weeks into grade 2, losing everything I was familiar with. It turned my world upside down and I expressed that I didn’t like it to teachers and my parents. My parents tried to get me back into my old class but the school refused. My grades then plummeted, which was unusual since no one ever gets bad marks in early grades, since it’s considered so easy. Having that little friends and no one who ever talked to me I became desensitized to others, having no contact with other kids. 

My grade 3 teacher was lazy and a terrible teacher, she told my parents I needed adhd meds. When i was on them my attention was worse and I would eat my clothing. I would get into to trouble and break other people’s things, not knowing what I was doing. Other kids would yell at me, telling me to shut up. I would sit by myself and collect rocks. Sometimes a kid named Ethan would talk to me, but only when he had no one else to talk to, and when it was convenient. I wasn’t old enough to see this, all I saw was someone who was interested in me for once. Older kids would bully me, I remember once they spit on a rock and handed it to me. I turned it over and saw the bubbly spit and threw it away. It hit a car and my parents and the older kids were charged 50/50. I found minecraft and started playing it, it was a way to escape my sad life. They took me off the meds after grade 3. 

In grade 4, I ended up with the teacher all the kids would complain about, saying she was terrible. I was also with completely new kids who I wasn’t familiar with, and Ethan was in another class. The principle knew most of the kids at the school, and knew I was with a grumpy teacher, and with no one i knew. She did nothing about this. My parents had had enough with the shitty school and terrible staff, so I was moved to a public school. So for grade 4 I changed to a public school, I never had any friends in grade 4 either. I did meet a kid who already had a friend group of 4 and they didn’t want me in it. At this point I was desperate, so I clung to them and followed them around, no matter how many times they told me to go away. I was teased all year, the friend group was bullied since I started being near them. I did that for all of grade 4, still receiving Cs and Ds. 

In grade 5, the friend group broke, 1 leaving, and I slipped in, and they tolerated me, too tired to try and get me to leave. I invited them to my birthday party in effort to get them to like me. 1 declined, saying he’d rather see it with his family, after getting the invitation with time and place on it. Then he came with his dad and literally spies on my party, both of them laughing at me and peeking around corners. (Yes I’m serious.) they even booked seats behind the party row, and talked to all the other people I invited, no one talking to the guy who invited them. I also met some batshit crazy girl, who said she liked me and wanted to have sex with me. I was wierded out, and she never kissed me or anything. I told my parents and she got in trouble, we never talked again. She moved on to making out with kindergarteners. 

From grades 4-5 I had decent teachers, but my grade 6 teacher was the worst. He was the kind of teacher to do team captains and let the unpopular kids be last. I was also targeted by a kid named Yousef. He would make fun of me having no friends and me eating by myself. He would shove me on the ground and elbow me in the back of the head. The teacher did nothing. The principal did nothing. Kids would tell me words I didn’t know, (cuz I was dumb and didn’t know shit) they’d tell me to point my middle finger up, and  tell people I was gonna rape, not knowing what any of that means. I would get in trouble for it, and the kids how told me to, wouldn’t. Eventually the friend group of 3 broke up, and I just followed around one of them, who would create imaginary worlds with me, he never really wanted me there, I was just someone to imagine things with, it didn’t matter who it was, but it made me happy all the same. We made imaginary stories, walking up and down the stone path in the school field, making ourselves Pokémon, or wizards, or people with superpowers. I saw him as a friend, he saw me as someone to get story ideas from. And that’s is what we did from grades 6-8. 

Grade 7, I realized I had to rise above others, there must be something about me that makes people avoid me and hate me. So I studied. I rose from Cs to Bs. I got bullied by a different person, named Hassan, he called my dad a dog, punched and shoved me, insulted me, and ultimately started my way into depression and suicidal thoughts. 

Grade 8 I rose from Bs to As, I sat by myself, after trying to get friends for so long I gave up. I talked to no one and just did my school work. The guy who would walk with me wanted to escape, even he was bored of me, but I would hassle him till he played more. I graduated elementary, and my depression got worse. I started thinking more serious suicide plans. I spent the summer missing when I was young and innocent. 

I started Highschool, grade 9, the guy I walked with had finally moved to the popular people, and was glad to be rid of me. I took music and sewing and cooking in hopes of meeting a girl. I ended up just liking the courses and everyone treating me the same. Avoiding me and not giving a shit, not wanting to have a conversation. I tried to see a psychiatrist but talking didn’t help. Neither do the meds. I rescued 5 duck eggs which were abandoned, and I eventually had to give them to a farm since it was illegal. This made me ever more depressed. 

Now in grade 10 I take more cooking, and music. I’m learning Guitar and Spanish. Still everyone hates me and doesn’t care less if I died. I have thoughts of shooting up the school, or murdering and raping people, as revenge for my terrible lonely life and the poor hand I was dealt. I plan on doing any of these things and then killing my self. Ironically, by train, what I loved so much as an infant will now set me free."

My dad is an abusive sack of shit and my mum is a narcististic snitch who tells everyone she knows about how lonely i am. Im completly useless at everything and i feel like everyone hates me bus sticks round because thry feel bad. I wake uo at night a lot and cry because i have to face the next day ahead of complete isolation. Ive only just recently realised how lonely i was until i looked around me and noticed nobody willingly talked to me and when they did it was a 1 sided conversation and they dont listen to me. I look around and see everybody laughing and having fun but im just there silent and alone. The only thing that brings me joy is music and netflix which my parentd are dragging me away from by forcing me to go to camps where the same thing happens. Nobody cares for me and i go weeks wothout any proper human contact, then my parents have the audasity to tell me that people care for me. Every breathing moment i just want to scream and break everything but i cant. I really just want a proper friend that likes me and i dint have ti fake myself for them to like me. I look  and see on my schools insta stories thst they were at parties with my entire year invited but im judt sitting alone at home. It takes its toll and i just want it to end."

Live on my own, have 1 ""friend"" (we only talk if I message first and he has told me he'd not notice for a while if I stopped) and my family life is pretty minimal, hardly in contact at all etc. I spend 9 days out of 10 completely alone (unless I've got work where I am a customer service assistant or cashier and that's hell when you are this lonely) I'm casual so I often go 3-4 days without shifts. 
So my existence is either being utterly alone, or spending my time putting on a happy and helpful mask, being dutiful in assisting strangers with product queries.  

And no, other employees don't want to be my friend, I've explored that but no such thing. They're mostly friends with each other though. 

Due to a broken upbringing, making friends is difficult with any such thing never lasting more than two years.

Add to the fact I was denied to a college for a 3rd time in 4 years and this one co worker made me feel so lowly. The combination of an emotional job experience, my cat (my best friend and one there to comfort me) died and not able to progress my future educationally had made me so alone.

Things were pretty flirty and signs were both there from us that there was mutual attraction both physically and personality/mentally. Saying she wishes i could come stay the night with her, go for a run with her, go out and do stuff with her. I was also saying same things back because ya know i really wanted to and was really starting to like her. Sounds great right??

Welll she ends up ghosting me Monday so i said alright I’ll wait to text her didn’t know if something came up so give it some time. I text her today “sooooo are we still on for this weekend?” 

Read but no reply, great 

Send another 30 minutes later saying “obviously that’s a no, but can you atleast be honest with me about why”

lonely,I am slowly losing my mind,"I am slowly losing my mind - Somewhat long post so TLDR at bottom.

New here, just sharing my experience. I may not have the longevity of loneliness that most of you had/have, but let’s just say these last few months have been *fun*. Here’s some background: Moved to a new state after graduation with GF last summer. She moved back home last fall, partly because she’s going back to Grad school and partly because she felt pretty isolated in this new area herself. I now live alone with my dog who I’m pretty sure is the reason I haven’t lost it yet. Now, from the outside looking in with just those facts, saying I’m lonely might seem pretty outlandish. I have a dog who makes life a little more bearable and I’m still dating GF in a LDR, talk to her on the phone once a day. Not bad right? Well maybe I’m not truly alone, but I feel there are some factors that are contributing to my perceived loneliness.

1. At my current role, my company employs around 60 people. Not everyone works in the same office, I.e. Most people work in the main branch while I go back and forth between there and the corporate office. The closest person to my age is 10 years older than me with kids, and most of the people I interact with daily (a majority of which takes place online) are middle-aged women. I usually go weeks talking to no one verbally but my supervisor, who is also a middle-aged woman. Not being able to relate to one person I was working with was a new experience when I first got here, hasn’t gotten much better. 

2. Location. Although my workplace is in a “relatively” populated area, a majority of the surrounding area is rural, with a lot of it being undeveloped. My GF and I made the mistake of signing for a place that is a ways outside of the closest city. Takes about 20 minutes to get to the nearest grocery store. The place is also a 40 min drive from my workplace. Closest relative is about 3 hours away and I’m somewhere around 6-7 hours from where I grew up. 

3. Coming home after work. While I had active hobbies in the summer with my GF here, my activity has become non-existent to the point where I actually would rather be at work than at home because nothing I do there makes me happy besides seeing my dog. The driving-distance factor tied in with the weather this winter have influenced my isolation most of the time. After spending almost 10 hours away from home during the day at work, it’s hard to justify leaving the house again for anything, especially if it’s gonna be at least a 40 min drive round trip. I’ve had days where I come home, spend the entirety of my time browsing reddit on my phone, skip dinner and just pass out at 8pm so the week will go by faster. 

4. This may not have to be explained for some people but because of the seclusive nature of my residence, I have no decent broadband providers in my area. I only get satellite, and with $60 payment each month, I get a data cap of 20gb, with an upload speed of less than half a mb/s. If you are familiar with gaming online, you would know this is less than optimal. If we’re being completely frank, this is just about the worse internet you can get. I used to play in parties online with friends but now most of time I’m excluded from playing because my WiFi literally can’t keep up. Keeping up with friends at home was pretty much done exclusively through playing and chatting with them online. And I know they are only a phone call away but it doesn’t feel the same if you know what I mean. This situation also makes streaming anything a challenge (Netflix, YouTube, Hulu), and streaming anything that’s LIVE impossible. 

5. Meeting new people. I feel a lot of my problems might be solved with this and I know that this one is majorly my fault, mostly because while my situation’s not ideal, the effort I’ve been putting forth hasn’t been something to marvel at either. With that being said though, and this may sound crazy but, I’m hard-pressed to find anyone in their 20s living in my area. This place is weird, in the sense that there’s a noticeable age gap within the area’s demographic. You have kids 18 and below but the age group between 18-30 might as well not exist. Seems like the tradition here is to move away as soon as you graduate HS and move back when you want to settle down and have some kids. I don’t meet anyone but these people when I do the recreational activities I enjoy either (biking, hiking, fishing, camping). Always the same. This is corroborated by the fact that night life in town is also pretty non-existent, meaning the only two bars in town, that either aren’t restaurants or stay open past 10:30, are a great place to meet retirees drinking flat domestics on a Friday night. Gets a little depressing seeing the same picture after going for the third or fourth time. 

I know this is laughable in comparison to some of your stories but I genuinely haven’t been this isolated in my life. Shit’s hitting hard mentally. It’s funny, but I talk to my dog more than anyone else, and I can’t decide if it keeps me sane or just ramps up the already growing levels of craziness. 


TLDR: Moved to new state with GF, GF moved out later, rural area, job feels isolated, long drive from home to town, no internet, hard to meet people my age."

I'm so boring and useless that I have no one.

I prefer to talk to females and I don't think I'm a fuckboy or like I come onto them or make then uncomfortable. It's just that girls know they can find unlimited people to talk to on here and I'm the most useless and boring person here. I easily feel like I'm the most lonely person in this subreddit and nothing is ever gonna change. The world would be better without me and this subreddit proves that. I'm sorry for being sexist in this post, I didnt mean to sound like such a chauvinist but I think it's at least somewhat true. No one will care about this post so I'm taking it down in a little bit. It's just that this subreddit describes exactly how I feel and yet everyone who meets me leaves as if they'd rather be alone than have me around. Rant over. I know how useless I am and anyone giving me fake words of encouragement, know it means nothing to me. Bitch at me if you want, you don't know me. I've tried things.

Some of my friends are in relationships and this week another friend got in a relationship and now hes ignoring me and those people are forming their own group together without the rest of us. Not only does it hurt not being good enough for anyone romantically, but now I'm being ignored for something I cant control. They look so lovely - a group of friends all with lovers, happy and living their best lives together. I saw them from afar and feel like I'm missing out on so much but it's out of my control that I'm single. It's so easy for them to find love and impossible for me.

lonely,Insanely lonely after family bereavement,"Insanely lonely after family bereavement - Hi all,

I'm at a bit of a loss and I don't really know where to turn apart from the trusted internet. So, 6 years ago (6 years ago yesterday in fact) my sister took her own life. It's been a pretty miserable and torrid time. I have ups and downs, but a lot of it has been downs.

One thing I have noticed is that I have become lonelier as time goes on. I think this is down to the fact that as time has gone on, I know less people who knew my sister and I feel like I'm losing that connection. Despite feeling insanely lonely, I push people away all the time that I am somewhat close to, and I don't feel like I can connect with other people. It's a dumb cycle that I can't seem to break. I also feel like I'm losing connection with my family, in particular my parents.

A bit of my recent past, if anyone can be bothered to keep on reading. I had been with someone for nearly 2 years but I broke up with her back in September and at the time, I thought it was a good idea and what I wanted. Now I realise that it was probably a mistake. I then moved somewhere new for work and I didn't know anyone here. The only people I hang out are with my colleagues who are nice enough, but they're just colleagues. I then started seeing someone else but it turned out they were absolutely mental and got black out drunk one day and started physically and verbally abusing me, which resulted in me calling the police on her.

As I mentioned above, it was the anniversary of my sisters death yesterday and I just feel so isolated. I don't want to talk to anyone I have any kind of connection with because I immediately feel like a burden on that person and honestly, I don't feel like they particularly care. I have started seeing yet another therapist and I just hope that it might help me a bit. I've got my next session on Friday and hopefully I'll soon begin to get somewhere with them.

If anyone has gone through this and felt anything remotely similar, any advice would be amazing. And I apologise if my post is a little all over the place. My mind seems to jump a lot at the moment and my train of thought is always going from one thing to another.

Thanks y'all"
lonely,Anyone else feel this way?,"Anyone else feel this way? - When I tell people that I feel as though no one cares and then they're like ""I care!"", or try to prove to me that they care, I feel like it's fake and they are only doing it for themselves. Like, where was this before? Why all of a sudden does it matter to you if I think you care? I feel bad for thinking/feeling this way. Like I'm in validating what they are trying to do, but I can't help it. It just doesn't feel genuine and that they are doing it for themselves out of pride. Like, ""I'm a good person and I care about everyone, and I'll prove it to you."" This gives me a lot turmoil and I'm hoping I'm not the only one."
lonely,I'm losing my mind.,"I'm losing my mind. - Nothing changes. Wake up, go to school, stay after, go home, eat, do hw, shower, sleep. I don't have much time for hobbies nor the money to buy stuff. My parents aren't the richest individuals alive and they don't like each other. The only reason they're together is because my mother doesn't have enough money to get out. In 2 months my mother and 2 brothers will move and see how that goes. My father barley makes any cash and sometimes leaves the weekends to either go to another chick he is seeing or other shit. Not that I blame him. Should I? He still cares and buy stuff for me and my brothers but. 


People always say ""It'll get better."" ""Just wait your time will come."" ""Hang in there."" I've been hella patient and everything is the same.


I'm struggling in school mostly due to missing so many classes which is my fault but my nagging mother won't stop pestering me about shcool. School this and school that. Like stfu for once. My brothers love to get on my nerves too. 

Even when I try to help my mother with house work and other stuff or help myself at school everyting goes awry.

I see all of these privileged teens how they have their own room, parents together, and have life pretty good. While here I am rotting. I get it. Focus on yourself. Yeah kinda hard when each and every day your reminded how pathetic your life is.

I'm starting to slip out of reality from time to time and have hatred towards everyone I see. But how the hell can I make friends with all this anger? I feel like they pity me.

Whatever. It's not like it matters. Not like anything matters. It's all a joke."

Just someone who's yours."
lonely,"a different kind of lonely, i am","a different kind of lonely, i am - this is mostly just a rant and i don’t have anywhere else to put it but this seems like the most appropriate place. 
i have a great community of people around me. i have an awesome family, the BEST best friend, and my SO is amazing. &amp; i love every one of them dearly, and i think they all love me. i almost never have no one to turn to when i need help - and i’m truly fortunate for that. 

my kind of lonely is a new one - for me, at least. i’m not physically lonely, or emotionally lonely. in fact, those cups are overflowing. even in my worst moments, i feel love/loved. but my mental connection is where i feel... kind of empty. 

i have interests and hobbies and thoughts that i just have to keep in. the people around me - as supportive as they are - just don’t share these things with me. and when i try to talk about it, i get that blank stare like “i’m here to listen but i’m not interested and i don’t understand.” it’s frustrating, but don’t get me wrong - i know i cant fault them for not sharing my interests. 

it’s just lonely for me to not be able to talk about things like my spirituality with people like my best friend, whom i talk to about almost everything. i can’t talk about my yoga or meditation practices, or the things i learn from it. i can’t talk about the energy we are all made of, or my sense of spirit. i can’t talk about what connects us all as living beings. 

at least, i can’t talk about it without getting that blank look. or the shallow, one-dimension responses like “yeah? wow that’s cool!” i cant share a REAL conversation - much less share my practice! - about any of this, i cant explore my ideas and thoughts with the people i usually go to. 

it’s lonely to me because my sense of spirit, my sense of self, my sense of energy and connection, that’s all very important to me. it’s something i take seriously. it feels like being the one and only die-hard fan of a sports team lol i know that’s a weird simile to make but that’s how it feels. i am MADE of my energy but to not be able to REALLY express that and how that feels and what it teaches me? to not be able to bounce ideas off someone who shares the same thought process? it’s just a little lonely, that’s all. 

what’s extra lonely is that my community of people probably don’t even realize how important it is to me. they probably have no idea that i am disconnecting myself from the body i’m in and reconnecting myself with the energy i am made of. and if they knew that about me, they would be supportive but not care. they wouldn’t share in the experience with me and that’s really sad. idk i’m just rambling now but idk i just want it out of my head before i go on a road trip with my best friend, and i pretend not to be meditating and visualizing my spirit and calling on my energies. 
i just wanted to get it out before i have to go pretend to be a 1-dimensional human again."

lonely,"With each morning, I die a little.","With each morning, I die a little. - Hello, I didn't want the title to be this but it kinda suited.

I don't know where to start, I had this falling out with a friend Febuary last year. Can remember the last time I was happy, It was when I was in her arms, I remember the warmness and the security. And I remember fighting over silly things. And then me clinging over everything single thing and us falling out. Since, then I always think of her, and I'm reminded of everything...every emotion I felt being with her from start to end, to a point where I forget where I am and what am I doing.

It has been 6 month since I have not contacted her, in hopes that I'll move on eventually. But every 3rd day I feel stuck, like and intrusion of mind whenever I face any challenges in my life, small or big. I experience this feeling like someone poured acid on my brain, and I start remembering how things went with her.

I can't help but feel that my life is deteriorating and my social life, behavior and etiquette are getting bad with each day. My speeches are incoherent. And I feel my nerves everytime I try to engage conversation with women.

I went on to fall out with 2 more friends after that, one of them strictly mentioned my behavior as bad, and I feel like there is no one who would love to hear my voice someday.

Eventually I kind of get okay with it. So that my brother with whom I live doesn't notice. I'm constantly challenging my belief system, I'm questioning everything and ending up just dull and sad. Yet something in my just lifts up and says, go on."

I'm sick of all the people telling me they know what I should do to earn more money, be happier, healthier bla bla bla. You don't know s***.

Sex is nice but sex with someone you have feelings for (or could potentially) when they just see you as a friend or a tool to get hard/wet with, is a painful feeling. That’s why it’s hard for me to do shit like that again. You feel lonely.

So don’t mistake being intimate with people (even if you can regularly) as a solution to your loneliness.

Before my last former friend removed me from their life they told me I am not worth the trouble. It is something I think about everyday. No matter how I try or what I do it ends the same. Still, I am trying to construct any semblance of a social life. Maybe I just want to delude myself into thinking someone would want to hear from me when they wake up in the morning. I have near zero confidence in meeting people online but I have some sick compulsion inside of me to try anyway.

I’m not really a people person, I work at night, and am kind of busy, so it is difficult. I want to talk with someone and make something of it, but I fall apart when trying to compose sincere messages. I just can’t do it.

To save myself from reliving the whole story, basically, I fell for someone that is absolutely toxic for me. And I mean toxic in a way that they don’t care, not just about me, but about anything. We were great in the beginning and they had feelings. But certain events led to changes that should have stopped me from being involved. They’ve hurt me so many times, and so brutally. They don’t care. 

Why do I care way too much?

Why have I drained my heart of everything I have into this person? Why can’t I save myself? 

I do this every time, too. But this time has been especially messy. 

I’m so tired. I can’t eat. I can’t sleep. All I do is obsessively check Snapchat, waiting for their reply. And tonight, I’m pretty sure they’re with someone else. In their bed. I’ve been dry heaving and crying and shaking. I’m literally sick over it. 

I feel so alone. All my friends have happy relationships. They’re here for me, but not completely. They’re so deeply involved in their own lives and boyfriends and I’m a burden right now.

She practically took me in because she felt so much love for me. Left me. She told me she was pretending for the last months of our relationship. “Weren’t you?”. No.     Have 0 friends online and irl. I overdosed a few months ago. It was bad. Last Friday, I realized I felt so lonely and memories of my relationship and everyone just constantly being against me makes me put a Ruger to my head. I think about it. I’m 18. My entire life has just been an enormous struggle. I’m so tired of it and i’m so young. If I’m good enough of a shot I can hit my brainstem so I die for sure. Imagine wanting to blow your head off then you miss? lol. I’m smart enough to not actually pull the trigger because no matter how shit it is, it must get better eventually right? Right? That’s what I tell myself and I put the gun down. Doesn’t help that everywhere I post has no replies. barely any upvotes. What the fuck is wrong with me? I talk to myself constantly. I’m my own best friend at this point. I’m going to be alone. It haunts me. I hear voices and convulse randomly since I’ve overdosed. When I get anxiety. Which is all the time because I just sit here and do fucking nothing while everyone is having the best time of their lives. People I occasionally talk to don’t actually look at me as close at all and they don’t give a shit about me."

I'm 16, i personally feel like I have 0 friends although I probably have at least 4. I never leave the house unless I'm forced to. I kinda dropped out of online school because I fucking hate it and they wont let me back into normal school. I just feel so alone right now, my parents are absolute dickheads and we just got into another fight (basically daily) because my mom is a crybaby boomer and my dad is an asshole boomer, they're not even boomer aged either. I'm mentally fucked because of my depression and anxiety (that my parents think are fake)and I have a hard time making or keeping friends because I cant regulate my emotions and I get annoyed and wanna be alone and maybe if I hurt you first you cant hurt me ya know? I'm working on myself best I can right now though.
I spend a LOT of time playing video games or crafting dumb stuff/hanging with my animals and plants. I have mostly succulents and 1 cacti. I'd like to learn a new language and learn how to skateboard.

Idk I'm just looking for people my age to talk to, like 16/17-20, I wanna find someone I can vibe with because I will NEVER have my childhood back and I just wanna be a delinquent with someone :(

Why can’t he just be there for me?  It hurts so much falling for someone who I don’t feel holds me in the same regard. It’s always about how things affect and annoy him and make him mad. Why don’t my feelings matter?
lonely,I’ve honestly almost accepted it.,"I’ve honestly almost accepted it. - My social anxiety makes it pretty much impossible for me to form anything beyond a surface-level relationship with anybody. It’s depressing but honestly at this point I’ve pretty much accepted I will never get a boyfriend, and never have any true, great friendships. I guess I’ll just have to live for something else, which sucks because I’ve always wanted human relationships for my whole life up to this point. Maybe I was made to be alone. Does anyone else feel the same way?"
lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."
lonely,Empty,"Empty - Fuck this feeling. I’m sick and tired of wanting to share moments with someone. Not even romantically — it would be so nice to just have someone to talk about things with. I look around and people are either conversing with each other or furiously on the phone texting or calling. I don’t even have anyone to text or call. 

Solitude is great until loneliness takes over. I try so hard to be happy with being alone. And I am. But holy fuck... can I just have some meaningful interactions?"

Being lonely feels like I am holding my breath, and I am so exhausted. I am so exhausted of being rejected over and over again. I feel trapped, and I am getting claustrophobic. It's weird because I feel everything, and yet at the same time I feel nothing. 

Dammit I just need human interaction."
lonely,1 experience changed my whole perception on wanting to be lonely,"1 experience changed my whole perception on wanting to be lonely - I'm the quiet, introverted guy in the family. I've lived alone for the past 6 years and everyone knows that I've always preferred to be ""alone"" and keep to myself. But I feel like that has recently been changed, and it's eating me up, making me feel sad and depressed.   


My family and relatives decided to go overseas together for a family member wedding, I thought I'd go along but wouldn't like it (because i'm introverted), but I actually had the time of my life. I met with family and distant relatives that I hadn't seen in 8+ years, we travelled and bonded, gossiped and had an overall fantastic 2 weeks together.   


Now that I'm back home, I feel so fucking lonely. I hate it. I'm soo far away from my family and relatives. I look through the pictures of the vacation on my phone and it makes me tear up. They're active social media users and constantly posting, and I want to adapt to that type of personality (I've never been much of a social media person). They're all together and I'm here all alone, missing out on everything. It's been 5 days since I've gotten back and I'm legit contemplating on moving to their city.   


It's crazy how just 1 short experience was able to completely change my mindset - am I just being dramatic? Am I just looking at the positive points?

I have no end goal in my life at all. It's not like I'm going to kill myself or anything, but if I died It would be a lot easier on everyone. I want a good loyal group of friends, but that seems impossible at this point. I'm going to try to go out this weekend but I'll probably just rot away at home, like I always do.

I know I can’t blame her forever, but I don’t know how to move on or fill the void she left me with. I never experienced a mothers love of a mothers touch, and it’s all I want."
lonely,I don’t know anymore,I don’t know anymore - Do you ever feel like all of your days just blend together? I know that sound weird but it’s like every thing just stays the same all the time. And some days you can’t even remember the last time something actually happened in your life. And when something does you can’t remember when it happened. I just feel like I’m moving but not. Like my life is flashing before my eyes and I can’t interact with it. My life is moving so fast but also so slow at the same time. Does anyone else ever feel like this or is it just me? Because at this point I just feel like I’m going absolutely crazy but I can’t do anything about it.
lonely,It Never Works Out,"It Never Works Out - I have always been too afraid to say anything about it in public or to reach out and get help from any sort of service. But I can't hold it in anymore. All my life I have been excluded, or have been made to felt that way at least. It's a sinking feeling in your chest and in your heart when you realize that no one really wants you there, they're just tolerating you because they have to. I have realized that my task now is not to change my situation, but to change myself to fit the situation that I am in. I believe as nihilistic as it may sound that there are those of us who are meant to be loved, admired and romantically fulfilled and those of us who are not. 

We all grew up on Disney, which taught us that everyone has a happily ever after. That was the most destructive philosophy that could have ever been fed to children in their most important formative years. Not everyone finds ""the one"", not everyone gets the friends and not everyone gets the camaraderie. It has been a difficult process trying to come to terms with it, but I have to...Because no matter how hard I try, how much care, love or kindness that I show, it never works out."

lonely,"Hi all, I'd like to share some hope.","Hi all, I'd like to share some hope. - Hello!

I had a baaad bout of anxiety recently, brought on mainly by loneliness. I know the underlying reasons I'm alone, and it's rough to face those issues.
But in general I do.

One way I combat the loneliness in my private life is sharing in my public life. I try to grow smiles in others.
Those smiles helped me get out of my recent rut.

One way I interact with others is by sharing my photography. I'm no pro, but I enjoy it and I like the challenge of getting a better shot. I travel in a limited way for it, which makes me look ahead, and plan for the future.

Having stuff to look forward to can help you grow hope. And that can diminish your loneliness. 

Sadly I can't share pictures on here, but my insta is spudfish83 if you'd like to see.

lonely,"Pretty lonely person, can't find that one person. Just gonna talk about things since bored","Pretty lonely person, can't find that one person. Just gonna talk about things since bored - For the past months I haven't been able to find friends online and that's probably the most comfortable social interaction for me. 
My social life is online and that makes me realize that I've been always lonely, I've previously found a place, a community which I felt I was something.
That died and I've been going down hill and losing friends due to myself having to lose social skills and stuff.
I have never met someone new that I felt that was okay for me to talk to and didn't mind or isn't honest.

Pretty funny story, pretty funny that I am lonely inside.
Nobody would wanna befriend or continue being friends with someone who is lonely and us terrible at conversations.

lonely,I feel like I’m missing out on life.,"I feel like I’m missing out on life. - I’m only 19 and I feel like I have no life. All my friends are at college having fun and going to parties and getting into relationships and just having normal experiences. And I’m here on a completely different wavelength. 

I’m in the military so my schedule is totally different from theirs. None of my friends can relate to me anymore and a lot of them have just stopped talking to me. I live in a shitty barracks because I’m injured and in a holding platoon and it’s really depressing. I have a wonderful boyfriend but our relationship is unconventional because of my job so none of my friends who still talk to me get it when I have problems or need to vent. 

I can’t do normal stuff that people my age do because of the career I’ve chosen. I wouldn’t change it because I owe this to my country but I’m so sad all the time. I don’t feel like myself anymore. I’m missing out on important milestones in my partners life. I don’t see my family. I’m just missing out on everything I love and care about. It hurts. I’m lonely."
lonely,Anyone else just crave affection?,"Anyone else just crave affection? - I’m 21M, and I swear I just feel lonely and depressed 24/7. It’s absolute ass. I never really open up to many people, let alone women, and whenever I do open up to a girl that I’m attracted to and I feel like they might reciprocate feelings, I just get rejected. I knew this girl that I’m working with was having a bad week, so I brought her in flowers on Valentine’s Day to surprise her and I made her week, but she said she had a thing against dating coworkers and that she wanted to just remain friends. And now I have to work with her every day and put on a fake smile, knowing that she doesn’t feel the same way. It’s a punch in the gut to say the least. All I want is someone to be affectionate towards, and not even sexually, just someone to motivate and encourage, because I know how shitty it feels to be down in the dumps and I don’t want anyone else to feel that way. Literally all I wanna do is just lay in bed all day and do nothing. All my friends are in college and I just don’t want to be a burden to anyone, so I close myself off from everyone. I’ve thought about going to a therapist/counselor but I just don’t even know if it’s worth it. I don’t feel like spending the energy to try and find the right one for me.

Life is excruciatingly lonely and it’s been like this even before I’ve had the overnight job. I’d like to think having a girlfriend would solve this, but no. I’m afraid at this point, because my life is so fantastically uninteresting, that it’s pointless even getting my hopes up about being with someone without them finding my completely boring. This logical thinking then puts me in a depression and I distance myself from everybody at work because I’m so self-aware of my cripplingly boring lifestyle.

lonely,I'm losing hope that I will ever fix my life.,"I'm losing hope that I will ever fix my life. - I dropped out of high school after a couple of suicide attempts when I was 17. I spent the next 7 years of my life not doing anything. No job, no school, no friends. I also gained a lot of weight over that period of time. I was miserable. Three years ago I started attending community college, at first part time and then full time. After this semester is over I'll have earned my associate's degree, and after that I'll be transferring to a university. Going to school has been great in many ways. Shockingly, I've done fairly well in school. I have a 4.0 GPA. I no longer feel that I'll never be able to have a career. I don't hate myself the way I used to when I was doing nothing with my life. When I feel useless I can at least tell myself that I can't possibly be a total idiot. 

The trouble is, I'm just as lonely as I ever was. I've never been in a romantic relationship, and I think I probably never will. I don't have any friends either. It actually bothers me more now than it did when I was a shut in. At least then I had the excuse of not being around people. Now I'm around people at school all the time, and I still haven't made any friends or formed any relationships. 

I've made some casual acquaintances in classes, but I've never kept up with those people after those classes ended. The closest I ever got was a woman I met in sociology. We met up outside of class a couple of times, ostensibly to work on a paper but we mostly just talked about other things. This was more social interaction than I had experienced in a very long time. I ran into a weird side effect of being an older student at a community college: most people I meet that are my age or anywhere close to my age are married. She was married, and I kind of had feelings for her, so I told myself that it wouldn't be right to try to get closer to her. Now I think that was probably just a way for me to avoid the scary prospect of actually being friends with someone. I don't know. In any case, that's the best I was able to do.

When I was a teenager, I used to think I would never be a functioning adult with a job. Since starting school again, I can see a way out of that given that I'm making real, measurable progress. On the other hand, I've gotten more hopeless about relationships over time. Trying to be a functional adult is taking everything I have. I'm making progress, but I don't have any energy left for trying to be the sort of person who could ever be in a romantic relationship. I don't want to spend another decade alone, but I can't see a way to change that."

be on the watch.

there are ways out.

there is light somewhere.

it beats the darkness.

be on the watch

you are marvelous

the gods wait to delight

lonely,I give up.,"I give up. - I have no friends. I sit alone at school every day in an area with the least amount of people. 

My social anxiety makes it impossible to start a conversation with with anyone irl and ,even if I did I have the courage to do it, I just wouldn't know what to say. 

Same goes for trying to meeting people online; I don't know what to say in a conversation after 'hello'. Because of this, I always come off as boring and in uninteresting. And then they ghost me, and I understand why.

I don't just don't know what to do anymore. I'll probably get a bunch of comments telling me to get out of my comfort zone but honestly I've tried that. It doesn't work. No matter how long you endure it, the anxiety never goes away. That's the difference between social anxiety and shyness. I feel a lot better when I just stop trying and live my life on my own. But then I have I have to deal with the loneliness and depression that comes with that. It's a loose, loose scenario."
lonely,Never have I ever wanted something so badly yet at the same time.... Didn't want it at all.,"Never have I ever wanted something so badly yet at the same time.... Didn't want it at all. - 17 years old. Haven't cried for years. Feeling like now is the time. It's currently midnight and my room is dark and I'm laying on my bed with only my pc monitor slightly emitting light into the room.

Thinking how much I want a female friend since the ones I had betrayed me.

Not in terms of love or anything. But as friends. Known them for years. Yet... Still betrayed me.

Guess I just yearn for the feeling of being able to talk to a female that I consider a friend. My guy friends are my bro's forever yes, but I think... I think I want something else.

Afraid.

Afraid of being betrayed again. Don't want love. Yet... I do. But I also doubt I'm enough. So in the end... I guess I'm just.....

lonely,Loneliness is man's worst enemy,"Loneliness is man's worst enemy - It can come unexpectedly, and can't be prevented. It doesn't care about your best friends, your family, your intelligence, your job or your relationships. It always can strike and it always has victims. It can stay 1 day or 1 year and does not have a general cure. Loneliness leads to additions, very bad addictions. If not treated, it is lethal through depression and anxiety.

Go out, find friends, do what you like and love your life. The loneliness, depression and the anxiety are around the corner, but you always need to be the one with the bat in hands who strikes first. Face them with faith and remember they are powerless in face of a happy person."
lonely,Lost my confidence,"Lost my confidence - I've completely lost my confidence due to anxiety ruining my life and my relationship with my family.

lonely,Those guys who look bored while shopping with their girl make me angry.,"Those guys who look bored while shopping with their girl make me angry. - Okay yes I know it can get hot, boring, and long.

And if she’s being a silly spender and ignoring priories I get it.

But if your girls wants your opinion on what’s sexy, or cute, you better tell them with enthusiasm!

Imagine having a girl ask how she looks. I’d pass out.

If I ever have a relationship I’ll be so ready to do some clothing shopping. From cute to lingerie stores you better believe I’d eat that up.

Sneak into a dressing room for a tease? Yes please!

Have her tell you to wait outside of a lingerie store while she picks something out and comes out with a wink. Mind blown.

Buying sexy heels? You better be bringing her your suggestions.

It’s an opportunity like no other to have someone want to look good for you.

And if it’s clothing for you and you’re comfortable with what’s she chooses then just know she wants you to look hot so she can be proud and happy to see you."

than to love 

and be loved

lonely,I'm battling my way through lifes harsh times. I would love to make some genuine friends.,I'm battling my way through lifes harsh times. I would love to make some genuine friends. -  I'm a 31 year old male. I am going through a divorce. I have 2 young daughters that she will be getting custody for and it's tearing me up inside. We have been trying to repair our relationship for the last 4 months. The more I do the more I realize I am wasting my time and energy fighting for something that can't be. Realizing this I need some good people to talk to. I don't have many friends irl and family seems to be hard to connect with. I'm a positive and loving person. It would be nice to find someone on the same level. I'm also a pretty artsy guy and a hard worker. I'm in construction but I am looking for better opportunities. I'm open to almost any age of person to talk to. I'd like to talk to a woman who can help me bare through this tough time. I have big shoulders and I definitely want to share them with someone that also wants to vent about lifes issues. I've been in a dark place for a long time and I'm ready to come to the light  🖤💛

lonely,Not a goddamn person is going to gove a damn about me except for myself,"Not a goddamn person is going to gove a damn about me except for myself - No one, not my parents, not my brother, not any of my friends would really give a damn about me.

All I have is myself. 

My family is my biggest curse. They will do nothing to help. It isn't that surpilrising seing as they never really did anything to help.

I blame my parents for being the initial cause if fucking my life up. Sure, those other than my family have added salt to the wound. But these fucks I call my family have been the ones to start it all.

For the past 5 years I have seen everything I worked for just fall to pieces. And yet I am unable to do anything about it.

I never liked my family. If given a choice I would have never chosen any one of them."
lonely,Do pets help?,"Do pets help? - For those of you who suffer from loneliness--does having a pet help you?  The way I see it, the advantage of a pet is that it gives UNconditional love, something a human is Not capable of.  NO human is.  Even a best friend can walk out on you.  
So just wondering--how would you compare a pet and a human being?"

It’s asleep now, but when I’m in school and people are being ridiculous it starts to get angry... but what really wakes it up is when I see someone I like, knowing that I’ll never have anything to do with them, or people enjoying time with their friends, taking them for granted, that what makes it roar, trying to break free. It has not yet succeeded, but everyday I feel more and more rage building up, ready to erupt, bursting free of its cage and taking control"

lonely,the one person i could call my friend just cancelled on me for my birthday,"the one person i could call my friend just cancelled on me for my birthday - Its my birthday on the 4th of march but im away at college so i wont be back home until the 6th of march. i asked the one person that i thought would say yes to come over and watch everybodys everything (Lil peep documentary coming out on netflix on my birthday)

He said he would come last week, but hes just said now he cant because its one of his mates birthday party the day after. (lousy excuse if you ask me)

i just want someone to spend the day with. one day is all i ask for. 

im gonna sit in my room, drop some acid, get drunk and pass out. no one cares"
lonely,I feel like i'm going to die alone,"I feel like i'm going to die alone - I always find a way to mess things up, and it's always early on. I messed things up again last night, and I fear that whatever was there might be over, now.

It's frustrating. Everyone else just finds someone and stays happy for a while, then stops, then finds someone new and stays happy for another long while. With me, it feels like trial and error. Just a little further each time, never for long, and it's becoming so incredibly grating and feels hopeless. 

I just wish I was normal."

 I don’t know when it went sour, but I can’t come to grips with the reality. It’s like knowing that you’re losing your best friend. I’m fully aware of what’s happening- I’m watching it crumble, and I am alone in this... and have no one to speak to about it."

lonely,I’ve learned that loneliness and being alone are two different things.,"I’ve learned that loneliness and being alone are two different things. - I’ve been lonely many times before. Each time, I’d wish to not be alone anymore. But now, I’m married and I’m still very, very lonely. I work from home, so I already lead an isolated lifestyle. But as I get older, I’m starting to realize that I’ve set myself up for complete loneliness. My husband is a social butterfly. I’m an introvert. He says I’m welcome to join him when he goes out with his friends. But because they’re his friends, I feel in my heart he’s just playing lip service and I’m not really welcome to join. Every single night I sit at home, sometimes he’s in another room, sometimes he’s not there at all. My best friend, my cat, passed away last month, and I’m free falling into depression without feeling like someone is by my side and on my team. I wish I had someone to talk to."
lonely,I seriously need a girl companion.,"I seriously need a girl companion. - No matter what I buy, no matter how many grades I have, I still feel like I am somewhat empty. I see many friends and online people having fun with their girlfriend. I don't need a girlfriend, just someone to talk to. If someone is free, no matter the gender, hit me up with a dm. I can talk about a lot of things."

lonely,Another birthday wasted,"Another birthday wasted - My birthday is tomorrow (I'll be turning 20) and I feel obligated to spend the day with my dad because my sister told me that he bought me a new phone (so I can't just ignore him if I want to get the gift). I know that without the context it seems that I'm a terrible person and a greedy asshole, but please trust me when I say that I got my reasons to hate him and just see him when I feel obligated to. So, here I go to another day of listening to him rambling about how my mother is a horrible person, questioning my career choices and trying to manipulate me against my mom and sister. 

I'm really sorry if this post triggered someone that wanted his father back on your birthday's more than anything on the word, but I just needed to get this feeling of my chest and don't have anyone to talk to. 

Thanks for reading"
lonely,"Maybe it's loneliness, maybe i'm just hungry","Maybe it's loneliness, maybe i'm just hungry - At my mid 20's, I finally came to the conclusion that i'll probably never have a true friend. Those I had loved to say we were close friends when they needed me. They would vent or whine for hours and i'd have to be there. But whenever I would tell them about my problems, all i'd get in return were answers like ""Hah. Happens."". So I've decided to cut contact with them completely and move on. I'm not a social person, I don't go out a lot so there's no way i'd meet new people. I can't seem to really bond with anyone. I thought friendship was like a shield, but most people don't really care unless they're bored or depressed. 

Guess it's alright. After all, my friends and I didn't have much in common, and now I won't have to share my bucket of pop corn nor help anyone hide a corpse."
lonely,I ended a toxic relationship a couple of days ago. Every day that passes makes me feel worse.,"I ended a toxic relationship a couple of days ago. Every day that passes makes me feel worse. - I felt great right after I broke up with my ex. But now, lying in bed, I miss him. I’m not forgetting the bad things he’s done, but I miss the good. I miss his love and the fun we had. I missed my alone time when I was with him, and now I miss having him beside me. I have never spent a long period of time being single, and it’s taking everything I have to not download Tinder right now. I wish things could have been better in my relationship. I wish it could have worked out, but we tried and failed, and I couldn’t take it anymore. Why can’t I keep the same strong independent mindset I had when I was breaking up with him? Why did these feelings come so quickly?"
lonely,I’m lonely and I want a girlfriend!!,"I’m lonely and I want a girlfriend!! - Im so lonely 35M Ohio. Like, not to the point where Im depressed I just want someone to share my romantic feelings with. I mean sure I could kinda share those feelings with friends jokingly but I wanna hold hands with someone and get kisses on the cheek and hold a cute girl and feel safe and loved (not in the way my family loves me of course) And, I really want to have sex, I want to be intimate with someone. Like I just daydream about it all the time its crazy.  like being held close and going really slow. SO LONELY"
lonely,Being as realistic as possible.,"Being as realistic as possible. - So, I've just left high school (finally), and I know for a fact I'm not a lonely person, I've got friends I talk to regularly, but naturally, as uni and apprenticeships begin, there's nights where I just stare at a screen, and stuck with myself, my head starts thinking myself to be really isolated. It feels like my friends are all doing things with themselves and I'm just kinda working at a gas station during the day and coming home at night and staring at a screen. The best way I can describe it is dying of thirst on an island in the middle of a freshwater lake, I know for a fact I'm not alone, and I have people there to talk to me, but this nagging feeling I'm just alone and anxious really pulls at me."
lonely,Anyone else have only their own thoughts for company?,"Anyone else have only their own thoughts for company? - So it's been years now. Too many years since I cut every friend out of my life. Years of time spent alone has taught me the value of other people in your life. It's also taught me that social skills are like a muscle. They need excercise, and I want nothing more than to find friendship and love. Hopefully there aren't too many other people that feel as lonely as I do right now. But if there is anyone, I'd like to know your coping mechanisms. God knows I could use some."
lonely,I often find myself envious of others around me and it wares me down,"I often find myself envious of others around me and it wares me down - Im touch starved, often wishing i had someone to love and after my last relationship i feel as if ill never find romance or achieve my dreams."
lonely,Sad and don’t know what to do,"Sad and don’t know what to do - It’s kinda always been an issue. I wouldn’t say it’s as bad as my peers but it’s definitely bad. There’s a lot that I obviously can’t write cause it would take a while but I’ll just say the grand scheme of things. So basically I’m not really happy. I haven’t been happy. It definitely started to get really bad last year but it was always an issue growing up. I was very emotional growing up and by the time I was in 4th or 5th grade I had self esteem issues. There wasn’t much of a reason why, I just did. I didn’t like myself. Tbh I hated almost everything about myself until like middle of 7th/8th grade. I found a group of friends that I would hang out with everyday and everything felt authentic. Like we always said shit how it was and got along great. We did lie about something or start some shit with each over someone else. Like we just stuck by each other. It’s hard to explain. But they all stopped talking to me. First, one of them ended up stopping talking to me because my friend. Then the other friend just stopped wanting to hang out. It wasn’t that he wasn’t friends with us anymore, he just stayed inside all day. So it was just me and the other friend and he prioritizes school over a lot of things so basically I was alone. Like yeah I could text people but it’s not really enough. It’s not very easy for my to make new friends. I’m an introvert and honestly I’m just awkward if I don’t know you. This all happened in 10th grade. 11th grade was by far my worst year. My grandfather passed away. He was more of a father to me, as my dad wasn’t really in my life for the first 10 years. I found a girlfriend and she cheated on me. My grades were slacking causing more stress. I was alone. I had 1 close friend. There was a lot of times where I honestly wanted to kill myself. I found another girlfriend. Shes been great. We’re very close. But I still feel depressed. I’m in my senior year now. 

The whole reason why I started feeling this way was after February break. I had a lot of time to myself and I was able to reflect. A lot of the nights I smoked weed just so I didn’t have to think because I knew it wasn’t going to be well. Every vacation, whether summer, Holliday, April, February, whatever, I get really sad. I don’t smoke when I have school or if I have to do something in the morning cause the mornings are hell. So I was thinking. I realized I’m very dependent on people. I need social interaction in real life to stay happy. The issue is I’m not able to get it. Even when I do, I’m sometimes still not happy. I just don’t know what to do. About a month ago, me and my gf broke up. She wasn’t happy. I was obviously sad about it, but I was finally gonna get help for everything because as bad as it sounds, I know I need her. Without her, I genuinely don’t think I can live. She’s pretty much all I have at this point I feel like. I would never tell her this, as I don’t want her to feel trapped. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t really bring myself to tell my mom about it. My sister was suicidal and it hurt my whole family. I just don’t want her to feel bad. I don’t want to be put on meds or something either, but I just don’t know what to do. I stayed home from school yesterday and I want to again. I have no motivation. There’s a lot more to it I just kinda wrote this up in a couple minutes. I probably forgot some important stuff but the main issue is really this paragraph. I know I have some issue. I just don’t know how to fix it, well more so I can’t bring myself to tell anyone."
lonely,Feeling so bad mentally it hurts physically,"Feeling so bad mentally it hurts physically - Does anyone elses heart/chest hurt when they think about this stuff, I also get a feeling in my back (it honestly just feels like I need a hug feeling I know that's weird but it's such a clear feeling like when you're stomach feels hungry or bladder needs to pee)

Idk if this is just me I have a number of mental health issues most of which come with some physical pains/discomforts I'll link in the comments another post I made in R/virgin that gives some more info"
lonely,I'm hurt.,"I'm hurt. - (They all move on. We talk because they're either bored or lonely. I am aware of that, but i let it happen because i just want to matter for a while. Then someone else comes along and he/she takes them. And i am left alone. I wish someone could stay. I wish i was someone's favorite person. I wish someone could make efforts for me like i always do for them. I wish my favorite persons could ask me out. But my whole life is just me clinging to some kind of hope, then i discover something i didnt expect at all, and i realize it was not hope, it was a fucking joke, an illusion.)"
lonely,I originally posted to r/virgin but I really need some help,"I originally posted to r/virgin but I really need some help - Im male 21 a virgin and I have diagnosed depression and anxiety disorders so I guess thats part of how i end up feeling this way.But every-time I think about sex or relationships or am ever slightly horny I get a really discomforting feeling in my penis (and lower spine but too a much lesser intensity)  the best way I'd describe it is it feels like being stuck in a small space unable to stretch properly.I also get these like muscle twitches. spasms when i think about it too they're at their worst when I think about this stuff but they also happen at other times the discomforting trapped feeling has been persisting for a couple years now and the twitches about 1 year does anyone else get this or something similar?  


some more info/rant   
I guess I was in the friendzone for a few years Idk really because for along time of it it seemed like just friends not friendzoned but when we were 17 she lost her virginity to some guy and told me all about it in sorta detail. this was 4 years ago were not even friends anymore and like memories of things she said still show up and make me feel sick and awful.  
and now that thats so many years ago and I hear how everyone else's sex lifes advance and mine still hasnt started, it makes me feel really weak and worthless   
I feel like a Failure as a man and it makes me want to kill myself and the fact that its been so long and ive let my feelings get this bad only makes me feel worse about it"
lonely,Entering Uni has been so lonely,"Entering Uni has been so lonely - I miss the solid friendships I had in high school. It’s not like I can’t talk to people it’s just that I never end up talking to the people I talk to again. Idk it feels like people don’t wanna be friends with me. It’s made the first week feel so lonely. 
On top of this I really wanna find love. I’ve never had a boyfriend before and I don’t know how to date. I also don’t know anyone I want to date. I thought I was gonna be friends with this one guy but he basically sent me a dtf message on the second day of knowing him and I got scared and ghosted him. Idk is it too much to ask for to be friends first then and see if you like them. Maybe it’s just me but I take a while to develop feelings :/"
lonely,I've hit a new low this weekend.,"I've hit a new low this weekend. - I drank non-stop, called an adult hotline for the first time numerous times racking up over $1000 in charges just to talk to someone, and called out of work. I just woke up and I'm still a little bit drunk. I'm not sure where I went wrong in life but I'm pretty sure that  I fucked up everything and every relationship by drinking too much. And the worst part is that this is not at all a new revelation or epiphany for me. This is literally probably over the thousandth time I have woke up and said to myself, ""I have a problem and I need to stop now"".  I just don't. Every time I try to sober up I quickly realize how lonely I am, and go right back to it.  The only thing stopping me from drinking the rest of this vodka is that I need to work later today. And I really don't want to go to work today. I haven't even eaten an appropriate amount of food this weekend. I'm going to start shaking soon but not from alcohol withdrawal, but from low blood sugar. I would be perfectly fine driving to get food, but shouldn't and won't be because I know there's still a significant amount of alcohol in my blood. I *need* to drink water but can't seem to bring myself to walk that far at the moment. My bed is literally half covered  by beer cans and trash. I have done very little more than work, drink, and watch YouTube for the past few years. I have numerous unpaid bills and obligations that I have ignored. I have numerous potential job interviews sitting in my inbox that I don't have the energy to respond to. I often feel like crying for no reason but can't work my way up to something that feels cathartic. I stopped going to certain businesses because I have made a complete ass out of myself so much so that I can't even bring myself to show my face there even drunk. I sometimes feel ""grateful"" that I don't have close family or children because I would only end up (emotionally) hurting them. 

I'm an adult man but choosing to drink every day has turned me into nothing more than a pathetic lonely little child who can barely take care of himself. I used to be a ""happy drunk"", but I'm not anymore. I'm just a bad, selfish person now, even sober. I get irritated when people who don't have something for me try to talk to me.   That's not who I think I am, but apparently I am. I'm not suicidal or anything but I don't want to be me anymore. I don't know myself but I know how I think, though, and there's a good chance that by the end of the day I will somehow talk myself into drinking again and everything I have written here will just be another cry for help out to people who can do little to help me stop making bad choices. I just need someone somewhere to know how I feel and how bad my alcoholism has gotten."

i thought that he understood how it felt like to be an outcast and maybe he does but almost too much. to the point where he's refusing to see me also being there and instead wants to be alone. and it makes me feel like i'm taking up too much space and then i get stuck inside my head, going in circles of should i be feeling this way? am i actually valid or is that something people say? what are my actual issues? are they actual issues? shouldn't we accept our flaws? if i don't, would i be rejecting myself? i have to love myself right? so i should be kind to myself, but what if there are things about myself that are not ok? i'm too dependent, too needy, too quick to start a relationship, too based in fantasies of true love and romance because stories told me it was real. because i've witnessed it in other people. and fuck does it hurt because if it is real it is nowhere near me at all. i'm constantly grasping at straws hoping to grab the one i need. 

i'm alone in my head, in my life. my friends have their own friends, their own lives. some of them have their own issues and understandeably cannot carry mine with their own. but then where do i go? am i being left alone? abandoned? i'm always abandoned. i disappeared a long time ago from online because i felt the same way and no one seemed to really care. abandoning the abandoner, i suppose it's fair. i wish you could get a little ""ping"" sound in your head, a soft ping not an annoying one, for whenever someone was thinking about you. then maybe i would feel more than instead of less than.

but there i go again, basing my happiness on what others think of me. why? why am i like this? how can i change this? i'm here posting and doing the very thing i'm speaking of. looking for validation, some comfort in sharing similar thoughts. but why? why do i need that? and even if i found it , would you even care after you've realized i'm not the person you thought i was? i don't have my shit together, i don't have ANYTHING IN MY LIFE  figured out. i am lost. i am alone. i am without purpose. i have no hobbies. my friends are all digital. i exist in my head and the outside life is something i ghost around on autopilot.

i'm 27 years old, which is so young in retrospect, but fuck i feel like i've wasted so much time doing nothing. having crippling social anxiety doesn't help. neither does being poor because i can't pay to see a therapist. 

so i kind of am just stuck here. stagnant in my life. waiting. but i don't know what i'm waiting for."
lonely,The best experience I've had in a while,"The best experience I've had in a while - I've felt lonely for years. I'm not good at making friends, former drug addict, never had a girlfriend. All I've wanted for so long is to touch someone and be touched

But last night I slept in the same bed as a girl.

I asked a girl from my university to my room to watch a movie and we ended up cuddling all night until I fell asleep.

Honestly never thought it would happen, it's been years. I've never done anything like that before. But it happened.

It can happen to you to. The most unexpected things really can happen.

Sometimes I would find a job to keep my mind off things. But after a while, I’d always find myself disdained by my boss and I’d quit and end up in this cycle again. 

I tried online dates, I tried the make friends sub reddits, I tried going to social events... dont get me wrong, they do help me get casual acquaintances that disappears in a week or two. Then I end up back to where I started.

I wouldn’t wake up tomorrow if I could."

I just can’t talk to people and my mentality is that what will they think of me, what if I embarrass myself, first impressions, and among other things. I am confused as to what I’m doing in life and whether I have made the right decisions or not. I’m in a big college right now and I just feel alone and just in my own world. I haven’t connected with people for a long time and it’s almost like I’ve forgotten how too, since i’m so used to being alone and just not dependent on others. That on top of being young i just don’t understand. Is it my face, my impression, my vibe, or just am I just a unseen by others. I try and never succeed and it’s almost normal for me to be awkward, laugh at myself, cry alone at night, I just don’t understand. Society is weird and it seems like there’s no place for me to I guess strive. I feel fine in my own little bubble but it’s just hard to connect and form relationships. I look at others and want to be them but in the end i can’t. I’m just so used to being alone that eating alone, studying  alone, and just being in my own head has become something that I go to I guess take away the anxiety. Sorry for the rant, i’m new😅"

Online relationships back at the start of the Net boom.  An affair with a married woman I thought I loved.  A friend or two I never really wanted.

Then a long draught and friendzone after friendzone.

I'm working on getting healthy but dealing with the loneliness is hard.  No real family time close to.  Friends are few, female to as being a nice guy makes male friendships hard.  As wel being a son of an alcoholic father and a wounded and absenctee mother? 

Therapy is slow and I'm impatient.  Hard to love myself but easy to love others.  

Sigh.  

Oh and sometimes I'd just want the ego validation of being wanted.

I don’t talk to anybody on a daily basis other than my gf and maybe one friend but I feel like I’m going nowhere and I’ve never been this lonely.

Some info about me: I live in the United States, watch too much youtube, and am always trying out new games. I like to listen to a lot of music but my taste is mostly alternative rock and alternative pop and such from what I've been told. I have social anxiety and it really has an affect on my life. Because of this I struggle to socialize with people in real life and as a result haven't had friends in a long time. I'm not 18 yet and I'm not in school either (that's a story for another day) so I don't have any other option but to look for friends online (at least that's how it feels).

lonely,Stuck : need advice,"Stuck : need advice - So like many of y’all I have hit the point where loneliness has become a giant downer. For the longest time I hated who I was and didn’t bother to open myself up for a relationship, there were girls who liked me but I didn’t give myself the chance to get into a relationship. I always looked at myself saying “ why get into a relationship if your such a piece of broken shit?”. My mentality was why get together with someone if your not good enough for yourself. Well it’s been a couple years and I’ve managed to work on myself a lot , now I’ve managed to beat my depression and self esteem issues. I am happy with who I am and wanna start dating but the dating world is a lot harder as an adult with no experience. I feel like I missed out on a lot of things and I’m the one at fault. I’m only 20 but this flip flop game of loneliness is taking a toll on me, I’ve just started to kinda feel empty. How did some of y’all overcome this sensation if you did ?

I'm usually all my myself in the room and in my own little world. But after being at the park and smoking a cigarette , I decided to take a 20 out and head to a bar . I'm nervous but I figure why not go for one time. 

I miss in 2015 when I was living wild and was able to be around a few women that were twice my age. I am notoriously crappy with women and can't get a single woman to look in my direction. I'm as lonely as an incel but I'm no incel. On dating sites I message transgenders sometimes just to try and talk to someone. I'm not placing any blame on women like incels. I know all the blame is on me and only me but I get the existential loneliness that incels feel and I don't see women as foids like what they call them. I use to see them as celestial beings lol. 

But I'm new to this subreddit. I'll try not to post much on here because I have a habit of saying weird things or repetitive depressing and nilhistic things so... Yeah. And I'm quite oversentimental at times and like hearing things I never heard like a quote from Osho.

Osho said that "" Even if your on your deathbed and never received loved and in that moment you receive love then you haven't missed out on anything because a single moment of love is equal to the whole eternity of love ❤️"

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

finally it’s the week of and the ‘friend’ that promised to drive me there and take me to my dr appointment the day after suddenly decides to stay the week with her bf. another friend is leaving the night before my birthday to go home until sunday. 

nobody else said they wanted to come with until i said i could pay for gas and their meal. but then i get my bills paid and now i would only have enough money to cover my own meal and now nobody wants to go. 

i’m dealing with health problems that i know are probably stressing my friends out (i know i’d be stressed if i was in their place) but i got a really nasty concussion over the weekend and now nobody seems to want to be around me. 

i feel like i’ll be lucky if i even get one happy birthday and i know most of my good birthday wishes will come from this post.

I finally started to eat healthier and join a gym about 5 months ago and at first all that fat loss and muscle gain was awesome, and the gym has become routine. But I have torn BOTH of my rotator cuffs, to the point where the inflammation, which I also have in my back and knees has affected my ability to do my basic job. Even running on the treadmill has become too much, largely due to my knees. I am not in a good spot, especially in my head and I fear for my life now, as I have made attempts before. I only have a friend and a half online and they’re not even in the same country as me, and I would hate to turn all my problems on to an online friend. I want to get better, but my anxiety has gotten to astronomical levels due to my lack of socializing in person that I can’t even talk to customers very well at work. I have no family to turn to and no friends and no way to make friends. I’ve been to multiple therapists and they don’t help. I just need advice on what to do in real life.

I’m from the golden state. Don’t worry about timezones because I’m never asleep on time. I pull all nighter quite often so if you need someone to talk to at odd times, there’s me.

I like lots of things, most recent thing I’ve been excited about is the season 5 release of Better Call Saul. Have you seen Breaking Bad? Favorite show of all time, not sure if anything can top it. 

Before you ask I’ve only watched two anime’s. Castle in the sky and Assassination classroom. I watch all kinds of movies too mainly action and animated. My favorite music is Japanese city pop from the 80’s or just 80’s music in general. 

What I like to do varies on my mood but I’m passionate about film, I want to make a movie. I’m actually in the process of making one. Don’t ask what about, none of my movies have a true plot to them; I suck at writing. Any of you seen killer bean forever?

Like, everyone says that its fine, they don't hate me but im all alone here with no one to turn to, and when i do i feel like i need to apologise. 

Maybe i should just cut everyone out of my life and start over, maybe i should just fake a smile and carry on, tears if a clown and all that, or maybe i should rot.

Fair enough I don't drink and party or do raves or whatever involves people losing their shit but has it become this hard to make friends? 

Loneliness should come up as an illness in webmd or NHShelp and all them sites because I feel like this condition is what worsens all other pre existing problems (mental health etc) and its just thrown under a rug as a first world sneeze. It's 

I don't know what happened but its ironic that I wish I could rewind time to a period where I didn't feel completely non existant. Anyone else feel invisible?

We became best friends (at least I think we did) until the start of national exam where he chose my ex over our friendship. Almost 22, graduate next year, and my ""friends"" seem to not like my presence at all. Last year, they all suddenly went dark. We did had a group call once and also hang once but I was a background. They literally were having a fun little conversation while telling me to sit at the back and wait. While I can't put my trust anymore, it feels suffocating to be alone for more than a year. I'm probably going to die alone, either from old age or... y'know.
Well, sorry for wasting your time. Its already 5 AM and I need to sleep.

lonely,These past years have really sucked,"These past years have really sucked - I had my 16th birthday recently, I spent it alone, which is fine I guess, I don’t really like celebrating. I’ve been an online student for the past 3 years, since I started I lost all but one of my irl friends, and I barely even talk to her anymore. I feel like I should be out with people, learning how to drive or at least just doing something productive, but I just don’t have motivation. My grades are slipping, I’ve barely done any work this semester even though it’s not that difficult in the first place, I feel overwhelmed to even attempt to catch up on the work I’ve missed.

I’ve been doing physical therapy for the past 4 months now, it’s been good. I’m starting to slowly get to where I should be physically. I’m still underweight, and I still can’t stand for extended periods of time without back pain, but it’s getting better. I think this is part of the reason I haven’t been going anywhere.

I just don’t know what to do to get rid of this feeling. I want to go out and meet people, but when I ever get close to actually doing something, or try to make plans with someone my stomach just drops. I usually always end up canceling my plans and making empty promises to myself that one day I will actually go. It makes me not want to try at all just because of the feeling I get, but then I won’t ever stop feeling lonely. I just want someone to hang out with and do random and stupid stuff together, I guess like stuff you’d see in the movies. I’ve never had that before. I don’t know how to fix this"
lonely,I just have no one to talk to anymore,"I just have no one to talk to anymore - So my problems with lonelyness started last June. My gf of 2.5 years suddenly broke up with me. I was demolished and I still feel the pain. Back then I was more or less happy because I had one person I could talk to about everything. My ex really was the only person I could open up to. She helped me with my problems I helped her with hers.
I have a few people I meet at some activities in my freetime and we laugh together but nothing personal. With my ex at my side I was fine with having no friend I could talk to about deeper stuff or personal issues. I probably didn’t even realized that because I didn’t brother me at all. But when we broke up, the regular messages I got from my ex stopped and I suddenly felt alone with my problems. It was hard to solve my problems all by myself and it still is. But I am trying to get used to it. I don’t know if I can do it.
At that time I realized that I wouldn’t consider those people to be my friends. They are good to have a laugh with, go eating or work together but nothing more. So I have nobody outside my family who cares for me. No one of them messaged me after the breakup. Nobody seemed to cared. Just no one asked how I was after a 2.5 years relationship.
I feel like I was a different person arround those people just without any personal issues. Just like they don’t realize I am more then a guy who makes jokes, eats with them or does whatever.
Because of the sudden breakup I also have problems trusting people. Even if there were people I could open up to, I probably wouldn’t be able to because I fear getting hurt when someone knows too much about me.
I also feel unloveable because of this. I consider myself being ugly, awkward and useless. I probably made myself lonely and the outsider. Right now I am lying in my bed, crying while those people are together and having fun. I don’t get invitations anymore. I never got many but at the weekends I usually had something else to do then work or playing video games.
I am almost 20. I feel old, used and alone. It feels insane that a few months ago I just needed one person I could talk to about everything to be happy.
I really don’t know what the purpose of this post is. But it helps me a bit to share it to you."

lonely,Here's some more lyrics from someone lonely.,"Here's some more lyrics from someone lonely. - Wrote this last night.

Fallen down too many times, 

But you wouldn't pull me up, 

You just dragged me down, 

Further into my flaws,

Not content with seeing me fail, 

Held in place, 

You hammered nails into my skin, 

Crucifixion was your despicable aim, 

Strung up and left for dead, 

Everything right in place, 

You knew what you were doing, 

But you didn't stop, 

Venomous leeches drain me of life, 

Gasping for air,

You left me stranded, 

Nothing left for the ravenous masses,

I am but an empty shell, 

Hollowed out for your amusement, 

You carved out what was left, 

And for what exactly"
lonely,Ever feel like your walking on thin ice when trying to make new friends?,"Ever feel like your walking on thin ice when trying to make new friends? - I feel like there are unspoken laws or something when you try to join a group or make a friend. You try everything you try to talk to a person you try to make jokes with the person or group but if you trip up and step on a piece of weak ice and you fall through and then no one would talks to you and you feel like a failer. And every time you are with the group or talk to that friend you have no idea what these unspoken and unwritten laws are and your so afraid to slip up you just end up being silent and say and do nothing because you have no idea what to do. And this just doesn't apply to one person or one group it applies to everyone, every group. Until you somehow spend enough time with them that you some how gone through the mine field or patch of thin ice and now there a close friend or something and nothing you do matters and there are no unwritten or unspoken rules anymore but until then it is just a minefield.

Does anyone else feel this way?

First off, this is my first topic on reddit. I was wondering if any of you have science based tips to reduce loneliness. I will post the studies if someone ask for one. I'm not looking for the tips that involve people.

1. A dog eases loneliness.
2. Tv eases loneliness
3. Alexa eases loneliness. ( i guess more minor)
4. Boosting up room temprature/electric blanket/warm shower eases loneliness.

Any more??


 I lived in isolation for a long time and I am so sorry you have to go trough this consuming feeling. I know how you feel. It is social crushing. Anyway, for those who are currently that unstable from loneliness that they are going to madness. Get help from a professional. I am serious. I noticed if you feeling lonely enough, any form of contact will do.  I spammed  a pdoc at the time. And my symptons much improved when he finally take me in. You can' be picky when it is about to drive you to madness."

One day you will step into my path and there will be no avoidance. That day I will pick you up and carry you, so long as you strengthen me with your loving words and touch.

So yeah, I'm lonely peeps. Like it's been about 2 years since my last partner, which was short lived. At 25 this is pretty rough, I mean sex is great and all, but I really would love to meet a lady that is like-minded and loving in more was than just enjoying intercourse.

That being said, any ladies in SW Oregon that are looking for love? 6'4 210lbs and I sip tea out of the skull of my rival, Mustafa, to accentuate my ruggedness."
lonely,Venting a little,"Venting a little - After a long breaking from dating, I’ve decided to re enter the playing field.  I know dating apps are notoriously unreliable and while I’m doing more socially, it’s still a huge letdown when people either ghost me or make it very clear that they’re not interested after a date.  It’s so disheartening that practically every woman I know had no problems finding someone yet guys avoid me.  Anyway, I thought I’d just post to vent a little and get this off my chest."
lonely,Only capable of working,"Only capable of working - I basically don't see anyone outside the context of work/school anymore. Its the only way i know how. I'm pretty smart so it's not hard to find people who want to work with me, but it doesn't matter. We will be friends for a bit, maybe hang out a few times outside school, but then it's over.

So what do i do? I work constantly. I make sure that I'm always ahead. My professors love me. I'm likely to take over management of a large club at my school. My academic life just keeps improving. But it's because while other people are socializing, i study alone, for hours, every day. What else is there to do?"
lonely,What is the purpose of this pain?,"What is the purpose of this pain? - Pain is supposed to be a protective mechanism right? To prevent further harm? To alert us that something isn't working right in our body and seek help? 

What's the purpose of this pain that I've been experiencing ever since childhood then? What, exactly is the purpose of the pain caused by lonliness? 

I know it's meant for me realise that I'm weird and am supposed to make friends. I've tried that. Believe me. I've done everything possible to make a few genuine friends and I've ALWAYS ended up hurt. So now, I've stopped trying. I've accepted that I'm going to remain lonely. 
But why doesn't the damn pain leave me? 

I'm a med student, trying desperately to stay afloat with hectic college life and a few chronic health issues. I'm trying my damned hardest to get healthier, study better, get better grades. Ever since I accepted my lonliness, life has gotten considerably better. The most significant improvement being my recovery from depression. I'm really proud of myself for how far I've come but I NEED to get better than this. 

My current issue is that I experience random bouts of extreme emotional disturbance when I realise how lonely and friendless I am. These feelings intensify when I'm in college, surrounded by groups of people. Everyone, every single fucking person has a buddy to talk to. Some people have more than one. Some people have already found their SOs. I'm the only person who sits alone. I'm the only person who has nobody to talk to. That's when the pain starts. I almost always have to hold back my tears and take deep breaths and pray frantically for the professor to arrive soon. Not because I'm so good a student that I want to learn. It's because I just don't want to be alone with my feelings.

I've tried stuff to engage myself during such situations - calligraphy, drawing, reading fiction, etc. All of these did help me, but only for a temporary period. At the end of the day I'm still stuck with these feelings, the pain and the inability to make friends. 

At this point I really don't care about not having friends anymore. I just want the pain to go away. I've accepted that I'm never going to have anyone who likes me, or wants to befriend me. I've accepted the 0 messages, and  0 phone calls. I've accepted the lonely birthdays, the lonely New Year's. Please. Please just make the pain go away. 

It's hard to believe this kind of pain can serve any purpose."
lonely,Left alone again,"Left alone again - I made 2 friends last year and we were extremely close and i was glad that i had close friends for once.

Now I'm confused if this was a friendship or a business partnership.

The irony here is that person who I'm talking about is as lonely a person as I am, going through a terrible phase in life...I really wanted to be the friend who  could be looked upon when in need...maybe it's me...maybe I'm like that stupid dog who goes to his human every time he sees him....even when he shoos him away.."

I don't deny their loneliness and despair but what about not having anyone? I seem to be the only one like this tbh. What is wrong with me? I never overcame my social anxiety and I haven't made more than 5 friends in my lifetime. Right now I have no one to even talk to. Last message in my phone from someone interested in talking/hanging out with me was 1 month ago. Last date I had was 2 years ago. The only people I talk to regularly are my parents."

Even when I manage to talk to some people and learn their names I still leave feeling so disconnected.

I only have a couple friends left who I can somewhat open up to. Most of them are starting new chapters in their lives like starting families or careers. And of course I'm happy for them but I can't help feel that a year from now I won't be seeing them much if at all. Even my ex left me last summer because she found a better life for herself without me. That one hurt the most knowing I wasn't good enough to keep the person I cared for the most in my life.

I'm just starting to rant now but is anyone else slowly losing connection to everyone around them? I just can't seem to break this cycle."
lonely,"If I was dead, would anybody care?","If I was dead, would anybody care? - I don't want to leave but if I stay I'll always be stressing out the people around. I feel like I'm not good enough to have people around me. I feel stressed and theres no one to talk to because my family would never understand and my friends are busy with college. It's 6:25am as I'm writing this, why can't I just sleep. I'm getting tired of faking this smile and making everyone else happy to distract from how lonely I feel. I wish I could've had someone to fall in love with. If I become the person that people want me to be, would they like me then? I regret many things in my life. It's probably true, people only care when you're dead and gone. Anybody ever seen the show ""dead like me"" no spoilers pls. I recently discovered it and it's just wonderfuly refreshing, at least to me it is good, really gives a new perspective on life and death, funny. The feeling of alcohol entering your body, warm.
I really loath waking up everyday, wishing I could sleep forever because I'd rather be dreaming. I'm not dumb but I feel like such a fool. It must be pathetic, being a boy with daddy issues. I don't know what to do anymore, I don't know what to believe in anymore. Why do we tell our children that there is a heaven when it has no affect on who they become as people. I don't know if I believe in God anymore, because if he was ever there he's not here anymore. I hate being this way, it's hard being such a confident guy behind closed doors, but it's tiring being an introvert out in public. I wish I could talk to people, and not care about anything. This world is moving faster than I can walk. I have to close my eyes to stop the spinning. Is it true alcohol actually makes you colder? The pain I feel, will keep being here like it is hurting now and will tomorrow. I feel hopeless and like a lost cause. 
C'mon, honestly nobody would miss me, sure some would be sad for a while, but they'll get over it and move on just like anything else. If I'm not good enough for anyone why would I want to torture myself by being alive. Plenty of easy ways to expire, but I'm too much of a pussy to do it. My mind can't turn off. What is it that I fear most? Why haven't I killed myself yet? Will anyone remember me when I do kick the bucket? One of these days. I just want someone to be proud of me, and not out of formality.  I don't want my mistakes to be what people remember. People only hold me up so high because they don't know who I really am. I was never that guy, I'm lower than the shit on your shoes. I can't compare myself to anyone else because I'm too worthless. I don't want to be alone in the future because I'm already feeling down, I couldn't imagine real isolation. Well, I've talked enough. Here's hoping I die in my sleep (or not)."

lonely,I live alone and I’m 17,"I live alone and I’m 17 - (Skip to paragraph 3 to skip background)

In about late August my mom texted me while I was at school that I was kicked out of the house. The reason behind this being that I didn’t like the man she had plan on marrying (now married as of october) who she had met in April on my spring break while I was with all my friends. It wasn’t as much the character of the guy but more the recklessness and careless nature of the relationship. Like one day in May I went downstairs and saw all these office supplies and computers and I asked my mom what were they there for and she replied “Oh ______ moved in” the fact that she didn’t even care to tell me in advance upset me greatly. 

The whole summer I became a recluse from them in my own house because the relationship made me feel extremely uncomfortable. The reason why because my mom told me about 2 years prior after she divorced my dad that she “would never see another man” which I understand people changed but she just jumped into this relationship so quick. So throughout the summer, tension was building between us. Then one horrible night in August (the night before the second day of school) I left the house abruptly. I don’t want to go into what made me leave because it’s probably my most deeply disturbed memory of my life but you guys can use your imagination. So I left my house at about 11pm and then I get a text from an unlisted number saying it’s the police and they need me to come home to talk. So being that this was the police and not just my mom, I went home. The police basically just escorted me home and asked me if I had suicidal thoughts or anything but I just replied “no” to everything when in reality life was a daily struggle for me and I contemplated it a lot. But when I get home, ______ starts screaming at me saying look what I did to my mother and telling me that I’m not thinking straight. I told him to “fuck off” and tried to go past him to get to my bedroom but he pushed me back. In that moment in time it took me everything in my power to not hit him in the nose but I restrained. I then said I would rather live with my dad than here (he lives in Chicago hundreds of miles away) _______ then went on criticizing my dad about things only my family knows and kept calling him “an alcoholic piece of shit” which was true but who the fuck has the right to call him that? I forget how the conversation ended but basically the next day my mom texted me that I wasn’t allowed back in the house.

I now live alone in an apartment complex a couple miles from my old house. My dad is financing it and visits from time to time but honestly I hate it when he’s here. I hated my dad before the divorce and now it’s just uncomfortable being around him but I still try to give him a chance. I recently also broke up with my girlfriend who I had been seeing since July and even prior to that but she was my main supporter throughout this whole process of moving out. But as of yesterday she completely cut me off by not responding to any of my texts except for saying “I don’t want to talk to you anymore.” Right now I struggle living, life just feels like a bad dream I can’t wake up from and I don’t know how to go on. I’ve tried seeing a therapist but I didn’t help at all whatsoever. Being alone feels like solitary confinement and my sentence feels like for the rest of life. I don’t know how to go on."

My friends mostly come from a couple of towns 20 mins away from the school, and I live on a farm out the opposite direction 45 minutes. I feel like I'm just kind of an empty presence there. They all play soccer for their town, while I play Rugby, and due to them all living so close to each other, they do all kinds of things without me. I kinda just sit there because I have nothing to contribute, and my attempts to strike up different conversations are inadvertently shut down by the more socially active guys. I just kinda feel alone, you know. I live far away from anyone else. Ah welp."

I cut ties with so many friends because I realised being friends with them made me worse. but god it hurt.

lonely,Hard to write now.,"Hard to write now. - As the title says, this is hard for me to write. Constant loss I guess is why I'm writing this and the pain of it. Loss as in well loss of friends in real life and online. So now my loneliness is just ever so increasing as it eats me from the inside out with this feeling of void. 

It was just a year ago I had people that were close for the first time in a long time. But in November one of them admitted to loving me, then they went dark on me for a bit as they weren't ready to handle their emotions, I guess. Didn't realize that I did return feelings, but my emotions are a mess, often times too strong or washed out for me to recognize right away. It was little too late though. They decided to use Tinder to in their words ""meet new friends."" I became history to them the same week. 

Then there was another case with another friend. Got close with him, he'd talk to me each day and what not. Rather it be deep things or just going over little things that we had done in your day. It was like finally, someone else that cares for mundane things!

Then well he found a partner, I was happy for him. Typical new relationship thing of where a friend tends to go under the radar for a bit entering the relationship. Well he just one day disappeared all from the one app that he used to talk to his partner and later removed me from everything not soon after he entered this relationship. 

Like that, I lost two good friends. It's left me distraught for a while and well I've just gone back to living my life as I've always done. A life of nothing... A life that needs to change now. Attempting that change has been hard. 

I've gone downhill since then mental health wise. I do not lash out at people, but something has changed that I am cannot see about myself. Trying to meet new people has only resulted in failure either way it goes, either me meeting them or them meeting me. People are quick to leave. 

Maybe it's just the energy I give now, or the fact that I am just broken and that seems to be affecting my outer shell so much so now? I don't want to go back to the days of wearing a mask when everything in the end felt fake and just had to let it end and everything fall apart. 

At this point the void hits me again. What to say thru out the rest of my message escapes me. I need change, to change for the better. Then maybe people in my life can be a thing again... But now as I lay broken I can't handle people or be tolerated by people.

Feel free to message me, I won't be reading replies to this to avoid any more blows to my already down self."

I believe that it is true, women want a man with blue eyes, perfect skin and teeth. They want a man who knows how to do everything, because otherwise they sleep with your plumber. They want a man with a chiseled jaw and an elephant dick because any penis under 8 inches is considered tiny.

I am realizing that at a large talk vs a small talk is so much more.

I also dont have family, an orphan and my adopted family disowned me since I was teenager. 
A culture thing in my home country, friends would leave you for a partner and they dont last until adult phase. So literally I have no old friend now. Especially most of them are married.

I through difficulties and no one could understand me. People give me advice to focus on my life but it is hard. I dont really have anything here no money no job. I relied a lot on partial scholarships which is not enough and probably I could not graduate. Sometimes I need people to share my life with but here people are so individualistic. 

I got contrast advice. People at my place now dont really understand my situation because here is developed country and mine is developing.

I work in a bakery part time and they only schedule me closing shifts which means I am the only one there for 5-6 hours at a time. As you can imagine that isn’t doing much for my mental health.

I was happy for them, because I’d be a bad friend if I didn’t support them ya know? So, I played my emptiness off by asking friends on Snapchat through YOLO if they would date me. I knew all the messages were to mess with me but a couple messages hit hard. 

“You are a good guy”
“Don’t worry, you will find someone one day”

I know these were supposed to be supportive messages but I couldn’t help but feel belittled. You know why, cuz even though the message was anonymous, I knew who the messages came from; those messages came from friends who were in a relationship. It was easy for them to say it, they are in a relationship. And me, I was left with a hole in my heart and I deleted YOLO to get that bad juju off my chest.

So around 2 1/2 years ago I split up with my ex. ( I’m 22). She’s had 2 boyfriends since and I’ve not really been with anyone. Not had a “ connection” with anyone. I met a friends work colleague on Friday night and we were all over eachother by the end of the night, and agreed to go for a drink tonight. She has the same interests and just seemed pretty cool. Cute too. 

Well we ended up joining her friends after going for a couple drinks and bla bla bla, to cut it short she isn’t interested. Obviously this isn’t her fault at all, you can’t help what you feel, but it fucking sucks.

lonely,I feel invisible in college.,"I feel invisible in college. - Back in highschool, people were pretty friendly and always open to conversing. I had guys interested in me and girls wanting to be my friend even though I wasn’t popular or particularly attractive. 

People in college act like I’m invisible. I’ve been there a little over two years and only came close to making a friend once. I was considering joining a club but I’m honestly a little scared I’ll be left in the corner."
lonely,All My Life,"All My Life - I hide myself away from my own mind as it’s disgustingly dark but as much as I wanted to keep away from it all, the thoughts have really hammered down tonight. 

Growing up I had difficulty making friends, understanding other people and acting “normal”, I should mention that I’m transgender (for context:  being different, especially in early 2000’s when it was still trying to be fully understood, UK), and for my dad to see his “little princess” wanting to be the exact opposite of that has really messed with me. He was always trying to clothe me in girls clothes, made it awkward around family etc. Whereas my mum... I think she was depressed personally that not only could her child not be happy accepting the way they were born but also because it was impossible to make friends because of how I felt emotionally - almost an internal struggle. It wouldn’t help that she would joke about it and say things such as “I would just go home and drink the issues away and hoped you’d be ‘normal’ “ or “and hope your make friends as time went on”. (She never meant in a horrible way but it still hurts knowing I couldn’t make friends and letting my mum down at the same time) 

( I’ve never let this “trans” thing get to me, but it would explain the anxiety I have when trying to make new friends, for example: I don’t sound like a guy or have the physical body appearance etc. ) I have always been the middle person... always throughout school I would be “friends” or at least be acknowledged by the both popular kids and the outcasts. I only realised I was the middle kid until GCSEs came around and every time I tried to help someone or ask for help, I’d find myself talking to... you guessed it... myself. This is where the loneliness started to kick in, now that I’m 17 rolling on 18 I’ve just felt like giving up on this pointless journey. In college I’m always sat at the back, listening to the laughter of others or talking and no one ever seems to notice me, let alone acknowledge me. Whenever I did have a close friendship, 3 in total, they either left or forgot about me or it was extremely fake. 

(I’ve never been able to hold a stable relationship either however I can’t truly judge that as I’m only young XD However past experiences has put me off the idea of a relationship as a whole. I feel the need to mention this as it might help get an idea of what is the issue, which could just be me generally.)

However, as much as I hate being lonely I also have this feeling of “would I be better off alone?”, because of all the stuff happening in this world. I enjoy my own company but as optimistic as I try to be, deep down I’m aware that it shouldn’t just be me, myself and I 24/7. One hand of me wants to make wild memories yet the other side of me wants to shut the world off.  
I’m so tired of being in a room full of people, only to feel empty inside."

lonely,The Reason Why I'm A Dandelion.,"The Reason Why I'm A Dandelion. - Oh man so like first full reddit post (go easy I'm a noob bruh). Some backstory I had been to 3 different schools in the same state before 5th grade, my family moved A LOT. I had come and go for a few and made some great friends and some distasteful enemies (basically anyone who bullied the skinny white kid) Now since I'm from NV I never really thought of the outside world because NV had it all for me life was great till my Mom was caught having an affair and the night she was confronted literally said the words ""you're not daughter of mine"" to my sister when she brought up my mothers ""friend"". So what came next was obviously separation, I went with my Father and we moved to Missouri. ""So how was school there?"" You might ask, well they were the gentry type and I was a city boy who was in a house with his female second cousins who bickered non-stop at least I knew them at school. So typical 5th grade stuff liked a girl, got the heart broken and then moved. Where? NY. Now for those of you who might think ""Oh like the city?"" NO. I'll have you peoples know that there are other places than the Bronx or Manhattan. I went to a small town (unnamed for privacy reasons) basically the same thing but my Father got in touch with his ex-wife and off to AZ I went. 
Now I'd love to say it was the same story but I did have to switch schools, once thankfully. I was kinda happy there but all good things come to an end. My Father was afraid of CPS coming to get me so he sent me off back to my home state. So after all the nostalgia and getting back to what I knew I started at yet another new school now things felt different when I met this really cool girl when we visited the Middle School I was going to attend to. When I say you'd know she was smiling if your back was turned and 10 feet away I mean it. I somehow interested her and we grew really close, but I moved schools again. It's worth noting that her friends didn't like me at all, and she told me and only me that she was fighting an already lost battle. When I switched her friends lied, and said how I used her as a way to climb the ""social ladder"" at that school (she was known there because she had quite a few friends there too). So she lost her battle and I with the chance of running away from my biggest failure I took it and ran.
 Where? Back to NY to the same small town. Ever since then I've never been good with friends I come and go. I can't trust people after how I was essentially betrayed by people who put on a facade, there's times I feel like a tool a punching bag for jokes or just there for people to take their anger out on. You name it I've probably been called that. I can't do relationships for fear of having the same thing happen again. ""But LuxDandelion why are you a dandelion?"" Well you know that really great girl? She called me a dandelion because I had been to so many places and through it all she believed that I had made a good impact on a few peoples lives. Like a dandelion comes in the spring and spreads joy to those who don't like winter, I spread joy and happiness to those who are devoid of it and to this day I will always let that nickname dictate who I am regardless of what people do or say. I'll come and go when I am needed to."

lonely,Dreams,"Dreams - I had a dream the other night I was on holidays with my friends, we met this other group from back home, we told em to join us and hang out and shit, we all got chatting and one of them kept talking to me, it flashed to different places where me and her were just talking laughing getting to know each other, we went for a walk that lead to a cliff side and just stared over the side at the sunset, thing is I could genuinely feel love and felt loved, it felt amazing, that was the first time in my life I've ever felt love and loved and it was just a dream, due to mental illness I generally don't feel which made it even better, I woke up and it was the loneliest I've ever felt, tried to get back to sleep to continue the dream but just couldn't, I haven't stopped thinking about it since, any of you ever experience anything like this?"

The issue comes with making friends that last, sooner or later all these people I meet drift out of my life. I don't have any really good friends and I recently just broke up with my partner. I'm noticing the pattern I have of making friends them moving on and me being lonely once again. It's been going on since I was a child and I genuinely dont know if I can be happy alone. Is that a problem do I need to fix that, I'd certainly be happier if I could, but is it somthing that can be fixed."

I realized that this might not be the case, and that I put up barricades between myself and friends, potential friends, or admittedly everyone. I tend to deem myself not worthy or that everyone is just too kind to let me down gently, on bad days I even believe that of my closest friends.

But I have to remind myself, just because I’ve been taught to hate myself doesn’t mean others were taught to hate me, and it may sound outlandish to hear given my background, but people wont instinctively look down on me, and may even in-fact see me in a positive light.

I'm tired of reaching out to people. I'm starting to see myself as a creep. I get so attached to somebody it drives me crazy, and me and that somebody only last for a while until it gets a distant memory or an illusion even. I want to be run after for once, but it's such a far seen dream that I realize it will stay one forever. So, how do I learn to enjoy myself, my own and only actual company?

Crushed by the weight of expectation,

Emptiness swallows me whole. 

Shackles that I placed on myself, 

I threw away the key, 

I can't escape this prison, 

Thoughts of failure consuming me. 

Self inflicted torture cell, 

Doomed to find no other,

The walls are closing in, 

Some of us are born to suffer."

It all got to me and I imploded completely and broke down and cried in front of my parents and they told my little sister that I was going through a hard time - which made me feel worse.

My family see I've been acting weird and now everyone thinks I'm nuts and are treating me as such and/or stupid - which makes me feel even worse.

lonely,Feeling really sad right now.,"Feeling really sad right now. - You know how much lonely, in need of love/attention and hate yourself you are when you realize how much you Roleplay on Discord.

I wake up, get up to my computer, start a game in the background to play when the people I Roleplay with can not answer right away and then go to Discord to answer to my Role Play and sometimes do full morning or afternoons just doing that.I do a lot of ERP, and the sad thing is that even **I** know why I do them, just because it fills up a hole to read and answer to some sexual words with a character that you like while IRL you are 17, almost 18, never had a real girlfriend (though I am a ""lucky boy"" because I had one sexfriend somehow). True people could say, and especially older people, that I just need to wait and that I will find a girl someday. Why should I even believe that? I am anwkard in public (which is ironic since I did two years of theater and loved it) and do not know how to explain the weird shit I am interested in and just pass for a creep.

Bad grades, almost addict to RP, no sport and a half depressed mother who tried everything in her power for her son and has almost given up, I can already tell she just wait for me to have 18 so she can throw me into the wild. I wasted her money on years of school that I started two years ago to stop caring about as well as her energy. The worst is that... I know I HAVE to change, I need to actually try to be someone who is somehow socially acceptable and I need to get those fingers out of my ass and actually start hard working so that once I got passed the annoying business I can go on with more interesting things. But it's almost as if my mind is complete garbage, because even if I know, I do not do anything according to that knowledge.

What I believe annoys me the most, is that I am a ""fanboy"" of the ""Blackstone Legion"" from the game For Honor and they are full of determination, though their goals is fucked up, they do everything in their power to realize it and never surrender or give up to any mission or battle. So this make me feel even more like a pure scam especially since I am very ""negatively realistic guy"" if I can say it like that, I rarely believe in my own success. No wonder, because to go back on the subject of school, I suck at manual jobs and it is a vicious cycle: You suck at manual jobs, so nobody want you or let you do anything and just insult you down when you try, so because you can not do anything you can not improve. Rinse and repeat.

Jobless, car-less, husband works fulltime &amp; wants to stay in on weekends - The only thing really keeping me going is videogames, but since I'm a stay at home wife, I have so much free time that I burn through them super quick. Ive tried MMOs but I'm too shy to talk to anyone, so I've pretty much given up on that end. I'm in my husband's guild but they're semi-hardcore raiders and I'm not very good at all. I'm just kind of in there because I'm the wife.

My husband hosts pathfinder in the basement on sundays, and the other players are mice enough, but since I don't drink or smoke weed/eat edibles, which is what they do when they all hang out outside of DnD, I don't really fit into that friend group, and never get invited anyways (my husband is invited to the drinking hangouts on the rare occasion, but he prefers to stay home and relax/play WoW).

As much as I love Canada and don't regret moving here, I miss my friends back in the US terribly. We all used to hang out all the time, I even had the key to the apartment of my two best friends and could stop by whenever. I also had an old high school friend I would hang out with from time to time.

Going from a healthy social life to where I am now is.. depressing, honestly. I've always had a hard time making friends, so what I had what honestly a miracle in it of itself, and now that it's all gone, I'm so lonely all the time. I don't know how it could get any better.

I am in the process of trying to find a job, but I've never made work friends due to my social anxiety, aspergers, + never finding people with the same interests. I've just struggled to do my job at the same capacity as normal people. Because of this I've also been wondering if it would even be worth the anxiety to get a job, but I'm staying here with a work permit until I get PR, so idk if I would get in trouble for not using the permit. We're financially doing well because my husband makes good money as an art teacher, so it's not like I even need to work. I'm starting to ramble at this point tho lol.

My friend that had many girlfriend tells me that if I would try a little harder I could find someone, but I am very insecure for the following reasons:

I am fat, not the obese type, but still overweighted. In my class, that is majority girls, I am not the most welcome, for some instances I didn't agreed with them. I try to integrate, but I always know I am left out the main group, even though I am the smartest from all the boys (I didn't mean they are obliged to give me attention only cuz I am smart).

Even though I am fat my friends still encourage me to give it a shot, but I never can find the courage for I never talk freely with girls.

Tl;dr: I am very sociable with boys, but never find the courage to ask girls out because of my insecurities and external conditions.

lonely,"Lonely after a bad breakup, 4 years to move on and horrible choices making me what I am today","Lonely after a bad breakup, 4 years to move on and horrible choices making me what I am today - **Warning!!**
It's gonna be a long post.

It started in high school, I had a crush on this girl for a few years. Too young for having crushes at that time. Never told her about my feelings and a few years later, my classmate ended up proposing her who kind of knew I liked her but I assured him that I was over her because I wanted to look tough. They broke up, she was popular and he ended up getting bullied over it. She got with another popular guy after that, didn't work out and he left her. 

So a year later I proposed, we ended up together. I ended up getting bullied and I wasn't ever the tough cool guy, just a normal guy who was good in studies and a nerd. The type you could easily mistake for a teacher's pet but I never was. So the relationship had its ups and downs but it was pretty smooth otherwise, I only hated the bullying part but it happened 2-3 times only and after that, there weren't any issues.

Fast forward a few weeks and I get insecure cos I felt that she wasn't over her popular ex-boyfriend(let him be ""**sam**""), I was pretty chill with him even before that but I guess we ended up being friends due to mutual friends, we used to hang out and we genuinely became good friends soon after. I was going through my edge lord phase at that time so I was pretty emotional too. We had fights and arguments. We broke up due to it but we ended up together again a year later.

The same thing happened again but I had genuine reasons to be insecure now. Sam transferred to a nearby school in the same year. She had a male best friend who was like her brother and he was like my best friend, they used to share notes which were pretty common in my high school but as far as I know it was him asking stuff about a girl he liked. But in one note she said she was thinking of transferring to that school because of Sam(Old Note). He snitched about it to me and I was planning to confront her but whenever I tried it usually ended up in an argument and that it was said when we weren't together and that she never talked about him anymore. Lots of arguments and she got fed up and she made a very shitty decision. She messaged Sam and said some stuff. 

At that time I had no idea about her messaging Sam but I kind of had a suspicion cos I once overheard my friends talking about some messages of her's sent to Sam. They never told me about it, so I borrowed his phone and I used to do it even before that cos he was the only one in our friend circle to have his own personal phone. I checked his messages(yep, don't judge me). And I was right.

**TLDR of the messages**-
That she didn't love me, never did and was only with me cos she didn't have a boyfriend. She loved him instead(Sam) and she wants to be back with him.
His reply- That I(me) love her very much and she wasn't being very nice by doing this.
She didn't care. He blocked her.

He knew I was going to check his messages, he said, 'so u saw it right?'
Didn't blame him, I think he realized I was too attached to her and didn't want to ruin it. No comment on this, wrong choice by him but I realize why he didn't say anything about it. We broke up of course and I was depressed for several weeks and I isolated myself as exams were approaching.

I was very angry and the entire class found about it soon somehow, she kept apologizing to me every chance she got. Messaged me, tried to confront me during class. Eventually, I gave in, I forgave her out of sympathy instead of genuine forgiveness( didn't know that at that time, I was in 9th grade), we talked and talked and I end up back with her. ( stupid me)

This time the relationship went way smoother, I wasn't insecure about our relationship anymore. But it wasn't confidence, it was me really not caring about anything anymore. I wasn't happy. To anyone else tho we looked like the perfect couple, never argued anymore. Always had something to talk about and we were always together. But I was just patting myself on the back saying that this is right and I should be happy.

Of course, I broke up with her eventually. After the breakup, it felt like everyone blamed me for being an ass and dumping her. I was angry, no one consoled me when I was depressed when she tried to cheat on me but when I broke with a genuine reason it felt like no one was on my side. In the end, I thought 'fuck you guys IDC'. I isolated myself soon after. Finals were approaching and spent most of the time just being with myself and no one else. 

Next year was last year in my high school, I avoided her always and I ended up being this moody asshole who didn't care to hurt someone's feelings at all. I never tried to be the better man, instead, I was just like a keyboard warrior starting an argument and winning it regardless. Except my 2 friends at school, I didn't ever interact with anyone at school. The last few months approaches, got into a street fight that really wasn't my fault but a misunderstanding only and my friend got hurt because of it. He got 3 stitches and it hit a vein in his temple. Teachers blamed me and the guy and girl responsible for it didn't get any punishment. Got salty about it, didn't attend even the farewell party and spent the next few months at home doing nothing(holidays before highschool finals in my country).

I don't blame my ex nor do I blame the relationship. I blame myself for how I handled it. I changed because of how I took it.

By this point, I get into a junior college for my 11 and 12 grades. Pick science as my stream cos my parents tell me to. Stay in a dorm. I have no friends in this college, really don't care about anything so I bunk my classes a lot. Make no friends because of it, barely pass 11th. 12 I tried to be better but eventually, I turned back to the depressed IDFC guy. Very lonely at this point, no friends, no one to talk with except when I go home for holidays and meet my 4 close friends from high school. Meet my ex during a gathering my friends took me to, we talk. We end up talking in social media a few more days, it kind of got suggestive and that we might get back together. A day later I block her and cut myself off from her. She gets into a relationship and a pretty serious one at that from what my friends told me.

My finals happen, average result. She messaged me about my result, we talk genuinely this time. I end up sharing my mental health issues with her and whenever something would happen I would share my problems with her. She herself had issues of her own, dad being a Lil abusive sometimes, mom being sick. We end up depending on each other now. Her results were bad-average and would struggle with what to do with life. Kind of suggested to me that she didn't want to live anymore, supported her and told her to talk with her sister and get help.

Me on the other hand, I decided to give my finals again for a better result. So stay at home, prepare for exams a year later. Perfect for me being more lonely, more depressed.
Try my ass off for exams, get extra classes from teachers living 8kms away as I lived out of town. Morning and evening classes, so 2 times of going and coming back home every day. Ruin my health because of it as I developed an eating disorder during my 11 and 12th grades with bad dorm food(lack of appetite). I got sick during summer and collapse, got hospitalized. Hemoglobin score of 8.  Some of my friends decide to reappear the exam too

My ex messages me after hearing this, she was going through relationship issues keep in mind and after she messaged me it again became these suggestive conversations every day both by me and her. I get my head together and say to her that I am pretty comfortable right now being alone and I don't want anyone in my life. We decide to not talk again and that time and time again we both seem to be very toxic together. 

My mental health was close to exploding at this point but for years it has always been me patting myself on the back that everything is fine and I am doing fine but it wasn't. Finals approach and I can't sleep. I have so bad anxiety by this point that if my mind is ever free I start feeling really bad anxiety. So right before sleep when my mind is calm and quiet I become anxious asf. Listen to podcasts and music to keep my mind busy and sleep out of pure exhaustion every night instead of a proper sleep schedule. 

My parents saw me awake at night, the next day they confront me. I admit everything about my mental health issues. I was done at this point, so I give up on my exams. Decide to get a degree with an average score instead and that I was only 19 to be worrying about a job due to my bad score( that score matters a lot in my country). I go out and meet my 1 friend who stills leaves in town while the others are away from town preparing in their own colleges from exams. We drink, we talk and I come back home. My sister is home after hearing about me, she gets angry at me for shutting myself when I could have talked to her who has also been depressed due to her relationship at some point in the past. I didn't know, was too young to realize that and I get angry too. Get into an argument with her and about my own decisions in life, I end up crying cos I know it's cos of my poor choices. After a tearful personal argument with her in my room, we have a calm and collected conversation. She cried too and I told her about the mental issues I have been going through due to stress and anxiety and that I can't appear this exam anymore. We talk about a lot of stuff.


Fast forward here I am a Lil happier. I am genuinely happier and I don't feel those negative emotions anymore but lonely cos now I am sitting at home doing nothing. Applications for a degree don't start till May, my friends are busy preparing for their own exams and I am truly lonely, no one of my age lives near me.

Also for my ex, we really don't talk anymore. She has a life of her own now and she seems happy on the outside at least. I have made bad decisions by trying to get back with her many times out of desperation and loneliness and I truly regret doing so even though I really didn't want to. I gave into loneliness and nothing against her as a person just that those weren't the right choices for both of us and I blame myself for not doing the correct thing sooner and instead of sinking myself deeper in a pit of self-pity, regret, guilt, desperation, and loneliness. Patting myself on the back every time and say I have moved on when I truly hadn't and only delusion myself.



I am putting this here for people to see and judge me. I wanted to leave this chapter of mine behind. Remind myself of what I have done and truly move on. Still struggling to find people so I don't have to be lonely anymore but it's hard cos for the last 3-4 years I haven't met anyone to be with. But I am not sad because of it just that I want to bring changes to my life, it is just a Lil hard after living like this for a few years."
lonely,made the effort to go out and have a nice meal on my own,"made the effort to go out and have a nice meal on my own - had the realization last night that no one really cared if i was depressed or lonely. aside from attending class and studying, i spend all my time alone, with no one to talk to, call, or text. i instead resort to watching videos or listening to/making music. 
 
today i acted upon that realization and decided to go out  and get a lunch on my own. who fucking cares if it’s better to go out with friends? sure it’s nice but problem is my “friends” are fake as hell so they don’t do shit with me. so i made the effort to do shit on my own and i really enjoyed myself. i had some great pasta and watched a cool video at the same time."

Last year I almost got into depression.For nearly 4 months,I felt like it was over.I didnt feel like doing anything.Didnt have the power to get out of my bed,to eat,to shower,to talk.I was close to being a vegetable.My problems in my life cummulated at once and I couldnt carry on.Impulsive parents,majority of my friends getting further away,bad grades,TONS of stress.On top of these the girl that I know for like,7 years? lead me on and when I tried to finally form a relationship she basically stopped any interest she had on me.Trust me,this shit hurt.A lot.I cared too much.Anyways,this was my life one year ago.My life didnt mean anything.



Until December.I finally tought I must do something,literally anything.Then slowly from day to day it got a little better.Until eventually I had the motivation I needed.I got in touch with my old pals again.My parents cant be changed but I learnt to deal with all this.My grades are finally getting better.I started working out and gaining weight,BEST decision I made yet.I even made peace with that girl.Well,I have to say I still feel for her and all,but Im slowly getting over.My life has got meaning again and Im feeling pretty happy.Learn how to appreciate yourself.If others make your life shit,YOU can make it better.Bit by bit you will notice visible results.Until eventually people will notice them too.




Really hope that this post will help anyone,I BELIEVE IN EVERYONE OF YOU! Im just a teenager,but trust me I know how feeling lonely can consume you."

I got a job 6 months ago which let's me talk to more people my age but it's only basic stuff, I never talk to any of them outside of work. My only close friend lives in London so we cant meet often and I text 3 other people occasionally. My weekends are boring and I usually go without speaking to anyone. I'm scared once I move out I'll become even lonlier and not make any new friends , I've heard it becomes even harder once you're and adult, and I'm scared that I'll become suicidal.

I have been turned down in every real life interaction to go on a date. I have only managed to get dates if I heavily photoshop my picture on an online profile which I know is lame and unproductive. I have never had a second date ... understandably after they see what I really look like. I posted my picture online to get honest opinions on those rating websites and consistently get 1-2 out of 10. Before I did this I thought I was just slightly below average. 

If I don't post a picture on a dating site women are so giddy and interested to talk to me based on my profile. They instantly ghost me once I reveal my picture.

I have hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets, I have travelled to dozens of countries, I have done things most people would never do in a lifetime, I have advanced degrees, etc. I am just saying, I am not a ""basement dwelling man-child who has never had a job and doesn't do anything"" 

I have been told people speak of me so highly and what a great person I am, etc, etc. Maybe they're lying. Maybe I have just a horribly weird personality coupled with a fugly face.

It doesn't seem to matter if I join groups, or am physically fit, financially well-off, and a broad individual.

The loneliness never bothered me when I was single, but I guess now that I have him, going back to that state is so much more unbearable.

He recently invited me on a trip but I wasn’t allowed to go (I’m 19F in a strict household) and it’s made me realise that being lonely makes missing out on social events feel so much worse.

This isn’t the first time its happened. I was overseas in December when he invited me on a roadtrip with his friend and I’m still devastated I missed out on that.

It’s just really upsetting when you already don’t go out or do anything, and then missing out on chances to actually go out/do stuff on top of that."

lonely,My former crush is making me open up more to her,"My former crush is making me open up more to her - (This a throwaway)

Let's just call her Mary for this post. In the past, she was my crush for about 5 months each for both first and sixth grades. In first grade, she was real mean to me and would just roll eyes at me when i did so much as ask her a question. In spite of this, i developed her a crush on her. She was just so pretty, had a very nice skin tone and very intelligent that really made up for her attitude towards me. This behavior would gradually wear off until 5th grade where it totally changed and she would actually speak to me now. Granted, half of the words she spoke to me were insults but it was just part of her personality to be a little mean to everyone. None of them really went past banter and it rarely hurt anyone. My crush died out in between first and sixth grades but i still had feelings for her and rarely ever lost hope. Our ""*relationship*"" stayed pretty much the same all throughout the years. For all my life i was a very introverted guy. I rarely ever shared my thoughts with anyone and would only go out if there were things to do for class. Im also painfully shy and would prefer to confide things with the people i have a deep connection with. 

Fast forward to high school, i was more introverted than ever and relationships began to mean something else to me. Mary is best friends with this girl (we'll call her Nars) shell be important. Fast forward to eighth grade still painfully shy and my anxiety begins to develop here. To my utter flippin surprise, Nars confesses her crush to me. For one semester, we were seatmates and she apparently found me to be an introspective and ""deep"" guy. Idk what this would be worth to you guys but this has actually happened before (twice)where my seatmate would develop a crush on me. Anyway, the crush never really materialized into anything and Nars and i just remained acquaintances. Fast forward to 10th grade, where everything heckin changed. For context, our school only offers up to 10th grade so we sadly had to break apart as a class and head to different schools for 11th grade. This was very hard for me to accept. So i though F it lets change it up and do it big this year. I changed everything about myself. I was more outgoing now, less introverted, and would actually like to talk with my close friends now. My anxiety was just as bad but i handled it better now. This is also when i started to actually smile for photos. Fast forward to the last few months of our time together as a class. 

Its senior prom, Nars invites me to hang at their hotel room for some uno and food. Mary is also encouraging me and my friends to go. The next day, they invite us over for breakfast and afterwards, pool time. We have fun at the pool playing games and taking pics and whatnot. Ball really starts rolling for me from this point onwards.

Ive noticed that Mary has also become a lot more ""huggy"" with me and even winking at times. She also wants to spend more time with me in class. I just return her gestures and dont think much of it. Fast forward to the best days of my high school life. Our two magical chats. In both instances she initiated the convo. We got deep about a lot of things here and also got deep into ""nothings"". We shared a passion for history but we also delved into other topics like philosophy, demographics, star wars, relationships. The best parts for me though was when Mary asked me for my ideal girl and said she only qualified for one. The other one was when she compared to mr darcy in ""pride and prejudice"". She is the first one to ever have a chat like that with me. I always give too little in convos out of restraint for what i share. She made it different though and made it her mission to make me less shy around her. She said she'll do this through giving compliments cause i told her i rarely ever get any and would react poorly.

Idc if this leads nowhere or was just born out of wanting to spend every last minute together before the inevitable break up of our class

TL;DR: ex crush makes me ,an introverted guy, feel more confident and be more open with others and unintentionally provokes the best feelings ive ever felt in a long time."

But I did, and I loved him a lot, and I started enjoying things again, healing from the abuse, and I had a partner who was there for me. He's been suffering from double depression for about 12 years. He was very depressed from time to time. And from around October he started losing interest and pushing me away. And that's when the arguments started, he made me scared of losing him, made me feel like I was nothing special for him. I tried to help him so many times, convince him to go to therapy, to take meds. He refused every time, and he just pushed me away.
He broke up with me this wednesday. And I feel like he pulled me with him to the bottom. I haven't been eating really since Wednesday, I haven't been sleeping much either, I just lay in bed and feel horrible. I can't go an hour without crying. I feel like he is the person who has finally managed to break me. And the worst thing about it is that he doesn't care. There's a lot of things that go through my mind but the most persistent thought is that I just want him back. I want to hold him and I want him to love me back, this is the only thing that would help. And he doesn't care anymore. He's been out for 2 days, probably having sex with someone else.

I had ADHD as a child and got in trouble every day in elementary school. I found out a month ago that I was wrongfully placed in classes with autistic children and told I was in “smarter” classes. In middle school, I stopped getting in trouble, so my uneducated parents assumed I had grown out of it. In reality, my adhd was maturing, and I was developing really bad anxiety among other mental health issues. In high school I found an outlet of friends that I poured my heart into, and after my senior year everything went to shit.
I moved in with my best friend ever, Haleigh, in the summer. At the same time, I didn’t attend my older sister’s wedding because none of them had really cared about me in years, so they abandoned me. I continued to hop from friends’ houses for 10 months (not counting semester college dorms). Last summer, I had a date to kill myself, but I was put into therapy by some of my close friends. Haleigh slowly left our friendship behind since she moved several states away. I haven’t talked to her in months. I’ve lost 95% of all of my “wonderful” friends from high school. I have no one anymore that I truly pour myself into. During the day I go to college, talk to a handful of people, then go home and have depressive episodes where I just lie in bed. I am alone.
I don’t want to get help. I want to die. But I’m not going to kill myself because I don’t really feel like it. I see no way out of this and I don’t think anything will ever get better."
lonely,"Not gonna lie, I'm envious of people in relationships","Not gonna lie, I'm envious of people in relationships - 20 M, it's hard living around and seeing a ton of people in relationship, but here I am, alone. I've never had anyone. It sucks. I feel empty, like I can give so much. I feel worthless and pathetic that I've been alive this long and I haven't been with anyone. It's such a shame. What's my worth if I can't even get a date, after trying multiple times, it feels like a giant waste of my time if no girl will even look at a guy such as me. Tbh, I just want someone to hold me. To be proud of me. I'm not getting any younger, I fear I'll never find anyone. I'd rather start over with nothing, cause it feels like my life was a waste and a mistake, someone better than me should've been born instead. I like to imagine when we die, depending on what kind of person you were alive, we dream forever , but bad people only have nightmares forever and good people have dreams. I feel like I'm not afraid to die, but I'm scared of everything else."

It’s hard being in this world alone. I can’t really complain though... I do it to myself. I reject hanging out with people because I find it difficult to connect with them...

I get invited to things all the time... but really I just want someone to hug me and love me and let me cry.

lonely,I have no clue how to actually develop a friendship and suffer from extreme loneliness and sadness.,"I have no clue how to actually develop a friendship and suffer from extreme loneliness and sadness. - Right now, I'm 16, and in a private prep school. It's all-male (I literally have no clue how to interact with women in the most basic of manners, and the last time I've had routine contact with girls was in second grade), and in a different state (not a boarding school, a day school). I have a grand total of 3 friends, and am basically treated like a third (fourth?) wheel by them, and have literally nothing outside of school. No activities and no hobbies. The school swamps me in work, and I get home at 5, so I am constantly sleep-deprived. I have no car, live miles of public transportation, and parents who don't care because they don't seem to understand the importance of having friends. I have quite literally no clue what to do here. I'm going off to college in a year and a half (if I'm even accepted anywhere. The sleep-deprived, swamped-with-work approach means I've sacrificed any remaining happiness or zeal for literally any activity for a C-average when everyone else somehow gets As) and am scared with how I'll cops with being dumped in an environment where I won't know anyone and will have 0 social skills to do anything, all the while being swamped with work. My sister, the person I have the closest actual relationship to, is in college, so I rarely see her, and I basically have no real relationship with my friends beyond ""the people I talk about politics with"". I don't really share interests with them, or anyone for that matter at my very small school, and my parents see no problem with this and shift all the blame on me. At this point, I'm convinced they send me here to feed their own ego. Anyway, on my average day, I won't or can't spend time with anyone and I am extremely sad, anxious, and stressed literally all the time, while at the same time apathetic to my future and any actual activity (with one terrible exception: I absolutely despise all my schoolwork with a shocking passion). I'm sad and lonely on weekdays, and sad and lonely on weekends, and become sad even simply listening to other people describe what they do in their free time with their friends. The one thing in the world I want to do most is transfer to my local public school (they are fantastic in my area), but my parents do not care, and their conservative echo chamber had made them think that literally no one learns anything in public schools and it's all just about indoctrination (completely true about my private school, but they refuse to actually listen to me on anything actually involving my life, because they, 38 years out of high school, think they know exactly what stresses high schools put on their students now). I really don't know how to keep on going here. I'm not suicidal or anything, but at this point, I'm completely hopeless and beaten down."

I have nobody else to go to, my “friends” don’t care and I don’t want to bother my parents with stuff I can’t even explain.
I always seem to fuck up my few good friendships and end up pushing away the people who actually care and I don’t know why I do it or how to stop. And then I always feel annoying and clingy when someone starts listening and at least pretends to care."
lonely,Lonely but it's my fault,"Lonely but it's my fault - Im 19 years old, turning 20 very soon and I've been unhappy ever since I got to college. My entire life I've never been in a big friend group or had more than 1 or 2 close friends and even though I wish I could have made more relationships with people it never really bothered me to much. When I entered highschool I was feeling very similar to how I feel now because when I entered my freshman year of highschool I tied to leave the old me in the past and reinvent myself. However, I didn't stay true to myself and I didn't form any friendships because I wasn't a genuine person. 

My junior and senior year of highschool made a turn for the better when I made a new best friend and became a slight part of a friend group that had been together since freshman year. Because of this I was slightly excluded and so I would just hang out with the one best friend I had. Me and that best friend are still very very close to this day, after 5 years of almost strictly hanging out with one person he's like a brother to me now. We went to the same college and were even roommates together. I had a girlfriend that was a year younger than me who i started dating my senior year of highschool and luckily I went to an in state school so we could spend time together during my freshman year of college. Everything was looking like it was going to play out perfect, and I was happy. 

The first semester of my freshman year was stressful as it is for most freshman. It's a new environment, you're usually not living at home and people are out of their comfort zone. I was fine with living away from home and was even looking forward to being more independent but as I was trying to make friends and meet new people in this crucial stage of social development my girlfriend got involved. She wouldn't get a text from me for a few hours and freak out at me because I wasn't texting her or because I was talking to /hanging out with other girls. At the time I had no reason to stop dating her and was not looking at other females romantically. Constantly I was being pestered about where I was and what I was doing instead of just living in the moment and for my whole first semester and even my second semester I was bogged down with thoughts of how my actions could be negatively impacting someone I loved. 

I didn't make any new friends my first semester and I was feeling desperate. I was lonely and even though I loved living with my best friend, my gf and him were the only two people I really engaged with for around 6 months. They suggested I rush a fraternity, which I did not plan on doing on my way into college. I thought frats were all about being an asshole, drinking until you vomit, and boasting about what girls your hooking up with. But, the rush events for one frat convinced me that it was more about a group of friends and a group of people, who would party of course, but primarily be there as a group of young men to support you in times of despair and rejoice with you in times of happiness. That was really what I had been looking for my whole life, a group of friends.

I got in and went through the rushing process and made friends with 2 or 3 of the pledges in my class. For some reason I found it difficult to get to know the older members. Maybe they intimidated me, maybe I was worried I wouldn't really be accepted, but part of me convinced myself that I didn't want to tang out with them because I didn't want to become like them because to me, they were the stereotypical frat kid, even though I hardly knew them. Because of this, after my semester of pledging, I left for summer break only having 1 new friend who I could talk to regularly. 

I spent time with my girlfriend that summer and I slowly started to resent her. I blamed my lack of relationships on her presence in my life and by the time I got back to school the net year, I broke up with her. It was one of the most difficult experiences of my life. For the two years we had been dating, I gradually felt like I had lost pieces of myself from my highschool days and by the time i was a sophomore in college I realized that I wasn't the same person I used to be and I wasn't the happy person I used to be. I don't know if it was her shaming me for trying to do funny things that weren't funny to her or if it was me trying to change to try to reinvent myself again like I did when I entered highschool and so I decide that I needed to be alone and reevaluate my sense of self and my life in general.

Being single again was so weird to me. I had planned on marrying this girl. I had conditioned myself to stop looking at other girls almost entirely. And now I had little to no friendships with people on campus. I tried to engage more with my fraternity as I was now a full member and was no longer pledging but parties just weren't really my thing. I came to learn that the whole greek life at my school was much more similar to what I had initially thought of it was as I was coming into college. Maybe I didn't invest myself enough into it to get to that point where it was  one big friend group but I was afraid that if I did, I would become someone that I didn't want to be. So, I spent the next semester in a deep depression, alone and without the person who I used to love with all my heart. I just felt empty. 

I didn't do well in school that semester and because of that my parents pulled me out and told me that I needed to take a leave of absence because I ""obviously wasn't ready for college"" So here I am sitting at my computer in my parents house just got off my shift working at a restaurant, alone. I feel like my best friend has already heard enough about my problems as well as my family and I just don't know what to do with myself. I'm depressed, lonely, and confused about my future and my own self identity. Maybe I should have gone to a school where greek life wasn't so ingrained in the social ecosystem. Maybe I should have gone to school in the city instead of a small college town. Maybe I should have gone to school somewhere far from home so that I could go off on my own, away from my past friends and girlfriend and find myself. But now I'm stuck at home working a 9-5 with no friends and little to no happiness."

Sometimes I feel like you want to or could, but you’re scared to admit it.

Why can’t we just be honest with each other?

I care about you and you and I talk about the future so much together. Why can’t we just be closer and not worry about what everyone else thinks? 

Why do you waste your time dancing around the issue? You tell me you love me but that you aren’t good at expressing it? I’ll take it as slowly as you want. We don’t have to rush anything, I have all the time in the world for you. But I can’t keep waiting forever. It drains me and pains me inside. 

I miss you when you’re not around. I feel like one day we will drift a part and we will never get to share those moments with each other.

We’ve watched the sun set a thousand times and all I’ve just wanted to do in those moments is put my arm around you and tell you that you mean the world to me. You mean everything to me. 

We get one shot at life. Why are you so afraid to love me back? 

Why are we both denying our happiness?

Should I just move on and let you drift away? I feel sometimes I should just move on. But something keeps dragging me back. I love you."
lonely,I hope that someday lonely single mums/ widows will find their missing rib. Happiness is free!,"I hope that someday lonely single mums/ widows will find their missing rib. Happiness is free! - I get it once you turn 30+ life starts to go down hill. I don’t think it should be this way. I think it’s the best time to put to good use all that we have learned while growing up and make the best of our lives with it. Such experience will help us to navigate and form a stronger bond and create wonderful families, the world need one. Coming from my emotional and empathetic heart I guess I am what most people would term as being “naive” just so we are clear I don’t care what people think of me being naive and all. But I do care that I don’t go stepping on toes or hurting anyone. That being said. I hope those of us who genuinely wish to start a good relationship and ready to invest our time, care and energy into it will actually find a good match. 

Sadly there are no happy ever afters but only in the movies. Good news is we can create a good relationship as long as we share and let each other know our flaws. I think that’s where the mistakes happen, when couples start pretending they are always right even when they hurt at each other or behave badly towards each other in public. 

When partners don’t know where to draw the line if a random girl/guy decided to dance and flirt with the girl/guy not saying it’s completely bad but if the partner happens to return the favour and clearly intends to take it to the next level right in front of the other partner then that’s the red flag. Happened to me once and I simply walked out of the toxic relationship. Because I tried to explain to my partner that there are boundaries in every relationship clearly I am jealous but that’s only because I don’t want to lose him. I calmly tried to explain how I felt and how he left me seated throughout the evening alone. Instead of reasoning with me he played the victim card and claimed I was too jelous to let him enjoy a harmless evening. Same lady later called him and they started chatting, that did it for me. 

I left him and never looked back. I am still optimistic that I will meet someone special someday. I shared my story because you should never let your past stop you from meeting your missing rib. 

Good luck!!"

lonely,I didn’t realize how affection deprived I was until someone finally gave me a hug,"I didn’t realize how affection deprived I was until someone finally gave me a hug - I’m an empathetic person. The school I go to informed all its students that a peer of ours had committed suicide over the previous weekend. I didn’t know this person or even recognize their name. Being someone that has dealt with people i know losing their life for that reason, it really hit me hard. I got a rush of sadness and anger for the kids family and friends, for him, and it brought back the memories of when the people I knew personally losing their lives to suicide. 

I started to cry and one of my friends (who I’ve never touched or seen her touch anyone, she hates contact and it makes her very uncomfortable) asked if I needed a hug. She gave me a long tight hug and I cried on her shoulder. I haven’t been hugged like that since I was very young. No one even offered me a hug when my grandmother died. 

I guess what I’m saying with all of this is that I don’t want anyone else to loose their life or a loved ones life to suicide. And it’s important to give people hugs, such a little thing made me feel better. I wish I could get more of those hugs, those tight heartfelt ones."
lonely,I never want to love again (Rant),"I never want to love again (Rant) - So, long story. About four months ago, I lost one of my best friends I've ever had in my life. I'll call her Hailey. We met on OkCupid and me and her got along pretty well. We both had similar tastes in video games, music, humour, ect. We also were pretty alike in that we were both pretty emotional people. You see, she had Generalized anxiety and I have mild autism or Aspergers, so we connected on an emotional level too. We would spend hours just talking over discord, or hanging out at eachothers houses, and so on. It didn't take long for me to fall in love with her. She just seemed like a good match for me, she was funny, smart, silly, multi-talented, caring, and really adorable. We were only friends for three months but those three months were the happiest I had been in years. 

Anyway, so two months in I told Hailey I liked her and she agreed to go on a date with me. We went to a resturant and over dinner I told her how about my feelings for her and she said to me she needed more time to warm up to me because this was the first time she ever tried dating. So as the night went on  wewere talking and at some point the conversation went to the topic of being isolated/lonely. I told her about my experience with being isolated when I got suspended in highschool for attempting to commit suicide that was spurred on by a girl I liked at the time. I told her how dumb I felt about doing it and how I wish I never did becuase it nearly ruined my life. A few days later I got a call from her on discord and she was crying and she said she was scared about the things I told her and was worried that I was going to hurt her. I assured her that I wasn't like that anymore, it happened a long time ago and I have since moved on and tried to better myself as a person. She calmed down and I things were better after that.

A few weeks go by and I had arranged for me, Hailey, her brother, and my friend that I graduated with from highscool, who I will call Sage, and Sage's sister to all hang out with eachother at the mall. We hung out for a few hours and it was time for Sage and her sister to go. I went in to give her a friendly hug goodbye but she didn't want to accept it and reacted negatively. She reluctantly accepeted and they left. Realizing the mistake I had made, a wash of embarssment and guilt overcame me. Hailey and her brother saw the whole thing. I didn't say anything because I felt there was no way they would believe me if I tried to explain my actions. I didn't even know myself why I did what I did, other than it was an honest to god mistake and impulsive action on my part. I talked to Sage about it later and I apologized for not respecting her personal space and promised her I wouldn't do anything like that ever again and she forgave me and said it was okay. 

A week goes by and during that week, Hailey went on vacation and she had just came back. She called me up and told me she just wanted to be friends. She said she wasn't feeling it and she wanted to see other people. I asked her if it was because of something I did and she said no. At this time, it hadn't occured to me that it could have been about what happened at the mall with Sage, so I never asked. After she was done talking, I felt really upset. I was still heavily in love with her, so I asked my mom for help. She said that she thought I should just leave her be and continue being friends with her and maybe some day she would change her mind. I took her advice and for a month, everything seemed to be okay. We would still hang out regularly, and talk to eachother over discord. 

The last time I saw her was in early October. I had came over to her house and we were having a pretty good time together. We were playing video games and I looked over at her and she looked sad. I asked her what was wrong and she said she just wasn't feeling good and it didn't have to do with me. We went upstairs to eat lunch and over lunch I asked her if she would be okay with having a sleepover with me at her place one day. (Sidenote: While I wasn't interested in having sex with her, she did not know this.) At first, she said she was okay with it, but then she started crying. She said, ""I feel like you are waiting for me to change my mind."" and ""I think that you think if I can't have her, no one else will."" I said that I was sorry for asking about the whole sleepover thing, I didn't seriously mean anything by it and I would never hurt her. She said ""I don't want to exist"" and went into the bathroom to cry. Her brother came upstairs and went to Hailey to comfort her. He somehow managed to cheer her up by making her laugh. I went over to apologize and she said that she wasn't sure if she wanted to be friends anymore. I said ""I think I should just go home."" of which her brother agreed. Before leaving I pulled her brother aside and I asked him if Hailey was okay and that I was scared that this was the end of our friendship. He told me she just needed a break.

So I went home, and a few days later I remembered how Hailey has said she didn't want to exist. She had once before expressed suicidal thoughts to me before, but at the time she said she didn't really mean it. Worried that she was going to hurt herself, I messaged her on discord to make sure she was okay. She said she was fine. Then as I was about to go she said she didn't want to be friends anymore and there was nothing I could do about it. I apologized and I pleaded with her not to leave but she said she was done. She said she was scared I was going to come to her house or her work and hurt her but I told her I would never do such a thing. Not wanting the friendship to end, I called her on the phone and desperatly tried to beg her not to leave. ""Don't beg!"" she yelled at me. ""Okay! Okay! Okay!"" I said to her, not wanting her to get angry. She said ""I just don't think we click, and I'm sorry for being that bitch, but I'm done."" I hung up the phone and and went into my room where I cried for hours. 

Realizing that this was all my fault, I went to seek therapy. I found a therapist and I told her everything that happened. She said she didn't think it was my fault and she thought that Hailey might have some problems of her own. I continued to see her for a two months and I eventually cracked under the immense guilt and loneliness of not having Hailey in my life. So I considered trying to reconnect with her. I messaged her on discord and told her I really missed her and was sorry for scaring her. I told her I just wanted to talk to her about being friends again. She told me she wasn't in a good state, so I said that I hoped she'd feel better soon, not wanting to bother her now. I waited about a week before talking to her again. She said she still didn't really feel like talking, so I asked if we could some other time. She replied that she still didn't really want to be friends. I asked her if she could tell me why she didn't want to be friends and she said ""I don't know, I thought I had explained myself well enough."" she also said ""I really thought this was over and done with."" I told her I didn't understand at all because she never elaborated beyond ""We don't click"" or ""I'm just not feeling it."". I said I didn't want much, I just wanted to know the truth. ""I don't like you, that's the truth."" ""Why?"" ""Because you don't respect my boundaries and I tell you I don't want to talk to you yet you keep contacting me."" Realizing there was nothing anymore I could say, I deleted my account. 

It's been two months since then. I thought I was feeling like I was moving on but recently I started feeling really upset and missing her again. I know there's nothing I can do about it and I do respect her wishes but I still can't get her out of my head. No matter how I distract myself or try to talk to people about it memories of the good times I spent with her keep coming back and it's killing me. I feel like this was nobody's fault but mine because I fucked up everything by coming across as a creepy asshole. Had I never told her about my past, and didn't mix my old friend Sage with her this never would have happened. I wish I could just erase Hailey from my mind so I didn't have to suffer anymore. Now I don't even want to deal with relationships anymore because I know I'll just screw them up in the end. All I ever wanted was to love and to be loved, but I feel like I will never attain that because people will immediatly think I am creepy and untrustworthy though I swear I'm not. I never want to hurt anyone. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to be a better person but I don't even know where to start.
**TL;DR I had a good thing going with a friend and I fucked it up by making myself look creepy**"

Is that so much to ask?"
lonely,My friends ditched me,My friends ditched me - I just lost one of my only friends after blurting out his ex crush. He now hates me and I am so lonely at school. What can I do?
lonely,I've never felt more alone in the past year,"I've never felt more alone in the past year - I don't know where this belongs.

I've lived with my parents for 19 years, their marriage was falling apart and my dad moved back to the US. I live in England. Both my parents have always been the kindest, most supportive parents I could've ever asked for. After my dad left, and some time before, my mom was seeing someone else. It's escalated to the point where she is never home, she never checks on me to see how I'm doing. Asks if I'm OK. From daily texts to nothing, gone for weeks at a time. She decided to spend Christmas, 2 weeks, the first Christmas without my dad, away with the other man and his family and friends telling me until 7 days beforehand so I had to spend Christmas alone. To have my own mom choose a man she's known for a few months to spend the whole of Christmas with over me hurt. It's the ultimate rejection. He always comes first now, never me. Not even a text. I had planned for us to have our own time together, make our own Christmas Dinner and relax. She always had this plan but never told me until a week before, too late to visit my dad and after I made all the plans. 

My aunt, on my mom's side, stays in the house when she is away as I live at uni. Before my aunt was round, and in summer, my mom would leave and say she would be back in 5 days, which often turned to 14. My aunt has made ""rules"" that I can't come to my own home without letting her know fiest, she's redecorated everything and moved all of my stuff around. If I go when she's there she treats me as if I'm the guest. Home is the one place I needed to be the same after my dad left and when uni gets too much, because even if mom isn't there it's so comforting but that's been taken away now. It doesn't feel like home anymore, like i don't have one. Uni halls isn't home. All the comforts that have been there for years have gone, everything my dad left in a particular way she has moved. It hurts. My mom's family don't care about me either, I'm a means to an end if they need anything. 

I have no friends. Basically. There's people I socialise with but I'm never included in anything. I'm just there when I'm there.

I've been dating someone since July. However I am always the one to make the effort. I wait on him, I organise seeing him and spend the money and time I don't have. I've been locked outside his house for 40 mins late at night because he never comes when he says he does. He doesn't have consideration for me. I always try and make time for him, whereas he just kind of sees me when he's got the odd time free, never makes it like i do.
Recently I tried something, since I'm always the one to ask ""What time are you free? When do you want me down? When is good for you?"" I stopped. I then didn't see him for 3 weekends because he never asked. One day after he seemed annoyed I didn't come, i simply said ""you didn't ask me"" and he replied with ""well you didn't ask/message me"". He never asks how I am. How university is. If I'm ok. I've put in so much effort because spending time with him usually outweighs this, I would get to his house at 10:30pm cause he would be busy, and leave by 6:30am the next day after he wants to stay up until 12/1 just to get to uni for 9am. Those few hours would be so worth it, but I feel like he never appreciated it so I stopped. I switched my phone on airplane mode because I didn't want anyone to message me or talk to anyone, so he couldn't get through. He asked me why and I replied i was upset and wanted to be alone, his response ""no worries"" and put the phone down. Didn't ask why. Still hasn't. 

The only person in all of this, that cares is my dad. He texts me every other day, asking how my day is going, how I am, wants to call and text me. He would do anything to see me and genuinely cares. Yet he's nearly 5000 miles away. If I call him at 6am his time he answers. Or 3am. If I need anything he is so happy to talk to me and always makes time. I miss him more than anything, through all of this he's been the only one to actually care about me and he's so far away.

I don't have a safe space to get away, my home is taken from me and I feel unwelcomed, my mom hardly texts me. I have no friends at university, my own boyfriend who I enjoy the company of, and he says the same, has no respect or consideration for me."

They’re not coming back and I have no idea what I’m going to do. At this point I wish that I could simply not exist. I really have no idea how I’m going to cope especially with several big changes that are going to be occurring in my life over the coming months along with what may be a very serious surgery.

Meaning i was just left with my mum in the country. None of my friends remembered that it was my birthday today.. I feel so unwanted, like this proves to me that no-one wants me here."

I am so unhappy. 

Two years ago I experienced a traumatic event that caused me to be dismissed from my college, lose a bunch of friends, and basically just scarred. My best friend that I thought would be there for life, couldn’t handle my ptsd and took many of my remaining friends with her. I have two friends, and we don’t talk regularly. 

I go to this college that I despise in a small town that literally has nothing. I don’t know if I’m ever graduating, so far I’m on my 5th year of school. I don’t like the type of people who go to my college, it’s a big party school, but I’ve found a few people I don’t mind. I’m just too scared to make friends, and I hate being reminded of the college experience that was torn away from me. So I don’t want college friends, but consequently that means I have no friends.

I do have my boyfriend and my cats, but everyone has been distant from me. 

So here I am alone In a small town in the middle of nowhere and I despite it all."

Doesn't help that two of my friends,  and , are in a relationship together. I love them both, but seeing them together just makes me realise how much I crave something like that. I fucking crave having a SO to hug, a girl I can hold hands with and just be with. I feel like when I talk irl, I'm just an annoyance and a burden.

lonely,Tired of being a sex object!,"Tired of being a sex object! - I’m actually taking a break from dating because it seems like every girl I encounter only wants me for one thing. &amp; I know for some people that’s cool but not for me, in my opinion sex is pointless if you don’t have true feelings for the person. Anyways I’m 35M and I’ve never even had a real girlfriend. Every girl I was in love with only felt lust for me and treated me like crap and the one girl who didn’t turned out to be married with 3 children.
It actually makes me pretty sad that women only see me as some kind of sex object, it makes me feel like I don’t really matter or something like that. I have a great personality and fairly good looking and can hold decent conversations but every time I meet someone and I think it’s going great BOOM...... he wants to fuck. Like do I have Manwhore or something written on my head.
How can I get someone to genuinely interested in me... /:"
lonely,Lonely 1st year,"Lonely 1st year - Im a first year student at university and ive never felt more alone. My current resident  is a single room and shared common areas.

I really dont have any friends, i go out (sometimes) to the dining hall and eat by myself and watch youtube or something. It really bugs me seeing all the other first years making so many friends and seeming to already find their 'group' while im all alone. Ive really pushed myself to be outgoing and ive tried to make friends but they all just seem disinterested when talking to me. Id say im a nice person and definitely on the shy side but i dont think thats a major factor. I feel embarrassed when my family asks if ive made any friends, they all have told me how fun uni is but i cant even seem to make friends. I feel like im wasting away in my room while everyone has fun. I also feel like now its 3 more months until my second year, and everyone has their groups that i should just give up now."

Like at all, no kiss, no hugs, and I'm broke right now so I cant even get another lap dance. And I'll never be able to have sex. It all feels weird and hard to deal with. She was so hot. And she acted interested in me, because you know, paid to, but its fucking my brain up, I actually cant stop thinking about it. What do I do?

I don’t have many friends, i don’t dress up for spirit days, i don’t get to sit in the pep section for football and basketball games. i don’t get to go to highschool parties or take part in the fun traditions my school has. i don’t get to have one of those favorite teachers who love me and let me talk to them and hang around all the time. i don’t get to do sports and be good at it. i don’t hang around the popular group. i hate high school while the popular group are all having the time of their lives. it’s not fair anymore, but life isn’t fair sometimes. it’s stupid but does anyone else feel like they are missing out?"
lonely,I'm just feel needy at the moment.,"I'm just feel needy at the moment. - I'm feeling for some human to human contact. Someone to physically be here with me or just someone to chat too. I'm trying to distract myself with my assignments but I can shake the feeling that I need someone to talk to. We can chat about anything I don't mind. I just... want to feel like no matter how boring the day is, I can be someone to just casually converse with. 

I sometimes wonder too ""hmm, am I actually that boring? Do you actually want to be that disconnected from me? Is it too much if I ask for you to share details about your day?"" I probably ask for too much. And if I don't ask then I won't know and we won't chat about anything......... ""long distance"" relationships without a vehicle between us is tough :/ 

I think I just want someone who wants my presence always, regardless if we're seeing face to face or over the phone. Maybe I do ask for too much or maybe I don't ask for enough. I don't know. I guess I just need friends.. ha. If the friends I had were actually genuine and trustworthy and chill and not a bunch toxic babies, maybe I won't feel as lonely as I am.

I don't even need any more hobbies than I already have. I just need pure human love and connection."
lonely,"Next week I’ll be turning 18. I’ll be alone, again","Next week I’ll be turning 18. I’ll be alone, again - Hey friends, as title says on the 26th I’ll be 18. Nobody will really care too much, which for the most part I’m fine with but man I’m so fucking tired of being alone.

I have close family which I’m grateful for, don’t get me wrong but sometimes I feel distant from them. My big brother would usually be there for me but he’s got a girlfriend now and I hardly see him.

As for friends, I *have* friends, but they never really interact with me outside of being in a group chat for memes or the occasional night of playing Xbox. They don’t invite me out, talk to me or anything. I’ve known them for like 5 years or more but since I left school a year early and they’re still in I never see them anymore.

I asked them to go to a party a few months back and I *thought* it was a good time and they’d start inviting me but since then I haven’t been invited once. I don’t want to keep asking them if I can come because if they wanted me there, they would invite me.

It hurts when they discuss plans when I’m there and I ask about it and they change subjects. I know what you’re thinking reading this. Why am I still friends with them? They’re the only people I have and it’s a small town so there’s nobody new to meet.

Also I suffer from anxiety pretty badly and it caused me to leave my job. I’m in a dark place right now and somehow keep on managing to hit a new low it seems. I regret a lot of my decisions involving school. Mainly not going but I was *far* too depressed to keep going regularly without breaking down. As a guy it’s hard to open up, as I’m sure many if you know. I bottled everything up and pretended to be physically ill when in reality I was mentally ill.

Lastly, for everyone else who spends their birthdays, new years or even just your weekends alone. I’m alone too and feel your pain, so do many others. 

Sorry of this got off topic but this is the first time I’ve let it all out. In conclusion I guess being lonely and miserable while everyone else my age is living life and having fun like most other teenagers are supposed to be doing has taken it’s toll on me.

I hope I don’t sound ungrateful because I know others have it much worse. For what its worth, I send my virtual hugs to everyone who reads this and thanks for your time, it truly means the world. **&lt;3**"

But sometimes I just don’t feel real and feel like I have to do things just because. Like I broke up with my girlfriend about 6 months ago because it felt like I had. We had a very healthy relationship and I really loved her and I would do anything to go back and change what happened but I just pushed her away. I don’t understand why other than the fact that I remember how i felt, it seemed like I just had to push her away. I see myself as a pretty logical person and I have no clue why I did it- it seems so strange to me. In general I have a couple people I’m friendly with but I never really get close to them. I just miss what I had with her, but she’s moved on and that’s okay. Anyway I just feel like somethings broken about me and it’s so frustrating because I know somethings wrong but I don’t understand it at all. Any help would be appreciated- thanks for reading :)"

So I really am just insanely lonely, like I really don’t have any actual friends if I’m completely honest, like I speak to people on message occasionally but if I ask to meet they tend to shut me out immediately, it just really drives me into my already quite bad mental health state, like am I not good enough or worth your time? It’s been this way for probably 2/3 years now n I’m really starting to dislike myself. It’s insanely difficult to meet new people when your anxiety constantly gets in the way and makes u feel worthless. I used to look forward to weekends and now I’d rather just work cause at least I won’t be alone..

lonely,"The first time I've been approached in months, is strangers wanting to fight me.","The first time I've been approached in months, is strangers wanting to fight me. - I was driving to pick up a curry from a curry house and needed to park on the side of a road where it is indented. Three people were standing where I'd like to park instead of the perfectly good pavement. There was a man and woman (maybe 30s) and another man (maybe 20s). 

I gestured with my finger for them to move and they did so. I had the radio on at the time and heard some shouting, but just assumed that they were drunk and shouting at people across the other side of the street. I muted the radio and then realise that they were shouting at me "" oi mush. Get out of the fucking car"" etc lol. 

I got out of the car and walker off towards the curry house. They continuted to shout stuff like ""come back here"" very loudly,  but I can't remember exactly what. They might've followed me a bit but they disappeared and I'm pleasantly surprised that they didnt vandalised my car. 

I wouldn't say I was that scared, but I feel like I've lost some of my innocence at 19 as nothing like that has ever happened to me before."

lonely,Diary of a 17 year old,"Diary of a 17 year old - Poem, cause pain can be hard to express. Sorry about formating.


Diary of a 17 year old:


I'm an ugly girl
But I still feel
I have heart 
I gave it to you
You took and abuse
Why you gone do that
Was it easy cause
I'm ugly?


There's so many of me
Coming out the factory line 
Dumped cause we didn't cut it
Didn't look perfect
It's what inside that counts
but I'm full junk and need
What does that say about me?


The negative news, the violence
I don't want to be compliant, I don't want any part of this, and I still get Depression, they misunderstand, and put me in detention...


Please stop the desensitization 
What is this acceptance of cruelty 
Like it's normal, it's normal to be a cannibal, sounds crazy, but I think they want to eat me alive


So I won't pretend I have a healthy mind
I came from a ""Broken Home""
And I got ""Daddy Issues""
You must have love that
Use that to your advantage 
Buttering me up 
Tell yourself I'm easy and ""she just want to please, she just want to be accepted"", so of course I'm easy to be taken for granted



It's not right but is whats said
A girl like me is only good for bed
And that's all my self worth 
It lies in if I give good head
Isn't that f*cked up in the head?
I got to undress, no doesn't matter if I can address important issues, if I got something to say, when the pretty girls ignore you, I'm the one you come to

Nothing against pretty girls
I think Men and Boys do to ugly girls what they want to do to pretty girls 
Do it to us first, cause they're more likely to get away with it, yeah more likely to get away with it, less guilt if your bros agree with it

I know it's not just me
Feeling dejected and lonely
Yeah not worthy
And very empty

You expect me to love me, but you point out my flaws, and go on say it's my fault, then gaslight, say I heard wrong 

So I'm a Ugly girl
But least I'm not a Monster
So I'm Ugly, and you gonna wanna use me, but had enough of Monsters

Yeah I might stand alone in the mirror
But least I can think clearer...

Hurts like hell to heal
Easier to say you're a loser who keeps losing than believing and hoping
It hurts like hell to heal, doesn't mean you shouldn't 

Called ugly all my life
And I just want to own it
If you don't like my butter face
Then that's why they say, kiss my ass"
lonely,I spend mostly every day by myself,"I spend mostly every day by myself - I'm a 21 year old guy. I'm getting my bachelors degree online. I work part time which is only a few hours a week where the only person I talk to is my senior citizen boss. I have 1 friend who lives at her campus so we hardly talk other than occasional text but nothing of substance. I had a girlfriend who lived long distance on and off for 6+ years, but we decided to fully end it at the end of 2019. We hardly talk now. I live at home with my parents and older sister - but I am mostly alone. I work either early mornings or late evenings so most of the day, I'm by myself, in my room, either doing school work or playing video games. I talk to my parents at dinner but that's basically it. I just feel so alone. It feels like if everyone I knew went on a trip for a month, my life would hardly change. I just feel very lonely - hence why I'm here. If anyone is looking for a friend, feel free to contact me."
lonely,Returning here after 4 months,"Returning here after 4 months - Yeah I was a lonely person, been like that for most of my life. I used to interact with people here and find solace in this sub.

But 4 months ago, I found a girl. We knew each other for sometime, we talked, and fell in love. We were dating. It mostly went well.

Until yesterday. We had a few fights here and there, which is kinda normal for every couple, but yesterday, she said that it was a ""mistake"" on her part being with me. That really hurt. She followed it up by telling me that she wouldn't care about if I ignore her or anything. 

We didn't formally break up, but it seems inevitable now. So here is to the long lonely nights again. I return here, hope you guys have been doing well"
lonely,Question.,"Question. - My boyfriend [35] of 8 years confessed something to me [35] last August and it completely broke my heart. I've cried so hard on and off for months. Only recently have I been feeling numb and lonely to the point of now actually being bored.

I don't know what to do with myself. I think I've fallen out of love with him. I'm not sure what I feel or what to think. I feel like I'm forcing myself to post about it now when I rather sit in a room alone in silence.

Is this some kind of shock? Is there some way I can snap out of this? 

I have no friends and no family. So it's not like I have social options to distract myself from it."
lonely,"First post on this subreddit, sorry if it is too depressing.","First post on this subreddit, sorry if it is too depressing. - Hello everyone! I've been looking at this subreddit for quite awhile and I decided to finally post something.

It's been a pretty rough couple of months. Sorry if this post is all over the place because i really don't know where to start. 

So to keep things short I had a really good friend and we were basically like sisters. We would talk every single day. She would call me and we would talk for hours, we would never run out of things to talk about. I have never had that in my life and it honestly felt so amazing to have a friend like that.

So fast forward awhile later and something was said to me by her that was really hurtful. I told her how it made me feel and she felt REALLY BAD but she is no longer in my life because of it. She just won't talk to me anymore at all. I tried reaching out to her through text and she did text me back but it was very short and that was it. We still see each other at work and we just smile but that's about it. It...really hurts. It didn't really affect me the first month because I felt like I was better off but I really miss that. I never had that in my life and I always felt like I was everyone's second choice.

 I really like this girl who has a girlfriend who is beyond beautiful.  I have known this girl for 3 years and we met at my old work. We have everything in common and talk basically all the time still but I know deep down inside I will never be able to hold her or get closer with her. It honestly bugs me and it's crazy how much we both have in common. 

I tried dating this girl a month ago and things were going pretty well. She would flirt with me, she would tell me how much she liked me and how cute I was. So we met up and it went pretty well (so I thought) until after the date she didn't talk to me and i asked her what we were and she lied to me at first saying ""i just want to take things slow."" I was 100% okay with that and literally right after she's like ""actually I'm seeing someone else and i really like her."" I honestly was so crushed. I was upset the whole day but of course got over it eventually. 

I am not happy with my job and my boss is leaving. My boss and I had such a strong meaningful connection. We would always talk about everything and he always seemed to enjoy my presence. He would always tell us how much he loved working in this building so It was a bit of a shock for him to leave like that. I was really shocked and I actually cried because of it since I never really had any meaningful connections with men before. 

So, yeah. I never really thought about all the shit that has been happening to me lately and thought it was appropriate to share it here. 

I guess what I'm saying is I wouldn't consider myself ""a loner"" or ""someone who has no friends"" because i do hang out every once in awhile and I wouldn't say I'm unattractive because I seem to get hit on constantly. But what I do seem to lack in my life is ""intimacy."" I feel like I'm nobody's reason to smile on a gloomy day, I feel like I'm never anybody's first choice, and I always feel like I'm so replaceable. It's been like this my whole life and I honestly think I'm forming a depression because of it. I have also been hurt so many times in the past which I'm not going to get into. 


So if you read this far thank you so much. It really means a lot and I wish all of you on here the best in life because I'm sure you all deserve it."
lonely,My boring story,"My boring story - Hello dear readers,

This is my story. It is not written professionally, it is not written by someone sober, as I can't write this with clear head, hell english is not my first or even second language so be prepared for spelling mistakes and all. I don't want sympathy, I don't want you to feel bad for me, I don't want people to think that I am whining. I just want to tell my story and get it off my shoulders. That being said, if I can somehow help one person somewhere in this wast world, I would be happy, but again, I have no expectations from this. How about I stop this bull\*\*\*\* and get on with the story?

&amp;#x200B;

It all began in 1993 post soviet country. I will not mention which one specifically, because I don't want people to know who I am. Mere days after I've been born I was given a shot of some vaccine (standard procedure), that's where it should have ended, but I would not have mentioned it if that was it. Needle was dirty, I have got blood infection. Spoiler alert, I have survived. Got a blood transfusion from a lovely lady and to my family's relief everything went well. Couple uneventful years later and I have reached the age of 5. Amazing time in my life to be honest. I was a little c\*\*t, just like any normal kid. I remember only a few things from that time of my life. I remember my dad (great person, got nothing bad to say about him), taking me to a park for some cycling, me, being little useless person, being too slow even for my age, managed to piss him off by also going for waffles (home made ones) instead of getting ready. To be fair, he did everything right, he was pushing me to be better, as any father should. He left, to go to the park without me (at least that's how I remember it) and I was left alone in the flat crying. At least I thought so. My mum was there, she actually took a photo of me, laying on a sofa in a living room, crying with a waffle in my hands. Now I look at it and laugh. It's actually funny.

&amp;#x200B;

Another incident I remember is not as detailed as previous one. I was riding my bike, with training wheels in previously mention park, when I've stumbled upon outdoor basketball court. Me being a little boy,  I have decided to go there, because there were some big boys (probably late teens) playing basketball (big surprise I know). While there I have noticed a pot hole. It seemed as an ordinary, shallow pothole filled with rainwater. Of course, just my luck, when I was riding over it (what kid wouldn't) reality proved my wrong. It was deep. I mean I went all in, I was underwater and stuck.  I remember everything, but I do not remember panicking, even when fully submerged and unable to move or breathe. Thankfully boys that were playing nearby, got me out of there (I won't lie, I don't know how long was I underwater). Mere seconds later my father was there to check up on me. I was fine, nothing more than wet clothes. My dad, comforted me and was proud that I was calm throughout the whole thing. He said that not loosing my head and thinking clearly in danger makes a man. Those words somewhat stuck with me. They did help me become man I am today.

Main points- life long depression, quarter life crisis, dropped out of my postgrad, long term girlfriend left me, rehab, loads of medication. 

I’ve spent about 2 years very isolated, living with my parents, trying to get back on my feet. I think the worst of it is over, now it’s just finding a career, making new friends- which is a little hard. I live with my parents in an old age community in a tiny town, which is very lonely and isolating. I turn 27 tomorrow, and all I can think about is how depression has robbed me of the joys of my best years, and left me broken down and alone. It’s tough to watch my brothers and friends lead such rich lives. I know I’m still young, but I somehow lost those magic years in your 20s where you go out into the world, meet loads of people, make friends, have a great time. 
It feels like 30 is this benchmark where you have your shit together, or at least have a plan. It feels like that’s just around the corner."

lonely,I'm tired of caring about people more than they care about me.,"I'm tired of caring about people more than they care about me. - I have a coworker that I would love to be friends with outside of work.  We have similar interests and a similar sense of humor and we get along great.  I always enjoy working with him.  And I've been trying really hard to make friends, which is super difficult for me.  So for his birthday I drew him a little birthday message (I enjoy handlettering/calligraphy as a hobby).  Granted, I didn't spend that much time on it, but I did put my heart into it and liked the end result.  I wouldn't go out of my way to draw a birthday message for just anyone, I'd only really do it for real friends to show I care.  I sent it to him and he just ""liked"" it with no other response.  Saw him at work today and he didn't say anything about it.  

I know it's probably not personal.  He probably saw it and thought ""oh cool"" and then forgot about it.  But I'm so sensitive to this kind of thing.  It's happened time and time again that I will put tons of effort into a friendship and receive a disappointing or hurtful response in return.  It feels like rejection.  A former best friend of mine was asked by our mutual friend to rate his love for me on a scale of 1-10.  He gave me a score of 4, and gave the boy he had a crush on a score of 10.  I've kept that 4 with me and I will always feel like a 4/10.  Like nobody will ever care more than a 4/10.  

Every time I have a friend or a romantic interest, I ALWAYS care more about them than they care about me.  The only true connections I've had with others did not last long because they people abandoned me.  I'm a 26-year-old woman and have never been in a relationship.  I don't feel that I have any true friends.  Last year hardly anyone remembered my birthday and I spent the day alone.  

I'm tired of this.  I'm tired of being so alone.  All I do is whine on the internet about my problems and it drives everyone away.  But I just want someone to hear me."

(Disclaimer I'm not native english, so please just don't really take my grammer for "" granted"" I just really need to share this and had it way to long on my mind and I just need to get this on paper...)

I'm an INFJ and constantly loosing my self over my own thougheds due insecurens and fear of rejection, as I suppose this all started as I moved with my mother in a completely different locaiton of my country . As so my mother got into a view Abusiv relationsships (partners) trough out  her early 30's (and also my childhood obv.) So it all went down hill after we moved and I didn'T even knew what happend till a few years later ( 10+ years or so ) , I just lived somewhere I wasn't present at all, Kinda creating my own little imagination world in my head that I couldn'T really leave no more....  

So as I moved from one to another location ,where they also had a different style of speaking (like word pronouncination) and ofc how kids can be ,I was bullied for beeing the ""guy from the outside"" , got hit, pranked and abused (in a sence of ,oh a ""nice guy lets see how far we can go to take advanteg of his kindness"" thingy )...  This went on like 6 years befor I even relaised what they did becouse I thoughed that that was prefectly normal indeed or lets just say I slowly ""woke up"" (I'm hard daydreaming and hardly in the presents ...)   and just had enough of there shit ,cutted nearly all cords of there toxic and absuing relations and ended up getting hit by reality. 

I started some things which weren't good at all (lets just say I didn't really knew what I did to my self), a few years  in  I finaly could open up my eyes and (I aint sure ) started to fall into depression , I was never a socialiser at all (could be also part of my INFJ trades tbh) had a few ppl I could do stuff with but still I doN't feel  like I can open up or get someone onto my level as I try to speak out what my heart wants to say or just describe what I feel . 

It is so depressing, becouse I know a lot of people but no one knows me , for the way I am . I just can't seem to find the bond to talk to them on my level (not as I wouldn'T try , but it just seems like that no one get my deps of converstional thingys ,fi that makes sence) kinda feeling like an Alien tbh :}. 

&amp;#x200B;

but lets get back to the main topic ....

I.. I ... I just don'T even know what to belive in or what kinda reason we have to stay on our so called ""earth"" (not that I'm sucidal , I just can'\*t seem to find a reason to live in this society with  there beeings in it), I don'T see any kinda reason to have belive in humanity no more . Every where is hate and destruction , sure there could be good things in live but what for? we live to die, we work our whole life to  try to live with our rent till the end of our days? what kinda life should that be ? ,A happy one? I don'T think so.

&amp;#x200B;

Even If I seem to be happy as soon as I relais that everybody else is have a good time I start thinking about sad stuff and how we are allowed to live with things we ""humans"" have done to eacht other and how we can so be cruel to each other , can'T we just be kind and open minded ? :C

&amp;#x200B;

So what is this circle we live in , working till we die with out chance of getting somewhere , seeing places or doing things that got ""high standarts""  by working for someone who's gonna buy his next lambo of his incomes and treating his/her workers like crap , and telling them that if they aint gonna do what is required then they get replaced by the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

to be honest I just think I was indeed born in the wrong century , I want back to where we would live in the woods hiking around seeking food and lived as one, and not this socaity crap we have today, with all its ""BS"" rules and ""alpha males"" dominaces and the biggest fish gets it all and everyone else will starv to death.....

&amp;#x200B;

NF had a qute in one of his songs that I can totaly realate to :

""  *And everyone* around me kinda *thinks I'm* a *great guy*. *But* I don't ever *think* it so I *think I'm* a *fake* liar "" \~ Change -NF

I  feel lost tbh ....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don'T even think at this point that therapists would be smart to get into this with me , not becouse I doupt there ""power"" to heal but even If I could take it that far I wouldn'T even know here to start becouse my thougheds are just going wild and over writing each other as I speak , there is so much on my mind that could be unleashed but I just never seem to catch my own thougheds and I guess I also gave up on this due the fact that I don't really have anyone who would understand ( and yes I know that this whole thing is a paradox in it self.... do i need help ?) 

 And of course I thoughed about talking to my ""relatives"" but I wouldn't think that they would understand like at all , its like trying to teach a fish how to climb a tree"" - ""AS"" (another context I know but it still fits in my case, I guess). I don'T feel conected with them at all , I mean sure they are here to ""support"" you but I just don'T seem to find it usefull to give them more headaches then they have already so I ma keep it to myself / trying to talk to ""friends"" about it, if at all.....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The only place where I seem to find peace (glimps of happieness) is in the woods while going through them by myself, but sadly those die  as well , as if we ""humans"" wouldn'T care at all about our nature , but they forget that nature doesn'T need us but we indeed do need nature.

and please if you have something that could help me with this big block of ""Help me change my mind , please?'' thingy then I'd highly appriciate it &lt;3 

&amp;#x200B;

I need someone to  restore faith in humanity for me agian ... please?

Started a new job. Decided that if i vibed with any coworkers I'd eventually ask them to hang. One by one, week after week, they have all denied me, repeatedly. A friend that I have become close with at work (and also struggles to make friends) tells me people see me as desperate . Also kind of annoying because I have ADHD.   


But I mean, yeah, I am desperate. I'm so lonely and desperate for friends that I don't even have the will to conceal it that much. My main problem is I'm unaware of how I come off. I'm not shy at all, I'm probably the most outgoing one there, probably too outgoing. If I wasn't lonely then I wouldn't come off as weird but at the end of the day I am CRUSHINGLY lonely. All the time. So IDK what to do about it, it seems like an unbreakable cycle.

Im not an outgoing person so its not like we were together all day everyday before me going back to my hometown but they're literally my only friends and i've never felt so lonely and unwanted by my only friends."

The problem is that we’re always just doing our own thing and constantly putting our heads down to get shit done, and because of this we barely say a word to each other, even when being 10 meters apart. I can’t even go and hang out with my friends, one reason being I’m on house arrest (again because of virus, where I live hit hard) and our school has implemented this substitute online school program which is mandatory.

lonely,"A pulsating dark goo emerges from my heart, then blooms like a sickening flower across my skin.","A pulsating dark goo emerges from my heart, then blooms like a sickening flower across my skin. - That's the visualisation I have for the loneliness I'm experiencing. 

It's suffocating, it's blinding and binding.

I've never fitted in my whole life. I'm always the freak and the r*tard, and since I'm bi and live in a very homophobic country, it just makes it worse. My dream is to live in another country where even if I'm still not accepted, at least I would belong. But that seems impossible now. I feel so isolated and useless.  I'm so easily drained which is why I'm so useless.

I used to have a friend but now they're getting better and healing whereas I'm getting worse so I decided to cut any contact with them. They've expressed many times that my negative words affect them. It's not that I wallow in self-loathe, I only mention them as a one-off joke. But maybe it's still too much. So now I'm bereft of any human connection. But people at my college see me as the happy-go-lucky guy, and it's so hard to fake it nowadays.

I don't know. I thought I can just ignore this goo from my heart as I had done this whole time before, but it's true : don't leave your wounds to fester. Before long, you can no longer heal it."

it seems like as i get older i lose more friends. i had a large group in college which is obviously not sustainable but there were a few ppl i thought were permanent fixtures in my life. out of nowhere two of my best friends cut me off completely. i even went out to coffee immediately to try to solve whatever issue they had, got nowhere, called the other girl, and she kept blowing me off. when she popped back up months later i was honest and told her that our friendship was too important to not be willing to speak and to essentially put me to the side repeatedly because that’s not how i treat ppl. she immediately got defensive and pretty much never spoke to me again. and one of my other friends, closest friend, didnt invite me to her birthday recently. its just all
so bizarre. and im okay to discuss and confront issues but it seems like i lose ppl that way. 
i dont know. i just feel very invisible to ppl, no one texts me or calls to check in. if something happened to me literally no one would have any idea. and i am like the complete opposite. i call my parents weekly sometimes more. i text my sister. i always check in with friends. and then i get angry like why do i care so much for ppl who dont? the other part of me is terrified ill be alone forever, and honestly how will i make it? i worry ill end up doing something crazy.

She put her head on my shoulder and we made jokes and I was the happiest guy in the world. I was really happy and super excited and when I woke up I realized I was alone and nobody was there for me to hug me or talk to me or show me affection. It was a rough morning. 


I’m getting desperate. Giving up on relationships and might just solely do hookups now to fill the void of no physical affection. It’s exhausting and draining. Having to reset yourself emotionally and try again and again over months and months is too much.

I’m kind to everyone. Maybe I’m even a little bit of a pushover because I’m super non confrontational but yet no one likes me enough to actually be my friend. I have a few long distance friends from high school, but I don’t think, besides my boyfriend and roommate, that I have formed any meaningful connections with anyone in college. I remember joining a dumb club last year as an attempt to make friends and everyone else who joined just warmed up to each other so quickly. I never felt like I fit in, I never felt like anyone cared about me. One day as a club we all had a sleep over and shared something about our past, or a sad memory, etc. people were sharing their depression stories and so I told everyone how I struggle with depression and isolation too and everyone just kind of ... stared at me .. I’m not kidding when I say I fell off the face of the earth this past year, went through a rough break up, tough time financially, and a hard time in school and no one bothered to check up on me or reach out ever. These are the same people that meet up with each other for no reason at all regularly! I’ve been really suicidal the past year and the only thing that keeps adding to the feeling is that I feel brushed off. Like my mental health doesn’t matter, like no one wants to be my friend, like I don’t matter. And I just don’t get it. What is so unlikable about me? This year, to find ways to recover my therapist suggested that I reach out to these friends first and so I did. SEVERAL times. I’ve asked a few people to grab lunch/dinner or maybe go to the bars and everyone says “yeah let’s do that” but never goes through with plans. I always get stood up or ghosted. I just don’t understand at all. I don’t even talk about my mental health or problems at all because I know that drives people away, I always try to be happy and extroverted when I’m meeting new people but no one ever sticks around :("

lonely,Went out for some Boba tea alone,"Went out for some Boba tea alone - As I was in my house all alone this Friday evening, I figured I’d go satisfy my unquenchable palate at this teashop I wanted to go try out.

Instead of feeling sorry for myself in my childhood room I decided to lessen the self-loathing and said “fuck it” I’m going...

I have anxiety driving so anything thats not like 5 minutes away from my house makes me feel uneasy and unmotivated. Especially driving at night. But oh well, I want some Boba.

When I arrived, I parked right in front the shop. The sign was lit and I could already see couples inside chatting it up...

Ugh.

I waited for someone to come out with their tea so I could feel more at ease with going in and out with my delicious Boba. I go in.

As I go in, I noticed a couple on the far left corner of the room just looking at me as I walk in...

Ugh. Lol

Anyway, as much as I wanted to embrace the atmosphere of the shop I couldn’t because my anxiety wouldn’t let me. I embraced what I could.

I go up to the front to check out the huge ass menu and I was already regreting not taking the time to look at the menu on Yelp beforehand.

I end up ordering a Passionfruit ice smoothie. I wait for about 5 minutes, not too long at all.

I get my drink but beforehand I look for a table so I can put the straw in. 

Ahh, and yes, you guessed it. The fucking straw wouldn’t go in lol

I struggled about 5-6 times looking like a wimp trying to put a straw through the plastic. The gym has indeed been a long lost memory in my life, so yeah thats probably why.

I digress but basically I wanted to comment on the couples I saw there...

Ahh, the normalcy they have.

You know, I could sit here and complain about why I dont have friends and a girlfriend to go out to drink Boba with, but to be honest – I’m happy for them.

I’m happy that at least some people can find affection in this shitty world. 

That they are able to find that physical and mental support from someone that cares about them.

I’m glad they have someone to drink Boba with.

I’m glad for that much."
lonely,I changed one aspect of my personality and the reception was absolutely astounding.,"I changed one aspect of my personality and the reception was absolutely astounding. - I grew up broody and skeptical of everything but beyond that I was a nice guy (still am). I wasn't as assertive as my brothers and my family members would always tell me I had a soft heart.

I would describe myself as ""completely forget-able"" in my teens.

One summer when I had just turned 20, I was lying in bed. I was visiting my extended family after not having seen them in years. I remember feeling absolute loneliness, and even though I was surrounded by all these people that I knew loved me, I felt like an outsider. 

It was then that I endeavoured to change the way people saw me. 

Yes Reddit, I became a fucking extrovert.

Suddenly people wanted to talk to me and hang out for shits and giggles. I felt immortal. Like I'd never be alone again.

My employers noticed and my career path experienced a crazy spike.

Now I'm 25 and I'm so tired. I'm emotionally drained and all I do now is finish work and go to sleep. I'm back to where I was 5 years ago, with almost energy.

What's the moral of the story?

I don't fucking know. Life is hard. People are picky.

The strain on my mind is not worth the change.

For some reason that I wish I understood, they kicked me out of the group and keep hanging out without me, they don’t even talk to me. They did this at the same time that my dad died and I needed them the most. It feels awful to lose your only friends - friends that have been together since childhood - and not know the reason. Additionally, the guy I’ve been with for two years moved across the country a couple months ago. We’ve been doing the long distance thing - call me psycho but I keep close track of his instagram following list - and recently I noticed he followed some pretty girls who are in the same area he now lives in.

It's obvious that in reality she wouldn't have been happy had she stayed but I can't help it. I feel like I'm going crazy. Maybe I am. Maybe I've always been. I just want the pain to stop. Even if my ex wasn't a factor I would still be in pain. I want help. Real help. I seriously can't do this anymore. I just want it to stop. Make it stop please. I NEED this to end.
lonely,Am I broken?,"Am I broken? - I've spent the majority of my life as a lonely nerd. All of my relationships have ended terribly. The few chances I had that they were decent ended up with me being too young and too immature, self destructing the relationship in question. As I grew older, any relationship I had that even seemed somewhat great, turned into toxicity. And now, as I'm reaching my mid thirties, my last few relationships have been destroyed by my emotional issues, my scars, from never being able to trust in anyone in a relationship, especially myself. In the recent... year. Year and a half, maybe. I've slowly started feeling different. Different in that I'm no longer finding myself even interested in trying a relationship anymore. I've lost all hope. I've given up. I've looked myself hard in the mirror and said to myself, 'You don't deserve to be partnered with another human being.' I've accepted a life of platonic friends, no sex, and most of all, no contact. I've become a recluse, only leaving my home for work, groceries, and the occasional social outing with the best and only person I consider my friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I'm evaluating myself again. In all my flawed glory. I'm a straight man in his mid thirties. I've fallen from grace with a once moderately athletic life and have slowly gotten over weight. I'm slowly losing the ability to socially interact with others outside of my microscopic circle. When I do interact with people, I simply assume the default customer service attitude that I apply to the users I assist in my work environment. It's all I know now. 

  
I don't like to talk about my problems. I think this may be my first or second time I even posted on reddit. Even council has failed me. Medications have failed me. People have failed me. I feel like I'm nothing but a walking failure. Even typing this, I'm wondering if I'm failing myself again and shouldn't be trying to reach out. Maybe I'm in the wrong place. Maybe I should just delete this whole thing before I hit submit.

&amp;#x200B;

So tell me, Reddit. Am I redeemable? Am I able to pick myself up and find my way past my social barriers and find someone? Is it even worth trying to fix myself anymore? Do you think I could ever find someone that could accept me, problems and all, and help me through them? Or do you think I should solve my problems first before chancing dragging myself deeper by searching and failing?

After about 20 online friends, I haven't found an exception to it. There's something wrong with me. I wish I knew what it was so I can stop being so hate-able. I went to another online friend for comfort bc we usually have each other's backs just replied ""I'm sorry I'm not happy all the time. I'm dealing with things right now"" and then ghosted me since..Ik this sounds selfish and it is..I'm just heartbroken and I don't know what to do or say anymore..so I posted on this subreddit.

It's painful to realize I barely have a friend to talk to now, except my sister. I came back to my home town after 3 years studying abroad and I have some good friends where i studied, but since I can't see them now I feel I am losing them too. I have no friends right now, even though I'm at my home town and I lost my girlfriend two months ago. Idk just wanted to vent I'm at my loneliest point atm.

If anyone wants to chat about anything im down. i like drawing, and anything about nature. im down for intresting conversations about anything :)"
lonely,Lonely does not mean horny,"Lonely does not mean horny - I just joined this sub a few days ago and I’m hoping to have more luck here finding friends/people to talk to. I really am looking for platonic relationships, but “lonely” is so often seen has code for horny. Like everywhere. 

Yes I am single, and yes I would like to not be. But that’s not what I mean when I say I’m lonely, and that is not why I’m here. I just want human connection (which has also been repeatedly mistaken for a euphemism, but it absolutely is not). 

In conclusion, the thirsty people who have taken over the internet can fuck right off. 

Ok, tiny rant over. :-)"
lonely,"I want a relationship, but on the other hand I don't.","I want a relationship, but on the other hand I don't. - So I've been single for about 4 or 5 years now and so far it's been quite the rollercoaster. There are a lot of times where I want to be in a relationship and make someone happy, but then again I fear that things won't work out and I'd waste my time and energy towards the wrong person. 

I hate having this fear really. I just want to be happy with someone without worry and make the best of our relationship. I miss holding someone and being held, the adventures, sex, etc. I still hold ""Making my woman breakfast in bed"" as the top 3 of my bucket list. 

What makes things worse is that the dating scene has drastically changed for the worse. Everything is based unrealistic expectations towards one another, going for someone's looks instead of personality, using one another for personal gain. I try to meet women in person, but they're not interested or taken which is completely fine with me. Sucks, but it's not the end of the world.

What do you think? Do you have the same struggle?"

I don’t feel worthy of being touched or loved. I haven’t had sex in eight years. 

Binge eating disorder has made me build up an armour of fat protecting me from the world but isolating myself too.

I choose to isolate myself but I am also so lonely and sad."

lonely,My Lonely 20's,"My Lonely 20's - First! Sorry for the upcoming rant.. 

I'm not here in a bout of sadness... But rather than just a place to reflect... I feel if I can acknowledge my faults.. then it's a step forward to progress. If anyone's in the same kinda situation.. would love to talk.

1. I'm 26 &amp; never been in a relationship:  this includes grade school.. I had acne &amp; glasses and was underweight growing up that made me unattractive. I was also way to shy, I was comfortable in my circle.. but the thought of telling a girl how i felt in person or just asking her out.. I couldn't do it. Growing up in adulthood.. I was just unattractive &amp; had no social skills due to never hanging out with people.. my friends all left me after highschool and due to my shyness, I was never able to make friends to meet mutual friends etc.. online dating only reinforced how unattractive I was.. I didn't want to settle.. but I wanted someone I was attracted to.. 

2. I've never lived alone: this is due to me just wanting to save $.. also you need money to get an apartment and lord knows I was never good at it.. this has also affected potential friendships &amp; relationships as I can't just invite someone over on a tee.. 

3. I have battled severe depression all my life: mainly due to #1.. the lack of social interactions growing up along with bullying I have suffered from has led me down a dark tunnel.. i still remember the day I hit rock bottom &amp; drove halfway across the country to end things.. 

4. I personally don't know how to recover: I told myself when I was a kid.. things would get better when I turned 20.. things would get better once I turned 25 etc... Now I'm telling myself things will be better by the time I'm 30... But as I sit here writing this.. I can't make friends magically appear, I can't make a girlfriend magically appear.. I just don't know how.. 

I dunno, it feels like I missed out on alot of very valuable life lessons growing up.. &amp; with me being over halfway through my 20's... I look back.. and really.. if I left tomorrow.. no one would remember me for anything, I don't have anything that I would be proud of. I have no idea how to make friends or even start a relationship meanwhile everyones getting married &amp; having babies already."
lonely,Getting this out of my chest,"Getting this out of my chest - Hey everyone, i actually don't know if this is the right sub to post about this but here it goes, I'm a M18 and i've always felt lonely even though i have friends it's like those friends who are with you to have fun and joke with each other but when it comes to talk about feelings or emotional stuff things no one is there... i actually don't have any female friends, i'm really introvert and the thing is i met a girl in september last year we became really close friends and we ended up dating i was really really happy because i thought i could finally be happy but guess what she left and it hurts, the point is, worst than being alone is being with someone that gives you hope and becomes your source of happiness and then leaves like it was nothing and it's not the first time that this happened to me.. most of the time i feel like i'm fighting against my thoughts and it's exhausting, i know i'm only 18 and i have a lot to live but i'm really afraid that i'm going to end up alone, actually it's my biggest fear. I know that everything sounds silly and maybe nonsense but it's really hard to explain everything that is going on in my head and everyday is hard to survive, I needed to get this out of my chest thank you for reading hope everything turns out good for everyone. (Sorry if my english is not the best)"
lonely,Drinking alone on a Friday night,"Drinking alone on a Friday night - It’s weird, I lean towards being an introvert and people exhaust me after some time but I can’t help but feel lonely when there’s no one to talk to. No one to exchange thoughts and opinions with, no one that simply wants to be around you. All I have are my own thoughts in my head."
lonely,I’ll never find anyone so I might as well just give up.,"I’ll never find anyone so I might as well just give up. - I’ve been trying for years, even when I was a kid girls were constantly on my mind. I would try and go somewhere beyond friends but it never works, ever. Even when you think it does, it doesn’t, they just leave you when they are done with you. No girl has ever returned my commitment and compassion for a relationship. I’ve tried being friends first, I’ve tried online dating, I’ve tried asking out randomly, and it never changed the result. What infuriates me about this are the remarks people make about it, “don’t worry about it right now” “just focus on school”. I’m doing fine in school, I have a life, I’m just painfully lonely, and I need more than just “friends”. Anybody can be friends these days, this guy I talked to twice because we were in the same class is friends with me, I don’t want that. I want the girl who I can take to places so I have someone to talk to about my day, and the girl who’ll hold me close and tell me everything is ok, even when it’s not, so for just a moment I can think that it is. Now I get it, I’m the problem, girls exist, and girls date, they just don’t date me, no matter how much love I have to give. Now that I’ve come to terms with being alone, I can finally feel better about killing myself. There is nothing to look forward to anymore, so life no longer has anything to offer me. This is about as light as I’ve felt in a while, all those anxious thoughts and fears of rejection put to rest. Thoughts of “what’s wrong with me” “am I really that unlovable” go sadly, but necessarily, confirmed. I know that because I’m a guy nobody gives a damn about my need for intimacy, but I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy, and hope one day there will be someone for everyone."
lonely,When will we start taking our own advice? Seriously.,"When will we start taking our own advice? Seriously. - I see tons of people asking for advice and giving advice on the same topics. It's sad really, that we know what needs to be done in some circumstances, but mentally we're not capable of doing anything about it.

I guess that's a good place to start: why is it that I can't deliver on the very same ideals that I suggest to other people, solutions that actually work. And if depression's the case, how do I deal with that? How do I know if it's just a mental imbalance, or if there's something I could change in my life BEFORE I tackle talking to people.

I think that's the biggest thing. Some of you are genuinely clueless on talking to people, and I'm not targetting you with this post, but this is just some food for thought if you're like me and you can't take your own damn advice because you lack the motivation.

After trying to think it through, I can't really figure out what the solution is."

lonely,Never had a Real Relationship,"Never had a Real Relationship - I have no one to vent to, I usually just listen to music &amp; write lyrics to vent, but I've been incredibly lonely &amp; I'm not really in the mood to write lyrics rn. I'm 22 &amp; I've never once had a Real Relationship in my entire life. The closest thing to a relationship I've ever had was only like 3-4 months, then she just left me for someone else. I've kinda Really lost confidence. I feel like I get nothing but rejected &amp; used for their own personal benefit. I'm old fashioned, a die-hard romantic, I know how to treat a lady right, it just seems like no lady wants to give me a REAL chance for once. I just want something REAL for once in my life, I don't want this bs where she has another guy on the side &amp; lies to me about it."
lonely,What if this is it?,"What if this is it? - So, I'm a guy who throughout the years has become less and less sociable. The few friends i have, they are all far away so being with them is very rare. I'm a person who wants to find someone, someone with whom i fell safe, and who can be by my side. But i have this thing inside my head where i feel less than everyone else, i feel unwanted where ever i go, i feel out of place and definitely not safe. I remain hopeful that things will change, but day after day what i think most is, Is this it? Is this all that there is for me?

lonely,Love is a loosing game,"Love is a loosing game - Love is truly a losing game, how ever you see it in which ever angle it only serve the purpose of biological chemical hypnosis.
A man loves a woman in its blossoming stage but just as a flower withers so is the love.
A mother and child has unconditional love between each other but as the child ages the love diminishes as time passed by. No relationship is stable and it's even harder for someone who still hasn't got those chemical out of their systems, then the heart becomes the enemy of the mind and the body becomes the victim. Complete senseless and self-destructive love is.
1 Corinthians 13 versus 4 -5 describes about how you feel when you are in love and not after the biological purpose is met.
Being one of the lonely, I have tried to convince myself about how cruel love is but all in vain.... I need him... Only he knows how to silence my demons... But I can't... My ego won't let me... Because he has a girlfriend and I care to much not to burden him with me. Although he told me that he doesn't want me to be alone (which is very nice) but I really cannot find a substitute for him.

lonely,Becoming a dad has made me feel more lonely,"Becoming a dad has made me feel more lonely - I (27) became a father to a beautiful boy, who just turned 1, last year and I've come to feel more lonely since then because of how dads are treated, at least in my experience.
Whenever I, mom and baby are out together and a stranger, whether it be an old lady passing by or a shopkeeper etc, talks about the baby/parenting it's never directed towards me. I'm always standing there waiting for *their* conversation to be over. Our son is part of a few baby groups which I admittedly don't attend too often because of work but I still have come to know a few of the other moms but I never get more than polite small talk in and out of baby group. They're always more interested in getting my partner's opinion even when we have equal knowledge/experience. Doesn't help that I rarely see  any of the other dad's so I'm almost always the only male.

Anyway it all just makes me feel so excluded and it really sucks"

lonely,It’s my fault and I hate it,"It’s my fault and I hate it - I come from I guess you could say an abusive background. As a result I’ve had really broken trusts in people. I barely trust anyone even those I know. I have some friends I’d consider close but they’re too busy in their own relationships... I’m really paranoid and always think people think the worst of me. As a result it’s really difficult for me to build any sort of trust with other people, because I keep closing them off. I really wish I could get closer to people. But I just don’t know how, I’m just so scared of the things in the past happening to me again. But at the same time I know I can never really make any sort of ground in a relationship without taking a risk. I hate that it’s my fault. I hate that I feel like I can’t trust anybody. I really would love romance but I can’t even imagine but loving somebody actually feels like. Is there a way for me to ever open up again? Even online it feels like I just can’t talk to people."

lonely,"I’m obsessed with a girl who doesn’t even want to be my friend anymore, and I don’t even know what I want...","I’m obsessed with a girl who doesn’t even want to be my friend anymore, and I don’t even know what I want... - Essentially I went into university, having no friends all throughout high school, but finally made one. She sat next to me in a class, and we talked, I invited her out a few times, and we became friends. I really like her, I kinda developed feelings for her actually, though I was certain she did not feel the same way (based on what she told me), so I stuck to being friends, and never told her my feelings.

A few weeks ago, we kinda had a falling out. I was being too intense, and according to her the whole friendship was a bit awkward. I was really surprised hearing this because a week before we wen’t to see a movie together, and things seemed to go well. I’m autistic, so I suck at picking up cues and hints though. Things had been a little awkward at times, but I’m an awkward person, and she assured me it was fine before. The reason things feel apart then though, was because I opened up to her about a lot of things, about being lonely for a very long time and stuff, and she got overwhelmed by it. I guess I was putting a lot on her, and had a unhealthy mindset that she could solve all my problems. But said there was no hard feelings, we just never really clicked, and she would rather not continue the friendship.

I told her this was fine, but it’s not fine. I’m all alone now. Even my family has been distant and not understanding. I am making some male friends now, but I still can’t get over this, and I don’t know why. I think about her all the time. She shared a lot of interests with me, but I can’t even do those things without thinking about her anymore. I honestly thought I was okay with just being her friend but maybe I’m totally infatuated but too emotionally immature to understand. I thought I was just lonely because I had no friends, but maybe I’m looking for something more. I’m trying online dating a bit, because I guessed that’s what I wanted, but I’m not really that interested, and have had little success. I’m only 18, so I’m not sure why I’d be so desperate for a relationship. This girl was 21, and she told me she never dated before, and never was interested. So I don’t even know what I want.

I guess this is all normal stuff you hear people talking about when they experience breakups and similar things, but I’ve never really felt this way about anyone. I’ve had crushes and stuff before, but not to this extent. So I’m just really confused. I’d like some help understanding what I’m going through, and what I should do to get through it. I still want to even just be her friend, but I’m guessing that’s not a good idea, and probably won’t happen anyway, so maybe I should just try to “get over it”, yet that’s a hell of a lot easier said than done."

lonely,A toxic friendship isn’t what you think it is,"A toxic friendship isn’t what you think it is - A truly toxic friendship happens when one or several people of a friend group are suffering from depression.But the group of young naive backstabbing cunts ignores it until it becomes a problem.Ultimatley they don’t talk about their feelings.So they act as a group but at the same time each member is very aware of the fact that shall one member fall into depression they will leave them there to die in the street.However the rules are differente depending on who you are.These special rules only apply to you if you are a part of what’s known as the inner circle.
The inner circle acts as a  mafia group on school territory.They can gut you in the street and nobody would give a damn.Although they may look like supermodels.They are top notch serial killers that escaped from death row.Do not underestimate them for they will kill you before you make a move.Although you can join the inner circle you don’t share every secret about yourself.Because always Remember that a psychopath must keep their identity hidden.
Thus you will only share a small quirk about yourself.Like your gay or you have an abusive partner.Or you secretly like fucking dogs.
Ultimatly this turns out in you becoming popular.Because you just became a part of the most well known  best running mafia group on the school grounds and nobody wants to challange your level of crazy.

The sun would rise again and the moon will appear as beautiful as ever. The seasons would change, and... nothing would be different. Because there is no one that would miss you. No one that ever took the time to get to know you. You are alone and alone and nothing but a useless spot of a better soul that could have existed.
I have gone months without human company. Not a single nod that would approve of my existence Sometimes I just need a shoulder to cry on. I'm no child but every night I hug my teddy bear so tight to make myself feel like somebody wants to hear me. I wish I had a friend to hold onto when I think there is no reason to be alive. I wish I wouldn't have to tell myself memories because there is no one else to hear it. I wish there was someone who would see my pain and misery and not use it against me. I wish I didn't have to sleep with that knot in my chest and the physical pain that reminds me of how empty and alone I am. But I'm so deep in melancholy that o don't even want anyone by my side. I would rather stay lonely than have someone tolerate me and be burden. Its better for people to stay away from me because every word I tell them is a second wasting their time. And oh!

lonely,Talking in groups gives me nightmares,"Talking in groups gives me nightmares - I find it ironic that my first expression of this personal failure is just an electronic letter to a group, but it's a different situation here. I can't see the effect of my disruption in real time; and am not made to judge critically my own words right after speaking them. My own judgement isn't the paralyzing element, but frantically weighing that judgement against those of the group I'm trying to join. 

Even trying to join a large discord server or chatroom makes me cringe. Finding a meaningful dialogue in the cacophony of conversation is like bobbing for apples down Niagara Falls. I suppose with the turnover of people on those sorts of settings, my novelty isn't interesting enough. I'd stay longer, but small talk is honestly painful, I have a very difficult time finding people who are interested in the same things as me. 

The only other ways to meet people, it seems is through jobs, clubs, or maybe bars, which fills me with dread. So, basically, I'm an antisocial loser with no friends, who isn't humble enough to engage anyone in reasonable small talk for a few weeks as to develop a relationship, I know, I get it. It just feels like there's nowhere for me. I move around a lot and can't stay put. I don't know what I'm looking for, but the stagnation kills me inside all the same. 

Maybe if I were intelligent enough to go to college I would find better conversation, but that's neither here nor there. I've heard angels fly because they take themselves lightly. In that case, I feel like a ton of bricks weighing down any group unfortunate enough to catch my interest."

lonely,Loneliness is like a drug,"Loneliness is like a drug - One time you want to be alone take a rest, then it extends by one day, then another day, then another day and then it's a goddamm week and you get addicted to the sweet sweet sounds of no people screaming, no music, no sounds of chaos just sweet silence and peace.

And then you try to join back into the group but you feel... disassociated and alienated

You try to sociolize but they just turn away and almost ignore you, you almost give up and you suddenly hear those two voices in your head...
One tells you to keep trying, but the other one tells you to give up but you can't decide what voice listen to,so you're just stuck trying and giving up


You just want to be loved but you also want to completely isolate yourself, delete *all of your contacts* and pretend that you don't exist but the ""primal"" need to be socially active holds you back...

lonely,I miss feeling important.,I miss feeling important. - Ever since i moved I havent felt important. No one does and its not for lack of trying. I have friends but i feel distant from everyone. I feel alone.

lonely,I feel so fucking alone right now and I can’t fix this and it hurts,"I feel so fucking alone right now and I can’t fix this and it hurts - I can’t make online friends because I get so scared and paranoid, I can’t bring myself to text back to the people who try to reach out to me over the internet because I have so much anxiety of fucking up and not being able to text very well.

The problem is that I don’t know too many people in the real world either, I have maybe 3 people who I would call my ‘friends’ but they don’t even attempt to act like they care. I go to a school for people who can’t handle mainstream school but don’t need 24/7 care. Because of this there are only about 20 people who come into school and attend classes, most of them are a lot younger than me (year 5-8 in the UK) and I don’t really talk to any of the people I talk to in school outside of school because they can’t leave their house (agoraphobia).

So who do I have??
Someone who takes me for granted and doesn’t act like they care; who in this situation i can say is the closest friend I have.
Someone who doesn’t talk to me anymore and on off blocks and unfollows me saying it’s ‘Instagram glitches’ when I fully well know that’s bullshit?
Or someone who won’t talk to me for more than 5 minutes because all they do is send memes and make references.

I’m so fucking tired of being alone and I thought that everything would get better after cutting the people-who bullied me for years, who called themselves my ‘friends’,-out of my life but it fucking hasn’t. I still feel so cripplingly helpless and lonely 

Don’t even try suggesting to confront the only friend who sees me irl (best friend) because I have. And they say sorry and promise to stop then go back to the same behaviour.

I want to live so bad but if this is all my life is going to be is there really a point? I’d make people realise they took me for granted and feel like shit but it’s all a bit too little too late. I’m tired and I need a hug from someone who cares."

I go days without talking to anyone and crying almost every night because I've been feeling so alone.

I have a friend, but she never talks to me unless she needs a therapist. We can't have a conversation unless it's about her depression and her problems and everytime I try to have a normal conversation with her, she takes days to respond and cancels plans to hangout at the very last minute. She only uses me when she has some sort of problem and then she couldn't care about me any other time.

Just didn’t care, figured it freed up more time to hangout with the boys I guess. Now here I am a year and countless meaningless hookups later and I’m just now getting beat up by it? Maybe it’s because I have three friends left. Maybe because I spend most of my free time doing nothing because I’m always so exhausted from working. I dream about her at least weekly and I always wake up so damn sad. I feel so alone, like I’ll never find love like her again. Everyone at my job is much older than me and other than that I don’t really have opportunities to meet new people. I don’t know why I’m posting this. I’ve always been one to just roll with the punches and able to take a lot of shit but maybe I’m at my breaking point?

lonely,Has anyone ever been to a meet-up?,"Has anyone ever been to a meet-up? - What are your experiences?

I can see the desire to go and potentially meet a couple friends, but, if the only thing say, in the case of this subreddit, was that we're all lonely, wouldn't it just be a bit awkward to find something to talk about?

For example, I can see a meet-up about football (soccer), or live music, or even cake being more successful in joining people together and sparking friendships, because there's a shared interest. However, no one here obviously likes being lonely, we all hate it, that's the point, so what is there enjoyable to talk about in person?"
lonely,"Feeling those post-Valentine's Day blues remembering every chance I've blown, even if that chance probably didn't exist.","Feeling those post-Valentine's Day blues remembering every chance I've blown, even if that chance probably didn't exist. - That feeling when you reconnect with someone you've always liked, and later finally have the self-esteem to shoot the shot you feel you should've years ago, even though you know circumstances wouldn't allow for anything to actually happen but you still would hate yourself if you never did it, and you end up just making things eternally awkward and you realize this would've happened either way so what's the damn point.

That's a fair part of where I've been at mentally this past year and change. I can expand on this in the comments, but it's quite late/early and I need to go to bed, but I still have brews in the fridge so why not dwell on it until I pass out. That is my specialty, after all.

And I would like to emphasize that absolutely no part of this is meant as ""r/niceguy"" or ""I deserve something"", no. I take full responsibility for the eternal awkwardness and poor timing entirely on myself. There is no blame or ""how dare they"" to be placed on anyone other than myself. I knew I'd missed my best shot years ago because I never had the self-esteem. Hell, I didn't even know if there had been a shot to take. I even had their number and never used it. Then I ran into them years later, and once I properly reconnected with them I also knew that if I never told them how I felt I'd regret it for the rest of my life. And as such, I made things worse for everyone involved and made the interaction irrevocably awkward, because I make everything worse, period.

And then you also remember every other shot you took too late and remember that even if you had through divine intervention timed it right it still would've been a disappointment for them.

I know I suck at pretty much everything. I just happen to also suck at knowing when a window has closed, especially if it'd been closed for a while, and still trying to fly into it like a near-sighted idiot pigeon. Hell, I don't even realize a window was open in the first place until I figure out it's already closed.

And if you start catching feelings for someone, you remember that you aren't worth it. You remember it's someone who's a good friend, and that's almost certainly all it should be because you'd only disappoint them otherwise.

Basically, my point is that I'm going to be alone for all of those reasons plus psychological reasons (Mom caught me playing a porn game and said ""no woman will ever do this for you; I know in hindsight she meant it contextually but I'm still feeling that today).

Anyway. I suck, I've blown my chances with everyone I've ever caught feelings for, I've shot my perceived shots FAAAAAARRRRR too late, and it just makes me feel bad for even shooting them at all, even though I'd hate myself for never shooting in the first place, and it makes me feel like I can never speak to them or message them again. Then I see them put up a new profile pic and I get hit with that ""got dang, they're beautiful, and you really blew it, ya dummy"" all over again, and lather, rinse, repeat."

lonely,Fighting jealousy,"Fighting jealousy - I'm lucky to have a couple close friends, several of them recently finding themselves in loving, happy relationships. I mean it when I say I'm happy for them, and they deserve the world, but it's hard when you're in a different place.

Something happened to me that I don't quite understand, something along the lines of assault. I've made some feeble attempts at relationships since then but they've all failed miserably, and now I'm in this sort of suffocating situation trying to force myself to like someone because he likes me. I can't, and so I feel guilty and alone.

This is on me, and no one else is to blame. But it's hard when my friends flip through every picture of their boyfriends. It's tough when they don't want me around because they're always on the phone, and when they expect me to reciprocate the joy but I can't think of what to say because the conversation brings back bad memories. It's hard not to feel jealous that they each found someone to adore them."

I’M always the one to ask THEM if they want to hang out. i mean, they say yes 90% of the time, and when we meet up it’s nothing but laughs and good times... but i can’t hell but feel a sort of self consciousness over it. why don’t they ever invite me? if i don’t say anything, we just won’t hang out, and that’s it. i’m always craving attention, so waiting it out just to get invited will mean i’d have to wait for WEEKS to get anything, if at all, and it never works out that way anyways so i don’t even bother. i hate that things are this way, it makes me feel like they don’t care about me. the more and more i think about it, the more i feel like my friends think i’m a bother and that they only put up with me. i mean, if i don’t get invited ever, then surely that means that they rarely think about me. just thinking about that fills me with sadness and embarrassment, because i think about my friends constantly. it makes me feel like i’m being to clingy, and that i’m just super annoying. i’m probably developing a complex."

lonely,I stuck my neck out a little bit today. I enjoyed the thrill.,"I stuck my neck out a little bit today. I enjoyed the thrill. - There's an incredibly attractive girl at my work. She's in a different department though so it's pretty random if and when I'll see her. She gets hit on quite a bit and is sort of at the top of the menu. All the guys talk about her. I've exchanged a few words with her in the past and  we even smiled at one another but I still haven't introduced myself. I just get the feeling she's probably sick and tired of being fucked with at work so I've kept my distance.

Our departments share the same break room so I was looking for a place to sit during my lunch. I noticed tons of guys in the room and one of the only empty seats was beside hers. I thought that was strange because who wouldn't want to sit next to her, right? So I pulled out the chair, put my jacket on it, and then sat next to her. I acted like I owned the place.

That wave of excitement just washed over me as I sat down. I opened my soup and poured the crackers in like I'd done a hundred times before. Silence. I took a few bites then relaxed and sat back. We both looked at the TV for a few minutes. Occasionally she would scroll down on her phone. It looked like she was looking at stuff to buy or something. 

""How's your department treating ya?"" I asked her.
""It's slow tonight"" she said back.
""Ah. Clusterfuck for us. Not enough staff..."" I said still picking up crackers using a plastic spoon.
""Awww"" she said back. 
""Mmm."" I replied. I wanted so badly to say more but I was exhausted and couldn't really see much to work with other than the weird designs on her lunch satchel. I almost made a comment about it but I didn't. I'm kicking myself a little bit now! My thirty minute break was almost up so I decided to end it there. 
""Have a good night"" I said to her as I got up to put on my jacket. She told me to do the same. It's strange because a few seconds later she got up too. 

I put my leftover soup inside the company refrigerator. When I went back for it later I saw that same exact weird looking lunch satchel of hers right next to my cup. Another strange coincidence perhaps? Or maybe I've left enough of an impression on her to become curious. I've decided to give it another shot if I see her. 

The small encounter didn't have much effect but it's a start I guess. I'm glad I did that. I encourage the rest of you lonely folks to get out there and take a chance :)"
lonely,My first therapy session can't come sooner.,"My first therapy session can't come sooner. - I don't know how long I've felt like this anymore, all I know is that it's been longer than most of my memories. Being in my senior year really launched everything in my system into overdrive, and now I'm so, so fucking cold. I desire warmth to the point of hurting myself sometimes for it. I remember the last time I went to a Therapist I only lasted 2 sessions: the first I flooded him with my emotions, and the second he brought my father in without my permission (even though I told him in the previous session I didn't want parents there) and had us sort out differences. We never scheduled another appointment. My newest session is with his wife, coincidentally enough. Back to it, and here are my flood gates to you. 

I like to think I used to have many friends. Now, I know factually I am invisible to most, if not all. I'm only there when people need me. Whether it be as an emotional guide, a therapist, etc. I am always there for people. And, some are even there for me sometimes. I've been isolating more than I have in my entire life, especially today. I stuck to the things I do for my family today: dishes, laundry, trash, the chores so I can feel appreciated for who I am for once in a great, great while. 

Often what I've found to be the most painful part about being so lonely is the lies of apprenticeship. The 'I love you's, the 'hope you get better's, etc. but all without action. The empty words might be a better phrase. It was with someone who said she loved me, and from a really personal standpoint, I loved her. Now I realize her actions never matched her words; she never put any effort in, and that is not love. She loved me when it was convenient, and never anymore. I was and still am so attached. It's so incredibly difficult to let go, like a sludge of gum is stuck from my heart to her back. And this isn't even the first time. When I need to detach like this, I isolate even more than I did before. In this context, I blocked her on all socials, numbers too, and haven't looked her in the eye or talked to her at all in person. I know it's a bad way to go about non-attachment, and im attempting to teach myself other ways, but frankly that's the only way I know how. 

I'll admit, though frankly this will just inspire people to put the suicide hotline in the comments to feel like they've helped: I'm at a point where the thought of not being here anymore sounds bad, but not anywhere as bad as it used to be. I'm at a point where I've realized that while people would miss me, it would not be because of who I am, but because they ""lost someone"". They never valued me for my me, they valued me in benefit to their existence. They would miss me only at the final moments to make up for their insolence beforehand. I am lonely in that, though I know others who will be in my situation soon if they aren't already. I often wonder if making it into the workforce is worth it at all. 

I need to cry. I need to wail. I need to vomit. I need to scream. 

My first therapy session can't come sooner. I need truth. I need a flashlight to show me the how not to walk into the sludge. I need a love I can't get from my mom, my friends, etc. I need a love for who I was, who I am, and what I can be. Everything right now is either pain or boredom, and somehow the boredom is often worse. I've been trying to build hope for the future to cure my mental stress, and this has partially been the first step. This is what I'm working towards. Just hope for me is all I ask. I don't want a moment that pushes me over, and I believe in the power of other people. Hope that I stay. Thank you, and I hope you all in your kind endeavors too :)

**TL;DR: Living has become so cold to the point where I need to practice involution and am seeking help. Please hope for me.**"

I have a very social roommate (the going out every weekend type) and I wouldn't consider us friends, but I always get the impression that she feels bad for my consistent lack of friends and social plans. So, she's invited me to her boyfriend's birthday party this weekend and I immediately got anxious and said no. However, I realized that this is the first time I've even been invited to a party (ew?) and could be the last. I'm contemplating the idea of going, but realizing that I really don't think I have the social skills to even be around people my own age. I'm also not a big drinker (which I know they all are) and I won't know anyone there (it's a small group of 30 people, so I know I'd be the outsider). The party is also on a boat, so it's not like I can go home at any time...it's a thing I'd have to commit to for a few hours.

I'm not expecting to go and make a ton of friends or anything, but I just thought maybe I could feel sort of normal for one night of my life. But anxiety is kind of a bitch, and there's also the possibility I'd just stand in the corner all night hating life.

lonely,"I hate when people it's healthy to be lonely, sometime.","I hate when people it's healthy to be lonely, sometime. - I grew up as a lonely bitch. Even when I actually had friend, I felt so lonely inside that it caused me to distant myself from them overtime. Now I got one or two internet friends, but I am still a lonely bitch. It is often overwhelming, and rarely goes by. 

I hate when people tell me it's healthy to be lonely sometime. I am so done with everything! I am done with being myself, done with squashing myself down out of fear, done with letting people walk on me. I am done with defending those who do not give a damn crap about me, done with overthinking, done with feeling like no fucking interaction is actually perfectly genuine. 

I'd like not to be so sensitive, and react normally. I'd love people to be nicer overall. 

It could be great to have people to hang out with, and just be able to let go, to relax. I feel so lonely overall that I get very excited as soon as something is willing to chat with me. And then I feel like a burden to them, I feel I am going to make them flee like everyone before. 

Loneliness undermine everything, and I do not think it's healthy. Part of the problem come from me, but feeling like an alien doesn't help.

So I'm in an organization in college, on the executive board, and I am close with everyone, or so I thought.  I share classes with many of those people and we have fun, help each other, and talk about life in general.  One of them (let's call them X) is in my classes and is actually a partner for a project in class (they asked me to be their partner, so I thought we were close).  So today X was having a conversation with Y (another person on the exec board) about an event at X's place.  He was talking about inviting everyone on the Exec board and a few other people, meanwhile I was doing my own thing, not really listening.  Halfway through I caught on and had a conversation about who's being invited etc. they were very talkative and cool about it...so I assumed I was invited...I mean they were speaking about it in front of me.  Then I noticed a hesitation on X, so I backed off subtly (oh I gotta do work, etc).   X then was leaving and Y was like hey, can I ask you something? They both went out (which is when I realized, Y was asking X if I was invited...why else? They talked about everything in front of me...so this is my logical guess on context clues) and Y returned and said nothing for the next hour.  

2ish hours later.  Y is back and talking to someone who is invited and making plans about how to go to X's house (I had my headphones in at the time but they were right next to me so I heard stuff). They were again conversing about it in front of me...some other kid came in who was not invited and they cut the conversation in half.  This is all I got.

My guess is that I am not invited...I mean wouldn't X at least tell me if I was? (He asked others).  That is my guess, tell me if I'm wrong...but based on the conversation they had outside and other clues that's my guess.  I told them I had plans because they were talking about ppl not making it...I'm like I think you should push it to next week if he wants a better turnout...he just said yeah and kept talking to Y.  If I'm not invited, why would you discuss that in front of me, you know how much it messes with someone's head? Especially when you've known them for a year, are a project partner and work closely together.  I am just so done ugh.  I'm speechless. Thank you for listening to me folks."

I love the person I'm with like crazy and I don't know how much they actually contribute to my lonely state. A few years back I made some life changes that removed me from my people and my culture. They treat me a little different but I can't blame them, I'm a completely different person.  I wouldn't even recognize myself.  My SO was with me during all this transition and has always been supportive. I think my problem is that I've felt such strong rejection from the people closest to me for most of my life that I feel like a person without a tribe. I don't have a fall back group any more and the rejection was so strong that I'm afraid of making new connections.  The one relationship that has been consistent is with my SO but I worry that I'm becoming too clingy and dependent on that relationship. Anyway just feeling utterly alone and unable to connect. Thought I'd tell you so you might not feel alone in your loneliness. 

I don't know if I will ever stop feeling alone no matter how much I'm loved or included.  I think my lack of ability to connect will eventually ruin every friendship or relationship so I almost want to keep people away and sabotage all my relationships."
lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

Not to mention how kind people I’ve noticed people being and making a friend at the bar last weekend.

I've thought things were fine, but as of late, I feel like I've been kinda cut out from my two best friends. These are my ride or dies, and we have been like that for years. We've made it though some tough situations together and we have always been 3. Lately though, it just seems like its them two and me, not US. Whenever we have to do something in teams, I'm the first one cast out. I'm always that first to be asked to watch the others stuff while they go somewhere, and I'm always the one that will stay back if needed. Now grant it, I do volunteer myself for this stuff sometimes simply because it just seems like the right thing to do so that my buddies can be happy. I just dont want to get left behind, cause I dont have anyone else like them. What's worse is that it's starting to cause feelings of resentment and jealously when they do leave me out. I find myself getting a bit upset when I'm the last to learn information, or when I'm not told stuff at all, and I HATE feeling that way towards the people I care about. I can't help but feel like I'm alone without them, even if I do have other friends. I dont want things to end and I dont want them to get worse, but I dont know how to make it better. Please help?"
lonely,"one step forward, two steps backward","one step forward, two steps backward - Christ, it just feels like its getting worse. I went back on social media for the first time in a while and seeing my old friend happy with her boyfriend just gutted me. I almost vomited right there. Work just keeps piling on, and college looms over my head, just making everything scarier and worse. I've drifted apart from most of my friends just because I spend all my time sleeping or studying. I'm burning out, and I thought seeing my old best friend would make me feel better. But no. She continues to never talk to me. Its like there's no one out there. Like all the humans have left and its just me and my room and nothing else. I drift through the school hallways, unshowered for weeks. I barely have enough energy to type this. God i miss her.

Group chats fade, you get the occasional text once a week, they’ve made new friends and you’re left to come home from college looking forward to talking to someone who still enjoys your company but they’re not there anymore. I used to have it all, the late night conversations, the sleepovers, I miss it dearly. I’m left with nothing. College has left me with superficial relationships, never anything deeper than inside of class to “hang out” I have no one to talk to anymore, I’m alone and I wish I wasnt."

Everyone’s a piece of shit at my school except for my close friends and the teachers. I just feel like there’s nothing out there for me. I’ve asked my friends for support, but those who aren’t LGBTQ themselves can’t really get behind it. I just need to know that there are people out there who will support me no matter what happens to me."

I feels like I’ll never have friends like that again and I’ll have no one to share my feelings etc. with. I tried finding people online but it’s not the same.

I know I’ve got my own faults in the past and I hope some of the ones I truly respect would just stay open minded to my mental development and progress. Growing up, my friends were my only family and I got to spend every holidays with their family. When I lost them, no more holidays and celebration for me lol (my parents forgets my bday.) Even though we had a lot of differences, we still could relate to each other on many other topics. We supported each other unconditionally. But sometimes our differences would also make us more distant. We hold different sets of values and such and it’s just hard for me to fit in. I tried to give in once, but that caused more damaged to myself. Now that I’m literally solitary (and do quite enjoy being an introvert) I find it hard to find new friends that I actually do relate on another level, not just superficial stuffs like makeup, fashion, boys, sex, parties, etc. I’ve become so fucking tired. I know some day I’ll find my group of friends or a few of them that I’ll actually enjoy being with and who I can fully trust. I guess it takes time for me to adapt into something that I’m not used to. Life happens. I’ll grow out of it."

It's embarrassing.

They take away my dignity, integrity and significance.

They ask me why I don't talk and when I do I feel like I have no voice.

I feel shit when I eat with them because I shouldn't be here at 29.

No one starts a conversation with me and when I do with them I feel like I have no merit.

lonely,I don’t think I will ever fall in love with anyone and I can’t put into words how sad that makes me,"I don’t think I will ever fall in love with anyone and I can’t put into words how sad that makes me - Sorry this has just been on my mind for a while and I need to rant. Sorry if this gets long :/

I’m a gay 20 year old male, currently going to college. I’ve never dated anyone, and very very rarely has anything romantic happened to me. These past few months I’ve been more and more away of how alone I am and it really bothers me. I’m very sad 🙁

The thing is, I actually have a pretty good life. I have friends at college, my roommate and I are best friends, I’m the editor in chief of the university newspaper, I get all A’s in my classes. But my love life has been so dry - and I mean SO dry. I haven’t even been able to flirt with anyone or go on dates, nothing. And it’s not like I don’t go out and be social. I have lots of friends here and I go to parties a couple of times a month. I meet new people fairly often, at least once a semester when going to new classes. But I haven’t found anyone that I’ve even developed a crush on. I’ve been here for 2 YEARS and am still as alone (romantically) as I was when I got here. There’s been people that I’ve been interested in but those have all quickly been shut down, usually by learning that the other person has a boyfriend already. 

Not only that but I feel so completely unequipped to handle a romantic situation even if I do get an opportunity. I have 0 experience flirting or dating. I’m so independent in my life, I always have been...even my parents pretty much left my life alone starting in high school bc they trusted me, I was always a good kid, got good grades, so I’ve pretty much been running my own life since 10th grade. I’ve built my entire life around how independent I am. My schedule is crazy, I’m busy all the time, bc I don’t have other people to think about. So even if I do get the opportunity to flirt/date someone, I will be so completely clueless. 

This completely breaks my heart. I’ve always dreamed of getting married and adopting kids. I want a family. If I get to the end of my life and I never had gotten to experience that....idk man I think I would have so many regrets in life. 

If I haven’t met someone in the first 2 years of college...how can the next 2 be any different.... :/"

lonely,i really (x10) want to help the only friend i have,"i really (x10) want to help the only friend i have - He talks about how bad his life is all the time and that he is not a good person, he doesnt deserve anyone or anything, his parents treat him like shit. He gets stressed so easily, his exams are coming and is barely able to concentrate. He is a really sensitive person and very insecure as well.

He frequently talks about killing himself.

I have tried so much to talk to him out of his problems and stuffs but i guess only talking doesnt help.

I dont know how to help him, can someone suggest something? Would be of great help. 

I know different kind of people require different kinds of approach but idk."

lonely,Gonna get some therapy,"Gonna get some therapy - I decided last night that I will try seeing a therapist. I’m very grateful I have this opportunity to see one, as I know a lot of people don’t which breaks my heart. I have done a lot of work on myself but I’m realizing I think I may need some help. I am lonely because I am an absolute mess when it comes to interpersonal relationships. I have a lot of emotional issues and I can’t keep dumping it on my one friend who I have left, she has her own stuff. She never acts like I’m a burden but I just know at this point I need a professional’s perspective. 
It’s not that I have a hard time meeting people or even making new friends, I just always mess things up somehow. And before I mess things up, I am trapped in my head about how I’ll mess it up. So sometimes I seclude myself just because I can’t deal with all of that.

lonely,Ooft,"Ooft - Within the span of two weeks my ex girlfriend already has moved on, I made a new friend group and then quickly was kicked out of it, my mother has been put in hospital and I only have myself to console with.

I moved from Sydney to Perth to live with my grandmother, she left to live there three months ago and myself two. The reason I moved there was to 1; help her around the house e.g. fix the table, feed the dogs, replace the cabinets, deal with customer service for her mobile provider etc. And 2; to study so I can get into the university courses I want to (accounting and finance, advertising) as my """"dream job"""" is to be a consultant for a superannuation firm, riveting I know. 

Of course I knew that moving would mean little to no friends but I didn't mind that as back home I felt as if everyone I know was drifting away, my ex, my aunt, my mother and brother, close friends too. But I didn't expect to lose all contact (bar one person which if it wasn't for them I think I'd just delete my social accounts), for a week or two I would go out of the school at lunch and call my old mate and have a cigarette, best twenty minutes of my day after my girlfriend and I broke up in all honesty. But as he always has done getting in contact with him is as likely as getting water from a stone, so I usually just sat in the sun.

But one day he messaged me to ask when I'll come back home for a bit to see each other and I asked the girl behind me in class when school finished. I saw her and my instant thought was ""What's her name"" but in retrospect I think it was me subconsciously trying to get over my ex. We spoke for a bit so while walking out to second break I went to go leave for my allocated smoke and coffee for the day but she asked me ""Hey, would you like to come sit with us"" I responded with "" Are you sure"" evidently she wasn't but anyways I sat with that group, they seemed like the mixed bag of nerds and social rejects, not me in the slightest but probably the best people for me to be around (social rejects may be applicable to myself but I'll gloss over that). The girl I mentioned before asked if I wanted to go to the school formal with her, I didn't know if she was desperate or really  into me, I think both go hand in hand. She also asked if I wanted to see her Friday afternoon too, to which I said of course.

I saw her on the Friday and it was a good chat, I didn't expect a make out session nor was that what I wanted. Learned a but about her and tried to keep myself civil and polite, we sat by the beach until her mother called her to come home so then we up and left, we said bye but what I didn't expect was a hug so tight I thought she wanted to wrestle on the tar road. It left a pretty big impression. One of compassion. Of warmth. 

That weekend was good I did all the study I wanted to do, I had a swim in the pool and just had a happy weekend.

Then she messaged me on Sunday to ask if I wanted to see her again, I was ecstatic. Again, of course I said yes. We spoke for hours over Snapchat it was a good, deep chat. 

Monday and Tuesday instead of leaving for a smoke I spent it with that group it was good, I thought anyway. But once Wednesday came the girl I was supposed to see said 

""Hey sorry to say this but I just want to go to the dance with my friends""
""And I have family issues Friday too""
To which I respond
""Easy as, I hope everything is okay with your family :(""
Obviously she has no issues Friday, but then she messaged an hour later 
""Also could you please find other people to sit with? I feel like such a hitch saying the over messages but the group feels like the vibe has been off since you've been in it and these are friends I've had for ages""

At that point I'm in disbelief of what I could have possibly d done, I got along with everyone, some funny/harsh banter, they all had genuine laughs with me. One of the group are still talking to me as she thinks what happened was totally unfair, and as a summary of why I was ostracized basically as soon as I sat down one of them ascertained I'm a very judgmental person so therefore they didn't like me. The irony is brutal. 

So today it was the same routine, the bell goes for lunch, I buy a coffee and leave for a cigarette. 

Then I had to go to the class that girl is in (it's a checkup class or what not it's just to see if anyone is struggling with classes) I had a huge test this afternoon so I was trying to get all my notes down, a good thing about maths is although I'm horrible at it I forget about everything around me, it's honestly surreal, so it was a win win, I studying for my test and I'm oblivious of the girl that gave me the most sincere hug since the last time I don't remember.


But, I got a message from my brother ""Oi call me mums  hospital"" as soon as I read that I just threw everything in my bag and left to call my brother, no answer. I call again, no answer. I call my aunt, she tells me my mother has been admitted to hospital because she's really sick, throwing up blood and what not. I'm absolutely distraught after the call, I'm just standing in the stairwell trying to compose myself so I can go back to class, but the teacher comes from nowhere and asks what's wrong, I told him ""I don't want to fucking talk about it"" I feel awful and the next time I have him I'll apologise. After this I go home.

I tell my grandmother and we talk about money and just difficult stuff, I mess around with YouTube and go for a swim then study for the test, I told the office that I'm going home and to move my exam for tomorrow, which works out great because I've been studying the wrong component anyway.

But what I think irks me the most is why make a massive deal out of kicking me out of the group, a simple we don't like you because XYZ would be blunt, direct and honest, it didn't need to be fudged up with insincere declarations of best wishes. But I guess that's just me trying to project my own personality onto others, I'm an fragile asshole so I suppose I expect others to be as well.

As well as all this, my ex girlfriend of two years has broken up with me, and has already posted about how to ask a guy out on Reddit, a day or two afterwards we broke up. And yes I looked up her Reddit account. I removed her from all my social because she posted on Snapchat anonymous question thing that she is interested in someone, I went from a defeated mood to an absolutely vindictive and hateful mood, I really cannot explain the hatred in that moment I held. I wanted to call her number and tell her how fucked it is, I didn't but, I figured I already look like an idiot as is. 

I know she cheated on me but really I didn't care because I knew for a fact I had three girls on my best friends list that would fuck me at the drop of a hat. But I didn't want them, as good as French cuisine is, I always wanted my homemade comfort food. And I did it to myself too, if I didn't go on her phone I wouldn't have seen the pictures and the messages. After that I never really touched her phone, after that as well I became very protective of my phone, I figured since I have this crippling fear of the truth, why should she know a thing about me. 

Eventually that led to a pretty toxic relationship, I loved her but between dealing with her, and moving, having no friends, no money or cigarettes, as well as missing her I just didn't know how I felt, but we both agreed to end things. It was fine, I felt indifferent. Then I was upset, mainly because all of my photos of her were ones of her smiling, so they were hard to delete. But after seeing her Snapchat, and then Reddit post, I turned to absolute hatred, I would pour myself a drink and think to myself about how much of a horrid, cheating lying cow that had been talking to another man while I planned on being faithful until we got enough funds to buy a flat out West. 

I've always felt the reason she cheated on me was my weight or attitude, so I tried to change both. I always tried to be calm and understanding, but I'm a very miserable, hateful and demanding person. And as for my weight I tried to lose some but it was a mission, I lost five kilos at most. But since her and I cut ties I haven't had a large meal and I've been instead of walking the dog we just run around the block. I will start to eat proper again but for know I'm calling it an extreme diet.

Now I feel okay, I know in my heart I hate her more than I love her, but when I remember what's happened instead of getting mad or upset I just remind myself feelings are like people in the sense they're maluable and fallable, they aren't permanent and in ten or so minutes I'll be fine, this helps me heaps. I just feel like an idiot for believing what I told myself, that it'll be fine. 

It's taken me an hour to write this, there are most likely grammar and spelling errors but it's very early hours of the morning and I just really wanted to write out my feelings to something else other than myself."

I was always there for her and she never reciprocated never put in effort and I still went back to her. And I still want to for some reason. I feel like I'll never be loved I just want a fucking hug. I want to be fucking cared about. It's that simple. Why is it soo fucking hard to find. I'm a good person who is fun to be around once you get to know me but I can never put myself out there. Idk why I struggle so much just being my fucking self. I know I'm a good fucking person and I know I have good qualities but I feel like I'll be alone forever. I just want to feel like I matter to one person. I just want one person to let me know they're thinking about me to tell me they love me and mean it.

I feel like most of my friends dont really care about me either. I feel like the 3rd or 4th friend to everybody and like I'm always trying to prove im a friend too. I feel like they only talk to me because they feel bad for me."

I used to have lots of fake friends and some very decent decent but a lot of my good friends have passed away and some of my true friends moved awat and we gradually drifted apart. The only person I speak to every day is my mother. Some days I may not speak to anybody. I don'y want to keep phoning my mother multiple times a day as she is ill herslf and I don't want to burden her with my problems as she is starting to get old and is very ill herself and I don't want to worry her as it will make her more ill. I would rather not have fake friends as they only want to have contact when thry need something like want to borrow money or tell me how crap their live is without being bothered how I am. An example was a couple when one of my friend came to visit a few years to to vent to me  about how crap his day was and about an hour later my other later to tell how much of a bad day they were having. They didn't know that I founf out one of my friends had died a few hours earlier, I didn'y tell them this as I didn't want to make their days worse and make them realise my day was worse than theirs put together. I tried to stay strong for them. I just want want people to know that that if they are having a bad day that there are people willing to listen and will try to help them. I have really bad days but try to not let it get me fown. If someone is having a bad day or needs to talk about anything feel free= to message me.

lonely,People say I'm cruel.,"People say I'm cruel. - I am 19, I only have 1 friend, when college started my friend told me to make friends in college, as he is in a different college so he thought I would be alone.

I started to approach people first time in my life, I never had a nice group of friends and I really wanted one, so I approached a big group who seemed warm at the start, but later they only called me when they needed me.

I have depression and sometimes I get abrupt mood swings without any warning (idk why), I only once lashed out at one of them and they told the whole group about it.

Know the whole group says, ""You're so cruel man"" and ignores me off.

Even though I have made huge progress for my confidence and social life, even so I always feel like I am not doing enough.

Every couple of days my brain just says ""Oi you, you need got out and get more friends and a girlfriend you missereable bastard"". Which of course is not a nice thought to be going though your head.

I know I am not alone with these thoughts and feeling at all.

For the record I have never had a girlfriend or even asked anyone out because I am to scared of being rejected. It's not even that I desperately want to have sex or anything I just want to to be held and hold someone else.

I know this post is all over the shop just asking for some thoughts or advice, just feels good to tell people what I am going though I suppose."

I just don’t understand why. I don’t want to end up like in high school again. Is it my fault? Is it my personality? Is it because I’m rather hesitant and “quiet”? I am so sad now because I feel more lonely than ever..."

It doesn't help that with me only if seems all sorts of technician errors keep coming which get me more stressed.
lonely,"I haven't met ""my people"" yet and I'm afraid it's too late (23/F)","I haven't met ""my people"" yet and I'm afraid it's too late (23/F) - I feel like I am missing out on life because I've never really had any friends that really made me feel loved, seen and understood. I was not a happy teenager. I grew up in a small place in the middle of nowhere with rather protective parents, so as soon as I graduated I moved out, jumping into adult life. My coping mechanism has always been to be in love with life, perceive everything, document everything... it definitely works for me, it fills in the gaps between lonely moments. And I think I've had  a nice and interesting life so far with lots of happiness and cool experiences, and I really value that, but there is also so much loneliness there.

At 23 I  try to keep myself as busy as I can in order to make up for it. My days are crammed full of studying and shifts at work. I have a boyfriend and we live together, and together with being around my coworkers and calling my mom every week or so that is sort of enough to keep my social needs satisfied, or so I guess. I just really miss having a group of friends that would get me on a deeper level and that I could do everything with I now do by myself. I don't want to spend my life just being at home, I'm really afraid of missing out. Fomo extraordinaire I guess. I've even gone to clubs and festivals alone when I was a bit younger/more desperate, although that's genuinely not something I can recommend lol. I do a lot of things with my boyfriend but we have quite different interests/personalities, and I feel awful bringing him along to something he doesn't enjoy.

Anyway, I just feel afraid that is really is too late. At this age everyone is getting so busy. People in their 20s become more focused on their jobs, significant others and personal growth and less so on friendships, it seems. It's like everybody has already experienced that phase of having a friend group that feels like family, going out at night and making memories but also just living at each other's houses, cooking together, platonically sharing beds, casual intimacy like that... I've only experienced it in fleeting moments (mainly with people I met for a very short while when I was backpacking) and I am afraid it really is too late.

Anyone here feeling similar?"
lonely,Anyone interested / willing to give advice to what I should do or feel?,"Anyone interested / willing to give advice to what I should do or feel? - **TLDR**: 

Somewhat lonely and socially awkward girl friendzoned me a few months ago, we still hang out and are decent friends, but I feel like shit that she seems like she would be the perfect person to accept me (given that she tells me that she is lonely and all) but I just aint it chief... 

I dont quite know how to feel... I cant be angry... everyone has the right to their own opinion... 

I dont want to let her go... she is genuinely my only female friend and is the only girl I can easily talk to... 

I know I shouldn't pursue her further... I don't want to lose her / push her away

I can't seem to ignore my feelings about her... I see her everyday and really like her, even if I tell myself that there are hopefully others out there.

**Long Story-Short:**

So I was friend-zoned by this girl two months ago but we still hang out in terms of having class together where we sit together and go out with friends sometimes. I keep on trying to tell myself nothing will happen or that she isn't in to me, and I should just be happy to have a decent female friend for once.

However, the more I hang out with her, not only do I find myself wanting her more, but also questioning myself: One thing we often can talk about is our loneliness and the fact we don't have a significant other. However, I realized how shitty it feels that even one of the more lonely and sad women in my school won't even give me a shot. 

I know it sounds as if I'm salty about her rejection of me, but from the stuff she talks to me about, about her staying up late, or not having a valentine, or her hating on people in relationships, I just feel like shit that she still rejects me.

I'm not angry at her, at least I tell myself that... like I can't be angry at her right? She has the right to reject me if I'm not her type or if she just isn't ready for a relationship. But, I just feel played that she seems like she wants somebody but I just ain't that person. 

I don't really know how to feel or do..."

I should add that i'm shy and a introvert person so this meant a lot to me. And he was the only guy in the hole class that enjoys the same things that i do, so it was easy for me to be myself with him.

The last year was our last year in highschool. During that yeat, he always said that he wanted to that year to end fast. Probably because he didn't like our classmates/ was tired of then, didn't know i was part of that group i guess.

We didn't talked to much (sounds weird, we were friends but we didn't tall that much). He enjoyed being alone. He liked to watch movies and read books, so he didn't payed that much attention to whats app.

We used to play videogames together. But he slowly stoped playing with me because he had a bad internet conection and didn't like me to hear his family trhought the mic.

So 2 days ago, i found that he wasn't in my friend list in all platforms posible (steam, uplay, origin etc). It was late so i didn't asked him what was happening. So when i woke up the next day and tried to send him a mesage, i discovered that he blocked me.

As i said before, he wanted to end that year fast. I always saw that as he wanted to end that part of his life and start a new one at uni. I don't think he hates me. In our graduation ( the last time i saw him irl, 4 months ago), he acted like he always did with me. He was the same dude i met 14 years ago.

I don't get why he would want to erase me from his life.  

This was longer but i deleted it by mistake and i didn't want to write it again. Thanks for reading."

lonely,Do i like to be lonely?,"Do i like to be lonely? - Idk, lately i have been feeling those strange feelings. I'm (22m), and i have done and conquered a lot of things that i wished when i was a teenager, things and wishes that i promised myself that when i would complete i would be happy. 

But now i'm not.

I feel that i'm being dramatic, and that i should be happy and feeling completed for the things i done, but the case is that  my mind are so strange by now...

I have a handsome GF that loves me and care about me, i'm finishing my course on a good college, have good parents, some friends and a propably good future. Some may say that i'm that average ""chad"" guy. Whatever. 

The case is that i am slowing going far and far away from people. And, although i know that's bad for my depression, i feel really ok by living by myself. 

By now i dont feel happy with people anymore, when i'm with them im anxious or just listless. The only times that i really feel quiet is when im working (i do home office) or when i'm working on my car or motorcycle by myself (handworks are a thing for me). 

So im going out with my friends and gf less and less because i don't feel glad to be with them anymore. And this freaks me out a little.

Lately the only thing that really gives me joy is to ""roll the cable"" on my motorcycle, almost hitting other things, just to feel that i'm still alive. Usually right after i stop speeding on it i feel extreme things, like guilty and an big fear that i could had been ended my life on the last street that i turned on.

I have a fear to kill myself by accident someday, as friends of mine that i used to know that died speeding.   I't passes through my mind that i could have ended my life on the last corner, or worst, ended another one's.

But what can i do? I take medicine, i do therapy, i pratice exercise. But i think that the social phobia is controlling my mind, and because of that i just feel good when I'm alone.

lonely,I'm now quite sad,"I'm now quite sad - I've often heard, ""It's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all."" I'm having a hard time agreeing with that one today. 

There is a girl (37 F) that I (41 M) have known for a few years. We kinda dated in the past but things never got serious and we sort of shifted to a friendship only role. I admit, this was more my doing than hers.

Over the past six months or so I've grown to know so much about her. I knew I certainly loved her as a friend but over this past six months I have realized that I've grown to love her as someone far more meaningful and simple than a friend. It has felt wonderful.

Quite recently after we did become briefly intimate (we would often flirt or cuddle) I felt a kiss with her that was not like any other kiss we shared before. I realized then and there that this is what I want. This is who I want to be with.

In the days following I told her this. What I received as a reply from her has left me broken. While I have been the one in the past keeping an emotional distance, in that time, she has found someone. This ""person"" of hers is more of a physical connection than an emotional one. I can't blame her as she has always been an intimate person and, well, desires have to be fulfilled. She is not at a time where she is willing to depart from this person's company and is not looking to pursue anything romantic with me.

I'm angry that she kept this part of her personal life a secret from me and she is sorry but alas, I now feel so alone. I have felt love for the first time since I was in love about 10 years ago. I was honestly starting to feel as thought I might not feel love again in my life.

Just wanted to vent and place some words on a medium. I fear I will have to distance myself from her now so that I can preserve my sanity and not have a constant feel of jealousy. Knowing this other person has a part of her life. Knowing I may never have her in the way I'd like to have her.

I'm just sad. Thank you for listening."

lonely,Help!!! I have high functioning autism and im trying to make new friends near my area but I don't know how if everyone doesn't understand me?,"Help!!! I have high functioning autism and im trying to make new friends near my area but I don't know how if everyone doesn't understand me? -  

I have tried making friends in multiple places but they all didn't work out so well. If you want to know how they went just pm me.

I am mainly looking for people with long, long hair that are looking for a new friend to get to know. I honestly don't understand why I like hair so much but I think its part of my autism.

I honestly hate saying I have autism cause im afraid ill never fit in to society because of it. I do have my issues that make me similar to autistic people and other traits that make me similar to normal people.

What the average person thinks about an autistic person

If you met an autistic person how would you react?

What the average person might not know that makes autistic people different from regular people is that people with autism like to touch things a lot. I know this may seem super strange and people frequently don't like to be touched by other people but member autistic people can't help it.

Also another reason why I feel like autistic people won't fit in well like me is that people with autism arent good at speaking to other people that well. For some people its really hard to have a conversation with another person or get nervous and freak out. Autistic people are very anti social than regular people.

Another reason about autistic people that regular people don't understand is how they act. Every autistic person is different from another. One may like repeating peoples names but they can't help it. Another one may like a certain word or do a certain motion that might make the other person question what the hell are they doing and leave them.

Another thing about autistic people is that they think in a very different way than the average person thinks. They think slower than the average person. The only difference is being autistic people are very freaking smart because they think things more clearly and in a more procedures manner than regular people. When an autistic person is put on the spot they usually get really nervous and studder a lot.

Autistic people also don't know how to react to certain situations like talking on the spot to a big group of people. Maybe a natural disaster they wont know where to go or do so they freak out. Who knows what disabilities these people have but they need assistance as well.

All I ask of you Reddit is to accept people like this and try to help them grow to be successful people like for example this guy who is an actual comedian has Asperger Syndrome: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBVpgyIXllw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBVpgyIXllw).

Comparing Me to a low functioning autistic person

The differences between me and the regular autistic person is that im trying to make friends even though im a bit nervous about exposing myself cause I feel like ill get teased left and right by bullies but I am trying to make friends I really am. I also try to talk to normal people but it usually doesn't work out that well because people often enough don't understand my reasoning and try to stear me the wrong way. I don't want to be mean at all but my face is not that ugly I look like a normal person on the outside. I can react to a natural disaster in a ok manner and I don't freak out as bad.

The similarities I have with autistic people is that I love to touch long hair (on gjrls no dolls or wigs, real hair on girls). You see I like to touch things as well. I did use to repeat peoples names back when I was in grade school but I stopped that cause it got really freaking annoying. I am also sometimes very smart and other times im just a fucking retard."

lonely,Be kind to people you don’t understand,"Be kind to people you don’t understand - I don’t know if anyone will read this or if it will get lost in the river of posts but I’ll try and explain myself..

There’s always that one person that gets under my skin where ever I go, like the guy that likes to rib people all the time, thinks life is a big joke for example.
I’ve lived a solitary life for now 15 years because my family disowned me for not being in their religion and when people are really cheerful and just “everything will work out eventually” Attitude I kind of just rather not be around them. 

Now for the title, I’ve discovered that there are two types within this context,ones that have a lot good fortune, thus can not fathom how life could be difficult for anyone, until shit falls on them and then it’s everyone’s fault. And then those who know life is difficult but having a little hope(positivity) in that they will come out on top with some fortune.

The first group is harder to be kind to, but still deserve it, the second group I see everywhere.

Just people trying their best and trying to keep the smile train going.

I’m now part of that second group definitively. Trying my best not to make those hiding their depression or anxiety feel judged or lesser. Everyone, in my opinion, deserves the benefit of doubt that they wouldn’t do things maliciously. Absent-minded, but not malicious.
If we can we should try to become allies with strangers, with each other. Close the divide as much as we can, whether online or offline and in person. 

The lonely life ends when you see value in people around you, that all people are capable of change and improvement.

No one is perfect, in fact, perfect doesn’t exist, nothing stays the same, ever. 
Give people a chance, I guarantee you that those who reciprocate the kindness and maybe love will do so because you gave them a chance.

Ultimately  be kind when ever you can, the world wants you realize that we all work for ourselves but it doesn’t explain that it’s so we can be together in this experiment called society.

Just do your best to be kind, I’ll do my best, and maybe we can change our culture of compounding loneliness."

lonely,The nights just crush me.,"The nights just crush me. - I used to go over to her house at night, and I'd hold her as she held her toddler, and we'd watch crime shows. Now I just feel so alone. I miss holding her. I miss hanging out with her baby; little dude legitimately enjoyed my company. I thought she did. She wanted to see me everyday. I thought I could maybe have that life and maybe actually be a husband and a father. Maybe I could have that. Then she dropped me. The messed up thing is, I actually thought I could have it. I would have done a good job. I would have valued her and treated her like a queen.

It's been a month and I find myself checking her Facebook all the time. The nights just crush me. I feel so alone. I miss kissing her. I miss holding her. And I get why she left; I'm not anybody's first pick. But I would treat her right. I would do my best. Now I'm just so afraid I'm going to die alone. Why can't I find someone to care about me? I feel like I'm a good person. I just want to share this life with someone who cares about me and I can care about. I love listening to girls. I love empathizing. I love cuddling.

lonely,Distrust Towards Everyone,"Distrust Towards Everyone - Randomly decided to look up this sub just so I could lift some weight off my chest. Maybe someone could agree with me on this. I've had frequent rage outbursts in the past that dictated my world view during and shortly after. Now that , I have come to understand those outbursts were not just random or for a reason that was obvious. I believe that they strongly indicated, what has now become, a hatred of society and reality. After developing this introspective pov, I think I am understanding where I am heading in my life as much as I can and honestly... It's fucking sad. I think I am a pretty nice kid overall, but after seeing the morality of some people, how cruel this world can really be and the actual meaningless of it all, really did mess me up. Don't get me wrong, I have the ability to make friends and blend in with society and my feelings towards those people aren't fake... Although, they might as well be. All it takes is for me to be isolated and that optimistic pov fades away and the hatred temporarily comes back. 

Just to give you context, I don't really get out much besides school, nor want to. To me, going outside is boring and meaningless which could be how I am digging my own grave, but that's a whole another debate. BUT, my main issue, is the difference in morality of a lot of people these days. Ever since I was 13, I came across e-girls naturally. At first it seems like everything is cool and all, but after like a few weeks or months of talking to them, I get to see this immoral side of them. Not really going to get  too specific, but I'm sure you can get remotely close to the idea. I don't know if I could even explain it if I had to. It's just something I've noticed with them. A lot of people have the mindset of 'oh well, it's just e-girls, what do you expect?' While I understand that pov, let's be fucking real, those are real people. It is both a blessing and a curse. If it weren't for e-girls, my distrust in people wouldn't be where it is today. With that said, I don't understand why things have to be this way. I can't tell at this point if I have a god complex I am unaware about but knowing that I will end up alone and perhaps always have been alone, is fucking sad. I've always wanted a twin brother, just so I could have someone who understands me more than anyone else. I like my friends, but I don't trust them, I love my family, but I don't know.."

i'm not a loser, i mean when you talk to me you'd realize that i'm not someone who's unbearable to be around, i'm average, not the brightest and not the dumbest, not cringy, not unfunny, and know some poeple that say they wanna help; but when push comes to shove, they're really hesitant to help, so that's why i don't feel i have trustworthy friends.

but fuck me who cares what i am we all are people with things and features.

now the good part, at the age of 13 my brother became schizophrenic, he became too violent, and i've spent 14 years, trying to be there and stop him whenever he tries to hurt my other family members, and i met the wrong people who made fun of my sadness and my hell, the kind of people you try to please so that they see the good in you, but they're too bitter to see the good in themselves in the first place

 which left me with trust issues, a broken home, and i was bright at school, but i stopped caring, and failed my last year at high school, and stopped trying, i no longer care, and i no longer want this apathy, but what can i do, it's just how it is, i'm alone, i'm broke and broken and with nothing to lose, and i don't even want to win anything.

to whom ever that will read this, if it's just your girlfriend that you broke up with, and you're so sad about it you think you're depressed, get your shit together, because if you think it's cute to be sad, it's really sad to be sad, it's crushing when it's dark and unbearable"

I'm a 21m, I've seen alot of the post looking for someone to talk to and if you need to them come chat me up. Always love a good meme or two. I'm into all sorts of gaming and music. So just send me a message I don't bite."

The only one I didn't had a lost wife.
I wrote Lovecraftian Horror and Noir, one Romance that ended in the death of the wife. 
Not because I want my characters to suffer or anything, I just want to reflect a bit of my loneliness. I feel my art should be a piece of me, so that's what I chose."
lonely,At least something to hold in common,"At least something to hold in common - Sometimes I feel like there's nowhere I belong. It feels like I've been excluded from just about every friend group, gathering, relationship, and family dynamic I've tried to be a part of. I've never felt like I fit in, not that I don't love being weird, but it feels like everyone around me already has someone and doesn't need nor want me around. I don't like being normal, I like to make an effort to do everything as wrong or weird as possible. Most of the time though, I cease up and crawl in my own shell because I'm too afraid of acting out and ruining more friendships. Sometimes it feels like I forgot how to be a human. I don't really know where to go to find friends, I don't know how to open up to the ones I have, I have a lot to share, but my brain just turns off when I try to open up. Thank you for reading my little vent, I'm here all week. &lt;3"
lonely,20F and i’ve never had someone who truly cared about me or that I can confide in. I have hope it will get better.,"20F and i’ve never had someone who truly cared about me or that I can confide in. I have hope it will get better. - I’ve been crying all day about how lonely I am randomly. It’s really come to my attention now because my birthday is coming up &amp; I can’t think of anyone who would wish me happy birthday except my parents &amp; two acquaintances. All my life, I’ve spent a lot of time at home and alone. In high school, I had friends but it was never deep. I’ve only had friends by circumstance. After I moved, we all stopped talking. Then, I met new “friends” and then after the circumstance that brought us together was done we grew apart. IDk why this happens to me. I just want a good group of reliable friends that I can open up to. But then again, I feel like I don’t have the social skills to open up because I’ve never really done it before. Plus, I’m realizing more that I kind of struggle to keep a conversation going and am quite shy at first when I meet people. This makes it hard to make friends. How does one make true life friends? It’s so hard. But, I am so happy I found this thread. I felt so alone and now I know so many people can relate to what I have been going through! Idk what the point of this post was but I just wanted to share the thoughts that I’ve been sobbing about. I have hope it will get better!"
lonely,Anyone feel like they are destined to be lonely?,"Anyone feel like they are destined to be lonely? - I've been lonely all my life, and no matter what I do I feel like I'm always alone at  school or of all the jobs I had in my life I tend to be only working by myself. I never really talked to my parents while growing up, and I've been told I'm really attractive and I am very active, but I just can't seem to make a friend or attract a girl who would want me to stay in their life, I'm always told why don't I have a girlfriend and I honestly feel like they should ask why I don't have a friend first. I've tried to meet people through apps, programs, or work, school but it seems i'm always left out and forgotten with any little friendship I get.  I remember I had a class everyone had a partner in except me, and it took a huge toll on me. I tried at one point to embrace it, sometimes I could, but when I couldn't it hurt too much. I try to be the brightest and friendliest person, but that doesn't work in my case. I'm seriously considering the military because I was told about the brotherhood it brings, but I'm betting to myself it will be the same."
lonely,Doughnut spare boyfriend,"Doughnut spare boyfriend - Guys, and/or girls, have you ever been in a relationship where the other person is not your significant other but almost?  I have done this not once but a couple of times.   The other person leans on you emotionally,  there may even be a little physical affection, but not all the way, and there is definitely sexual tension at least on your part.  This person gets all the benefits of being your partner, but without the commitment or complete physical intimacy or exclusivity.  Then when this person finds a real boyfriend or girlfriend, your closeness diminishes significantly.  They usually don't abandon you, but you are not nearly as close to you as when they were ""single"" or more like in between ""real"" relationships.   I am doing this right now.  However, unlike the previous time, this person is being honest and transparent, in that although they care for me a great deal, they feel that I'm not their type; that being intimate would ruin the friendship; that she is horrible at relationships, and therefore I'm better off not being with her; etc.   At same time this person will cuddle and kiss me,  use the ""L"" word and I even ""sleep"" with me sometimes, but I don't have sex with them.  Like seriously in the same bed, cuddling, and even kissing is OK, but nothing more.  So this is what I mean by a doughnut spare boyfriend, in that I am not her real boyfriend, and when/if she does get one, I will be stored away again for the next emergency.

Am I an idiot for doing this?  This person has actually helped me, and has not used me for money or anything like that.   Of course I shower her with attention and adoration, while being far less demanding of her than a real boyfriend, so there's that. 

What do you think?  Has this ever happened to you?  Is it abusive?  Is it exploitative? Is it only she that is abusing or exploiting me or am I doing so as well towards her?  Am I as much to blame?  Or is she? Or are we both playing each other?  Your thoughts and opinions are appreciated."
lonely,"I'm so lost, need people to talk to","I'm so lost, need people to talk to - I don't know what I hope to gain by posting this to here, but to say I'm lonely is an understatement. It's the type of social isolation mixed with social anxiety that just leaves someone feeling hopeless and 100% alone. I just work hard, go home, and lay around depressed with my little free time because I don't know what else to do. I wish I just had a girlfriend, but being attractive doesn't seem to help me, so somehow I have to break out of this loop... I just don't know how. Honestly I don't even care where the girl is from at this point, I just want one my age to talk to. 19m, usfl

Things that won't work in my situation: dating apps/ social media, friends (cause I have none anymore lol), college"
lonely,I had a dream about my was best friend last night,I had a dream about my was best friend last night - My best friend and I stopped talking a few months ago after a few months of minimal contact from her even when I tried. Last night I had a dream where we starting talking again and we saw each other. I felt so happy because the emotions of the dream were so strong. However it turns out that upon waking I am still the same person with no real friend who has any care in the world about me. I constantly suffer with getting close to people and then just as I was talking to my best friend again I woke up. It honestly felt so horrible. I really have no one to talk to. Sometimes I can’t even decipher my own feelings in my head and I just want one person to care about me but I can’t and probably wouldn’t let anyone become that close of friends with me.

lonely,This will basically sum up my loneliness,"This will basically sum up my loneliness - ()I get up, go to school, have no one to talk to, and drive home. Then do homework, watch tv or Youtube,go to bed, and start over. This is how boring life gets when all your friends move away and stop caring about you. You eventually get stuck in this shithole and find no way to escape, because by now no one is interested in your simple life that resulted from your loss of friends."

lonely,I isolate myself and I hate it,"I isolate myself and I hate it - It's only gotten worse and worse over the past two years. I'm 20 years old and rather than have a social life, I get home from work and smoke until I cant feel the loneliness anymore. It's gotten progressively harder to do anything else but that. To the point where even if I'm invited out by friends, I'd rather stay home and kill all my feelings. 

Around a year a ago I met someone and for the brief amount of time we were seeing each other it was like all my confidence came back to me. I WANTED to go out to places with her. My abuse towards weed also dropped dramatically which even surprised me. Needless to say, it never got serious and she stopped talking to me.

I've been alone all my life and I don't know how much longer I can go on feeling like this. I don't even have the will power to try and get better, most of my self worth has been lost. The worst thing is that to everyone around me none of this is apparent at all. I'm fucking incapable of showing emotion to people and it eats me up inside. If my mom or any of my friends knew how fucked up I was I don't know what they'd even say. 

I'm stuck in this downward spiral and I'm scared because as the days go on I accept it more and more as my reality. I'm at the point where I wish I was just numb so I don't have to cry in the shower every morning"

During the day I’ll be at work and I’ll feel immersed in that, but life outside of work feels empty, lonely and meaningless. I exercise, go out from time to time, have a few hobbies though I don’t often feel in the mood for them. What do you fill your evenings with when you’re done with cooking and chores?"

Whenever I see the girl I just not even have the balls to go talk to her because I believe I would be wasting my time. I have nothing to offer, I'm ugly af, and basically the opposite of what you would look for. I swear that I try to change but life doesn't want let me feel loved. I have been rejected multiple times before. I feel jealous of those that have experienced it and I kinda hate them. I just feel lonely af man."

Nothing from the people who I thought were my friends. And the number of people who do wish me a happy birthday dwindles every year. It reminds me how lonely I feel, and how I barely have any real friends. And the real friends I do have are living really far away from me. Idk.... it just sucks. Everything sucks. People suck. And I suck for getting so hung up about people not wishing me a happy birthday. I just don’t feel like I matter. And now I don’t want to put effort in anything cause what’s the point."

I have now been reduced to nothing but filler in crowds!

But one sort drifted from me, and another i pushed away through arrogance and stupidity. but i am glad to be rid of this last friend. she was manipulative and unhealthy for me.

I am feeling so sad for him. But I don't know how to console him. And there isn't a culture for me to talk it out with him. I really really wish I could talk to him. But frankly speaking I don't know how to? Plus how would he react? He may get angry that a young man half his age is trying to console a mature guy like him.

2)PLEASE DO NOT UPVOTE, REALLY DO NOT WANT TO FARM KARMA.

lonely,"Lonely, sad, failing, angry parents, no friends to talk to..","Lonely, sad, failing, angry parents, no friends to talk to.. - Hello everyone, I'm 23M and I feel really lonely and sad.  I've been really lazy and least bothered with studies for the last few years so I have been consistently failing in my exams. So I've passed out of my final year in college but I still have some papers that I didn't pass in so I need to clear them before I can get my graduate certification. This has made my parents really angry and really disappointed. My results just came out yesterday and I failed in 2 subjects and my parents are really pissed off. They aren't really fond of me especially because my older sister is an overachiever and she's now a doctor.

I've been staying back home for the past many months and all I do is stay up in my room using my laptop or phone to play games, watch movies, series, anime, YouTube etc
I try my best to not avoid any conversations with my parents because many times it has ended in an argument and I'm just so sick of that. 

I'm thinking of getting a job but I'm not how I'll do in interviews.. And my failure in my college doesn't help boost my confidence either.  
So I keep thinking about it but idk if I should act on it or not.. 

I'm quite socially awkward and so I didn't really make any proper friends in college. The only friends I have are my childhood friends. And most of the times they now act like I don't exist because they have other people they prefer to hang out with and a few of them are busy with jobs. 
And it's really sad when they post pictures of places they visited and I had no idea about it. 
Occasionally I do get invited in some plans to go somewhere and that makes me happy.

Sometimes I just grab my bike and head out on my own to roam around the city and eat something by myself to get away from home and because I feel my friends won't be interested. 

I feel like I'm wasting my youth because everyone seems to be out having fun but I just feel like a sad soul. I haven't even had a girlfriend yet (unless a few week long online relationships count). I wonder if my life will get better later on if I'm spending my youth like this. 

So I try to compensate for all of this by talking to people online and making online friends. Making friends online can be quite a challenge because many times people just wanna troll, be rude or completely uninterested in being friends with me. And when I make friends, they talk for some time and then lose interest and dissappear, or block me which hurts so much. 
But I do have a few online friends that I cherish. 
Many times it just feels like I'm forcing someone to talk to me and that's a terrible feeling too.. 

Thank you for reading my longer post. Just needed a place to vent since I don't really have anyone to do it irl. 
If someone wants to be friends, please feel free to send a message. I'm always up for a nice conversation."
lonely,veteran loner,"veteran loner - hi there, i am a 27 years old female. i am an only child. i was the black sheep thru school years. i was in so much distress, sadness, because i couldn't fit in, it was the worst. for a few years i have tried to accept that i am a loner, and it feels much better. the only things are the few occasions when i get the feels i need some company. these feels get triggered a few times a year, for a short time but otherwise i embraced my solitude. and i feel like my pet helps me thru all the shit, and my good family. i am fortunate with my family i really know. i will be forever thankful.

but still, today at work, i found this sub, i really like it, i really found myself in many posts, at least partially, or in some of them - fully.

i completely agree with the ones about meaningless human relations, online, or irl. i feel like i can't fit fully in any friend circles, i will be neglected by people who say ***""oh you are one of my best friends!!!""*** etc. i can safely say, i thought once i had a real best friend. but i just thought, reality was different. i don't know how does it feel to have someone reliable (outside of family), who could comfort you if you feel down, or sometimes even visit you. i dunno. this might be one thing i still want to happen, but kinda tired of seeking forcefully.

the concern about myself that i don't think i ever felt love (and i mean the lovey-dovey one). i feel i might be unable to. no kidding here, i don't want to seem to keep a rock inside of my chest, but i might. i never had a real relationship because of this.

even if i am kinda cold, i give really good advices, i am a really good listener. i happily help if needed. but if anyone is considering to contact me, please think about the word ***""mutual""***. i am done with one way connections.

thanks for reading."

lonely,I think I have a problem,"I think I have a problem - I don't mean to sound edgy or something but I'm starting to dislike people in general. I don't have any friends, IRL or online and I'm not very close to my family.

I tried making online friends on Reddit and those stupid dating apps for friends but it always ends the same way. I put in 100% of the effort trying to have good conversations, I researched conversational techniques and all that crap, but nobody ever messages me first, nobody asks me how I'm doing, all I get is a single sentence closed off response. I probably have like 50 dead conversations on discord and Reddit where I just decided that I'll wait and see if they ever message me (spoiler: that was 3 months ago and I never heard from them again)

I've tried anything I could think of, I tried to befriend men, women and everything in between but it's always the same, nobody cares.

I tried making friends IRL too obviously, I went to events, meetups and courses, I got a membership at a gym and I went to bars, clubs and sports games but nothing works for me, I do talk to people and even make some of them laugh. Sometimes they even stay around to exchange contact information but then a week later it turns out they never have time to do anything with me, like not even talk on the phone.

And I don't even want to try anymore. Because obviously I'm not worth it. Some retarded crackhead creeping on little girls has his crackhead friends and I don't even have that, what have I done?? Why do literal murderers and molesters have friends, relationships and family while I have nothing? Just because I happen to be a bit of a quiet guy????? 

I don't fucking care anymore (that was a lie, I still care very much) I just want to work for a bit to save some money and then move to Alaska into the middle of nowhere or something so I don't have to look at all these shitty normal people that don't deserve anything they have and don't even appreciate it.

I'm so glad I at least still have my cat, getting a cat was the best decision of my life. I want to get more cats."

I'm  and ever since I turned 18 my parents have been really trying to get me to move out. It's not that I don't want to move out, I do but I'm scared and have no where to go as of right now. So, I spent a few nights on the street and eventually they let me back in. That was two weeks ago. Fast forward to now. This last week I met someone online who lives in another country but he is amazing and I've never felt the way I do about him. So, I'm trying to deal with that and not feel so much like the things I say are stupid and that I'm scared to lose him. Then last night after we said goodnight, my plans changed from doing nothing to babysitting for my mom's friend. That went well. But when I got home, my mom flipped out about my acne. I recently broke out and have dark spots on my left cheek now. I'm extremely self-conscious about my acne. I feel like I'm expected to be some perfect pretty girl bc that's how I lived my life for a few years. But things have changed. And people still say I'm pretty but it hurts bc I don't feel that way inside. After she was done yelling at me and saying really hurtful things (she's been doing this my whole life), I had a rush of all these emotions that I have shoved away for so long. I had thoughts like ""I'm just f\*\*d up and ugly and I don't deserve love"" and I also felt really suicidal last night but I was scared that if I did do something then I would end up hurting the guy I met and I really care about him. I cried more than I've cried in years. The only thing I've wanted for my entire life is to just be normal. At one point I just excepted that I'm different and so I decided that the two things I want in my life to feel complete are peace and happiness. I'm worried that when we do finally meet that he will just run the other way bc I'm awkward but when I'm typing things it's easier for me to come across as confident. And now my problem is whether or not I should tell him what happened last night or just say that I'm fine. I feel like I say too many of my emotions that go through my head. I don't wanna be the kind of girl who just talks abut her problems. I try to be positive. But last night was just so rough. idk what to do. I'm also wondering if my family is just too toxic for me and if I should just move on and not be close to them anymore. It's scary to think about bc I know that one day I will need a mom and dad. idk..

lonely,Didn’t talk to someone in days,"Didn’t talk to someone in days - Well, I had many friends in school to a certain point and was a very outgoing person. Losing all my friends, having family issues and getting raped broke me to the point where I wanted to die so horribly. I was severely depressed for 7 years and am probably still a little depressed. I don’t wish to die that often anymore but right now I don’t even have online friends to talk to. They were a really good distraction so I didn’t bother getting help and isolated myself even more from society. I basically lived alone since I’m like twelve. It was easy to skip school a lot and I just escape reality with the help of videogames. In real life it’s really hard for me to look people in the eyes or make conversation in general. I know for a fact that I don’t really look approachable and I’m also too shy to do that deed myself. But I feel like I would’ve been extroverted if it wasn’t for my depression. I hate being this lonely and I’m losing my sanity. I know I have to change something but it feels so impossibly hard for me and I don’t know where to start. My next semester only starts in 2 months and until then I have literally nothing to do. Nothing is fun to me, I need people around me so badly.

Tried to be a good friend for those in hard times or When they feel down

lonely,Feeling blue. Give it a read and some suggestion?,"Feeling blue. Give it a read and some suggestion? - Loneliness is a tricky companion. It seeps into your bones, and before you know it, it has made a home under your skin. There it stays, living in harmony with your fears and insecurities. Loneliness is what the voice in your head tells you you deserve, for being you, for being difficult, for being so hard to love. 

Loneliness becomes a shield. Once you're good at being lonely, you find safety in the quiet, empty spaces. There is no rejection there. You are never the odd one out when you're alone.  
  
Loneliness becomes an excuse. It is a weapon you use against yourself. There is no one there to judge you for your choices. Making excuses is a lot easier when you’re the only one who has to buy them. 

Even though I know that I have love in my life, sometimes when I’m on my own, loneliness still hits me like a hammer. It ripples out into my body like waves on a lake that you toss a stone into, and its momentum seems unstoppable.

But I am here to tell myself you are complete, just the way you are. There is nothing wrong with you because you are single and feeling lonely. You are a whole and consummate human being without a significant other. The lies loneliness tells you are untrue.

Please also know this: no one is ever truly alone. There is someone out there who is thinking of you. You are someone’s favorite person, your voice is someone’s favorite voice. Most of You matter. Even when it doesn’t feel like it, you matter. But I definitely not feel so

And as drake says ""Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone "" 
So hold on. When loneliness tries to tell you that this is the only way you will ever feel, hold on. As I have been learning over the last few weeks, if you simply do your best to spend time with the people you love, and take care of yourself in the process, the loneliness will ebb away again. You just have to hold on"

lonely,Dreams,"Dreams - I had the dreams again. Different demon this time. I’ve been having these dreams ever since I came back from basic training. These dreams that, are so vivid I can remember my first one from 2015. We were clearing this house ( I won’t mention names because they are all still serving)it was multi story. I can remember “G” took the stares up and me and “I” continued down the hall. He was clearing his room and I breeched the farthest room down the hall. 

 The first thing I saw was wood paneling on a wall. Looked cheap, like one of the old houses I grew up in. It had a shag blue carpet with a barred window on the right side of the room. There was an analog tv at the very end of the room. 
 
 I stopped for a moment and breathed steam. My core was hit with ice and the demon or image or monster appeared. I can only describe it as a demon because it’s malicious. It doesn’t have good in it. You can feel how evil it is and you can’t get away from it. I looked out the door to “I”s face and I screamed his name in horror. I went to reach for the door but it slammed in my face. I looked back at the thing, and it screamed this guttural scream that made my ears ring. It told me to get out. At this point, it’s the only thing I wanted. But it wouldn’t let me. It charged me and the dream ended with me in sweat. 


That was the first dream. I’ve had 5-8 since because the frequency and different situations and people involved make it hard to remember everything. Except for the demons. Last night was this little girl. She had violently green eyes and would take this child that I feel looked new to me but in my heart I knew her. In the dream I wasn’t me. I was a different man and had a different wife. I knew immediately what I was dealing with in the dream though and I started to moving everyone out of the house. I fought the demon or thing, it didn’t want us or it really just wanted the kid. The words it used, it felt like someone was cutting into my soul. 

 In that point of my dream, I’ve learned from past ones to keep moving. You’ll get out quicker. We make it out of the house and I tell my wife who looks nothing like my wife in real life, to “get in the car, don’t look back at the house, and don’t look in the windows.” The dream ended. 

I’m suppose to be waking up my guys now because of a mission we are tasked with today, but I just wanted to put this shit on paper and see if anyone else has experience with this. Thanks.

To make matters worse; I'm male, and that really doesn't help when it comes to advice; people just don't care as much.

Given where I work making friend irl is not an option unless I have the energy to go out after work which for the most part I don’t. I just want something real for once. I have trust issues and struggle with depression. For the most part the problem currently is I’m knowingly letting people use my kindness against me. The solution Ik you may say : don’t or find new people to be around. Easier said then done.

I have very few choices in life. Not because of how rich or poor I am. Not because of how smart or dumb I may be. Not because of where I live. But the reason we have such limited choices is because that's how the world works. You either work your whole life or become homeless. Of course there may seem like alternatives, but they all end the same way. Work, fight, or do nothing. 

I just wish there was a way out where people wouldn't care about me when I'm dead. Just a way to say: "" Hey, im done, I just want to leave now"". 

I dont want to kill myself because it seems selfish to leave my family. I dont want to say to them: ""I dont want to talk to you anymore"". I just want them to understand that I really dont want to do this anymore. Yet, if I told them, they would freak out and put me in a place where I couldn't hurt myself and then I would have to live out the rest of my days in there, or find a faster way out.

There may be a third alternative route amd that's to be locked up and do almost nothing for the rest of your life, but that could almost fall under the homeless category.

I just wish I had more of an influence of where I go and how I was born.

lonely,Just got out of a relationship. Don't know what to do.,Just got out of a relationship. Don't know what to do. - My SO and I have decided to end our relationship after so long of trying to make it work. I don't know where to start meeting people and making friends again. I always had her. I can't expect everybody to be available all the time. Just feeling very alone lately.
lonely,I’ll be alone on my 30th birthday.,"I’ll be alone on my 30th birthday. - I’ll be turning 30 come next Monday. It’s weird, that age seems like such a large milestone in life, but as the date gets closer I just don’t really give a fuck — well at least that what I tell myself in my head. 

I’ve been very fortunate in life as having people around me. As a kid, through high school, moving away to college and then working in that area I’ve always had friends around me. I was never an individual who would reach out to people and somehow they always were drawn to me.  You know asking me lunch, to hangout, etc. Even though I can be social at times and enjoy it, my personality always tends to pull me away from people. I like my own time and always need time to recharge from people or the world. As I’ve gotten a little older.. I feel like that required time to recharge has increased and that need or urge to be alone is something I look forward to. 

As an important side note. During my first semester of college I met this girl I absolutely fell in love with. We dated just shy of 4 years until she destroyed my heart haha. She was quirky and probably out of my league, but over those 4 years we got extremely close. I’ve never had such a relationship with someone that had such a large impact on my life. To this date I’m at least still in love with the idea of her.. or at least the type of the relationship we had together. I’ve tried to date since then.. but have ended everything because I cannot feel anything as real as I did with her. As of now I haven’t had a real relationship with someone for about 6 years... and that number is killing my soul. 

The reason I am bringing up this side story is because I feel like overtime is developed into me in no longer trying to build relationships with people because the person doesn’t feel real or at least as impactful. Maybe it’s because I do not have any history with them. I would almost go as far as saying people feel fake to me.. like they aren’t actually human beings. This  idea scares the shit out of me, but I cannot help but feel this way. Often times I need to ground myself and get back into reality.  Also, spending a ton of time alone fuels this idea sadly.. sometimes I feel like I am trying to not go crazy. 

So.. 2 years ago I felt like was in quite the rut and needed a change. I wanted to fight this and maybe a new environment would help. I decided to pick up and move to a new city.. start something fresh. I got a good job, made some fiends (who moved away), and made a little life for myself here. But I’ve realized quickly living in a new city.. mixed with this need to isolate myself/recharge, having no history with anyone, and this weird issue of thinking people are not real is really taking its toll on me. It’s almost like I’m putting direct effort in turning people away so I can be alone... which is indirectly fueling this depression issue and making me feel extremely lonely. 

Very recently and becuAse this 30 number is saving me, I have been putting direct effort into working out and trying super hard to be social when I can... but my god do I feel so god damn alone all of the time even when I’m around people. If didn’t have my dog I would be in such a deeper depression. I feel confident in saying if it wasn’t for her I would be on brink of going crazy or in a very very very dark place. I don’t think I’d ever do any physical harm to myself, but at least the phrase “i want to kill myself” enters my head at least 10 times a day. Not seriously.. but just a phrase burned in my mind.. which really translate into “I hate life”.

I think typing this up has actually helped me a ton to kind of Define what’s happening to me. It’s probably fucking incoherent.. but w/e typing this out is helping me realize I am fighting this depression and loneliness. It’s about baby steps... and patting yourself on the back even on the smallest of things.  

 I don’t know really what the point of the post was, but turning 30 here shortly has really scared me. I say I don’t give a fuck but I do. I will be alone this year... and it’s really do to my personality and need to turn people away. I need to work on myself first.. and then take the time to listen to others. I think being patient with others, listening, and trying to see the person for who they are will help me build history and break down this “fake human being” idea I’ve developed in my head. 

Again.. not sure where this went but I hope maybe someone can relate to this. I am going to beat this god damn depression, somehow not go crazy, And make direct effort in not being lonely. If anything.. ima do it for my dog more then me...I fuccking love that little hairball on 4 legs.. she my true support system."

That which creeps upon you, waiting to strike.
It lets you have your fun, and to be with those who you find closest.
Yet that moment when you find yourself in isolation, it strikes.
It takes all of the moments and things that you found fun and enjoyable, and makes them feel as if they were but a distraction from that which is about to come.
That feeling of sadness, which washes away all the good moments, and replaces them with the bad.
That sadness which is nigh unnescapable.
You want desperately to no longer feel alone.
You want desperately to just have love.
You want desperately for the void to be filled.
You want desperately for the they who would fill it:
They who you could talk to unendingly.
They who you could be intimate with.
They who you could hold tightly.
They who you could come home to.
They who you could remain by their side as they fell asleep in your arms.
You try to reach for they as such with all you can muster.
You extend your grasp is search.
This search yet proves unsuccessful, for when you cannot be happy with yourself, you cannot be happy with others.

I just want to be happy being completely alone. I wish I could do that. I can't even be bothered to try to kill myself again. I'm too scared of failing again, at least for now.

lonely,Push,Push - Existing hurts. Having no one who really cares about you is so isolating. I can’t turn to the family around me. This is an ongoing nightmare. I feel like self-harming but I’m always chickening out the second I’m about to cut. I don’t want to fuck up &amp; hit a vein. I just want this pain to feel physical to match my mental torment. Every day is a test to see when will I give up and just end my suffering. Some people have drugs but I only have certain moments of escapism with music. The distraction only lasts so long.

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

I was so used to being needed (despite it being unhealthy) that now, even 6 months after breaking up, I feel empty without them.

lonely,Last few months have been rough,"Last few months have been rough - I guess I was never special to someone. I've always felt unwanted. Even a kid, parents told me they would have left eachother if I wouldn't have been. Had no friends in kindergarten, primary or middle. In highschool I was that kid you would be friendly with just because he was the class clown. Always left out if it was possible. I've always had to go the extra mile just to be around someone. College is no good either, you think you know lots of people, yet all they want is help for their homework. You think this girl might like you, even as a friend, talking to you everyday, yet once the exams are over she blocks you. That hurt the most.

That just who I am, always the last choice. For my birthday, I've tried to gather some people I know, in advance. Everyone had something else to do, even the people that said they could come. ""I'm really sorry, I forgot"". For new years eve, they asked why I didnt come, only after realizing they forgot to invite me. No one has time for me, yet I'm always trying my best to help them, buy them stuff they wanted for a long time, wish them happy birthday and all. 

But it's ok, I'll just survive life on autopilot, working and drinking until I forget about everything. I just wish I could stop crying at night."

There wasnt much in it but a lovely card and some small stuff, but i told them i didnt want presents so i didnt expect much. However all this made me feel really sad. There were 2 people writing me happy birthday on whatsapp and its not like i need the attention but somehow the birthday always gives me the sense of how insignificant i am. Yet another year goes by and the older i get the lonlier the days of my birthday are. It kinda shows me that i live on my own and despite of having friends in my life i feel like i dont really have someone outside my family who truely cares about me when it comes hard on hard.

I used to love my dad more than anything. He was jovial, empathetic, and endlessly creative, even after divorcing my mother. For many years, he was all I had. The only hope in my tiny, teenage world.

Then he got a fancy job in Connecticut, and moved. Things changed after that.

For a long time I felt that the world was collapsing around me. The friends I had made began leaving because of how much of a shitty person I was. I’d hurt the people closest to me, and word spread fast. Their friends were quick to learn about my actions. Quickly, my reputation was filled with the horrible exploits of my abuse. Years prior I had come out to my mother. She was angry more than anything. I wanted so badly to feel comfortable where I lived, but with my father away and constant arguments with friends and mother, my chest heaved with nothing but anger.

I set myself into the resolve that I needed a fresh start. A new state; new people, new school, and a somewhat new family. I had so many hopeful prospects for the future. So many dreams of what my new life would be like.

I was admitted to a hospital weeks later.

Life with my “new” father was strange. I had no sense of privacy with him and his wife; an hour was set to do my work, where I would be watched. My bag was rifled through, and my room was checked. I’d only made one friend at school, and I was terrified of everyone else. The school itself was large and prestigious, loaded with expectations and a competitive environment. For a while, I spent hours in the guidance office, until I realized I’d overstayed my welcome. I began skipping classes to sleep in the library, as I hardly slept at home. I began starving myself and avoiding self care, and severe depression wasn’t far behind. Symptoms of my PTSD I’d developed years prior after an incident began bubbling to the surface. Paranoia and anxiety ruled my life. My stepmother was constantly critical of my actions; calling me disgusting and making me doubt my every move. My step sister was temperamental at best. She had her own group of friends anyways- it felt like she wanted nothing to do with me, only talking to me when she wanted something. Even the only friend I’d made didn’t last long. He had us own problems, and our shared mental illnesses collided and fought. Older friends that I’d known from my former home didn’t work out either, one saying that everything I was feeling was my fault. 

She was probably right. 

I wanted my dad to understand. I wanted it so badly. He’d said he knew about depression and anxiety. He said he had experienced them first hand. But his job seemed to have changed him. He no longer made jokes with me. They were all the same from when I was a kid. All of the ones he was repeating felt inorganic. He constantly accused me of lying, saying he knew everything I was doing and that there was no point in hiding my “intentions”. Every argument we had, he glazed over. My entire “new” family never settled anything. They only acted everything never happened. Towards the end, he began calling me abusive, always asking “well, what do you want to do?”, as if I knew.

At that point I’d accepted I was meant to die. Every friend I made, I traumatized. Every live-in family members I had, I alienated. An abuser doesn’t deserve a life- that’s what I’d hammered into my head. All the wack medications that were supposed to stabilize me only made me a zombie, and waiting a week to be admitted into a hellish hospital just made me even more suicidal. I remember and acquaintance asking an old kindergarten friend about me, and they asked plainly, “Did they kill themselves yet?”

I was desperate to come home. Back to my mom, who I missed more than anything. We may have had differences, but when I made the decision to go home, she accepted me with open arms. She loved me for who I am, and always resolved things after the heat of the moment had dissipated.

Now, I’m relatively okay. I’m still dealing with the repercussions of what I’d done , but I’ve made peace with it. Some forgave me, others hate me, but I’m working on myself to make everything better. I know have a tiny enclave of friends (some more like acquaintances than others) that I appreciate more than anything. Especially my best friend. She may be a thousands of miles away, and we may have gone through hell and back, but she loves me.. and I love her. 

I’m sure I could have written more. There’s so much I didn’t say- but I think that’s enough. I don’t want to expose myself entirely anyways.

Thank you, and I’m sorry."

And then this year, my senior year, the one year of high school that’s supposed to be like “the best year of my life” has sucked ass haha. I couldn’t get to school the first 3 weeks of school because I was so anxious and depressed and nobody really cared or tried to contact me. Then I switched to online school, that I’m doing now, and I only talk to 2 people. The thing is that I realize that I’m isolating myself but at the same time I have no desire to put myself out there and try and meet new people. I can’t really relate to pretty much everybody at my high school which is fun. Basically I’m just super lonely and it sucks. Thanks for reading about my super fun life"
lonely,Do you ever feel like that raisin chip cookie in the sea of chocolate chip cookies,"Do you ever feel like that raisin chip cookie in the sea of chocolate chip cookies - The kind that looks good but once bitten into is just a crumbly disappointment? I feel like a crumbly disappointment. I still don’t even get how my ex was attracted to me, I guess I wasn’t attractive enough to keep her from cheating on me, by attractive I mean more than just looks by the way; but I’m not gonna lie..I don’t think I look the best. I have accepted that I’ll always look this way because I was born this way. Can’t tell me to lose weight, I’m already super thin so this is just kinda how it looks so I had to come to terms with it. 

It’s not just looks though like I said I’m also insecure about my personality. I feel so clingy and affection starved that when I get it I just soak up every morsel in hopes it wasn’t just a nice gesture but someone genuinely wants to treat me well for he long run. I talk to much too I feel like and I feel like a burden to anyone:("
lonely,3 week university journey,"3 week university journey - Week 1:


Started he day off thinking, I'll meet some like minded people. Difficult to do when you constantly stuck in your mind, I couldn't even speak to the people next to me and when I do, I regret everything I say. I dont blame them for never wanting to speak to me. I'd do the same thing, theres not enough about me that's special enough to warrant spending time breaking down my walls when they could spend a tenth of the time with another person and already have them all figured out. I'm not special, although in my mind, you'd swear that I'm a goddamn celebrity.

Week 2:

Met a girl so far we're friends. I like her, she's different than the rest of them. Shes like me but better socially. I got lucky meeting her, I just hope I dont manage to scare her off. 

Week 3:

I fucked it, shes not gone but its probably not long. How do people talk so easily? I cant even laugh anymore. I thought it was the medication but now I'm not so sure."

lonely,My story,"My story - I work in an airport as a traffic agent and for 1 year I have been in love with a pretty, kind and cool girl who has treated me well since we met. When I am with her, all my depressive thoughts disappear (because I was diagnosed with depression) and I had a lot of chemistry at work to the point that all our colleagues theorized our kind of relationship. But she always rejected my advances, simply preferring friendship. One day, I learn that she was in a relationship with a longshoreman who had been courting her for some time. and that completely destroyed me to a level that my doctor diagnosed me with a stronger prescription. and I wondered ""what is wrong? what did she see in the docker?"" and then I found out that the girl had lost her aunt and that the longshoreman was supporting her since then and that's why they fell in love because she never told me anything if we were friends? I felt betrayed and disgusted with me but mostly defeated. because I am ugly and the docker exceeded me in many ways. I am 30 years old and I am simply tired of this. of feeling horribly bad about everything. of losing meaning to life. I want someone to stretch my ability to love me because I have suffered too much. I will soon quit and go outside the country, maybe looking for a place where there are no people. a cabin in the woods sounds good ..."
lonely,Another day alone...,"Another day alone... - When I found this sub, I (26F) felt that is the only place to write my feelings.

I'm sorry, English is not my first language.

Since my boyfriend (25M) of 1.5 years left me some months ago, I feel so lonely. He was my best friend and until today Idk the real reasons of his decision. We had a ldr, it was hard but I thought we could do it. We were planning our wedding, have an apartment...and then my happiness bubble just burst. Sometimes I think he cheated on me but idk. I feel so stupid, I believed in all his promises and now, he's having fun while I'm trying to go ahead with my life and my new goals. It's sad, because I don' have friends to talk or get distracted and I don't like talking with my family about this.

I think I'm a successful person: I have a degree in engineering, a good job, a decent family, I don't smoke, no drugs, no alcohol....but nobody cares, maybe I'm ugly, who knows lol. I've tried to meet new people online but most of them ghost me lol. Maybe because I'm a nerdy or a little bit shy and introverted. In real life, Idk how to make friends, I mean, when you're an adult, you already have friends! From HS or college. At work, my co workers are very old and, as I said, I'm introverted so being outside trying new stuff is very hard for me. 

I miss sending messages in the morning and at night, talk about my day at work or my plans for the weekend. I miss hugs and cuddles. I think that's I need: a huge hug just to know everything will be ok."
lonely,I’m lonely and I literally can’t do anything to fix it.,"I’m lonely and I literally can’t do anything to fix it. - So I’m a teen enrolled in an online school because I have anxiety (it was cheaper than a therapist and meds) and I’ve been in it for two and a half school years. The year before I started online school my best friend moved away and that was kinda the start of it all because she was kinda my only friend. But when I switched to online school I was kinda deprived of all social contact and now I am more alone than I ever was before. The most social part of the fucking week is when I see my teacher through a computer screen. I don’t go anywhere either. My happiest time of the week was when my mom would take me shopping with her. It says a lot when you get happy by going to the fucking grocery store, but hey, at least it has real people in it. But lately I haven’t been able to go anywhere and it majorly depresses me out. Some times I go weeks without any human contact other than my family. Whenever I don’t get to go anywhere I just kinda sulk in my room and go on different chat rooms and end up not talking because I get too shy. I know this might’ve sounded extremely privileged (and it probably was) but I don’t think I can take this loneliness anymore and I feel like I’m missing out on a huge chunk of my youth."

lonely,I feel like I’ll have no friends again,"I feel like I’ll have no friends again - I’m in college, I made new friends and it was great ! So fucking awesome and so wonderful.

Second session and three of them left their programs (two on a break, the last one needed high school credits). 

I’m socially awkward so I don’t really have friends in my program (only one and I rarely have classes with him) so I’m pretty much alone too whilst in my classes. 

I had no friend until my 4th-ish year of school (and was bullied for that time), that friend (she was my best friend) I couldn’t count on her for anything, dropped the ball on things left and right. 

In high school, she more or less dumped me in a friend group and distanced herself. The group was, and I don’t think they realized it, toxic towards me. I always felt like ‘the runt of the pack’. 

I thought.. it was the end of this lonely cycle. 


Maybe I’m just whining and just want sympathy, I don’t even know. I’ve been told I’m whinny. I always talk like if maybe enough words come out I might just be listened or make someone laugh with my over the top personality.

Or maybe it’s just an off day for me. I’m sorry."
lonely,To reach out or not to reach out is the question,"To reach out or not to reach out is the question - Does loneliness make you more inclined to reach out to say, someone you used to know or miss or less inclined to do so? And , I’m curious of anyone who has been on the receiving end how they felt? Did you feel better if that person reached out to you if it was out of loneliness or did it make you feel like you were just being used ?"
lonely,So yesterday a girl had a conversation with me at work.,"So yesterday a girl had a conversation with me at work. - I work at McDonalds btw

Yesterday at work, I am taking orders in the drive through with this girl and initionally I didn't plan on having a conversation with her cuss me and her don't really talk like that. We also don't hate each other or anything like that. This girl's name is Sam. We start talking in the mic and we had a casual surface level conversation about what I like about working at McDonalds and what I like to do and stuff like that. The conversation lasted only 10 mins cuss we got pretty busy later in the shift.

 But after the shift , the desperate side of myself is telling me that she likes me. But the rational side of my self is telling me she was just bored and wanted to get to know me( And I agree with this). Man, It would be amazing if me and her became good friends. I haven't had a girl to talk to in a long while. 

Is there anyone else that has experienced the same thing I did ie, your desperate side saying that someone likes you but your rational side saying ""Na, she is only trying to be friendly""?"

Got no money or health issues, but my selfsteem it's kinda destroyed and I'm depressed AF waiting for the depression to consume me.

I’m mentally ill, I suffer from depression and anxiety, I’ve even felt suicidal lately and now I have to withstand the verbal abuse from my father, it’s really getting to me and this crippling isolation and loneliness and my father’s words echoing through my head.

Turns out her and her other friend went to ktown and had a fun time without me. They went shopping and got korean barbeque which I've always wanted. She didnt even think to invite me.. Ik that sounds selfish and entitled. But she has the audacity to throw a fit whenever I try to hangout with my other friend alone. She gets butthurt like I did but its different for her. 
I just wish I had a wider friend group. I only have 3 close friends and they dont like or cant hang out much
... I just want a diverse group of friends..no matter what race what sex.. I dont care..I want that kind of squad you could act like crackheads with, do big group hangouts like bowling or karaoke etc. , chill at your house and cuddle with the homies with.. that literally all I ask.. a bigger college friend group with atleast some similar intrest to me you know..?"

lonely,I think I'm starting to feel lonely for the first time.,"I think I'm starting to feel lonely for the first time. - I've almost always lived a very lonely life. I never had any friends that were more than just acquaintances and it's never bothered me. Possibly because I've been with my spouse since I was 22 and had people around me in some way. Now I'm starting to realise just how alone I am.

I’m sick of pretending to be happy and cheerful just so I don’t ruin the mood. All everybody sees is me being happy and cheerful but not the way I actually am.

Maybe it’s because I’m insecure about myself. I worry that my friends would up and go if I’m not being interesting enough. Maybe I’m  scared that people can see right through me. That they look down on a lonely depress fuck trying to act the opposite of how he feels. 

Perhaps, I hope that someone would care about me if they see me as someone of value. 

Maybe I’m just sick of being lonely."

I did mess up however because I cheated on her. Yes I know what I did was wrong so I don't need to be told that. I don't support what I did and would never condone it in any circumstance. 
Anyways I'm a marine engineer and spend alot of time out at sea. About 6-8 months at a time before I'm down for maybe 3-4 months.
As I work with a small crew of almost always just men, meeting new people at my workplace isn't something that's going to happen, and even back home alot of my friends have moved abroad for better job prospects.

I believe he has an undiagnosed personality disorder, and he would never seek help. He's gone and there's a huge hole left. I have an incredibly hard time keeping friends, and I'm not a likable person. I've been going to therapy for quite a while but it's just always been a fact for me. My life is work then home. I have no one to talk to or dream with. The transformation was absolutely heartbreaking and I don't think he will ever find his way back. My coworkers don't like me and I don't really like online friendships/relationships. I have no one anymore, and really I haven't had anyone for almost 2 years. He was there, but he was dissolving before me. I don't think he felt love for me, just for companionship. He was so integrated into every aspect of my life. I feel like I'm mourning him because he's been so taken by this darkness that he's just completely gone. I think he might be suicidal. I've done everything in my power to help and support him and to prevent him from taking those actions, but he's completely lost to me. I have no one else."

I cannot make friends.

I want friends. I really, really want friends. And I have people who I hang out with at school and at work, and when I am with them, everything is cool.

But once I leave work, once school ends, I am completely and terribly alone. 

Is it my fault? Should I be reaching out to people to hang out? I’m afraid to do so because they might reject me, but should they come to me?

I know I might sound immature or confusing but this feeling of terrible inexplicable loneliness is killing me.

I want to be liked by everyone, but it seems that no one likes me enough to be anything more than acquaintances.

I’ve never had therapy in my life but I am seriously considering it now.

Compared to other people on here I sound like I’m in a good position socially but I’m not. I can’t make anything other than surface level relationships. Am I not trusting enough? Is my personality too abrasive? I have no idea.

I don’t know why I’m asking these questions on here, but hopefully someone can connect with my feelings and relate their experiences."

I'm usually ok with not having friends, but some nights, like this one, I feel suffocated. I feel so empty thinking about my classmates whom I daily see having fun with their friends (on Instagram), being able to do things that I can only dream of doing. 

And, right now it's okay because that feeling won't last much, tomorrow I will go shopping with my parents and I'll forget I ever felt this way.
But when I move to another city to go to college, I'm afraid this feeling might last longer or be permanent, and that I won't be able to bear it and I'll have give up my career because I felt so lonely that I had to come back.

Maybe, when I find myself completely alone in an apartment, my phone won't be enough anymore. It's so pathetic.

Case in point I have a friend who is really, really, going through a hard time because of a separation.  I realized yesterday that I must be angry at my friend because my communication with him has been so bizarre. Instead of lifting him up, I send him a dm saying things like he shouldn't watch Joker right now. The inference being he's so pathetic that he would never recover.  And there have been other things I have done and said that are so stupid and insensitive.  This friend is really sensitive so he might be a frenemy now for all i know.

lonely,"He made me his ""drug friend"" because he wouldn't miss me.","He made me his ""drug friend"" because he wouldn't miss me. - We became friends in 8th grade. More like acquaintances though. All I ever had was acquaintances in middle school. We bonded through trespassing in sophomore year. When he started smoking pot he got me into it. I nosedived into addiction but had some good times. He didn't even talk drugs with his main group I exsisted in the periphery of. 

I, formerly a straight a and b student, started going to psych wards because of defiant stoner behavior and withdrawal related depression. Despite being caught I kept the heat off my friend. I spent hundreds on drugs. All I cared about was getting high. I lost myself, my ambition. 

Nothing helps when you're not ready to put it down. We would go to parks at night and get stoned as rapists in Brazil. I live off those memories. Sober I'm miserable, high I just want someone to chill with but nobody has time for me. I realized the drug isn't the only thing that makes the high. 

I'm a month sober. I want to put it down but the more sober I've gotten the more I crave it. Not as desperately as I crave comfortable companionship. People you can say anything around. Where you laugh about the dumbest shit and there's no awkward silence. I feel like a square peg in a round hole when I talk to people now. 

We got into psychedelics but I was the one with the plug. My first trip he tripsat me and it was beautiful. Great to have someone to bounce my thoughts off of and keep me safe. My first trip cured my addiction problems with weed and my compulsion to drink high caffeine doses. I started using high doses (2-5 tabs) of LSD biweekly. It was so beneficial to me spiritually and emotionally. I got obsessed and it was constantly on my mind for about 2 months. I'm really good at tripping. I've been around relatives of really high doses and kept it together (sunglasses of course). 

He got caught with THC for the first time and got grounded for a while. We planned to trip together on the day he got off. It was going to be his first time on a dose higher than one and it was his third trip. I took 5 on my 3rd with no tolorence so I thought he should be able to handle it. Nope. I was inpatient and tripped on mine a couple days before. I tripsat him and he flipped on the comedown and got caught. 

I'm lucky not to be in some sort of jail but I can't fucking stand this. I want to fucking shoot myself. It's been months but it's still fucking raw. Everyone in the friend group dropped me. I just want to fucking smoke right now so I can laugh instead of cry. I've been trying to get sober but it's so fucking hard. 

I fell back into weed because I wanted to mix it with LSD, fantastic but now I really fucking love it again. I lost my acid guy aswell. I've been sober a month but I don't know if it's really worth it. I have no friends so all this extra time is wasted on self pity."
lonely,Lonely but shouldn’t be,"Lonely but shouldn’t be - I have a relationship but hate being a baby so don’t want to talk about my problems. Have a family but can’t have an honest conversation. I feel so lonely but it seems like i have friends and a girlfriend and a family so i’m not supposed to which somehow makes it worse. The only way i’ve ever made any connection in my life is through manipulation and making myself like them so they subconsciously start liking me. Does anyone actually like me? I’m just shaping myself around every person to like me because i’m so lonely and just am so scared to have no one. The only people i really want to be friends with hate me because either i’m not good enough for them or they judge me for assumed actions that aren’t true or even just normal actions that shouldn’t be judged. I hate my life but i refuse to think anything suicidal because it’s too selfish. Can’t talk to anyone but no one talks to me about things because i’m too defensive to just listen to people. Can’t just be myself. So lonely. It’s selfish to even feel lonely with all i’ve been given, i should be grateful 😕."

lonely,"I'm sorry, but the seat next to me is taken by my baggage. You're going to want to find another seat. Trust me.","I'm sorry, but the seat next to me is taken by my baggage. You're going to want to find another seat. Trust me. - Baggage weighs me down. It's not the kind of baggage that exist outside of my mind. No children involved, no messy divorces, no litigations for monetary or material possessions. Emotional baggage I've been slugging around for 30+ years. It only gets heavier the longer I pull it along. I haven't found anywhere to put it. I tried giving it out to people that didn't work. I tried to bury it underneath my possessions, but in a matter of months it crawls its way out. It follows me around everywhere I go. Staring at me, judging me, waiting for the opportunity stop me from anything that would bring peace and happiness. 

I can see me as a child in there. Sweet, innocent, full of kindness, wonder, and love. She isn't equip with the thick skin she'll need to get through the few years of her life. She's lonely a lot of the time. Her parents are great people but they didn't realize how fragile of a child they have. Her older sibling treated her as a threat. Hated her presence. Bullying became his favorite past time. She cried a lot. But no one cared. The immediate response to quiet the whaling child was more important than to resolve the reasons she was upset. Someone you look up to, idolize, shadow telling you that your stupid, ugly, fat, no one likes you followed by your parents yelling at you to stop crying. It never went any farther than ""stop being mean to your sister"". 

Adolescence was the next big challenge. It had its ups and downs. But in those darker times there wasn't a safe space. Bullied at school and then bullied at home. It was clear to my bullies that my skin was thin and I was easy to break for their satisfaction. It was relentless at times. There wasn't any place to hide other than a small bedroom in which I spent so much time being grounded. I was doing bad in school and acting out. It was like I wanted to be there because everywhere else was way worse. It wasn't so much a punishment as a request. At this point, my gifts of music and athletics had passed and I found myself around people that certainly did not have my best interest at heart. Picked up awful habits that I still can't break. So many people passed through my life dropping off their baggage onto me. I spent years trying to pick up those pieces. Not realizing how mistreated I was. That I was worth so much more. 

Adulthood in the beginning wasn't the worst experience. I managed through college a little later in life. Always had jobs and really worked hard. Had some boyfriends and casual hook ups. For a little bit there I even had really great friends. But so quickly that faded. Some by choice and others not so much. I met a man who I thought filled my heart with love and acceptance and after a few years that came crashing down because I wanted different things than he did and honestly I wasn't about to keep someone from what they want no matter how much I didn't want to go back to my previous life which at that point was nothing.

Now I'm the loneliest I've ever been. Moved away from all that I know to try to start again. But the starting again has been a challenge. I feel like I wasn't given a fair chance at life. Every new friendship or relationship I start I quickly stop because the true me who is full of pain and sadness creeps out and I don't want to put that on anyone else. It's a catch 22. I need people more than ever yet my baggage drives people away whether they leave or I push them out. And to be honest I've been doing a lot of the pushing. 

I have found that the internet has been such a toxic place. Even when I try to connect with a group in which we share a common interest I get shunned out. I get bullied all over again. Social media has really taken its toll. I know people only choose to show you what they want you to see, but I don't want anyone to see me. I don't have much to share. Every time I refresh the page I'm bombarded with more success, happiness, vacations, friends, family, smiles, and laughter. I've tried so many things that make me happy, but it always fails. Or really no one cares that much. I set myself up for failure all the time. I always falls apart. I'm mostly to blame. I'm always to blame. I'm both the parent yelling at their child to stop crying and the child who can't stop crying. I'm my biggest enemy. I wanted to do something special with my life. I wanted to do something that brought people together and sparked joy and happiness. 

If you've made it this far I'm impressed. I just needed to get these things off of my chest. I don't have a solution or a plan. I just feel so numb at this point. Fragile. Going through the motions of life. Making money and paying bills. Feeding my meat body with food, alcohol, and any other pleasures it so desires. I don't think I deserve what I do have and certainly don't think I deserve anything better. I'm at the point where I made my bed. The childlike fantasy of dreams and aspirations is long gone. Believing in love, kindness, and friendship is a fleeting memory I once had. I've chosen to lay here in my bed with my baggage until the day I die so I don't release the pain and sadness out in the world. It's mine that I was given, mine that I made, and mine forever until it's my time to leave this world. I'm sorry, but the seat next to me is taken by my baggage. You're going to want to find another seat. Trust me."

lonely,I Don’t Even Know What To Do,I Don’t Even Know What To Do - I’m 18 and I decided finish high school early in December because it was a horrible experience for me. It sucks knowing that for the rest I my life I have to look back on high school as the worst days of my life instead of my best. I lost all my friends in middle school and since then I’ve always been on my own. I’m gonna be starting college in August and I know that’s my last chance at making any real friends. Having social anxiety doesn’t help. Whenever I want to talk to someone I always second guess myself and how they will interpret me and I always just shake my head and keep to myself. I just really don’t know what to do because I know it’s my last chance to really do anything. I don’t have anyone to talk to this about either so up on Reddit it goes.
lonely,I’m too scared to lose her.,"I’m too scared to lose her. - I’ve tried making this post 3 or 4 times now? Lost count honestly. If I jump around a lot I’m sorry in advance there’s just so much on my mind that I can’t type it out before thinking of something else.

For some context, I met this girl online in January 2019. Since then I’ve fallen for her. Really really hard. She just seemed too good to be true: we have a bunch of the same interests, very close in age and distance (despite the fact I don’t even have my license but that’s not the point). We just seemed to click you know?

I love her. I love her a lot. Maybe more than I should considering we’ve only met face to face once. And I’ve told her I love her and she told me she doesn’t feel the same... yet.

I’ve noticed (especially more recently) that when we talk, I play my cards super reserved and safe. Like our conversations are filled to the brim with my “sorry”s and “if it’s ok with you”s. I talk like an idiot. My texts don’t feel like a normal person wrote them. I feel like I don’t even know who the person talking to her is anymore.

My most recent predicament: radio silence for three weeks now (which doesn’t sound like a big deal in retrospect but I’m needy for attention so it hurts). The only things I’ve heard were that in the first week, her phone got confiscated and in the second, she was sick.

I have no idea why but I just feel as if it’s because of me, even though out of the very few texts I’ve received she’s told me it isn’t. I feel like I’m too needy and a fuckup.

She’s the only person outside of direct family that I’ve actually cried over. I don’t know what to think anymore. The only thing I do know is that I DO NOT want to bring this up to her. I don’t want to burden her.

If you’ve made it this far, I appreciate you more than you can understand. Thanks for hearing me out. There’s a lot more that I wanna write but I decided against it. Love y’all. Hope you’re daring better than I am."

I was away for over a year and put a lot of energy into keeping contact with some friends from back home and it seems like all of it was in vain.

I have a few friends, but i only hang out with them every now and again, and separately, too, so I don't really have a ""group"" of friends.

lonely,"I don't see anybody anymore, it's my own fault, but it still hurts.","I don't see anybody anymore, it's my own fault, but it still hurts. - I recently made the rather bold decision to teach myself the necessary qualifications to get into university. The deck is really stacked against me (by my own hand) because not only am I doing it without a teacher, but they are all universities in the US (where I am not from) so I have to find private funding, but none of it would be worth it if I didn't apply to very esteemed universities, which obviously have a very low acceptance rate. Because of this I haven't really even been able to leave the house, and even though I am an introvert by nature, the loneliness can be kind of crippling. I'm really trying to better myself, trying to curb my obesity by intermittent fasting and removing unnecessary calories in terms of foods. I also stopped taking drugs to slow my cognition down on purpose, which I felt like I needed to do in the past when I was stuck in regular schooling (no judgement please). All these things really are tiring and so I tend to flake out of social engagements, when I know I shouldn't. Even though I've brought this on myself, I feel so very alone. I know working on myself is better in the long run, but I really am struggling at times. It's not that I have no friends, just that I tend to push them away, or am distant. Same with romantic opportunities. I've been propositioned a couple of times by girls (no idea how I'm incredibly unappealing physically) and I've pushed them away because of my own internal chicanery. I was hoping this pathetic attempt at engaging with other people that understand loneliness would keep me going. Thank you."

lonely,My experiences with my loneliness... (21M)(Long narrative) (NOT a rant),"My experiences with my loneliness... (21M)(Long narrative) (NOT a rant) -      What I feel I have to get off my chest is going to be long-winded, so please bear with me. If you like a story, then that’s good. I’ve always been a better writer than talker anyway.
     I remember vividly being in elementary school, sitting on a wine-red carpet reading book after book as the other kids played together. I don’t think I was interested in companionship until about fourth grade. I eventually grew jealous of the kids who seemed close with one another and played all the time. I tried my hand at a few groups but was quickly ostracized. I’ve always been the type to avoid confrontation (even today) and so I just conceded and walked away.         Throughout the year I would try and fail repeatedly to make friends on my own. I clearly remember sitting on a wooden bench (without the back rest part) in the back of the playground in heavy shade (this was in spring if I remember correctly) and I just cried. Even after recess was over, and all the kids had reentered class, I stayed behind as I didn’t want anybody to see me. I was embarrassed and afraid. I sat on that bench for an hour after recess, and I realized no one had noticed that I was missing. At the time, this crushed me and the tears grew more heavy and plentiful. Eventually I was discovered by a staff member who had stepped out. She escorted me to my class and I just silently sat down and watched the teacher who thought I was there the whole time until she was informed what had happened. 
     Fifth grade was more of the same, and I grew more withdrawn and my grades slipped. I found out I would have to repeat the grade after I sat in a parent-teacher meeting where the teacher said that she knew I would give a “little sob story.” The second time through was worse, but I barely pulled through and eventually transferred to a different middle school where I finally met Issac, a person I could call a good friend to this day. Things started to look up after we became friends, but we were basically both misfits. It was just us two and a special ed kid that I didn’t really have any interest in to be honest. We were really close until high school where we saw less of each other as we were in different classes. Just before graduation, he called me by my first and last name and saluted me as he planned to join the military. I smiled and nodded, but that was the last time I have seen and heard of him. We lost touch, and I felt empty.
     I met my first girlfriend in junior year and she was the nerdy type that I found attractive at the time. I had companionship, but it was around the end of middle school that I started to be interested in girls. I approached her and from that first conversation she would walk up to me every morning during PE and we would talk endlessly about all sorts of stuff. We grew really close and eventually she confessed to me. I was overjoyed that someone had finally shown interest in me romantically. After Issac and I lost touch the summer of my junior year, I stayed in contact with my girlfriend and we longed to see each other again as I was on a summer program to prepare for college and live in a dorm (voluntary, as I wanted to be ready for college). We talked every night, but one problem with our relationship was that her parents were verbally and emotionally abusive and I could only comfort her on the bad days. When I came back home, we met up at the public library in the morning and walked around town until the evening.
    I clearly remember sitting on that concrete bench with her laying on my lap and watching the fountain in front of us, the sound of the water was calming to us. She sat up and I mustered the courage to lean in for a kiss. At the time she had an ex who was long-distance who kept pestering her and being abusive to her. I tried repeatedly to get her to block him and cut ties, but she didn’t have the courage to do so. I remember she had read a rather scathing text and I said gently, “Don’t listen to him. Listen to me. I love you.” I had my first kiss that day. It only lasted about five seconds, but I was satisfied with just looking into her dark eyes until we finally went back to our homes. Our relationship lasted two years, but it came crashing down when one day I realized she had been “playing both sides.” I was a Baptist Christian, so I didn’t believe in pre-marital sex. She, however, had an extremely high libido and was starved for it. I had a lot of self-control and kept my virginity (thank goodness). I eventually realized that she was satisfying her need for affection with me and her libido with her ex, who had no qualms about sex to put it nicely after I had opened a text from her ex on her phone and read her text history filled of NSFW images and messages. I was furious, and felt betrayed. I asked her to choose, and almost without a second thought she chose him. Her lack of hesitation crushed me, and I broke it off with her and cut ties completely.
     When I entered college, I felt like I had gone full circle and I had felt worse than I had felt in elementary school. Even today I stand by my decision to wait until marriage. As hard to believe as it may sound, I still believe in God and I have faith that there’s a better place saved for me after I die. I’m 21 years old now and I have a major and a goal in mind that keeps me moving forward. As pathetic as it may sound, I still hold onto a sliver of hope that things will get better. I don’t have friends and I’m single now albeit with a heart that has healed for the most part. There are admittedly times where my heart feels tight and I fall into deep despair, but my parents, my church, and my faith are really the only things giving me the bravery to move forward.   If you got this far, then I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read my experiences. I hope the people in this thread can find some comfort in knowing they’re not alone. I’m happy to answer questions about my experience through comments and replies.

Once again, to those who read to the end and/or took the time to ask a question, thank you."

I just get jealous, angry, and bitter when I see other couples cherishing one another like they are made of gold or diamond. I try to avoid those situations, but when I am waiting in line to return something, that's when I lose it. They hold on to each for dear life like this is the end. They kiss for hours and get really really possessive. When I sleep at night I wish myself being in those men's shoes. It all feels artificial and too good to be true for them. Its like life is on their side. I just wish it was flipped and life was the other way around. I know that you are not supposed to wait for the ""right one"" because its all about action not about waiting. I have never had any experiences with women so I feel like it would be very overwhelming and scary to talk to the opposite sex. I feel like women have their own rules or something that makes them extraterrestrial. I just hope that it is a passing face and somehow will get the courage to go up and approach them. I know that you are not supposed to put them on pedestals but I end up doing that all the time and don't know how to control myself."

lonely,Swallowed by society's indifference,"Swallowed by society's indifference - I recently split with the woman I've been with for 7 years. The woman for whom I moved to a different country. The woman I thought I was going to marry and have children with around the end of this year. We were each other's best friend and lover in one. But we met when she was just 18, and eventually it got to her that she never experienced another person (among other problems mostly stemming from this root cause that wasn't fixable by effort or communication).

Moving back to my home country, because 4 people waited for me with ""open arms"" (only to drop me when I arrived. Not even my father has come to see me) didn't make anything easier.

I've dealt with depression years ago and I'm seeing the signs. I just don't think there will be a happy ending this time. By no means am I physically repulsive (at least I don't believe so) and yet, even maxing out swipes on dating apps. Going to little karaoke bars on weekends. Putting myself out there and being positive and kind. Literally nobody is interested in getting to know who I am. No matter how much I put myself out there.

I'm so motivationless that I'm numb to this feeling. - The only time I felt it was on valentines afternoon, when every missed interaction and opportunity made me more energetic, extraverted and impatient. I literally couldn't sit down and do anything else than talk. Until I told a messy story to my dad, just because he asked for it, who has bad listening skills and he was too tired. So I just wasted words. Then I decided to watch a movie, instead of travelling 1-1 hours to party with my brother and half-strangers, so I guess I wasn't even energetic?😫 I would have gone if i know 2 intriguing person at least. Maybe I should miss interactions with strangers on the street and that will build up loneliness in me? Do extroverts stare at people, until they got bored of their sensory imput, memories, impressions and other fantasies related to people, is that their secret or what? Is there a specific music taste that makes them crave connection with others, maybe?(dubstep with it's minimal talking and waiting for the drop seems to make me impatient, so it might work). I would love to connect but not when I would be too tired to continue talking and focusing and currently I rarely have enthusiasm for anything, I just sit back and enjoy whatever is currently happening or needs to be done, I enjoy doing nothing and even not going to sleep sometimes(I usually sleep on time no matter what, i have no choice).

I will try Wellbrutin for this, but I still need a list that will make feel lonely or become extroverted.😁"

lonely,Lost soul,"Lost soul - Hello, kinda new here but i need a place to tell everything off my heart.. 

Im 20 and i have a loving boyfriend (almost a year together now) and a caring family. I go to college and study medicine. :)

But lately i've been starting to feel really down. I've been having troubles, arguments with my boyfriend, where he tells me that i upset, annoy, irritate and make him mad. We usually have misunderstanding and i dont know how to prevent those. Ive been so insecure about telling him things now just because i might upset him.. he also blocks me and removes me when i do irritate him too much. Everytime i do something bad, he wants to commit suicide or atleast writes that to me, which tears me to pieces, cause i feel like its my fault. Am i wrong for feeling that? He wants to do it just because we have arguments.. and i do say sorry, i acknowledge my mistakes, i try to fix, but i get blocked and then i get those goodbye texts. He lives like an hour away from me and i have gone there everytime he has said that he would kill himself. But when i say that.. he never comes..

Since my past has been really hard - my mom left me with my grandparents when i was 2, my dad used me only to get child support money until my grandparents didnt let me see my dad anymore because my dad used to scare me and my dad had huge dogs, he let them terrorize me to a point, where my speech got interrupted, i couldnt sleep or eat. I had to go to doctors and psychologists to get that out of me. To this day im a bit scared of the dark (everone who knows me jokes about it, i feel so shamed), absolutely terrified of walking alone next to forests or roads, that are isolated. I fear being alone.

..But my grandparents took amazing care of me and i cant be happier! They are the best people in my life, altho they have made their wrongs too, but i dont blame them. They chose to give me another chance in this life, taking me under their wing and providing eveything to me ♡

But they're old now.. both of them have issues, we are having financial issues too little by little now, since they cant work that much now. My grandpa has anemia (blood problems - too less blood, which is really dangerous for the body). He faints, almost went into a coma lately, trouble standing up etc. My grandma is the strongest woman i know - she has gone through many operations - both of her legs are metals (since she is a nurse from a young age, she had to stand and move alot which caused leg problems later on), she has backproblems, high bloodpressure, a lot of problems. She has pain so hard that she has to take up to 7 painkillers at the same time (all prescribed by the doctor officially). So i see her cry, she wants this pain and life to end. My grandpa talks about death. Why do i feel like losing them both? I cant handle losing the most important people from my life!!! I dont know how to l e t go! I dont w a n t to let go &lt;/3

Now i was overweight when i was little. I used to be bullied because of my weight, physically abused (kids used to slap my fingers between doors or table and chairs claiming they didnt see my fingers inbetween to the teachers). I was rejected, ""fat kid"", ""ugly"". I used to grow up alone, with ""friends"" who stole my things, used me only because i had a mother that lived in USA. I went to school and it got worse. I was bullied daily, chased home by people calling me names, pushing me off the road. I used to get texts on facebook, saying ""hoe, bitch, slut"" (i had never been with a guy - i even have proof of those texts). Classmates used to upload pictures of me, tagging my figure with ""ugly bitch"", ""fatchamber"" on facebook. Commeting it and sending it to other people from my school. At the same time i had to go to court with my father, because i understood that he didnt love me anymore and just wanted to use me. I was the ugly, fat, without a mother and a father kid. The kid who tried to get straight A's. I was 7 when i first drew a picture of myself hanging. I wanted to be saved already then. My grandparents and court found a connection after, my dad had been terrorizing me so much with his family. Until high school things were hellish, i started selfharming since i had noone. I had gotten 2 bestfriends who decided to betray me and told my secrets to the whole school. Betrayed. I lost everyone, thats what i felt like. 

..nothing has changed. I dont know how to make friendships, i have people from college who i talk to, but im not really friends.. i dont have anyone to go to and talk to, you know? The bullying hasnt stopped, it still happens sometime, even tho i was overweight only a little bit earlier, then now i gained more because of stress. (Unhealthy coping systeme -sleep, video games)

Just a quick notice,  i used to selfharm in middle school, but i dont anymore thanks to my boyfriend, but this urge has gotten so bad lately.

I have had many failed relationships, that my current boyfriend blames me for. Everytime i found someone a bit special for me, who showed me love, that got me wrapped around their finger, just used me. My first and longest relationship was 9 months, until he cheated. Every after relationship has been short and sad. I regret believing in love, since my current boyfriend has called me a slut for being with my exes. ( i have had like 4 exes, with some i havent even gone to a sexual level, u kno..)

So everything told. I feel miserable. We just learned in college about death. Death is when a person has used all the resources in life and feels like its it for them. I feel that. I feel like i have seen enough, i was given a loving life from my grandparents, but seeing them die slowly, i feel myself dying, because i have never actually been accepted by the society. Never have been, by noone, trust me. The only thing thats comforts me is sad music (xxxtentacion, lil leep, juice wrld, suicideboys etc)

So feeling rejected by the society and by people, losing my family.. i feel ugly. And believe me i have starved, had an actually healthy lifestyle and i still couldnt lose weight, which gives me depression. We learned in college that some people do have problems with weight, because it comes partly from genes (my dad and his family were really obese). So im fighting, but i dont know how anymore.

Im fighting for my relationship with my boyfriend.

If i lose him, i will lose everything. I will actually be alone.

I just want it all to stop. I've been having bad nightmares and sleep paralysis(-s? Multiple ones). I wake up from nightmares, crying. 

I think its actually too late for me and i think its actually time to just give up everything. Just let myself die every day more and more until i get brave enough to stop my life. I wanted to be a doctor and heal my parents, later i realized that i cant help them. I wanted to become a doctor, to help other people, but i cant even handle myself nomore. I want good for others, but everytime it comes out bad..

Im tired, i dont know where to go anymore or what to do 💔

Thank you for hearing me out tho, i really appreciate it. :))"

lonely,Nothing feels good anymore.,"Nothing feels good anymore. - I dont feel as if I have anyone to really talk about this too so I just thought that I'd just relay this here instead. I just need get stuff out of my system.

For a while now, everything just feels awful for me. Recently, I got my results back from my winter exams for college. Sadly, there were far from what I expected. I did pretty awful compared to all my college mates. I know I shouldn't compare but it just happens. The majority of my college mates all did way better than me even though they all left to study only the day before the exam (except for one who worked hard and did phenomally well). Me? I studied ever since college started (Im first year) yet sadly I performed significantly lower than my classmates. Its pretty frustrating coming back into the new year and getting those results you know?

Apart from that these days everything I enjoyed doing like LoL, music and basketball feels just so awful. Literally.
LoL is self explanatory from people who play it but honestly i enjoyed it but now it just feels so bad. Previously I've used it as an escape because it felt good but now its just awful. I played guitar and record songs and covers of me singing and before it felt amazing and all but now aswell it also feels worse. I legitmately cant sing anymore (i was okay at it but now im just horrible). Basketball has been prominently worse nowadays. I've never really like the sport honestly but even though I've trained hard back in summer nearly everyday and the previous years and kept in shape by going to the gym. You see, in the country i live in basketball ain't a big sport. But still there are college basketball teams like in mine. Im in the Division 3 team. My teammates the majority haven't been in a team previously nor had anyone properly training. They're all play for fun kinda thing. But yeah thats the thing, I've been playing to be good and training to be good. For a while now. But thats thing - I feel so bad in scrimmages bruh. Theoretically i should be way better in skill level than my own teammates but it feels like im worse than them. Literally all the hobbies I do - just feels so worse.

College. College should be happy and where you meet your 'friends for life'. Honestly I couldn't agree with that at all. Yeah initially the friends I made felt hella great to be with felt amazing to be with but as time progressed it feels like no one really cares about me or what i say. I just feel left out all the time as if everyone is slightly cautious of me. You see im the 'clown' of the group but honestly because of that it feels as if no one takes me seriously at all. You see I never really had proper friends in Highschool. I had friends in Highschool but eventually I got snaked out by them so i thought college wouldve been better. But I guess it feels equally as worse. Another reason why it feels worse being with my group is because I confessed to one of my friends. I got rejected. I have feelings for her so for me its pretty hard seeing someone I have feelings for every single day each and everytime im with my friends.. Her birthday came recently though, I wanted to be nice and get something for the one I love and for a good friend so I did. A teddy bear she specifically always mentions about. What happens? She forgets about it. I showed her it and she asked me to keep it for a bit because she couldn't put it in her locker since she doesnt have any. So i put it in mine where she kniws where it is and is easily accessible. But yeah. She forgets about it. Literally no one else got her presents except for one who made cake for her but yea. She forgets about it hahaha. I know people forget but man I spent 40 dollars on that teddybear and really took me so much time to find what she would really like. Like how would you forget a present youve always mentioned about. To me it seemed like she doesn't really care about and putting pieces from what I know - it seems like she doesnt care at all. 

Yeah so thats my rant. I dont have any one to talk to this about. But man everyday since the beginning of December of last year just felt like torment. Hobbies doesn't feel good, college doesnt feel good, friends dont feel good and even home doesnt. Everything just sucks. I literally cant get a break. Anything good that comes just disappears instantly. I literally dont know anymore what to do. Im out of options. But yeah ranting here/talking about it here just made it a tad bit better just until I wake up for college tomorrow. Thanks for listening if you stayed reading."

Most of the time i sit in my room and watch netflix or some shit on youtube. I feel like i am too retarded to make friends. I don‘t know how to interact with people. Also i don‘t know why i write this right now. Maybe because i am standing in front off a cliff (not really, only in my head). The last hug, i can remember, is more than two years ago. I am afraid of someone who will touch my body and i will explode of feeling and just start to cry.

But when i look at my contacts in my phone, i can‘t find someone who wouldn’t be pissed off by my problems. So i can‘t talk to anybody.

It wasn't just this weekend - I feel isolated most days, but it stood out profoundly at this event. 

I deal with depression as well, and I recognize that it may be having an effect on my perceptions.

I don't know. I guess I just feel like I don't have anywhere to get this kind of thing off my chest without having to try and justify why I feel that way to whomever I'm talking to.

I realize that by comparison, my life isn't bad - that there are always people who have it worse.

I know these things rationally, but I still hate that I feel this way. I hate that I feel like my brain is broken, and that I just can't be happy and content.

It's possible my loneliness stems from the breakup from a few months back because I don't have that person who is experiencing life with me. 

People or even friends/acquaintances  seem go think I'm always running off with friends or that I'm usually with people in my free time. Obviously I'm not.

So... I guess I'll start off with my Ex. We've been together for almost 4 years, but she broke up before prom. I was already going through some rough times back then, cuz my grandpa was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and my parents were strungling financialy. I somehow got through prom, but at the afterparty everyone was all over my ex, cuz now she was single. I was geniuenly about to kill myself after the whole deal. I did go to a doctor, and she diagnosed me with chronik depression, but I stopped the therapy after some time, due to not having enough money, and the therapy not being any help.

""Thanks"" to the breakup I got one friend tho. She helped me when I was low and I helped her. We are only friends tho, and I'm happy it.

I can't say the same about my other ""friends"". The all groped my ex, and one even started sexting her.

I don't know if this counts as a fuckup, or anything, but I habe to get it out aswell. 2 weeks ago I met up w my ex, and we both just wanted to talk. About school, life, bullshit like this. After some time she got bored of walking, so we hopped in my car. We had fun, but after some time we hugged, and she kissed me. After that things got.... ""out of hand"". Idk how to feel about it. I'm happy, and I feel like I don't love her anyomore, im just hoping she feels the same. It would break me, if I were to hurt her, ever.


If you are wondering, my grandpa did die, sadly. He died back in november. It breaks my heart, seeing how my grandma handles his death. They loved eachother very, very much.

TLDR: Breakup, cancer, money, fake friends, hookup with my ex

Thanks, if you read it. I love you :)"

lonely,I feel so vulnerable.,"I feel so vulnerable. - 3 years ago I only felt safe being the person that was preferable in the given environment. I said things I didn’t mean, and did things that I found shameful or weak. I wasn’t myself.

3 years ago I gradually disconnected from people/environments that made me feel this way. A year later I became friends with a girl who I could be completely myself with. However, she wanted more and even though I loved being around her, I wasn’t attracted to her. I stopped seeing her and over the two years that followed I became more and more isolated. 

For about 8 months now, I haven’t talked to anyone besides clients at work and a few times with my mum and dad. Since the isolation I’ve started to struggle with depression, anxiety and conversing/formulating proper sentences.

It’s lead to me being unable to find the courage to open up and talk to people. 

Most importantly, I feel more lost and unable to identify who I am relative to 4 years ago. 

I miss affection. I miss laughing with a friend. I miss physical contact. I miss the sensation of focusing on my heart and feel what I am. I just feel like there’s nothing there anymore. I feel insanely vulnerable. I’ve lost my anchor, I don’t know where to go anymore.

I just wanted to get this off my chest. I’m sorry it’s probably not of value to any of you."

lonely,Hard to change,"Hard to change - Hi.  Just feel like venting a bit I guess.  I've been in a pretty bad depressive cycle for a few months now, and I don't see much changing soon.  A lot of my thoughts have been centred around loneliness so just wanted to put some things out there.

This shit's hard, man.  I feel like the longer you're alone the harder it is to break that cycle.  I've always been a lonely guy, I suppose.  Only child, small family, bad home life. A weird kid who didn't relate to people very well.  Fat and weird, so a target of ridicule and so forth.  

Made a few friends in high school, and I think due to my general lack of stable connections, clung to them pretty tightly.  We all remained friends for a long time after high school, but things have fallen away the last few years and it seems that I wasn't as close to people as I thought.  Really sucks to see that things don't matter to others like they do for you.

So I'm 34 now and I feel like an absolutely worthless joke of a person.  I've been pretty isolated the last few years and I think the few friends I've made have merely tolerated me rather than enjoyed my company.  And I hate that, I don't want to burden anyone.  So I try to not bother people.  

I fell for a girl and I think because of my general anxiety over intimacy and relationships and so forth, I totally blew it when we went out.  And I still find it so hard to let go of and forget about.  

It just feels like the more isolated one gets the harder it is to form those connections.  The more uncertainty one has over it all.  The more I believe there's something inherently wrong with me.  You doubt everything about yourself and friendship.  If I was worth loving, then I would've been loved by now, right?  If I was worth friendship, my friends for over 20 years would still care and want to be in my life, right?  But it doesn't seem like it, and it must be me.  

I know it's somewhat common, the more you have of something the easier it becomes to get more.  And it seems like the inverse is true, the more alone and isolated you get the harder it becomes to break out of it.  I'm feeling more and more that I don't know what to do.  

I'm already trying so hard to just not implode with depression and general feelings of self loathing.  I so much desire to have someone to have a laugh with, to do nothing with, but I'm so broken that I know I'm not worth that.  I'll only ruin anything good, anyway.  I don't know how to get out of here any more."

lonely,"I lost confidence in my own personality and I don't have anyone to talk to about this. Feeling so filthy, confused and alone.","I lost confidence in my own personality and I don't have anyone to talk to about this. Feeling so filthy, confused and alone. - Sorry if this post is long, been festering it for some years.

I'm not very understanding of my own personality so I'm describing it with a mix of how others describe me and how I view myself. I tend to be cheery most of the time, overly caring and concern about others (some people find this trait weird), not interested in forming romantic or sexual relationships (fine with never having one either), hates toxic positivity and live by my own principles as long as I'm not harming anyone. I think I used to be easy to get along with but hard to get close to. I don't think that I am, but.. people around me including my parents tend to say I'm weird (in a good way??-at least that's what they say when I ask them about it). They find me funny and entertaining which I do have to admit that I enjoy ridiculous and nonsensical stuff. Some describe me as innocent like a kid, some say I'm like a pet and my 'friend' from childhood who never actually cared about me said I'm both loud and quiet, thoughtful, and of course; weird.

However, everyone around me only like me when I'm happy. I feel like I'm not allowed to be sad, angry or serious because people around me hates it when I'm not being entertaining. I've been clinically diagnosed with major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder a few years ago and I don't have anyone to confide in without them distancing themselves. Tried therapy and antidepressants; not working. A few of my 'friends' complained that ""You're not as happening as before."" and another said that ""Yea we get it you're sad but talk or rant about it to someone else.""So I'm feeling very lost about this thing I thought were 'friendships'. I don't know where I stand anymore and I feel so awfully lonely and abandoned.

I'm not sure what else to say so thank you for taking the time to read this. Sorry, for any errors and if I don't reply to your comments it's because I'm mustering up courage which will probably take some hours (I'm a little scared of personal attention especially when it comes to these kinds of issues; I hope you can be understanding). Again, thanks for reading. I hope you all have a nice day."

lonely,I don’t want to hurt anymore,"I don’t want to hurt anymore - I haven’t been sleeping well. A few nights ago it was smoldering hot in my bedroom so I took my shirt off and started rubbing my hand on my chest. My head was overwhelmed with thoughts that the only touch I’ve felt in all of these years has been my own and it hurt so bad I start clawing at my skin to feel something different. How are you suppose to function knowing no one in this world wants you? It’s the basis of our genetic coding, of our races survival. I’m too old for a first time, but so young that a lot of life is left ahead. A lot more years of empty beds and no valentines, no comforting hand holding, no loving hugs, no skin on skin. My life is a lot better, I thought I was getting better, I felt better, for awhile. My life has totally changed in the last few months but after all of the dust settled I’m still alone and penniless, with worthless writings and trying my best to fill every moment with anything that kills time. Right up until I get drowsy and I get cozy and the stars and moon take over the sky. Then I have nothing to do but bask in the quietness and think and I’m tired."
lonely,I feel so wrong and broken all the time. It’s like everyone I know is just a single serving experience,"I feel so wrong and broken all the time. It’s like everyone I know is just a single serving experience - Even the people I interact with on a daily basis. I’m just struggling to exist. Also I’m kind of drunk right now so this post is going to make basically no sense, but whatever it’s just stream of consciousness bullshit I’m projecting into the ether in the hope that someone somewhere can comprehend and feels it too. 

I’m obsessed with my own mortality. Fully convinced that I have cancer, or heart disease, or just something is killing me. Every day I feel like I am not a part of my own life. My living room is foreign. My kitchen, my dining room. My whole house is like it’s someone else’s and I’m just existing in it. This shell I live in. It’s all the same. I’m shaky all the time. I feel off balance. Like at any moment my will could give out and I’ll just fall over and never wake up again. I have no idea what I’m doing in my life. 

I smoke and drink constantly despite the fact that I know it is killing me. When I’m sober I tell myself that’s it. I’m not going to buy another pack of smokes. But then for a moment I have clarity and I say oh fuck it I’m fine this time. I don’t drink daily but when I do drink I’m drinking to feel normal. When I’m buzzed it’s almost like I’m myself again. My chest is tight. I have to constantly take deep breaths to convince myself my body is okay and I’m not struggling for oxygen. 

I eat like shit. But tell myself I’m going to do better. I never do. One or two meals a day even though I’m shaking and exhausted. I just can’t bring myself to fix it. All these consolations I give myself. Oh it’s too expensive. Or oh this delicious Taco Bell will make me feel better. It’s all lies to myself and I know it is.

I don’t feel right around what friends I have. I force myself to laugh or be the outgoing charismatic person they think I am. I’m loud and obnoxious and somewhat aggressive because it’s the only way I know how to interact with people. 

I’m rambling. I’m hurting. I feel so goddamn alone no matter how many people surround me. I need help."

I'm sure if it was a mental breakdown or something else. There have been moments before this where similar things have occurred and it has happened since. I'm just constantly crying. The worst part is that I don't know who to tell other than my therapist, who I try to see once a week but my health is getting worse faster than its getting better.

lonely,The only friend group I(19M) ever belonged to was when I was six and played with pony dolls.,"The only friend group I(19M) ever belonged to was when I was six and played with pony dolls. - When I was six years old, I had friends. We'd all sit together and play with our pony dolls, I never had any; I was a boy. Though I didn't think much of that then. 
Some of my fondest memories are of the moments I spent with them.

One day a senior girl came up to me and teased me about it. Said something about me having a crush on one my friends.

I don't blame her. But after what she said something clicked in my six year old brain. Maybe  to do with my conservative christian upbringing. Maybe the embarassment I had of crushes. But it was something that told me I should be ashamed.
I was.

Since then all male friendships I've had lacked mutual vulnerability and support. And no female friendships have persisted due to contradictions between platonic paradigms, and the passionate feelings had mutually as a result of intense loneliness and connection. 
All closeness has been conducive to loss.

But my chronic loneliness ensuing bred obssessive thinking. And my thought process was gradually refined as time went on.

I have not learnt that closeness is conducive to loss, I have learnt that it is simply tremendously difficult for someone like me to have it harmoniously.

Having mutual vulnerability, mutual honesty, mutual fondness, but also no destructive romantic desire, is difficult.

It is doubly difficult when though most people you do not get along with, the few that you do are almost exclusively women.

The best way I have to explain my sexuality right now is ""heterosexual"" and then I turn to the camera to give a flirty wink.

This story goes on.
It started at six, and has not ended since 19.

Right now.
More than anything, I just want friends.
And I'm left feeling guilty for how bored I am with most people.
The small talk of groups can be fine, but I never get to know anyone. I never feel known.

These feelings are not helpful for the mitigation of loneliness. And that's what I need more than anything.

My greatest interest is psychology, specifically in assigning the most likely causes for pathological cognitive patterns. Particularly my own. This is a compensation for loneliness (the company of myself rather than that of others).

But I'm sure if you're open to being vulnerable, and are willing to see the hidden parts of yourself, that might question your sense of self, I'm sure we'll get along fine.


I don't know what else to say.

I'd prefer if people who were genuinely interested in me as a person rather than an emotional charity case would like to chat.

He said it in a really sarcastic way. Then I told him even this game can run, I don’t want to play individually side by side, I prefer multiplayer game. He just said, It’s nothing different. I started to feel unhappy about the whole thing. Then I said, it seems that you don’t say ‘I love you’ recently. He said No, I love you. Why are you blaming me? Why didn’t you say it? I told him, I need more love and care, I miss romance and passion. He keeps saying, tell me something not so vague. Then I cried myself in the corner and fell asleep. It’s common for me.

The next day, my boyfriend accused me of blaming him and called my drama queen by reel him my feeling. He even messaged my dad telling him that I’m insane and need to see a doctor. Then I had to created a group for my parents and my boyfriend and me, copied and pasted what my boyfriend threatened me: I’m going to fuck a prostitute and stop contacting me.

I've always tried to think that I don't care about this day but it just leads me to think about how much better it would have been had I not survive the day of my birth when that god damn doctor (whoever they may be) saved my stupid baby-self from strangling to death by the umbilical cord.

That turned dark pretty quickly..

Either way I've never really had the courage to post anything on reddit ever. But for once I felt like letting myself just scream out into the void just to let it all out even if no one ends up seeing this."

lonely,How do you deal with the feelings?,"How do you deal with the feelings? - Hey everyone,

So I’ve separated after 24 years and I am feeling it. The loss of companionship, the conversation, physical touch and the banter etc. I’m also missing not seeing my children as much. My situation is further complicated by the fact that I’m in recovery from addiction, so I’ve pretty much cut contact with old friends and haven’t made any real friends in the recovery community.

Most of my days are like this - I rise early and drive to the shore for quiet time, silence and prayer before work. I work all day then come home to eat, watch tv, browse the web, read or listen to music. Not a bad life really, I have my basic material needs met, but the sense of being alone, the actual feeling of it, can overwhelm me sometimes. 

I’ve thought about going to church, going to groups or starting a new hobby etc. The truth is that in some ways, I’m actually a loner and so I don’t bond easy, it takes time for me. 

So...the feelings...what do you do to manage them? Do you distract? Do they fade in time? Any and all advice gratefully received.

Thank you :)"

lonely,I crave social connections but I don't want it at the same time,"I crave social connections but I don't want it at the same time - I'm a combination of introversion, loneliness, depression, and self-destructive behavior; maybe that's why I find it nearly impossible to have positive and continuous friendships/relationships outside of brief, surface-level conversations. 

I crave friendship and meaningful interactions with people, but when the opportunity presents itself I act distant and cold to others and act like I want nothing to do with them (although I feel differently on the inside). 

Are my standards too high? Am I too emotionally messed up? The best I can do is stay as busy as possible with work and school to stave off depression, but sometimes it doesn't feel like enough.

And I think about some of my reactions to disappointments and social failures and I see that I don't have any wisdom to cope or the tools needed to have healthy relationships ....

We hit it off and I failed to read some come ons so she didnt pursue me further, it's torture knowing that I goofed so hard. She's got reasons as to why she doesn't let people close and also has asperger's syndrome so she's hard to communicate with when not in person. To be honest I don't even know why I'm writing this... I needed some format to let this out when all I've done is stare at messages left on read to my crush, or re-reading messages from my ex who has fallen in love with another person.

lonely,Here's something....,"Here's something.... - Where to begin? Well lets see, I've been friends with this one girl since middle school, and somewhere along the way, I started having feelings for her in high school, how'd I find this out? Well, one of my ex-friends asked me if it would be okay if he went out with her, and at first I said yes and thought nothing of it at first, only to actually think about it later during class and only then to feel my heart hurting, then another friend of mine had told me about what kind of person the guy was, and it from what I heard, it wasn't good so I had tried to break them up out of her own safety, and I succeded though that may have more than likely killed any and all chances of being together with her as I had confessed my own feelings, and got turned down, I went out with other girls after, but nothing clicked or something was wrong, one was an on and off relationship, and the other I had actually legit loved, but that was false because that ex confessed to me that she never actually loved me, and that she forced herself to love me so you can imagine what that did to my confidence, fast forward years later, I'm hanging out with my friend that had turned me down amd for a while I thought I might have had a chance again, only to have life slap me across the face yet again when she asked me to go with her to make sure everything was okay because she was meeting her online boyfriend from TF2 and their love was real too, since then it's been almost a decade, she had moved to a far off place within the state with her mom and boyfriend, with plans to move put of state because of cheaper housing, mind you I've still not given up, the smart, normal, and right thing would've been to let it go and carry on, but I refused to be normal because to hell with that, if I let this go, I'm going to regret this, knowing full well that even rejecting the truth of moving on and to keep going after her would lead to regret, because if she goes, she's never coming back. Each night, I'm thinking of her, and it's twisting me from the inside, distorting my views, amd just recently my best friend that I've known since elementary school had announced that he plans to move to out of state as well just to get out of this god forsaken state, I mean sure I've other friends, but these two have been with me for the longest part of my life, and the fact they both have plans to go somewhere else is breaking me. I know I shouldn't complain, I can't complain, I can never complain, because they're doing what they want to do, but they're going somewhere I can't follow, even if and after I get myself together and have the means to do so, and if I say anything I'm the bad guy. My best friend that I could legit count on for anything and the girl I'm in love with are going to leave me behind. So here I am, a nobody with two of the greatest friends anyone could've asked for, getting left behind to rot and wallow in self pity even if and after I get myself together and sorted out."
lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

lonely,Dealing with having a crazy personality and how it effects relationships.,"Dealing with having a crazy personality and how it effects relationships. - All my life, I have known I’m different, weird or whatever you want to call it, and many people have made it known to me. I have mild autism and ADD making me very anxious and awkward. I’m ok with this and over the years excepted who I am. However, despite having a great job, nice house and am in good shape. I have never been able to get in to a real relationship even at 19 and constantly being exposed to many people. 

Every night it sits with me knowing that I won’t be able to have that type of romantic connection with someone my friends or colleagues have. No matter what I try, whether that be therapy or talking with my mates, I can’t get over being alone. All I want is to care for someone who will care for me equally; as everyone does. 

But that is pretty much impossible when your a programmer with an unhealthy addiction to memes. My personality is something I cannot change and is who I am. How do you guys deal with the constant reminder that your own personality, the person you are, at your core is unattractive? I know that this is the part of me that drives people away, not my looks, not my job or anything material. It’s me that’s the problem, and it haunts me every night that there is nothing I can do to help with the loneliness.

lonely,I wish I could restart my life life (ramblings about failed friendship),"I wish I could restart my life life (ramblings about failed friendship) - I don't think I've made any single good decision in my life other than buying dark souls. I don't have any friends. I had maybe two friends in the start of the last semester but I ruined both.

I feel like I just need to rant a bit.

Last semester I met my first really close friend. I was actually really happy for a period of maybe one and a half months while we still were friends. She told me stuff that made me feel like I wasn't nothing. She told me stuff like ""I was her second favourite person(only behind by her cat)"" and ""that talking to me really helped her mental health."" I felt like someone actually cared about me which was new for me since I've just felt like a nuisance to people for as long as I can remember.

By mid November she started distancing herself from me without telling me why. This made me confused and I started loathing myself for it. I didn't understand why she was distancing herself from me.

The last few social interactions between us were just bland because I didn't have the energy to by social because I was loathing myself and stressed over upcoming exams.

It was late November when she told me that she didn't want to socialize with me whatsoever because of mental health reasons. I said that I understood and I never approached her again irl after that point.

Our communication throughout December was minimal and only consisted of a text every week.

She basically only sent screenshots of people saying something funny to her in a discord chat or call. Which both confused me and made me hate myself more for each screenshot. 

I didn't understand if she dislikesd me or if I'm just uninteresting. I felt left behind and confused. I didn't know if she meant it when she told me that ""I was the closest friend she had had in a long time"" just a month prior.

Everytime I walked past her in school or shared a class with her she was talking to people, but she wouldn't even acknowledge my existence.

Just a week and a half into December I hated myself to the point where I started cutting myself with a hacksaw. By that point I was crying daily

She started texting me again just two days before Christmas. I was really happy and I bought her hollow knight for Christmas. It didn't matter to me that she didn't get me anything, I was just so goddamn happy that we were somewhat talking again.

But just a week later she completely stops responding to my texts without saying anything. 5 days went by until I realized that she was deliberately staying away from me in school and not replying to any of my texts. 

It wasn't as bad as in December because I was used to it by then.

I was getting tired of being on the brink of tears constantly and I wanted to be able to sleep. I wanted to understand why she stopped talking to me, so I could either move on or stay friends.

After three weeks I decided that cutting ties would be the best Idea for me to move on. I started writing drafts for long messages where I basically said that I wanted to cut ties with her. I chose messages because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable by approaching her in person.

After a month I sent my last and most rude draft. Instead of summing it up I decided to include it into the post

&gt;The logical part of My Brain understood that you just talked to me for around a week in December to manipulate me. I'm only writing this to burn the few remaining imaginary bridges that my limbic system keeps trying to make up.

&gt;Your intentions should've been clear to me considering that you only started talking to me again a few days before the Holliday of giving. Especially since you told me about how you  manipulated guys into giving you steam games. I guess the fact that we used to be close friends deceived me.

&gt;When I bought you hollow knight I didn't care that you didn't get me anything. I was happy because I thought we were friends again, I really missed you back then.

&gt;I honestly don't know why you bothered to keep talking to me for around a week afterwards, I'm guessing it was to keep me from refunding it(which I wouldn't have done either way).

&gt;I don't know why I didn't understand that our friendship ended in late November. Maybe because I'm just bad at social signs or that you were my first close friend.

&gt;What you do with this message doesn't matter to me. For all I care you can laugh at it with your friends like you did with ###### messages. I'm writing this for myself so that I can move on and focus on things that matter.

&gt;I hope you enjoyed playing hollow knight.


What I wrote was really fucking stupid and really hurtful.

lonely,Why,Why - Why does only one person make the happiest I've ever been while battling depression. I know I dont have a chance with her. She tells me how her ex have started talking again for the 3rd time. She cuts herself and I told her right in front of her mom to please talk to me as a first resort instead of the razor. It made her and her mom happy knowing that I'm here for her. We walked around for 3 hours just walking and I already miss her. I'm gonna see her tomorrow but I cant help but to feel sad knowing I'll never have a chance with her. My feelings for her keep getting stronger every day I hang out with her but at the time when she asked i told her I didn't have feelings for her because at the time I didn't. She invited me to the traditional church service today and I went and when someone I who I was she made sure to emphasize that I was just a friend. Now I'm laying down in bed on the verge of a mental breakdown because of my loneliness and knowing that I'm never gonna get with her. Even if I do I'm best friends with her ex and that could completely ruin our friendship. Why does this have to be so complicated? Why cant I just be happy with someone without catching feelings?

Mental illness, “a disease or period of sickness affecting the body or mind”. Mental illness is a little cockroach that creeped in there like a parasite.

No treatment, medication, facility that will help. Just imagine a helpless maple leaf just being carried by the wind. There is absolutely nothing that will help. The only thing is that some days, things are better. I strive to make all days like that. 


What happened? What happened to humanity that they can’t make one part of the body not malfunction. No one has found a cure for, PTSD, DID, BPD, BD, or any other mental illness. I want to be better. I need to be better for my sake. I want to influence people and to make sure they know it gets better. But, how can I say that and not believe it. It is just the seedling, the little white lie. Is there something I did? Is this genetic? What are the causes? There are a number of endless questions. We never know what will come our way so we hide behind the rock. We don’t come out, not ever. 


We all suffer. Slowly going down the drain. We will all dissolve at one point. We all have our own problems that we can’t handle. Why is that? Why do we all need to suffer and bleed out in pain, just to be human? We developed from millions of generations of dinosaurs. They didn’t have mental illness, so why do we? Why do we need to constantly be in pain? Why are we even here? What was the point of that, to be here. Did someone mess with us?  Did God or the Devil mess with us to pay for what destruction we have done? Do we really deserve this?


My life has been a slow train slowly, and not knowingly about to crash. We all have our problems but why do we need too? Is there some sort of obligation? What is the point of depression, anxiety, stress? Why does life need to be stressful to be a life? We never deserve to be in such pain but we are anyway. We are human but not some rats in a lab. We can’t be mutated to be mentally ill. We are living, breathing, organisms that just want some joy. Why are some people better off than others?


We don’t deserve pain. We need nerves in our body but why do we feel pain? Is it “God’s Plan”? Will it happen in a few years that we will never feel pain anymore? I wish that I was healthy. I wish I was like the other girls, but why? Why do I think that so automatically. I am jealous of the girls walking around with their group of friends who love them and are true friends. Why can’t I have that? Do we really need friends? I like being alone but I am so lonely. I can’t tell anyone who I am. I just need something to get me through the day. Would you know what that is, Tabitha?"

To put it short,he only sees me as a friend. I got mad at myself for telling him and felt so angry I ended up shaving my head just so I could ease what was going inside me, I couldn’t bare the embarrassment. I still love him and we make small talks( texting obviously). I imagine scenarios where I could be with him and cry myself to sleep most nights, there are times when the loneliness hits me hard and I want just to scream so loud."
lonely,10 yrs no friends. Don't connect with anyone...should I get a dog?,10 yrs no friends. Don't connect with anyone...should I get a dog? - I think its been 10 years now with no friends. Its hard to remember at this point...I can tell its beginning to effect me mentally and physically. My friends from my past don't want to talk to me. Probably for the best cause I don't relate with them anymore. Feeling depressed and lonely at this point. No one talks to me at work either. I come home and on weekends I just watch tv and occasionally ride my bike through town....I just feel weird being in public showing my face always just me by myself. Would like to have someone to talk to and hangout with but don't even know where to begin or how to because its been so long. Never really developed the best social skills and feel like im just being a drag because I just come off as depressed and numb. Im thinking the only solution at this point is to get a dog and just accept my loneliness for now. Should I get a dog?
lonely,Imagining how I would say goodbye to my girlfriend if I had a girlfriend,"Imagining how I would say goodbye to my girlfriend if I had a girlfriend - I have already been fantasising about so many things in my head that I could do together with my non-existent girlfriend. This time I think I made it feel so real. I imagined that we met at uni and it was the begging of summer holidays. We live in different countries and so wouldn't see each other for 3 months. She had to get the train home and so we went to the station. While on the platform, we were looking into each other's eyes, holding each other and hugging for so long knowing that we won't be together for a long time. I was trying to hide my tears from her but I just couldn't, I already missed her too much. As she was boarding the train I was holding her hand and as hard as it was, I had to let her go. The last thing I said to her was 'I love you so much and you mean everything to me'. Then the train left and that was pretty much the end of the memory, even though it never happened, somehow inside of me these adventures that I imagine for myself to escape loneliness do feel real. That gives me at least some way to try and enjoy life."

lonely,Omegle doesn’t work anymore,"Omegle doesn’t work anymore - I have now accepted that it’s me who is the problem. Every now and then I find someone really cool on Omegle, talk for months and then out of nowhere I’ll get unfriended or blocked.

I just had a conversation with my bookshelf about it. Just sat there and talked like it was my therapist. 

What hurts the most is when you either experience something really fun or just need someone to talk to and you realize that the only person that’s there to talk to you is your mom. I met a cute girl on tinder that I bonded with and I so desperately wanted to tell someone. Found eventually some random stranger on Omegle to tell. Next day the girl unmatched me. 

I know I’m not terribly ugly. I’m right below average. I had a pretty rough childhood, most of my friends were adults so now I have no clue how to talk to people my age. They scare me. 

I’m so lonely I no longer cry over it. Because it’s nothing new. I have endless pages in my diary about this, but I wanted to share with some humans god damnit. 

Lately I’ve been really sick. I get that it’s just the flu and I’ll get better but at this point I don’t want to hear the reassurance. I don’t need people to tell me “you’re gonna be fine” at this point I’ve accepted I might die. That’s dumb, but it’s nice. I’m nowhere suicidal, I will not try to kill myself. I’m just okay with death at this point."

In the last couple of years I went from having tons of friends to not that many. When I started struggling with anxiety nobody cared or tried to understand why I withdrew so hard from them. I didn't want to just go out and party every night anymore, and it just feels like I'm alone and no one cares what I'm going through. I'm not suicidal and I'm sure there will be light at the end of the tunnel but I feel like if I tell any of my actual friends what I'm going through they'll judge me and look at me differently. So if theres anyone out there that needs a friend that's not creepy or anything im here.. thanks for reading"

We used to talk a lot, but talked less and less after that agreement and now he got a bf. I should block him since its hurting me seeing him happy with someone else than me doing the stuff I imagined we would do. I guess there's still some hope in me that they will break up ( the fact that I hope they break up makes me feel bad but I can't help it) We talked a bit recently before I knew he had a bf and he still saves the flirty/cute messages I sent him as he used to back then.

 I'm back again and I just keep coming back like a boomerang. You'll never fully get rid of me which may be a good thing or possibly bad thing. That's all in your perspective.  I'm a kind hearted caring soul who just enjoys spreading love and happiness to those who may need or want it. 
A little about myself I have social anxiety, so at times, more than not, I can be socially awkward and weird but I embrace it.  I'm into gaming (PS4), I enjoy watching horror movies and youtube videos, I like listening to music (who doesn't),  I'm open minded, so I am willing to basically talk about anything from the weather to conspiracies. Just anything in general. I enjoy jokes (dirty dark humor and all) and I love a good pun :)
That's all for now. We can leave the rest if you find this interesting or find it to be your cup of tea, then feel free to message me. If you want start with telling me a little about yourself.
I look forward to talking with you and possibly developing a friendship 😁

P.S. I do have other ways of chatting because the messages here tend to glitch and I have to keep restarting the app. I have kik, snapchat, discord, and instagram"
lonely,Wishing I was a people person,"Wishing I was a people person - I’m not extremely shy but I’m also not outgoing. I wish I was naturally a people person but people hate me. It’s so sad that the friends I view as my closest probably see me as just one of their other friends, not close to a best friend. They never invite me to hangout, one on one or in small groups. They only invite me when it’s a big event that they invite all their friends to. A group of girls I’ve known for years have never invited me when they hang. I’m the only girl that they leave out within our bigger group. Why don’t people like me? I’m shy but I put a lot of effort to talk to people. Am I too awkward? Am I not funny enough? Too nice? I’m tired of being a friend that’s in the background. Even in my big friend group the only reason I’m invited is because my boyfriend is. Everyone loves him. Why can’t I be a people person like him."

lonely,Lonely extrovert :(,"Lonely extrovert :( - It sucks when you’re an extrovert yet feel so alone. I have my family, relatives, and college friends I barely see. I have a bestfriend since college who lives nearby but everytime I ask him to hangout he’s always unavailable so that pissed me off and pride got in the way so I’m never hanging out with him again unless he invites me, in which case, never did. We have an active group chat but that isn’t enough since I want a human interaction. All I ever hangout with are my family members and relatives, and it’s great; but there’s a void I feel so much that needs to be filled, but sadly it feels impossible. There are other available friends I can hangout with but I don’t really enjoy their company (I don’t like their vibe and I don’t really had fun with them in the past) so I said I’d rather just be alone than to hang out with people I half heartedly want to be with because I feel like that’s just a waste of time and energy.

Back story: I used to have high school friends who ended up betraying me and it’s been 7 years since the friendship ended but the pain still hits me like it happened yesterday. I already muted all their Facebook posts because seeing them all together happy without me feel like I have this cursed, shitty life. I miss them and I made ways to reconnect with them in the past but it did not restored the friendship. 

Sometimes, I think to myself, “How could this happen to me? How did I end up here? Was it my fault? Is there something wrong with me?”

What did I do to deserve all the hell I’m going through? 

I see people going out, living their lives and having fun, while I stay at home feeling like I’m wasting my youth. 

Being uninvited, having no one to hang out with when you wanna interact w/ friends so bad, being betrayed, being unwanted. I’ve felt all of those. This sucks and I feel like a fucking loser. I’m such a strong person but this is just too much to handle to be honest."

I also really enjoy politics so if you do too maybe we can have some friendly discussions. I’m republican/conservative and would like maybe some friends who share similar stances. If not that’s fine, message anyway, Just have had my fair share of debates that have made me lose some friends and I’m getting so tired of people labeling me as things.

Here the korean community in argentina is... bad if i had to describe it , there are a lot ton of sh*t people within this community .fake or not, always spreading BS rumor about everyone everything that makes it seem as if it was something real bad , i mean yeah, this could happen anywhere but there's something ""special"" here that makes it so damn... idk what to say  . you really cant trust anybody else from your family or really close friends or gf/bf (neither uncles,cousins etc nor ""ordinary"" friends can be trusted here)
We ,the teenage korean community(?) is who we get the most beef around here whether its an adult or a friend who makes it. im naturally a pretty quiet guy so thats maybe why im alone. i have a few close friends but they're not always around me whenever i need them the most, but i cant blame them, im the introverted here. Anyways, i usually tend to stay at home on weekends but when a go out with my friends im just standing or sitting there listening what the say and at the end of they day i go home with just a few words said. people always say behind my back that im a weird dude or something like that, i dont like it. 
i remember 2 years ago ,(i was dealing with severe anxiety and i dropped out from school )i was walking my dog, a korean sh*tty fat ADULT shouted at me because my dog peed in front of him , we were arguing and i kept telling him i was sorry and all while he was shouting when suddenly i felt my leash slipping off and my dog ran away from me . i started following him towards my house, i was angry and wanted to kill that man so bad that i grabbed my knife and ran , i fell, hurt my knees and i snapped and dropped the knife therefore the anger was huge that i started punching a wall and shouting nonstop , people near me were staring and laughing at me . afterwards all the korean community knew about this , they also got the scene on surveillance cameras . i was so ashamed for it , everybody knew and they started telling me i was crazy and stuff that i didnt really like to hear and nobody wanted to be with me or thats what i felt.
but now im okay, i still need to improve my social skills  , i have a few friends and i no more act like a child and recently got back to school
TL;DR the korean community in argentina sucks

Since middle school I've sat back and watched my friends ""fall in love"" and others ""fall in love"" with them, but I can't feel that. And I hate when they talk about their significant others, I'm happy for them, I am, but its constantly talked about and I feel like they're just rubbing in my face that I can't feel that. I've never been around  a ""loving relationship"", my grandparents can't stand each other and my parents are more like roommates and my mom sleeps on the couch lots of the time. As a kid I was so bubbly and affectionate and then my personality did a whole 180. I HATE physical affection, yet I yearn to lay in bed with someone I love. The topic of relationships makes me feel sick and weirdly insecure, but I always find myself yearning for that validation that I'm enough for someone. No one's ever said kind words to me, I've never made my parents proud, the only thing my friends describe me as is emotionless and a bitch. I feel as if I've lost myself and become forgotten and insignificant in this sea of people. I feel like a shell who'll never be inhabited. It took my two years to admit to myself that I'm lonely, I've never spoken to anyone about it because I know I'll just be looked at like I'm pathetic and then the conversation with shift to be about the person I'm talking to, like it always does. I see nothing but grim in my future, I feel as if it'll always be this way and I don't knownhow much longer I can live with it.

Now I'm fat, losing hair and teeth. I have no job. No hobbies. No personality. My only hobby is watching other people live their life on my TV.

I lost count of how many years I've lived this way. I'm absolute trash. Even if someone makes the mistake of talking to me, the conversation would end quickly as I'm ugly inside and outside. I'm like dead inside. And I'm waiting to be dead outside cause I'm too scared to kill myself on the outside"

lonely,New level of loneliness,"New level of loneliness - I've officially reached the level of loneliness where I can't even cope with reality anymore. A few months ago I started pretending that this small rectangular torso sized throw pillow I have is a real person and he's my boyfriend. I kiss him and cuddle with him and I've genuinely fallen in love with him. Ik I'm fuckin delusional but I'm so lonely and cuddling with him makes it hurt less.

I’m afraid that she would end with other person and not me... I have just three friends, when I wish I had big groups of them 

I finally decided to create my own bubble, with my own rules and stories... and forget about the real fucking stupid confusing life and world, because it hurts. 
Maybe in that way, I would triumph on this world, maybe alone, but better than with all those different persons that I would never (unfortunately) control into love me"

lonely,First Contact in Months! [SUCCESS],"First Contact in Months! [SUCCESS] - The other night I for once decided to say fuck it to my anxiety and fear and met up with a girl I've been texting but hadn't met with yet. We cuddled, kissed, and talked all night and I felt true happiness for the first time in a long time. I felt a warmth in my chest, like the light inside me came back on, and for the first time in a long time I was able to stop lying to myself about not needing the company of someone else.  


Isolation is very dangerous, and I'm tired of filling the void with alcohol and shopping.  


That cold aching feeling inside, that desperate hunger for a hug. It kills you.  


Please, if you can, don't let it consume you. Don't let being numb become your normal.  
I had nobody to tell and nowhere else to share, so I thought I'd write it here as a way to cement the experience for myself and maybe encourage someone to take a chance at breaking out of situational/physical loneliness as well.  


Now I know that I personally can overcome loneliness and find a meaning in life through caring about other people again. I need to stop lying to myself about not needing others.

All and all, life isn't always all that bad in the end."

The past four years of my life have honestly been some of the worst when I was always told they’d be the best (high school) I lost my dad my freshman year, had to get a surgery the next year, last year I got turned down by my crush when I asked her to homecoming, and now I’m left with one friend after 2 of my best friends just kinda decided to ditch me out of nowhere and now all I wanna do is lay down with someone, cry and be told it’s ok"

lonely,I was so lonely I searched lonely in reddit and then it hit me. I AM REALLY LONELY,"I was so lonely I searched lonely in reddit and then it hit me. I AM REALLY LONELY - When I was a child I was very cold. I would kick my siblings. I would isolate myself from them. I wouldn't bond with them. Sometimes after I finish reading my books, I would find my the house feels very empty and I find them in the masters bedroom sleeping together.   


When I was in college, I got my first hearbreak -- in romance and failed class. But I don't have someone to cry on. I don't have someone to tell that I am feeling down. That I want to cry. That I want someone to hug me. And then I read something in the internet that when you smile or laugh, the brain would perceive it as smiling thru some nerves. So it doesn't really matter whether the smile is fake or not. The brain will produce happy hormones.   


I was so desperate to not feel lonely and alone that I forced to smile everyday in school. I would smile to body guards, to my classmates. I would laugh with them. I would laugh at corniest jokes. I'd go to  /r/jokes and force myself to laught or go to /r/mademesmile or /r/aww to force myself to smile. For sometimes, it worked. It worked so damn good I don't even know if I am really happy or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would go to bars. I became friendly. And I became sensitive to people. I can detect the slightest change in their moods, behaviours, or the way they speak and asks them if I made them upset somehow. I lost myself. I care for people now more than I care for myself because I don't want them to feel lonely. I'd drop anything for my friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now, now that I am choosing myself, distance myself from them so I can take care of myself, I feel so lonely. I told myself that I can do it. That I can cheer myself up. I started going jogging to the near park. I started online courses. I quit social media. I keep denying that I am THAT lonely. 

&amp;#x200B;

But who am I kidding. I am lonely as fuck. I feel as if I am the  person that people would go to if their first choice isn't available. No one even likes me. My friend would drop me and cancel our schedule when his girl invites him for something. 

&amp;#x200B;

And me searching if this subreddit exists and posting some shit like this exists, it struck me. I feel like I am already in an empty well of sadness. No one that can hear. I need a hug right now. :(

Not yet. Yes I do. No I don’t. Yes I do. No I don’t. Every time I want to do something in my life, everything comes crumbling down. Also my former friend kept bringing up that he’s certain I have BPD, and that has been buzzing in my head for weeks and it makes me want to die.

I have applied to a performing institute in New York, I have a Skype interview Tuesday but I’m sure I won’t get admitted. And even if I do, what will I do? Fucking $40,000 for 2 years, I only have $25,000 and I’ve already worked full-time for 2.5 years. How the fuck will I get my own apartment if I’m barely turning 18 and have no fucking credit? And then I sing, so I won’t want any roommates because I know I will be bothering them. I have no car and no license because I’ve been too depressed to get out of my house for anything and have no fucking friends to help me.

And if I don’t get admitted, I’m moving to Portland, Oregon. Again, same fucking situation. How will I get an apartment? How will I get my license without a car, and without friends? My entire life is a fucking failure.

I hate feeling like I don't have a deeper connection to people. No one likes me like that and it's difficult for me to vulnerable enough to have relationships like that. It really sucks man. I just want to cuddle and talk but I guess reading dumb fanfiction can provide me an illusion.

never had a relationship because of the same reasons. on the rare occasion that i find out someone actually likes me they drift away again. 

every time im around other people whether its family or other people my age i find myself on the outside and not included in anything

lonely,no one cares as much as i do,"no one cares as much as i do - no one cares

no one cares about me as much as i care about them. no one. not one single person. it’s my birthday in a few days, and i wanted to do a chill day in followed by dinner out with my group of friends. two of them told me they would only come to one event and one expressed that it would be inconvenient. only one person told me that screw it it’s my birthday and we’ll do whatever i want. she did, but after i said oh it’s too hard for everyone dwabi, even she backed off. 

the thing is, i could’ve just gone out to dinner with one friend, who claims to be my best friend, but THEY are the ones that asked if i was doing anything for my bd, like they wanted to be included. and this supposed best friend is one of the ones that said she would only come to one event. she decided that spending the whole day with the griup was too much for her and she didn’t want to deal with it. this person who i’ve expressed affection for in ways i’m not even comfortable with because i know she appreciates the gestures, cannot be bothered to put up with a few hours of being around a loud group. 

these people - i would do ANYTHING for them. i love them so much, we’ve been friends for a decade. i often feels that they aren’t as attached to me as i am to them. today i feel like no one cares. i have a friend for whole i’ve driven 45 minutes away to bring her food and listen to her cry when she’s been struggling. when i texted her asking if i could come over and talk for a bit because i was having a really hard time, told me she had a lot of work to do. 

i do my best to make sure everyone feels included. i do my best to make sure everyone enjoys their birthdays - i bake them cakes or lasagnas or organize surprises. and they tell me how much they love me blah blah blah. but when it comes to me, no one shows up for me. no one cares about me as much as i care about them. 

i don’t know if i’m taking too much of this and just spiralling. i don’t know if i’m making myself feel shitty. but what sucks even more is that every friend i have is someone who i can’t talk to about this. all my friendships are superficial. i can’t talk to my parents or siblings m. i can’t talk to my friends. i don’t have a boyfriend or husband. i am alone. sure i’m surrounded by people and hang out with people but i am alone. i go through the shit in life alone. i struggle through and power through life alone. and it fucking sucks."

Anyway, so my wife left me last summer, so that really didn’t help matters. I started dating again a few months later, I’m not sure if that helped or not in the beginning....the first time I hooked up with someone new, I left pretty quickly having a panic attack and cried on the way home. Not just a few tears, but like had to pull over because I couldn’t breath or see.

Fast forward a bit, I’m actually seeing someone pretty steadily, but we don’t get to see much of each other as I work a lot and have my kiddo a lot too and she isn’t ready to meet him yet (totally understandable, I’m not ready for that either). 

But it just sucks, I only have 2 real friends, ones out of state for the holiday weekend with her boyfriend, and the other has a family of us own and weekend plans as well.

Then she lashed out again, that im a downer and i make her unhappy and sad and thats why she doesnt like to talk to me anymore(we used to talk 24/7 before) and that she has her own problems and that she needs a complete man, who isnt broken in her life. 
Me instinctively being afraid of being alone, told her that im sorry and i will work on myself and i wont complain to her anymore. 

After the conversation ended, i thought to myself, “another person in my life who i cant be real with/ tell whats really going on in my mind or what im feeling”"

lonely,"I haven’t made friends since I met my husband, and all my friends abandoned me then","I haven’t made friends since I met my husband, and all my friends abandoned me then - I have always had a difficult tine making friends, and I have a tendency to be very opinionated. When I was in undergrad and right after college, I had a solid group of friends, male and female. The minute I met my husband, who is a bit backward but not at all offensive, every single one dropped me, from every friend group. Now I think my only worth was as a potential sexual partner. I’m not sure I want to go on, honestly. It’s been 8 years and no one has reached out, and I’ve not been able to establish any new connections. Worse, I get uglier and older every day, so if that was my value, it’s diminishing"

lonely,I feel lost and I don’t know why,"I feel lost and I don’t know why - I’m a 15 year old male and I feel lonely very often. I have a mostly loving family. My parents divorced last month, but that hasn’t really changed me. I don’t really have any close friends, which makes me sad. I have a group of people I hang out in school and some times I see them at them in the gym so I can’t really say that I have no friends at all, but I’m not that connected to anyone particular. I’m not sure if they actually care about me or if they only act nice because they know that I’m lonely. Regardless I really appreciate them and I’m thankful of at least sometimes being able to belong somewhere. Although there is one guy in the group who always makes fun of me (probably for clout), but it doesn’t really bother me that much. 

Outside of that, I feel like people kinda tend to avoid me. I’ve tried to build connections to people on social media, but there people either ignore me or completely block me, without even saying a word. I really have no idea why. Random people often joke about my looks, which gets really annoying over time. For me it seems like even the teachers of our school dislike me. 

Over all I doesn’t sound like I’m in such a bad spot. I have a friend group I maybe could be closer with, but again I don’t know I they would want to. I have no issues with my family and even though it’s annoying hearing mean comments from people I’ve kinda gotten used to it and I feel like a could just live alone. Still, for some reason I feel like I just don’t want to go on. I want to die, but not in a suicidal way. It’s like I’ve reached the end of the road. I don’t know what’s wrong. I just feel lonely.

If you read this far, I really appreciate you. If someone here has had a similar experience, please give me some advice. Also, sorry for my bad English."

28 male here.
I've been going to my local skatepark for years now and the guys down there I've known since I was about 15.
Although a lot of them smoke a bunch of weed I can look past it. But now recently they have been cocain and other substances.
I used to smoke but it really fucked with me and I became a nervous wreck for 9 months and can't smoke it at all anymore and since then the depression has been horrible . I have seeked help and  although the people are nice the advice is shit. 

Anyway. Because I don't do the things they do and get fucked up every night I don't really get called out all that much.
I just moved a little further away from my home town in the last 3 weeks, only about 5 miles up the road. But I've heard nothing from anyone. I could go on to write the last 5 months and the expensive waste of time my ex was but I don't think dwelling on it is the best thing to do.

The past week at work has been awful and I'm pretty close to updating my cv and finding another job. I have no qualifications and I just moved into a one bed flat on my own. So I have to do the life thing myself now. At 28 years old this has been a long time coming and to be honest. Being in this tiny flat on my own is driving me slightly mad. The last 3 days I get home from work. Then drive back to my parents to use the internet so I can sort my bills and life out. And I get home and think about killing myself until 1am along with all the things my friends have said to me that made me feel a little crappy.
At this point I 'm single, alone and depressed.
I started taking my sertraline again today but can't help but feel like I'm going to be seriously considering ending it all soon if things don't look up.

I don't want to get to the point where I'm 45, alone, no family and friends and looking forward to dieing old with a boring outlook on the world.

I don't really know why I came here. I think I just needed anyone to read this because I have no one to talk to."

I'm a (36F) married mother of two and I'm so bored and so lonely, it's driving me insane.  I'm home with two small children all day while husband works. I have literally no friends. Not even online friends at the moment, which, from the age of about 14, was where I met most of my friends, anyway. 

I read a lot, watch TV when I can, write when I can... I'm just dying for some kind of connection with other people!

Don't get me wrong, my husband is wonderful and I miss him a LOT while he's at work, because he's my only adult friend. I speak to my mom, but that's it. She lives four hours away and is...well, it's complicated and I won't go into it here. Anyway, my best friend of so many years passed away ..wow, in 2007? I had one person I spoke to from high school for awhile but she kind of drifted away. It's just...I guess I'm not good at friendship, or something.

lonely,None of my friends are real,"None of my friends are real - I made them up in my mind when I was 8 or 9 to cope with not having anybody. I was never much liked, kids avoided me, I never had friends, I was bullied. The teachers only hung out with me and sat with me at lunch because they saw that I had nobody. 

I have one very special friend and she never leaves my side. It’s not like she can, because she lives in my mind, and she is my pure imagination, but she has become such a vital part of my life. I need her to survive. She told me that if I die, she dies. She told me that she will always be there for me. I really love her. 

I think about the friends in my mind nearly 24/7. They comfort me, they make me laugh and they give me somebody to talk to. Sometimes, people ask who I am talking to, because I forgot that they aren’t real and actually use my voice to talk to them. Usually, I just say that I am talking to myself. Kids think I’m weird because of this, and it made them avoid me even more. Also, they make me laugh. I love their jokes and they know exactly how to make me smile. Sometimes, I laugh out loud at their jokes and smile ear to ear because of the things they say to me. Other people think this is weird- that I laugh at random times. I just tell them that I’m thinking of something I read the night before.  I have never actually told anybody about the people in my head. 

I didn’t realize how _wrong_ this is until recently. Most people don’t have other people living in their head. It’s just me. These friends of mine were created by an elementary schooler version of me who was desperate for friends, but could never achieve any. 

My friends are with me right now, as I am crying while typing this. I’m not crying hard, but I am very sad. They can never exist. They don’t exist. They aren’t real. I want them to be real. I want to live in a world where they exist. I want to hug them. I want to hold them. I want them to be free, and not have to live in my mind. I love them so much, none of you have any idea. I never want to lose them. 

Sure, they can’t physically touch me, and I’m touch starved, but they can talk to me and help me through very tough times. It’s weird, but, they give me advice and know exactly what to say to calm me down. It’s wonderful, really.

I am sorry for wasting your time."

lonely,Lonely Paranoid,"Lonely Paranoid -  

This will be a long post. 

I am a 25 year old gay male and I have always felt lonely and left out. Since I was little I felt I did not belong among people, yet I craved the connection so much. I always liked doing weird stuff to get the attention I never had at home. I wanted to excel at school just to get noticed and praised, but I also did weird stuff to get noticed. I liked to drastically change my looks to get the reaction and looks from others, etc. The list is long.

I became interested in sex very early on. It has become an emotional outlet for me as well - if I get to sleep with a guy, I'll get some of his attention too. I have problems with being rejected a lot and I used to lead quite a promiscuous life, even though deep inside I wanted and want to adore and be adored by one guy only. I am a total people pleaser (not only in bed) and tend to sacrifice my own good and pleasure for the sake of others - which is extremely rarely reciprocated.

I have always had very few friends - not many ppl could handle my true weird self and it's hard for me to open up to others. Nevertheless lately I began losing my friends for various reasons and now I have barely anybody to confess to. Sure, I do have a few acquaintances but they live their own lives and I feel like they are not willing to listen to my everyday life stuff. I feel like a burden a lot. A lot of a lot.

Whenever I get a message on Facebook it makes my heart skip a beat. I'm so happy that somebody else writes me a message and I instantly reply. Whenever I see that (1) in the tab I just wish so desperately that it's a message and not a notification.

Did I mention my rejection problems? If somebody does not reply to my message I automatically assume they hate me, think I'm boring or overly attached. 99 percent of the time it's not true, but I get these thoughts more and more often. Sometimes I sabotage my relationships with people just to get rid of the feeling that I'm worthless. I get clingy to people because I have so few friends and the fact of being too clingy scares people off.

I live by myself and I currently work from home. In the weekend I feel like going out with somebody from time to time - when my very few friends/acquaintances are busy I sit at home and hardly go out. Slowly I learned how to spend time by myself and I feel either very insecure around strangers - I feel like as if they wanted to kill me with their eyes or I am overly (falsely) confident. None the less seeing all these people getting together at bars, concerts, cinemas etc. - I just wish to be like them, yet I can't no matter how hard I try. I feel it's all so shallow yet I want it so much.

I had just one boyfriend who never loved me. He was there because I was younger and we had good sex. All the other crushes I somehow push away by being the true me. I like weird stuff - weird music, kitschy art, I can be loud and showy, and I am very demanding affection and attention-wise. Very often I get the feeling that gay guys run as fast as they can whenever the ""love"" thing appears to show (from my side) and I got burned pretty badly a few times. Over the years I've built high walls around myself, and very rarely do I let them down to open up. Showing emotions or feeling was strictly prohibited at my home and I guess my organism just muffled it all down - very rarely do I experience exhilaration / sadness / excitement - I guess I need strong stimuli to feel anything at all.

What I do feel, however, is guilt. I feel guilty for everything - for running away from my family and hurting them (even though they hurt me and were abusive to me). I feel guilty for not having enough friends or connections that would satisfy me. I feel guilty and stupid when I send sb a message and they don't message me back - even though I know they can be busy or just whatever. I feel like I'm overmessaging people and that I'm being too clingy over again. So I wait for their answer and up until then I'll have 3 different scenarious explaining conveniently that they hate me and find me a burden.

I hate my looks. I am extremely camera-shy and I just think I look like a little kid. People of both sexes keep telling me I'm handsome but I just have hard time believing them. I do not believe in any of my skills - I just have this feeling I'm never good enough at anything. I wish I could go on Tinder and find some friends or a boyfriend, but I just can't accept any picture of me cause I think my looks are laughable and I will just be a laughing stock among all the other good-looking guys.

My family never took me seriously. I was a little smart ass boy in the glasses and it just stayed this way for them. I was left out during important conversations and any decision making (even the one that would directly concern me) and I've always felt extremely guilty for being gay and not telling them (haha, another one). They were always expecting me to get a high profile job and a wife with kids, and I guess I failed them all the way. Still feel subconsciously guilty about it. I feel like a total failure and burden in every aspect of family life so I let them go. I was also emotionally abused and neglected and I feel that that's a scar on my psyche I have to live with.

I do go out. To the gym three times a week sometimes. Sometimes with one buddy or another, sometimes by myself, but it's just not enough. I will sometimes go to a sauna to look at naked dudes and wish I looked as good as them. An occasional party is nice as well, although I'm scared to organise one cause I have so few friends that I think it'll just look miserable. 

I hate to admit it, but I am lonely as fuck these days. Before I had one of my gym buddies, with whom I would sleep, but suddenly he became scared of love and started randomly dating other guys. I was expecting he'd hang out with me yesterday nonetheless (we were supposed to go to the gym), but I was left out on the Valentine's Day, it turns out, cause he had a date. He also cancelled watching netflix with me the day before Valentines to go on another first date. I felt shitty as hell and I still do. I have some feelings for him he just won't accept. Now he's kinda avoiding me and obviously I assumed he hates me. When I told him I was sad he cancelled on me twice he started kinda attacking me and telling me he can't spend 100% of his time with me. Duh. Other people have lives, have I already forgotten? Now I guess we'll spend 0% of time together or it's just my paranoia. It's even worse that we have mutual friends and I'll feel heavy-as-earth-guilty for developing feelings for him and not being able to see him happy with some other guy. A similar thing happened to me exactly two years ago and I just had to stop seeing a group of friends of mine cause it hurt so much.

Today I started rewatching Legend of Korra (watch ATLA first please) we were supposed to watch together, but I guess he will never have time for me outside of gym, provided he will still be my gym buddy. I don't know what to do on weekends with myself. In between episodes I went grocery shopping, went to the hairdresser, cleaned up my apartment, had a full ""beauty"" routine but all I think about is how lonely I am. I can't even cry because my emotions are that muffled - I want to cry even now, believe me.

I feel like my life is over. Rationally I know it's bullshit, but I do not know how to get out of this shame-and-guilt pit. I have big dreams but I assume they don't make sense if I do not cater for my social needs first. 

TL:DR - Lonely and guilty AF"

lonely,Breakups and dependence,"Breakups and dependence - Breakups...

I'm dependent on others for even the slightest sense of wellness. I don't know how to grow from that or just be happy with myself. I feel like I'm not enough, for her, for myself. I can't be alone again and I just want to hop right back into the next relationship so I feel like I have a reason to do better for myself.

Every joyful moment shared is soon to be a distant memory for which there is no hope of building more. I don't want to be, yet again, another passing tree seen out the window of the vehicle that is their life. I don't want them to be the same to me. I'm so close to being overwhelmed and curling into a ball.

lonely,I can’t keep living like this,"I can’t keep living like this - I’m so lonely, that’s a given as I’m here writing this. In brief, I’ve always been the odd one out or felt that way. I get a group of friends and I’ll be the last one invited or the disposable one, or the only one that doesn’t quite feel part of it. After these sorts of situations happening time and time again, I get uncomfortable in groups because I know it won’t last long. They’ll go like they always do. Work friends, old school friends. Anybody. I have 2 sisters, who both have their own families. So I don’t fit in there. My 1 and only close friend is in a relationship, so I don’t fit in there. I don’t fit in at work. I literally have no one. My parents offer to be there but, as odd as it may sound in this position I don’t enjoy forcing myself to sit and spend time with them. I’m 27f. The fact I still live at home depresses me, but as living alone is expensive it’s been a constant battle of trying to find a job that pays enough to be able to do anything about it. I get apprehensive about weekends because I know when everyone is having fun, I’ll be sat alone in my room depressed. Or I’ll be out by myself pretending I’m okay. And I’m so sick of it. I know people have it worse but it’s no quality of life. And if I wasn’t so scared to end it, I would. Sorry this is so long. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you got this far."
lonely,Can I kind of vent here?,"Can I kind of vent here? - I just got out of a relationship that lasted almost 2 years. The reason we broke up was because we werent doing anything together and the only time we talked was over text. The relationship kind of became toxic, and I will admit that I did contribute to the toxicity, weather I wanted to or not. I had a crush on my bestfriend, and she knew but we never got together. We were good friends and talked alot. Eventually she started ghosting me and when I asked why she said she was annoyed at me. I didnt really know why. Then one day my friend told me why. I had talked about killing myself and wanting to die and not being good enough like 24/7. I was a handful. I became exhausting. I realized that it really hurts people when I say that, because they care about me. So I did apologize to my crush. Things haven't been the same between us though. She wont ghost me like before, but we never really talk. We stopped hanging out. So before this had started, I started working on a long message about how I really felt for her. I was working on it for about a month. So when February 13th rolled around, I finally sent the message. Since it was long, I dont think she even read it. She didn't even respond to it. I mean she did say something but she deleted it before I saw it. The next time anything was said, it wasn't related to the message or anything of the sort. Now I'm stuck here with no one to talk to and I feel so lonely. It's gotten to the point where it physically hurts. And I've ran out of options. No body wants to be with me, and no one really likes me. So I don't know what to do at this point."
lonely,Anyone else always feel like they’re doing their 20s wrong?,"Anyone else always feel like they’re doing their 20s wrong? - It feels really hard to have a social life in your early 20s if you’re not in college. I went for about 2 years and felt just as lonely then, despite joining a bunch of clubs and actually making an effort to go out and meet people. Had to leave for mental health reasons though, as much as I really, truly want to be in college. 

I turned 21 back in August and I’ve done jack shit since then. I work, go to rehearsal, play video games, sleep, repeat. And it’s not like I don’t ask friends to hang out. I didn’t see a single person on my birthday even though I asked. I went to a bar by myself. I just don’t understand, I mean I went out more as a teenager than I do now that I legally can! I know people have their own lives- and getting off social media almost completely has helped- but I kept Snapchat and seeing my best friend at her college going to parties, studying abroad, hurts. I’m trying to be happy for her, and it’s really shitty of me not to be I know, but is it too much to ask for a text back sometimes? FaceTime occasionally? Like fuck. Sure, it’s not my friend’s jobs to take care of me, and most people don’t put their struggles on social media so I might not see what’s actually going on, but damn. At least show me that I still have a friend. I reach out, ask how they are because I fucking care about them, is it too much to ask that people that I thought cared about me do the same? We don’t even have to go “out”/clubbing, just an hour for coffee or lunch- something! We’re all busy, but it takes 5 minutes to send a text, and we can’t pretend that we don’t all have our phones on us at all times. I don’t want to think about my relationships as transactional like that, but I don’t think my expectations are too high to want my friends to act like friends.

Maybe I bought into a false cultural narrative, but this is never what I thought my 20s would be like. I’m tired of forcing myself to go out alone to bars and concerts because I have no one to go with. I’m tired of random conversations with strangers that go nowhere and make me feel even more alone. Most of the time I actually prefer to be alone, but that doesn’t seem to be a choice anymore- just the default. 

I’m trying to not give up. But I’m getting very, very close."

lonely,Loneliness despite not being alone,"Loneliness despite not being alone - Hello friends. This is kind of a rant, kind of just a state of the union. Wondering if anyone else is in a similar situation.

I'm married, I have kids, I'm lonely as fuck.

I've been staying awake at night trying to figure out why I feel this way and I think it's for a few reasons.

Moved to this city cuz the wife had a really good job opportunity, and was able to find myself a decent job, we ""settled down"" and all is good, right? Well, no. I have nobody here. Nobody. No friends. Nobody I can just go and hang out with. Nobody to get a beer with. The people at work are too involved in their own lives to spend some time with this lonely fucker. They hang among themselves, and always come back to tell the stories and say BS like ""oh yeah, we didn't think you were gonna be able to make it, cuz your kids""... Like, could you at least ask, bitch?

Then at home is kinda the same. I come home to a wife that only wants to talk about her job. There's tons of things happening there that she'd excited or what not, and HAS TO talk about it with me. So every night, an hour of this conversation goes by. No one single question about my day, no one fuck given. Meanwhile I'm stressed like a mofo cuz all the work piling up on my side. But in my mind I'm like ""hey, that's work stuff, that stays in the office"". So she has zero clue what I do and how I feel about it but demands that I listen to all her crap. When she's done talking it's time for bed. So no real interaction. No intimacy, not a hug, not a kiss, nothing. Brush your teeth, go to bed, read a book, fall asleep.

It's like I'm living in some family's house that is not mine, and they're polite but don't care much about me. 

So I end up going to bed, with all these things boiling up inside my mind, with nobody to talk to (that would care), and nobody to really come home to.

So I'm letting my work absorb me, and it's not rare the day I spend 14-16 hr at the office. Eventually I'm just watching YouTube or something like that. I just don't want to go home. It's really fucking me up. On the weekends I spend a ridiculous amount of time in the bathroom. Like I have the worst bowels ever, but nobody cares.

Valentine's day? I left the office at 11pm. Did she care? Nope. Came home to have to listen 1.5 hr of her meetings and work stuff. Fell asleep on the couch.

Wished I was single. At least I would me making my own decisions just for myself. 

Fuck."

 And now that I spend more time alone and without going out I think I've lost social contact because of those who I called friends also betrayed my expectatives of being there when you need them to vent off your mind. I can't even ask my family because the only answer I get is maybe another day so I don't ask anymore. No close family either as all my other relatives are on other province and I've at most seen them in numbers I can count with my fingers so I've never had chance to grow up with them together either. 


And then, it's just hard hear your mother say. when will you bring a GF home? Like I could get a GF in these days that is full of male witch hunting implying that we all are equally savage beasts and then media spreads the idea making things harder making you think if I didn't live in this country maybe I could make new friends and maybe find love escaping this sinking ship? But then it hits you that you're a socially awkward person! And again we go in self torture in our minds.

I just want a hug, going out, have a good time with somebody who can be by my side and at least share a little of their time or love with me and interact helping me get out of this enclosure between four walls but I find myself thinking I might not deserve it if I find such a person.

Here goes,  years of age and am currently living in the US. I was born and raised in Singapore and attended primary school and two years of secondary school before moving over to the US when I was 14.

&amp;#x200B;

 You see, because I left Singapore when I was so young the only real friends I have in Singapore are from my short time in secondary school (2 years) which means that I only have about 5 close friends in the country that I plan to settle in in the future. I do not talk to anyone from my Primary/elemantary school anymore and I'm sure this is true for most of you guys too. This absolutely sucks because all of those friends who are now 18 and have been studying in Singapore their whole life managed to form so many different friend groups and meet so many people. 

&amp;#x200B;

My time in the US was no better either. I went to one high school in the US with a student body of \~70 kids. That means that I only have so many people I can ultimately form strong bonds with. And during my 3-4 years in the US, I have made only about 2 \*moderately\* close friends. I know that in 5 years when I'm living in Singapore I will lose contact with everyone I met in the US, because 

&amp;#x200B;

1) of geographical location

2) I simply did not manage to form much very good friendships

&amp;#x200B;

If only I lived and studied in Singapore for a longer period of time, maybe I could have made more Singaporean friends, which is particularly important because I plan to continue living there once I return from the US. And being in a city with few friends is definitely not the best thing that can happen.

&amp;#x200B;

But alas, I did not have a choice. My father was struggling to find work in Singapore and had to relocate and I could not protest his decision. I love them but the fact that it impacted me by basically cutting me out from making friends in a country I want to live in really sucks. I also find myself more comfortable around Singaporeans  than Americans because of the cultural differences, so our relocation to the states was very difficult for me. I don't want to hurt my parents' feelings so here I am, complaining on Reddit. Anyone with children planning to migrate to a place vastly different, hear me out. Please take your child's social life into consideration too. You do not want them to end up with major difficulties in their long-term social life.


TLDR: Family chose to move overseas from Singapore during the most important social years of my life, missed out on making enough friends while I was in Singapore. Might end up lonely when I return there in the future."

I grew up extremely close to my family. Never really had friends that lasted or that I could be 100% myself around. I’m always socially awkward and don’t know how to approach people. I always think that I look ugly and people stare at me thinking what the fuck happened to her. People say I’m pretty but I don’t feel like it. I don’t want to be like this. But it’s just gotten worse. 2 years ago my family decided to move back to Germany after living in America for 7 years. Since I was going to senior year my dad decided that it’s best I’d stay with my older sister and her bf to finish school. Originally I was suppose to return and do college in Germany. But I decided to get a scholarship and attended college in America. Moving in with my older sister was great I loved it. It was hard but I managed to make friends at my new school when I first moved in. I had a good time. But starting college and having to start all over again making friends while commuting an hour to school is a nightmare. the distance of being so far apart from my family and only visiting once a year for Christmas is torture. I can see my dad and mom getting older each year and how my younger siblings have grown up. Even my dog is getting old and it breaks my heart. Living with my older sister has turned into a mess too. Recently she got engaged to her bf and I feel like I’m intriguing on their life. So I decided to keep distance and stop hanging around them so much give them space since actually their relationship is pretty shit. Yes they love each other but Its so toxic. And I feel like they just go engaged because just to do it and because it’s “time to marry”. And now she wants to make my dad pay for the wedding. She’s guilt tripping him hard. I swear he would pay for it but he has 4 other kids too and has to already to pay for flights to America for the wedding and still needs to figure out his retirement. He payed for everything my sisters education bachelors masters and living costs car insurance everything!!! She’s 24 turning 25 and she doesn’t appreciate anything, it just breaks my heart. My parents do everything and more for their kids and seeing my sister do this to them is torture. I tried talking to her about it today but it just resulted in me getting a reddit account and spilling my heart out cause she doesn’t care. I don’t know what to do.

My best friend is an online friend, but I'm very close to her despite that fact. We've sent videos (with sound and speaking, so I know she's real) and pictures quite often, but have only spoke on the phone once (not my choice.) The only reason that happened was because we had a fight that nearly tore our friendship apart. 

I had work today, but with today being the holiday of love, I asked if we could talk again tomorrow. Rather than saying yes or no she changed the subject. So what else am I supposed to think, really? I wish sometimes she didn't mean so much to me, as a friend or romantically. But I don't have anyone else"

lonely,Does Valentine's Day happen to not make anyone else anymore depressed than usual?,"Does Valentine's Day happen to not make anyone else anymore depressed than usual? - Everybody's so down that I thought I'd share a different perspective, which might change your view on this holiday (With any luck). I of course wanted to see if anybody agreed as well.

Like most of you I'm sure, I've never really liked Valentine's Day, which occasionally garners the ""somebody's got sour grapes"" type response, which couldn't be further from the truth. I just think it's the most commercial of the commercial holidays and that dedicating one measly, cookie cutter day to love kind of cheapens the idea, you know? I find it decidedly UNromantic. So I've never really seen it as something worth working myself up over. To be clear though, I've always been unhappily single, but if anything, having an excuse not to participate in this vacuous nonsense makes me feel a little better about the state of things in my life. 

But also, even when it's not February 14th, I've never been the sort who sees happy couples and feels worse afterwards, because my dislike of being eternally single doesn't really stem from wanting other people's relationships instead of my lack of any, since I'd settle for my own thanks. So that's an additional reason I've never found myself too down in the dumps on Valentine's Day. It might be the time I'm most okay with being single. It's just that inconsequential.

But I'd like to close this off by saying, this wasn't meant to minimize anybody's negative feelings. It's more than understandable why today leaves thousands upon thousands feeling so lousy and far be it from me and my little spiel to change your minds. But if one person can read this and realize that hey, maybe today is just not that big a deal, I will have done my job."

lonely,My Valentines Day Plan went well..... and then did not so much,"My Valentines Day Plan went well..... and then did not so much - On Valentines (Singles-Appreciation) Day, I set out to treat myself tonight as a substitute to not feeling lonely tonight. I went out to see a play, it was called Disco Inferno - where an aspiring singer made a deal with the devil which made his life worse (awesome play btw). A couple of my friends, who are a couple, went out to the show with me. I was, of course, glad that they could come- it would surely make the play a bit more of an experience, but when they started holding hands and cuddling while I was trying to watch the play and ignore their romantic gestures towards each other, I got uncomfortable. Surely, I would think it is because of Valentine's Day. I always feel uncomfortable around couples because I am not in a relationship and I would get jealous. But the reason for my discomfort during the play was cuz one of the friends was a former crush of mine. I had a crush on her before she got into a relationship. Of course, I would be happy for her in her relationship cuz I would be a bad friend if I were not, so I tried to see her as a friend and nonetheless. It's just those times when you see your crush with someone else on Valentines Day that make you feel at least a little bit of jealousy and emptiness (and I hate those feelings so much, I just want to move on with my life). But anyways, when the play ended, I told them I had to go and I gave my congrats to the actors and left. I only immediately left partly because of less traffic on the exit out of the lot and mostly because I see them doing couple stuff, like all couples do. I just kinda feel bad.

I’m a 22 year old woman. I’m going to graduate this year. Never had a boyfriend; never been kissed. This was my last valentines day in uni. All my friends are in relationships. 

I have anxiety that encourages me to completely avoid my schoolwork (lmao guess what i’m supposed to be doing now). I always avoid people that I vaguely know because I feel like they would never actually want to be friends with me. I feel like i’m no one’s priority. 

I want to have someone who I consider to be the no.1 person in my life and vice versa. i think i’m asexual but i desperately want to be in love. I’m really worried that if I try dating I will just end up leading the other person on. 

I also found out today that my only guy friend got a girlfriend. There was never anything between us but it stings a little that I basically had no idea of what’s been going on in his life for the past couple months. 

I tried tinder a few years ago but all it resulted in was a couple really awkward dates that never went anywhere. I’m just tired of feeling lonely and like everyone I know is actively dating and i’m just a pool of anxiety that doesn’t understand how to make a romantic connection with someone."

lonely,My soon to be ex wife is at a rave all weekend... Again.,"My soon to be ex wife is at a rave all weekend... Again. - She spends all of my money.  She is tens if thousands of dollars in credit card debt.  She won't work.  She hits me.  She threatens to call the cops on me all the time.  I don't even have the money to start the divorce.  I have nowhere to go.  She has her father's and different mens' houses to go to.  She has put on about 40 pounds as well, which isn't at all the problem, but it shows how she is just giving up.

She says I'm miserable to be around and not ""fun"".

She wears pretty much just underwear at these raves.  She says she is ""expressing"" herself and that I'm ""controlling"".  She never dressed this way when I met her.

I got the divorce papers.  She disapears for the night when I try to get her to fill them out.

I'm not perfect.  My biggest flaw, though is giving her the benefit of the doubt for too long.  I decided to divorce her when she physically attacked me on New Years for not taking her out when we couldn't afford it. (Again... She won't work.) And then she attacked me again the next morning and was so unpleasant and assaultive for so many sustained hours that I had to leave.

Anyway.  I feel better posting this.  Maybe I'll do some pushups.  I typically tell other people to do that.  I'm low-key jealous of everyone on r/gardening because they have snowdrop pictures up already... the only flower that pops up in February.  I want to turn my house into a homestead with multiple gardens with herbs, vegetables, fruits... Maybe a goat.

Sometimes I troll a bit to feel better.  It gives me a chuckle to leave an off-the-wall comment.  I already got banned from r/communism and r/witchesvspatriarchy.  Secretly, I really adore powerful strong women like Judge Judy or my boss at work when she shows leadership... And not in an r/femdom kind of way.  I just compare that to all of the baby-like women I've been with who can't ""adult"" today.  Maybe its my fault, though.  I mean... I did choose to marry her.  At the time, though, she was making 70k a year as a sales rep and she helped around the house.  I WANTED her to take the lead.  Now I'm doing it and ignoring her childishness, which causes the hitting and screetching.

I think she is a codependent who was raised by a narcissist.  She can be helped, but not by me.  I'm maybe prone to paranoia and scitzy-like behavior, but I overcome that by treating life like an RPG and by just seeing where the game takes me.  I want to level up my homestead and my life.  I really like watching Geoff Lawton and James Prigioni on youtube.  They garden pretty well.

I'm glad she's gone... I just feel alone and very stuck."

I don’t know why I do talk to myself. I know the brain does it instinctively to cope with loneliness and depression. The problem is that I do it as if I were talking to someone or a group of people. Feel like my head is going insane, and I feel so trapped in it. Every night I stay up until 2-4 am, just watching videos or playing games just to distract myself from it. I’ve been to see my doctor about it, but there wasn’t much she could do, due to the fact there’s no cure to chronic loneliness. I want to get better, feel better, be better.

Now my life is just so empty like there’s nothing for me to do. I want cool friends that wanna do cool things like explore, travel, watch interesting things or whatever but there’s literally no people like me. 

From my experience there’s two types of people in the world and I don’t fit into either. First is them people that just party all the time and do drugs all the time and the second group is people into things like anime and gaming which I’m not into.

This Valentines was different, today I was bombarded at work with questions like “what are you doing tonight?” or “where are you taking your date tonight?” When I answered back with a causal “nothing special” every time I was met with a negative or judgy comment by the other person.  I mean it’s very public that I spend most of time alone and have never talked about going on dates or hanging with a girlfriend so I ask you what’s the point of rubbing in the fact that I obviously have no plans for today, all it does is make me feel worse about myself.

I said I was a professional fundraiser, but I posted it and shared it and I didn't even get $5. I'm nothing. I've been unemployed for over a year. I'm about to become homeless. I just wanted a family and I will never get anything worthwhile. I thought I could do this one thing, but I failed. I always believe I won't, but I do. Every single time.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, I don't understand what changed. I don't understand what I'm doing that she doesn't like and she won't tell me either."

lonely,Screw Valentine’s Day,"Screw Valentine’s Day - 

It’s just another reminder of how alone I truly am. No girlfriend, no friends, no one to give my affection or appreciation to. It makes me want to throw up when I see couples or people going on dates with their crush while I have to watch , and god knows that I’ve tried with people but I just end up making things worst and ruining friendships. I’m tired of people getting my hopes up just to constantly break my heart and yet I’m still the bad guy for getting angry about it. I hate this world and everyone here is a hypocrite.

So my reaction was just me stuttering ‘ok, thanks I guess’ I couldn’t tell if she was sarcastic or not. She proceeds to say she’s gonna miss me over break. Idfk what to do. I’ve literally never had anyone do this before so I’m confused as shit, not to mention the “traumas” (the best word I could come up with) makes me trust no one.

He had the audacity to text me today saying “ I thought you’d come today to apologize. I hate you more than anyone, I was very wrong to love you.” He says this knowing he was the reason we broke up?

lonely,How To Attract New Friends Without Seeming Creepy,"How To Attract New Friends Without Seeming Creepy - This is not rocket-science, but it's something I never thought about before,...

I just walked into our neighborhood grocery store wearing my Dunder-Mifflin hat. Didn't realize I was wearing it until a fan of The Office struck up small-talk with me. Then I started noticing that occasionally a stranger would do a little double-take when they noticed my hat, like ""Right on!"" Thinking of y'all, it occurred to me that if you want to meet some new friends (or even more than that), this would be a good way to attract people with similar interests to your own, without needing to ""put yourself out there"" and risk feeling creepy. Just sport a little fan-wear and MYOB until somebody gives you a smile or strikes up a conversation. 

Bonus: Since you've created an obvious inroad for conversation, there's no need to stumble around wondering what to say. And when you run out of old episodes or gaming stories to rehash, then if you feel done it's easy to politely walk way. 

Pro Tip: I am just guessing that classy fan-wear, with a very small or unsassuming logo, is going to get the best reception. Don't wear a t-shirt with D&amp;D slathered all over your chest; wear something so subtle that it shows that you are a serious fan and not desperately seeking attention. Or, don't even wear a logo, but just something related to your hobby, like a dragon, or a motorcycle jacket.

Bonus Number Two: Doing this gives assistance to super shy people who might have been wanting to meet you for a while, but couldn't think how to strike up a conversation without seeming creepy themselves :)"

After that I was found of saying that I just wanted to know what it was like to even be an option for someone, to even be second best. I wanted someone to look at me and see who I really was.

Well, be careful what you wish for, because I got exactly what I said I wanted... second best, and heartbroken. So shockingly close to everything I ever wanted, and everything she wanted, but someone else just checked the boxes she decided she cared about more...

lonely,Happy Valentines Day,"Happy Valentines Day - I feel lonely as always. But what makes me not feel as lonely is thinking, maybe i shouldn't kill yourself because who knows maybe one day I'll be financially stable, and have a family. I know I sound very delusional but I can't stop thinking about how I want to have a kid and give him or her everything I never had when I was a child and now. 

There's so many ways I'm holding myself back. I use to blame my mistakes on my Dad and mentally unstable mother. But it's not their fault. Now I can't help but be lazy (which i can get away with for now) and had such materialistic things about my appearance, like my hair type. 

I know having a child won't cure all my insecurities about myself. But it will feel amazing having someone to love who I created with my future partner who I will hopefully love.

For now I'm happy being single as I do want to lose 50lbs and get my drivers license during this summer. And I just wanna work on me. 

Just to clarify I don't want a child now and I only want one once I'm financially stable."

I'm scared to find someone else, I was in a bad mindset at the time and I didn't think any girls wanted relationships after that (Which is obviously stupid of me to think).

Consider The Glory Hole as a dingy dive bar where a group of nerds and loners from around the world with ages ranging from 18 to 35 that get together every day to hang out and pass the time. We are a server for meeting new people and making friends, and despite our numbers, we are still a pretty small close-knit group that would love to expand our circle with more unique and interesting people. And yes, we know, the name is ridiculous, that's the point.

**What Do We Do?**

We are a mainly voice-active community, so we spend most of our time chatting together while we play games or go about our day. We run weekly movie and music nights, occasional game nights, Minecraft server, and other seasonal events. There’s plenty of text and media channels to share your interests as well as a variety of voice channels for larger or smaller conversations, watching movies, or playing video games together.

**Should You Join?**

The Glory Hole has provided us with genuine and long-lasting friendships, and we would love to provide this opportunity to others such as yourself. A group of people like this is an amazing way to make new friends or at the very least fill those lonely evenings up with lots of laughter and other voices. So if you're 16+ and at all interested in joining our group or poking your head in to see what’s up, I welcome you to follow this link to join: [https://discord.gg/H4w58Px](https://discord.gg/H4w58Px)"

lonely,YEAH!! Y’ALL KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS!!,"YEAH!! Y’ALL KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS!! - It’s the day before National Suicide Awareness Day!! 
 
Now let me drop some straight up facts to all you lonelies and lonelinettes into why *you shouldn’t* want to be in a relationship with someone, especially on this money hungry, corporation runned, stupid ass excuse for a holiday. 
 
**1. Keep your bread to yourself
 
To all my homies out there, why would you want to spend money on a bitch? You could be using that money to buy something YOU want, instead of spending $100 at Olive Garden, and $50 more on chocolates and shit. Not only that, but that girl is gonna take you for granted, no doubt homie. They don’t respect you, they just want your money. Save your cash and buy yourself some Fortnite skins or some shit. Better yet, hell yeah, go out to eat, but you’d only be paying a swift $20 compared to being with someone else. 
 
**2. Men aren’t shit
 
Now for all you women reading this so far and thinking I’m being misogynistic, this ones for you. 

MEN. AREN’T. SHIT. 
 
Quit looking around for men because all they want is sex. Especially today, the day of all days, where they know there’s desperate women out there wanting to have closure. Don’t fall victim to men’s traps homegirl, you’re stronger, and more independent than that. You deserve to be truly loved and respected, not treated like a piece of meat. 
 
**3. Relationships are stupid as FUCK.
 
Why would you even want to be in a relationship? It’s all nagging and worrying. Yeah maybe you hug each other and do the sex and stuff, but all of that comes with a price to pay, and that’s listening to your significant other bitch about their miserable lives. If you’re unlucky, sometimes you even have to BE part of their lives too. It’s too much pressure, too much garbage. Then arguments and shit. It’s annoying. 
 
Don’t trust the “I love you’s” dudes and dudettes, because you know that person has said it to other people, and you know people can cheat and disrespect you with the snap of a finger. 
 
**4. You’re free to be your own person
 
I know we’re all here because we feel alone, but you have to remember how much freedom you have to do whatever you want. When you’re in a relationship, it’s like a damn rubber band. You don’t let each other do anything unless; 1. He/she is there with you, or 2. because of jealousy or mistrust or some other bulls hit reason. When you’re by yourself, you can go wherever YOU want to go, not wherever y’all argue to be at. 
 
**Other

Now you’re gonna be asking me, “but u/jelly_blood, I’m so lonely, and I DO want to be apart of people’s lives, and I don’t mind wasting money on someone I like” 
 
Well first of all, you’re a dumb motherfucker. Second of all, we all do. We as humans all deserve to be with someone, it’s our nature to repopulate. 
 
But don’t depend on social media culture, and stupid holidays to determine how lonely you are. Focus on you and yourself only. Don’t use other people’s lifestyles as an example, because those people aren’t you. Stay off of social media for a while and ponder to yourself, then will you find out that you’re stronger and more attractive than you think you are. 
 
You’ve been surviving alone for such a long time, what’s a little more time?? It’s cliché, and redundant, but the truth is these things really DO come within time. So give yourself some time brothers and sisters, and use this alone time to do whatever YOU want to do, not what others want you to do. Be comfortable with yourself before you try to get comfortable with others.
 
tl;dr, keep your money to yourself, relationships sucks, FUCK valentine’s day"

lonely,Hot Chocolate - Read,"Hot Chocolate - Read - This is a hard day for everyone in this subreddit, yes. It's a tragic day that reminds us all that we're lonely and worsens our situation and makes life more miserable. To me, this is just a day for people to waste their money on others to show their love, when they can do this everyday. Many of you want to drink and stay home and I was thinking of doing that too, but something is telling me otherwise..

Here is some advice that I thought about: Try going out to a bar for a drink or a meetup. Why? Because there will be other singles who are also lonely, looking for that last minute hope. You never know what will happen, especially on this day. If you don't want to do this or can't bring yourself to, stay in or go out and treat yourself. To what? 

**Drinks**: a celebration of freedom.

**Shopping**: reward yourself, because you deserve it from enduring loneliness, which is something that only the strongest can do. 

**Brunch/Lunch/Dinner**: you spend a lot of time with yourself, so give yourself with a great quality meal that's tasty. Your mind will focus on how good that food is.

If you can't bring yourself to do it, I'll do it for you! I'll go out to a bar for a drink (or 2, or 3 depending on my luck) and see if I can meet anyone! I've done this 3209 times without success, but how about on this day? Let's see. I'll let you know how it goes. Yes, this decision is risky, because I'll see many couples doing shit that I don't want to see. But I'm doing it for you guys. If you choose to do the same thing, please share and let me know how it went!

**Reminder**: I'm with you. I'm lonely as fuck and miserable from not having anyone. Today is a stupid fucking holiday where people waste their money and cards, flowers, chocolate, hotel rooms, Airbnbs, and gifts. You have the freedom to do whatever you want, and making your own decisions. 

At the end of the day, we're all still people and breathing! Whatever you do today, have fun and focus on yourself!"

I don't know at this point, it almost feels like I am not gonna find anyone. Until a few months ago I was optimistic about finding one,  I have made efforts like joining social dancing classes, started cracking jokes etc. But nothing clicked for me. I have faced extreme anxiety about this thing and some other things recently like 2 months and had to get medical help too. 

Whenever I see couples holding hands walking, or sitting together in restaurants I can't just stand them. I just feel bad about myself. I have few good male friends in my circle, some are commited and some are single like me. Some of them know about what I am going through, but no one really helped me by introducing their friends etc even though I explicitly asked them.

A long story short, I thought of myself as a desperate loner last two years. But then I suddenly was stunned by hope that my yet another crush would not be such a disappointment. She actually changed my life a lot, majorly in a good way. Though we agreed being friends, I really can't get over her. And now even I've got a GF, it doesn't feel the way I expected it too feel when I hadn't got one. It's incredibly unusual to feel that someone genuinely likes you, and I'm apparently... not a good guy, who's now the one breaking hearts. And recently my friend opened his feelings to me.

lonely,Sad in my bones,"Sad in my bones - My ex-husband and I are trying to work things out together to make our relationship work again. I think it would be good, especially for our sons, and because I really care for him. I told him earlier in the week that Friday is Valentine's Day and I wanted him to do something for it. I bought him a nice collar shirt, the kind he likes to wear, last week as a present. I thought if I reminded him and told him it was important to me, then he would put forth an effort to get me something or plan something for us. Last night, I asked him if we were doing anything and it was clear that he hadn't thought about it at all, much less prepared for it. I told him that he really hurt me and he said that it was impossible to make me happy and all I do is complain. I don't know what else I could have done to communicate with him. He's trying to act completely dumb, like he doesn't know how to make plans for someone and I am asking for really difficult things.... I think he doesn't really care for me anymore and I told him if he thinks there's no point in trying to make me happy because he can't make me happy, then there's no reason for us to try to make our relationship work. I just feel so sad, sad right down to the aching in my bones, because I want to be loved so much and he just makes me cry all of the time."

# ""The Light"" 

""To the lost and the lonely,

For those with heavy hearts.

The world is dark, and full of sorrow.

Anyone with eyes could see that much.

Consider how much darker it would be,

without your light. however dim.

Every moment you walk this earth.

is a moment brighter, for you have lived in it.

Fear not to give others your light,

A spark is all it takes to light a flame.

Do you see now how valuable you are?

The spark that lit a thousand flames?

Thought your fire may waver,

Your light may flicker,

Let not your heart grow dark.

Let the flames begin anew.""

If anyone needs a ear to listen, or a shoulder to lean on, Please message me.

I won't preach at you, but remember, God does not make junk. You were made in his image, a perfect being.

You may not feel like it now, but YOU are gods perfect masterpiece."
lonely,best friend/boyfriend abandoned me without explanation,"best friend/boyfriend abandoned me without explanation - I (F 25) was completely abandoned by my best friend/boyfriend(?) (M 38) about a month ago. For nearly two years, we had an unofficial relationship (we were monogamous, but never used labels). He is an alcoholic and has relapsed several times throughout our relationship. A month ago, he relapsed again  and was ignoring my messages and calls. I finally found out he was going through withdrawals. Once he was better, he just stopped talking to me. I called and texted several times and he just ignored me. I sent him one last goodbye message last Sunday and he ignored that, too. The worst part is a former friend (a female) abandoned me without explanation before too, and I told him about it. I told him several times how I had an irrational fear that he would do this to me because she did. He always reassured me that he would never do that and I was being silly for worrying about it so much, then he did exactly that. We used to text each other all day every day and talk on the phone for over an hour a few times a week, plus see each other at least once or twice a week. I lost my virginity to him. I love him. I trusted him. And now I’m alone and I don’t even know why. Last night I had a dream that he texted me and said it was all a misunderstanding. It felt so real. When I woke up and checked my phone, I wanted to cry."

Alone for Valentine's Day yet again.

That I have a hand to hold, a cheek to kiss.
 
Someone to spend the day with.

Exchanging kind words and gestures so lovingly.

I'll await for next year to see if my luck will change. 
 
But for now, I'll sleep away this Valentine's Day.

lonely,I hate the way I am..,"I hate the way I am.. - I’ve had a messed up childhood, it definitely wasn’t normal. Both my parents neglected me and that was actually one of the good things they’ve done to me.. I guess that’s why I crave attention. I thought it was going to stop once I met my boyfriend and it did for a while but the emptiness came back.. 

We decide to become open so we both can explore. I did some NSFW stuff and obviously I felt loved by randoms for a while, but I realised that’s not what I’m after.. I just wanted someone I can goof around with (meaning sending meme to each other, basically being myself) and tell them about my day but ofc with my profile nobody was going to take me seriously.. I did meet a few people some were great but I could tell what they’re real intentions were.. but ofc they seem great so I give into them and then cry about it afterwards (I know I’m stupid) sometimes I feel like they will cut me off if I don’t
I know it’s my own fault.. I’ve made myself look like I’ve only wanted one thing.. 
I wasn’t exactly looking for another relationship, but I just want someone to WANT to talk to me and WANT  to be around me.. 
This all sounds ridiculous I know .. and yes I know “how are you expecting other to respect you when you can’t respect yourself” yeah idk what’s wrong with me honestly.. 
I have no one close to me (besides my boyfriend) because everytime they get attached I push them away 

Ps. I know my boyfriend deserves better.. I’ve tried to leave so he can find someone better but he thinks he can help me .. 

I don’t know what I’m even ranting about.. I always feel like everyone hates/dislikes me, I’m always so lonely and I just wish I could stop feeling like this.."

I want to be accepted by people so badly but all I do is cry every night. I don't even know how to meet people anymore. 

As a kid I was endlessly bullied and mocked by everybody I knew, and then when I had health complications that just further isolated myself from my peers. Eventually my depression and anxiety overwhelmed me and at the beginning of my freshman year of HS I switched from a public school to online which left me where I am today as a senior that's about to graduate. I do nothing but do schoolwork and sleep and I'm so fucking lonely. I don't have any good memories, I don't go anywhere, I don't know how to do anything. I've spent the past 4 years in my bedroom which just feels like a prison. I just wish somebody cared about me."

I'm not creepily looking, but it's hard not to notice especially when they dont have curtains. But what I love, is seeing family's getting together around dinner time, laughing and talking. This makes me feel kind of happy, but also bittersweet because I miss those days of being a kid and having people always around you.

lonely,Parasocial relationships?,"Parasocial relationships? - It basically refers to one-sided relationships with people you have never met but who help fulfil some of your social needs. YouTubers, social media personalities, people on TV or podcasters would be some good examples. It feels like they are your friend, although you don't really know them.

Anyway, I have some and I have no issue with it. The people I know in real life are often boring, so I often prefer spending time with my surrogate friendship groups. I really like when it feels normal and natural, as though these are people who would just be hanging out anyway, they just have a camera on.

I really want some suggestions for people to check out! Let me know if you feel the same and who you like to watch.

Some of mine: I really like battle rap, so The Dirtbag Dan Show and Watch Battles on Ruin your Day are awesome for this.

Baited Podcast, not many episodes but they really have no filter around each other like real friends.

Cx streamers... controversial I know. I don't like or condone their actions, but I'm seeing real, unfiltered craziness that I can relate to, as I was a bit wild in my youth. I wouldn't want to be there but there's something about watching from afar that holds and interest.

lonely,Just can't make meaningful connections with people,"Just can't make meaningful connections with people - It's not through lack of trying either. At work there have been a few people who I get on with really well, we have similar interests, similar age and live in the same area. And yet I have never been able to consider any of my work acquaintances proper friends. A new starter was paired up with me and she has even said to me and others that she really likes me (in a friend way) and trusts me. I've spoken to these people outside of work but it's ALWAYS me to message first. I listen to their problems, offer advice, we have a laugh but not once has anyone took the time outside of work to take the initiative with me.

I've had this happen so often that I refuse to invite anyone over or to hang out until I can see that they are actually interested in being a friend. Which never happens. No idea why.

Lately I have been reflecting and I feel like I just don't quite fit in, and perhaps that's it. But that's still so vague. I'm not pushy, or weird or anything like that.

Guess I'm just destined to have no friends ever."
lonely,Why does no one want to be in a romantic relationship with me?,"Why does no one want to be in a romantic relationship with me? - The closest I've had to a boyfriend is this guy asking me out to prom a few months ago and him putting his arm around my waist. He was flirting with me after the prom but suddenly he lost interest in me, only for me to find out he's been flirting with other girls. I fell for a flirt. All the crushes I've had in the past never liked me back. I'm only 14, but my parents started dating at 14. I have so many friends who have boyfriends. I'm at a low right now, especially with it being Valentines Day and all. I just can't find an answer to why no guy likes me back while my friends are already are in their 2nd or 3rd relationship.

At my office, we have several other students like me waiting for school to start. I was the first the join and then the others joined a few weeks later. Somehow, even after being in the office for longer than them, theyve made more ""friends"" than me. People would rather talk to them and partner up with them than me. I feel heartbroken honestly. Im never good enough. I really dont know what am I doing wrong. This really just makes me lose my confidence all over again and just make me tempted to become my younger self, become shut-up from the world. Im really sad. Even a friend of mine from school from the same work place has said that the other students are more ""sociable"" than me. I dont know. Do people actually hate me, my face? I rather not live anymore, there's nothing more."

I find myself daydreaming of the simplest things like just cuddling and holding someone who I love and who loves me back, stealing their clothes, goofy inside jokes, stealing kisses here and there, and it just makes me feel so sad. Last night I dreamt that I had a boyfriend and we did all the things I daydream about. I woke up feeling incredibly sad that it was just a dream, and ended up crying for a bit. It’s just so disheartening to see my friend, who’s in college, have boyfriends and going on dates and just having fun. I feel like such a loser and failure of a 20 year old girl, hell I haven’t even had my first kiss yet. I have really bad depression and anxiety so everything “normal” seems impossible for me, like if I get beyond terrified to try to do something as simple meet new people how the hell am I gonna meet someone? I’m just getting so sick of feeling so lonely and touch starved that I have to imagine someone spooning me just so I can fall asleep sometimes.  I just feel so alone and like i’m unlovable."

lonely,How many people only got Valentine gifts in elementary school?,"How many people only got Valentine gifts in elementary school? - I remember the days when the parents would buy the candys and cheap cards to give out to the other grade school classmates but no one would say anything to me. ""Did I do something wrong?"" I would think. ""Did I forget them?"". I read down my list and double checked but I had gotten everyone. Some didn't even walk past me. They just went around. I was so desperate for attention that I would give two out to everyone but the most I would get back was a quick look. Then middle school came. I expected atleast a ""Happy Valentine's Day!"" from someone but nope, nothing that day. The next year came; 7th grade. I had the bag in hand that had the candys in it. I wanted to give something out to all the people that I thought of as a friend. The first try literally broke me into the lonely person I am today. I held it out as a friendly gesture and it just got slapped out of my hand and stomped harder into the concrete. I didn't even cry. All my emotions had left my body. I was in my last period with the bag in hand and when everyone left, I just set it on the teacher's desk and left, put on a fake smile and lied about how my day went. Nobody but you knows what I felt that day. In 10th grade, my emotions began to come back. Valentine's day had come and I saw people getting all lovey dovey towards eachother throughout the day. I had no one. When I got home, I just walked throughout the house like a zombie, checking to make sure nobody was home. When no one appeared, it just happened. The teats practically flew out of my eyes. My wail of sadness and raw misery continued throughout the night until I ended in my bed listening to the fan blow air over me. The only thing I had felt that night was loneliness and misery. My little brother came in and saw me. Guess what he did. Did you say help me out of my depressed state? Well you're wrong. He walked in and walked out. I didn't move. My lungs barely moving. To this day. I still have never felt anything worse that the loneliness I still feel. Since the day I was born, a little over 18 years ago, I've never had a single close relationship with anyone. So please make a good impression on people while you're young."

lonely,How to get through today,"How to get through today - 1) Delete all social media apps for the next 48 hours. There’s never anything great to find there anyway.

2) Go and get some exercise. And then some more. Use up all that extra emotional energy until you’re too tired to be upset.

3) Allow yourself the freedom to express your feelings without any guilt or shame. If you need to cry, go for it. If you’re mad, hit the punching bag or a pillow. But once you’ve got it out, leave it and move forward. Don’t dwell.

4) Remember that Valentine’s Day for many couples isn’t as rosy as it may appear. Many of them feel just as lonely as you, if not more. Some are stuck in relationships just because they’re scared of being alone. Others will be quarrelling over dumb shit. (In my experience, Valentine’s Day with my exes never lived up to the hype anyway) 

Just because you haven’t got anyone to spend the day with doesn’t mean you’re inadequate in any way. It just means you haven’t met anyone yet! Avoid spiralling down negative thought trains and take advantage of your freedom today!

I am 22 and ready to die. - The conscious I’m left with is torturing me everyday. I’ve moved passed contemplating suicide, now I’m just waiting for the right day. I no longer wish to live anymore. Valentine’s Day is here. I wish I would’ve known what it’s like to have that special someone want to talk to me and hear from me. Ya know? To give a hug and have them hold you so long and actually really hug you back? I know I sound so stupid but I’ve been in isolation for quite some time now. I’ve lost about 70lbs and put 10lbs of muscle on, going to the gym helps. But I have a large plethora of trial and error of prescription psychiatric medication, in order for such medication to work, it’ll take 2-3 weeks just to get it at a therapeutic level. I can’t purchase a firearm because of my 3 psych ward visits, so I guess I’m confirmed to finding a barbaric way to take my own life. Thanks for reading!"
lonely,She’s out making memories with other guys. I’m here wishing she had chosen me.,"She’s out making memories with other guys. I’m here wishing she had chosen me. - I stupidly checked her instagram. She doesn’t even really post on social media, but this time she was at the coast with some guy. We never even dated. We kissed, were in a sort of honeymoon faze because we were “interested in each other” or so I thought. She was moving anyways do things would have never turned out. But, she promised that we would spend time with each other before she left. That promise never happened. She made me a bracelet, but it didn’t fit so she was going to fix it. It was the first time anyone’s ever given me a gift like that. I never got it back. I asked multiple times. But, she never wants to see me again. I’m too much of a burden. Or in her words, “You can only beat a horse so many times.” So, spending time with me is so horrible you make an analogy like that? Great.

I never yelled at her, never lied to her, and she had valid reasons to not be in a relationship. She doesn’t owe me her time. But, when you promise someone and lead them on with maybes and ghosting. That hurts. It could have been me at the beach with her. And now Valentine’s Day is tomorrow. She’s beautiful, and could be with any guy she wants to that day. I’ll be at home. No one to make plans with. I don’t want to learn to be ok by myself. But, that’s what needs to be done so I don’t torture myself till I break."

I’ve spent hours and hours thinking of all the things wrong with me that push people away. Wondering if I am too negative or dramatic or boring or just ugly? Middle school, high school, college - I lost any friends I made in those just after I left despite me putting a lot of effort into trying and maintaining them. I find I have a bunch of acquaintances but truly 0 close friends who actively support me. I’ve gotten so lonely it’s constantly worsening my mental health and exacerbating my depression and anxiety.  I have panic attacks thinking of the people who have slowly cut me off from everything. .

Does anyone have any advice on either how I can evaluate what about me has pushed so many people away and how I can make new friends as someone in their mid 20s?"

lonely,Tips for trying to meet a woman?,"Tips for trying to meet a woman? - First off let me say, I’ve been drinking. Lightly, but still, I know I won’t be as social when I sober. None the less I’ve been without the touch of the opposite sex for close to 5 years now. Though I throughly enjoy physical intimacy I genuinely dream of someone I can be truly emotionally open with. For awhile I had convinced myself I was better off without another. Reasons such as I hadn’t enough time, wouldn’t fulfill their emotion needs, I find myself fairly toxic, (I tend to push people away and can’t stand pointless small talk) and above all I’ve really never been intimate and close to another human. I know I’m not complete emotionless cause I really love raising and emotionally nurturing animals, primarily dogs. Though I’ve always thought it was because of the unspoken trust and love, and among my closest friends and family I’m known as a dog whisper type. But lately dogs haven’t been enough to pull me out of a depression slump. Though I’m far from quitting on my companions, they just aren’t enough.... like I said I have tough time being emotionally intimate and stepping out of my shell. Hell I’m not sure I ever have, even with family. But damn if I haven’t been feeling an overwhelming urge to find a right hand woman to struggle with me. I’ve never been one to just lust for someone. I really just want to put all my chips on the table and commit 100%. All that being said I find myself incapable of making the first move. Though it feels like that’s all it’d take. I don’t think I’m ugly (my profile pic is a recent pic of me) but I’ve never been hit on. Maybe I’m expecting too much and need to realize it’s the man who makes the first move. Okay now I’ll stop ranting. But I’d love some tips on starting conversation, overcoming initial anxiety or maybe even just tips on holding conversation with someone I’m not attempting to be intimate with. I’m a damn good mechanic but I really have zero people skills. A good way to describe me is all business and no party, even at parties I can loosen up and enjoy myself. Pls help a stubborn sob."
lonely,20 years of being on this planet and I’ve never been able to find someone to call my own,"20 years of being on this planet and I’ve never been able to find someone to call my own - My life’s been full of trying to make other people happy just to try and fill the void in my heart. I thought that making others happy would have a similar effect to me but that’s never been the case. Even when it comes to telling a girl how I feel, I can never find the confidence to tell them how a feel without the fear of it ruining the relationship that I currently have with them. The one time I managed to work up the confidence to tell a girl that I liked for 4 years, I was shot down to the ground. Ever since then I find it impossible to feel anything for anyone now. It feels like I’ve just become numb and don’t want to contribute to anything anymore. I feel that I won’t be able to connect with anyone or have feelings again. It hurts deep down but I don’t know who to go to. I’m tired of wearing a fake smile on my face just to keep others happy."

lonely,reflecting on the lonely day,"reflecting on the lonely day - Tomorrow is a hard day for some of us. It’s crazy, I remember thinking back to when I was younger (I’m 21) I used to think of Valentine’s Day as a waste of time. Now today, I see my friends or peers with someone, and I’m very happy for them. But I envy them. It’s been a long time since I’ve had any sort of actual connection with someone. My last relationship ended in a horrible way that left me unable to become vulnerable. I just feel empty inside and feel like “what’s the point”. And I know that by me thinking this way, it’s not helping me get out of this rut. And then I see people who have ventured out and met someone and I envy them. Valentine’s Day hit me different now that I’m an adult. Makes me feel like I’m losing time in finding someone."
lonely,It’s not even about tomorrow,"It’s not even about tomorrow - Honestly, tomorrow’s significance hadn’t even crossed my mind. It was just that wave that came over me again tonight, the knowing that this is just how it is. Convincing myself that happiness, it just isn’t for everyone. Would be nice to be happy and not alone, or even one of those for a little while, but it just might not be meant to be.

Friends wise, it’s just not the same. I’m moving to a new, bigger city soon (Indy) but I feel like that won’t change anything. I really only have one good friend in my life, person I haven’t even seen in two years. The others, who knows why, but we don’t talk anymore.

I can’t even make friends through work. I work remotely, rather than in an office, so there are no work parties or being around people, it’s all working from my apartment. 

I realize I’m rambling, I’m sure some have it far worse than me. Wish I didn’t feel alone. Wish I didn’t feel like I’m never going to experience real happiness. Oh, and thinking about Valentine’s Day now, that is hitting me now. But, who am I kidding, I feel like this on non-holidays, too.

Well, at least I wrote it out this time rather than keeping it inside and mentally hurting myself more...will probably do that tomorrow though.

(M 38) about a month ago. For nearly two years, we had an unofficial relationship (we were monogamous, but never used labels). He is an alcoholic and has relapsed several times throughout our relationship. A month ago, he relapsed again  and was ignoring my messages and calls. I finally found out he was going through withdrawals. Once he was better, he just stopped talking to me. I called and texted several times and he just ignored me. I sent him one last goodbye message last Sunday and he ignored that, too. The worst part is a former friend (a female) abandoned me without explanation before too, and I told him about it. I told him several times how I had an irrational fear that he would do this to me because she did. He always reassured me that he would never do that and I was being silly for worrying about it so much, then he did exactly that. We used to text each other all day every day and talk on the phone for over an hour a few times a week, plus see each other at least once or twice a week. I lost my virginity to him. I love him. I trusted him. And now I’m alone and I don’t even know why."

lonely,Lovely Rant,"Lovely Rant - I remember my brother had died. 2 weeks later my other brother had to leave to prison. He was the only one in my house with me. I woke up one day and sat in the living room. I resisted every temptation to turn on the TV or be on my phone. I can’t tell you how long I sat on the couch with the sun chasing the morning shadows away. 

I had a bottle of whiskey but I didn’t drink the pain away. I sat there with this bottle without taking a drop. It was that feeling of walking into a place having felt as if you’ve been here before. But it was new. “Somewhere between a memory and a dream” as Tom Petty once sang. 

I had this long, beautiful, introspective moment. I come to accept I was alone. There was no physical pleasure or poison that’ll fix that. I had this pain and nobody to share it with. It’s one thing to want to share love with someone. I think, however, we truly ache for someone to share our heartache. I felt like home all by myself. It was painful but it was mine- my humble abode. 

I was no longer desperate to leave that moment. I had no desire to fill the abyss inside me with temporary dopamine fixes. I sat with that sadness and let myself feel it. It felt exactly how it sounds - hopeless and heavy. My cheeks flooded with those unique tears that come when you are releasing some true pain. 

I looked around and thought “fuck this”. I decided I was going to workout. If I were to be lonely I’ll be fit and lonely. 

This was about 9 years ago. It wasn’t until 4 years ago that I really became comfortable with my own company. But it’s been a journey. As I read all these posts I truly feel for you guys and gals. From the bottom of my heart, I love you. 

I wish I could take it and carry it for you. I wish I could fill you with healing love. I wish you knew how fucking perfect and beautiful you are. I wish you knew how much I admire your strength and sacrifice. Be good, people. 

As Joe Dirt always said - keep on keeping on."

lonely,"First Valentines Day alone, and I feel nothing [long post]","First Valentines Day alone, and I feel nothing [long post] - I apologize if this turns into a general rant, when I write about my feelings that tends to happen. 

Tomorrow will be my first Valentine’s Day alone in 3 years. I miss the reassurance of knowing that there’s someone who loves me other than my family. I miss having someone who understands me, and doesn’t care if I do dumb things, or if I make a fool of myself. But I feel nothing, just kind of... incomplete. I’ve been shutting in my emotions for years, and at this point I don’t know if I do it intentionally or if it just happens. 

The belief that men should be tough is bullshit. Everyone needs to be in tune with their emotions. I grew up thinking that crying was a sign of weakness. I learned how to hide my emotions to the point I can hide them from myself now. My emotions are just building up now. It’s almost like a dam, there’s a point where it will fail. I know I’m going to snap at some point, and it’s just a matter of when. I haven’t cried in months.

I haven’t felt truly happy in a long time. The only time I have felt really happy since my ex and I broke up is when I play D&amp;D, but I’m not myself during that, I’m acting as my characters. It allows me to escape to a fictional world where my problems are things I can physically confront instead of emotions. You don’t get experience when you kill your emotions. You just lose an essential part of being human, your ability to feel. Without feeling, you cannot be happy, sad, angry. You just... Exist.

I want to find that someone. Someone who I can be happy with, and who makes me feel whole again. But how? How do I find that someone? Do I wait until I bump into them on the street? Or do I just let things happen as they will? Dating apps haven’t worked, and I don’t go out much. This is what frustrates me. When my ex and I broke up after 3 weeks of knowing there was someone else she liked as well, and being too far away to be able to do anything about it, I had known our relationship was over for long enough I had already isolated myself emotionally. For 3 weeks, I was her therapist. Making sure she would walk away okay. She didn’t want to hurt me, and I convinced myself I would be fine. I’m not fine. I’ve been internalizing the screams of frustration and loneliness for the past 4 months. I’ve been muffling the screams with my studies, YouTube videos, and loud music. Anything to coverup the echoes through the silence. Silence has been like a bottomless pit recently. It pulls me in, and I start thinking of things I haven’t thought in years. Things that crippled me emotionally and psychologically. My saving grace is that I can block out my emotions. I lock up the dark thoughts, and bury them under more work and louder music. 

This is the first time since then that I have truly opened up and talked about how I have felt since then, and I’m glad that I have the faceless void of the internet to talk to. Because I know that out there, there are people who are going through the same things. People who know what I’m feeling and can be that shoulder I need to lean on to get through this.

But tomorrow is just another day."

We're not even an hour into this year's Valentine's Day and I can already feel how cripplingly alone I am. This is not a new feeling by any means, but it's like it's been highlighted or amplified specifically to make me miserable.

What the fuck is wrong with me? Today is the day a lot of my friends have been looking forward to because they get to surprise their girlfriends and have a really sweet, romantic day, and I should be happy for them. So why do I feel nothing but empty? I didn't think I was the jealous type but I'd be lying if I didn't say I longed to have somebody special like they do, and have a special occasion to let them know just how much they mean to me.

I hate myself for feeling this way. I can't even be around people because it's too much energy to even fake a smile or pretend to be happy. How can I be so selfish? How can I make a day all about sharing love and happiness about me? I fucking hate it."

lonely,I don’t really have anyone else to tell this to so I’m bitching about my bad day- after a bad month- here. Have a lovely day/night.,"I don’t really have anyone else to tell this to so I’m bitching about my bad day- after a bad month- here. Have a lovely day/night. - Lately I’ve been depressed, I haven’t been doing great health wise and for the past few nights I’ve been terrified of dying. I’m scared I won’t wake up and yet when I do all I want is to go back to sleep. I’m tired. Mentally and physically.
There’s one person in this world I wish would care but considering the introduction to my rant, it’s clear I feel that person doesn’t care much. That person being my boyfriend.
It’s stupid little things but for example dreams have a big impact on me. I grew up with my grandmother who always interprets her dreams and so did my aunt. I told him that I’m one of those people, he said his mom is like that too and “oh god, it’s stupid”. I told him about that because something really strange and disturbing had happened in a dream and I was unsettled. He just said “well okay then” as per usual so I just told my grandmother about it a week after it happened. I’m not a very open person but this was really bugging me. That being said a couple weeks pass by and he tells me about his dream, it’s about another girl. It’s nothing romantic on his end but apparently said girl was very into him. He went into great lengths about said dream. I listened. Another couple weeks, another dream about yet another girl, nothing romantic either, this one was just weird. Another week, he tells me his dreams have been all over the place. Now before I told him I paid close attention to my dreams he never mentioned anything, and now I did, he strangely wants to relay his dreams to me only when it’s about another girl. A couple days after that I have a really strange and stressful nightmare. I tell him about it and his response was “same dudebrodude, same”. Then nothing. No asking if I’m okay, no nothing until hours later he rants about a video game. The day passes and I don’t hear much from him but something happened to my brother so I told him and he replies with one word. I go comfort my brother and my boyfriend comes back, tell me “oh wow you didn’t even call or text? Nice to see you’re so worried about me” I wasn’t worried. He went awol( and basically slept the whole rest of the day) on purpose to see if I’d worry which I didn’t. 
Now yesterday he had a headache. I was studying. I told him I was having a hard time with a subject. He didn’t reply so I assumed he was still playing his game. He had a headache during the day so I also texted him to ask if he was feeling better. Time passes I figure he fell asleep. But around 2am I texted him and I told him thinking of how one could never wake up was so terrifying to me. I was really scared. And then I said I loved him. I slept for about an hour  before I woke up throwing up and went back to sleep. Woke up to him replying to the textabout  it German and nothing else. I was a bit out of it but I replied. He said he dreamt about his ex, who died, and that’s been happening a lot lately so I hear him out and when that subject and the next one died down I go back to sleep. 
Later in the day we spend time together and he wants to play something so we do, I feel a bit off so I’m not as talkative as usual, and he gets kinda annoyed at that. I tell him he can speak too. He asks one question, how was my day. I tell him about it and he just says okay and then we play. And then that’s just it.
I just feel so alone. I don’t really have any friends whom I can talk to. We don’t really have that kind of dynamic and even if we did I’m just not one to bitch about things I know will be fine if I just bear it for 5minutes but sometimes I just wish the one person I care about the most would make me feel like they care about me too. 
And I know I’m sounding ungrateful and greedy, I’m sorry about that but I needed to get a bit of it off my chest. 
I’m not scared to go to sleep tonight, my chest feels uncomfortable and I feel as though my heart is giving up on me but I’m not scared of falling asleep. I don’t want to die. But I’m so tired I’m not scared to close my eyes. 
Hopefully I wake up tomorrow. Hopefully you do too."
lonely,I don’t have people that care,"I don’t have people that care - I don’t feel to bad, but I just realized the only people I still talk to are my brothers, who could give to shits about me, my mom, who just works and works and is always gone and I love her for it, cause I got no dad. I mean, he’s alive, just been away forever. I talk to him from time to time, and one of my friend who I haven’t seen in a long time. I don’t talk to either of them very often. 

I smoke, I never leave the house. I just play apex or watch some shows all day and night. No school, but I should be a senior. No new friends, just stagnant life. By all means I should be fat, but somehow that seems like the only thing I got going for me, cause I only move if I need to eat, drink water or smoke. My mom is gone for Valentine’s Day with her boyfriend, which she deserves. But I just realized how shit I am, and also that I’m pretty lonely."
lonely,An overwhelmed/lonely vent,"An overwhelmed/lonely vent - I've had a pretty rough few years. Got really sick for a few months, finally got better, started seeing someone, ""Z,"" long-distance who I immediately clicked with and thought I'd end up marrying, found out my mom was diagnosed with ALS, got dumped by Z, a few months later started seeing someone else long-distance, ""B"" (not as intense of a relationship but still nice), got dumped by him because of the distance, got sick again for awhile, started hanging out in a slightly less-than-platonic way with another long-distance person, ""C,"" who I'd been friends with for awhile (I knew there was some attraction there and admittedly I needed the support), got laid off at work, stopped talking to C much after I came back home (we never were in a relationship or anything, and now it sucks because it feels like our friendship changed after we were starting to get close). Also, Z and I had been talking semi-regularly for awhile, which was nice for me because he's supportive and knows me well and we still get along, but now he's been talking to me less because of something personal he has going on. And my health has been bad again.

I know the long-distance thing is an issue; I keep trying to meet people in my own city but I never connect with anyone here as much. And I'm really trying NOT to need the support of someone who's interested in me, but they just tend to give more unconditional support and attention than anyone else. They care more. Other than my mom, but she can't physically speak very well anymore and she obviously has her own major health issues. It's just so hard to manage and be motivated when everything piles up."

I can barely say a sentence to anyone besides the people in my small friend group. People think I’m fine because of my reputation of like from 3rd grade but I feel like I’m sinking deeper and deeper into a hole. I know that sounds edgy and whatever but it just is what it feels like. Some days I just want to stay home and speak to nobody and do nothing.

lonely,There is still so much to do...,"There is still so much to do... - Loneliness sucks, and I’m not going to pretend it doesn’t, but I can’t help but think about how even in this less than ideal world there is so many incredible things to see and do. The other day I did what I like to do when I’m sad: I drove up to a secluded spot and listened to some music. It always makes me feel better, and I think I know why. My house, my room, the people in my life...they’re the small world I have created for myself. The big world full of lonely treks down winding roads at night, accompanied by the music created by other sad souls is so much more comforting. 

There’s comfort in knowing that we are all lonely. There’s comfort in knowing that even the stars cannot escape mortality, and as I watch them from my car I am spending some of my brief life doing something I love. I don’t need to be in love to share that with others. I can post here. I can write a song or a poem or a book.

As we see another Valentine’s Day tomorrow please remember that the balloons and red cakes at your local store are just part of your small world. Do something grandiose tomorrow night. Steal a moment for yourself that only you will ever see or appreciate. Participate in the cosmic loneliness we all feel."

People always leave me for somebody else. As a child, other kids would leave me for another friend, not even include me in anything, and just flat out ignore me afterwards. I just wanna know what it’s like when someone is genuinely excited to see you and WANTS to talk to you. I do so much for people and want them to feel loved and appreciated, because I’ve never experienced it myself and I don’t want anyone ever feeling what I’ve felt. So whenever I’m with someone and things are going well, I get all excited, but then I worry how long do I have before they leave me like everyone else. 

I just want to know what it’s truly like to be noticed, cared, and just.....human. I really just hate myself and the way I’m made. Like what did I do to deserve to be treated like this. I truly feel like I’m a defective part."

When I was young I dreamt of having a close group of friends and woman I was hopelessly in love with and yet I have none of this and I'm scared that I never will and that I've missed my chance and I'm going to feel this way for the rest of my life.

I'm sat here thinking what is the point of me.

This is a very supportive subreddit and I want to share my support by saying this; Instead of thinking Valentines Day as the loneliest day of the year, think of it as Singles-Appreciation Day. If you want to go out and see a movie, or have dinner, or just to take a drive do it. Even do it with friends, if you want to, damn it. If you want to stay inside, order a pizza, and play video games, do it! You are not in a relationship so you do not have to worry about what others want- focus on yourself. Be the star of your own show, cuz you dont need to care about other peoples wants that day. It's just you! Oh, and those candies the day after Valentines Day? You get them for a deal! So don't act sad about not having someone to be with you, trust me- ive been there, be glad there is still time to focus on yourself!

Hello. I am 26, and I am struggling with anxiety and depression for years.

Next wednesday I have an important exam which I have to pass to graduate from university. My parents are living 400 km away and I feel very lonely. This week (especially today) was really hard for me. I cried all day and I feel like I can't deal with stressful situations anymore. I feel extremely exhausted and sad.

I have to pass this test, but I am extremely afraid that I will not pass :( It's not good at all to have this mentality before an exam, but I can't handle it :("

It’s just a painful reminder of how lonely life can be. It makes me want to cry. I never experienced Valentine’s Day with someone I like and they like me back. I never got a gift from someone else other than family on the day.

I've just focused on myself, my job, and taking care of things at home. The isolation has been really theraputic, but I'm ready to move on. I haven't gotten out very much. Tonight I hope that changes. This is a huge step for me and I'm proud of myself. Thank you for reading this."

I don't want to cry because I'm too societal anxious to have everyone focus on me. I can't make any friends for similar reasons. The few friends I do make never stick around because I'm just not fun or interesting to be around or talk to. I sometimes get people messaging me here, but they eventually stop either because I'm not fun to talk to, or they forget about me, but I don't blame them. I can hardly talk to people or uphold a conversation because nobody ever talks to me.

lonely,Guilt of feeling lonely without being alone,"Guilt of feeling lonely without being alone - I know i shouldn't feel so lonely all of the time. I have a few friends that care about me but that does nothing to stop the feeling of loneliness and emptiness coming from the inside. I guess it comes from the feeling that nobody else understands whats going on in my head. I've always been pretty good at hiding this feeling from the people close to me, and numbing the feeling with drugs instead. 

I feel a lot of guilt because of this, like i'm being selfish and taking people that care for granted. Its not that they arn't good enough, even though it can be frustrating when i try and explain things to them and just get a lecture about why I need to stop taking substances. I just wish i had someone to talk to about life that just listened, and understood why i do these things, not get mad at me for them.

I'm not sure where i'm going with this, I guess i'm just curious if anyone feels the same way. Even people that are never alone can be lonely."

lonely,Me and my loneliness,"Me and my loneliness - (Hey guys , this is my story how my battle with loneliness started n it’s a bit quite long story n I am never a writer , so I wrote a part for you people , so please read it and if you liked it I will continue to write my whole story , because writing this gives me a strange peace to my mind. )

I always remember that I was lonely , from childhood till adulthood, I never felt or remembered any moment that I cherished with my family but it doesn’t mean that they didn’t love me they do love but I think the problem lies with me. My grandparents used to love me dearly and I remember I was closer to them than my parents and my grandparents used to adore me ,shower me with gifts more importantly they never left me alone. But all started to shaken when I got up early in the morning on January 23rd 2001 wanting to go and pee and was surprised to find many different people in my house and later I found out my grandma was dead(later I got to know she had breast cancer), I was nearly nine that time so it didn’t hit me away straight. Days passed and days became months and my grand pa started to feel not good and become ill, so I had to take care of my grand pa from making tea to help him in toilet. Because my parents were busy working their asses off. That was the time I started to feel lonely first because I knew grandpa was dying bcoz my grandma and grandpa is what you call soul mates they had a great marriage together and when my grandma left the world , my grandpa couldn’t live it here anymore without her. And soon the very next year grandpa passed away too. So it was jus ten year old me all alone in a big house doing nothing and scared and lonely. And that time there was war going on in our country so I heard many stories how unknown people can come and kidnap children and it was the time when cell phone weren’t popular and available, so I tied to read and built my own
Imaginative world and imaginary friends, some times I go to the garden and take a dry fallen small branch and pretend it’s like my sword and will move and swish it in the air pretends like I was fighting. Or some times I will take a dried coconut branch n make a cricket bat from it and will take some ball or dried small coconuts n pretend like I was playing and I toss the ball in the air and hit it so I will be baller and the batsman and I pretend like trees my garden were my fielders. I know it sounds stupid but I was a kid and lonely. You may ask why I didn’t go to the playground and play with my age group boys , it’s bcoz my parents thought it was not safe with the war n they thought I was a fragile one. So days passed and then I started to develop a healthy interest in English literature so my parents took me to nun who used to teach literature, she was a great person, and we always read and think about philosophical stuff even though I was twelve or thirteen. That nun always tell me that I have an old soul. I thought it was improvement but sometimes that nun also busy so I had to wait for here in the convent or after class wait for some time to come and pick me up, counting one to thousand to pass the time, staring the big copper pod tress (Peltophorum pterocarpum) wondering how nice life would be if there is just some one for me to talk and staring the gate , expecting my dad to come and pick me up ...."

lonely,It hurts to realize that nobody like you except your parents,"It hurts to realize that nobody like you except your parents - People around me always say negative things about me! I can say for sure that I am a nice person (my therapist told me that I have a good character ), I am also a smart student and funny. but it seems to me that nobody likes me .they always criticize me. It started with my extended family when I was kid, they always criticized my skin color and clothes, and now my colleagues talk about me with negativity, I am nice to them so when I talk to them they respond to me but if I didn't talk to them first, they just ignore me! And they also criticize my character and I respond to their criticism and stood for myself they say they want me to be a better person! So I think why do people always see the negativity in everything about me Why doesn't anyone see the good inside me! I deserve to be loved for who I am. Nobody compliments me ex: my mother but everyone's mother loves them so it doesn't make me feel better 
I lost the hope to have friends a long time ago, all I ask from people is to be nice and stop criticizing me."

I go into the classroom and she is sitting next to the seat i usually sit in. I was a little shocked but i decided id already hit rock bottom a while ago so why not give it a shot. I walk over and ask ""do you mind if I sit here, or do you want your space"" (in case she was retaking something). She gives me a weird look and goes ""sureee sit here, but i want my space"" procedes to get up take all her stuff and move to a table thats full except for one spot. I guess what really makes it suck is shes considered to be one of the nicest people in my grade and isn't like super popular or super hot, but i really liked her and i get completely denied."

Soo many times I’ve prayed for friends but yet here I am all lonely af 
I just was to belong to a group of friends and have them invite and what me to be there 
I have one best friend and I am beyond thankful for her knowing how much I’ve struggled to make friends and just always having her there, I never take it for granted but she lives far and she works so it’s hard to rely on her to be my only type of social life.
But I really really would love to know why why can’t I make friends like everyone else? Is it in my faith to never have friends? Am I not worthy of friends? Am I being punished for something? 
I might not be the best person but I’m not the worst and I just don’t understand it!
For the most part I just get on with my life but I can’t help and think about it on days where things would’ve been easier if i had friends, hours spent alone I could be having a laugh with great people so idk what it is and why people don’t want to be my friends or why the universe isn’t allowing it but all I got is hope and if not hopefully one day I can start a family and my kids will be my friends"

lonely,I’ve been lonely for most of my life.,"I’ve been lonely for most of my life. - I’m grateful to have family and friends in my life that care about me but something is missing. 
My brother and I grew up extremely close but when we hit puberty everything changed. We were suddenly in our own worlds and looking back I know we needed to be in order to mature into adults. We never gained that closeness back. But ever since then I’ve craved that closeness with another person and I haven’t found it. 

I tried looking for it in romantic relationships. To the point where I became (and still am) a cereal dater. I stayed in bad relationships because I didn’t want to be alone. And worse I hardly made an effort to make friends because I felt I should have been searching for that perfect romantic relationship instead. I put too much weight on myself to find it and as a result I missed out on having close female friends. 

Now I’m approaching 30 and I feel I never had a true best friend. I don’t really know how to be a best friend either. Among the friends I do have, I don’t reach out or invite them over. I feel they wouldn’t enjoy hanging out with me and I feel I don’t know how to keep them entertained. I don’t know how to have girl talks and I’m uncomfortable or awkward around them. I would like to find like-minded women out there and have a true best friend one day. It’s seems that when I try though, I fall on my face and just can’t find a person who I feel would be that friend for me. 

My boyfriend has an easy time making friends. It’s truly night and day with us and I find myself studying how he does it. He’s friendly sure but I think he’s just never had this problem before. He can connect with anyone and people truly care for him. It’s insane to me how easy it seems. 

He loves to be out with his friends and most of the time it’s without me. This gives me relief at times because I don’t have to exhaust myself by trying to be social when I’m panicking inside but also I feel more lonely at other times. I don’t feel that connected to my boyfriend either. We talk about surface level topics, he hardly spends time with me, and he spends quality time with his friends over me. 

Last thing I want to touch on is that I’ve always been the adventurous type. I want to travel and experience new things. This is because I grew up in a poor and misogynistic family. I wasn’t allowed the freedom my brothers had and we didn’t take family trips because of the costs. So I didn’t experience much as a kid or teen. Now that I am older and able, I want to do new things and I feel I have this tremendous vigor for adventure but I want to share it with someone. What hurts me the most about life is that I don’t have that someone to share it with. Be it a friend or a romantic partner. This truly breaks me because I feel life is passing me by."

I do not like going into public anymore because of my weight. And thats another thing...Its been so long since I received any type of compliment (outside of the family). I am 36 and never bern in a real relationship because my childhood was fucked up. Ive gone through so many therapists, medications, and even been to the hospital more than once. It just feels like there is no future for me and I am stuck watching everybody else get to be married and have a life of their own. I am still at home...and feel like I will never get out. I stay in my and in my bed wishing soneone out there is waiting for me.

But who actually responds and has the person respond back and have a talk about what they’re going through? I don’t know the percentage of people who actually receive help or get offered help and I don’t feel like making the numbers since it’ll be too much work. But I’ve seen a trend with the posts. People ask for help and sometimes people comment and there’s nothing else, the poster sometimes responds to the comments or someone pm’s them and that’s a different story. What if the reason no one is getting help isn’t because people don’t care but because you simply don’t accept the offer since you believe no one actually cares and that’s how you’ve been seeing everything from your perspective?"

I have been cheated on, ghosted and left for other women so many times that I’m afraid I won’t ever find true love, which wouldn’t be really important to most people but to me, I feel like that’s one of the most beautiful things about living. And I’m afraid I won’t get to experience it. 

My mother seems to be content in who she is, and things like that don’t bother her. 

But me, constantly seeing love in people and art and hearing about love on the radio, having to listen to your coworkers talk about their significant others while it seems you’ve been cursed with one failed relationship after the other makes you feel even more alone. You try to ignore all of this but after a while, you can’t help but think “When will life start to look up”?"

It’s almost every day that I hear someone say something good about me in the hallway or in class but it never feels real to me. It’s almost as if they’re being paid to like me or something. Despite having many friends, I feel like I can’t depend on any of them, and that’s lonelier to me than being an outcast."

The people are like robots. They’re barely alive.  My classmates? They’re kind and all but I don’t really feel any connection with them. I have friends in school, quite thankful for them but I don’t have that “connection” with them either and they’re insensitive af. I don’t talk much with my highschool friends as they are busy and I don’t want to disturb them. I feel like I don’t belong here. I hate the university too and there’s no energy that pushes me to study and work harder. My parents check on me everyday asking “how’s school” and I’m running out of list of lies to tell them. I love being alone lately tho i have time to reflect and overthink lol. I’m planning to transfer but scared that i might regret the decision, also unsure of what I’m really supposed to do. I lost sleep a lot I tried to sleep but once my eyes shut I can’t help the thoughts from flowing. I hate going out too, I get conscious and feel like everyone is looking at me. I don’t know feel like there’s something wrong with me. I ate bananas, but i guess the happy hormones doesn’t work."
lonely,Valentines day sucks... A lot,"Valentines day sucks... A lot - Valentines day is one of my least favorite holidays. All it does is remind me of how lonely I am and how much people hate me. Out of the 6 friends I have that still don't care about me I was the only one that never got asked to go to the schools dance. All I ever do is lay in my bed, which is the only nice thing in this world, and use my phone or try and make friends on vr but my voice is so high pitched that no one wants to talk to me because it's annoying or they think I don't know what I'm doing. It's hard making new friends online and in person. For some reason I only listen to music about romance or relationships like Cuco, or Mac Demarco, which just makes it sadder. Sometimes they only joy I get is when I forget I'm alive and just stare at the ceiling and day dream. I'll forget about everything and just think about what I would do with a girlfriend or a million dollars and then I'll look around and just want to die. Sometimes when I do it, it'll last so long that when I stop I think I do have that stuff for about 5 minutes then I just get sad again. I just don't want to be lonely on valentines Day any more."

However I feel especially down in the dumps, in school, I have to mentally force myself to talk to girls if I  am working in a group. I’ve talked to girls in the past online but I regret doing so as I have said awkward things and asked questions on the borderline of being creepy. I feel really fucking bad about this I also have very strict standards on women as I like to have someone with the same views as me, the same interests as me, and also how she looks. I just don’t know."
lonely,Isolation and self hatred 😔😔,"Isolation and self hatred 😔😔 - I should be so much happier than I am.

There is an inpatient eating disorders unit in my city but I'm  (thankfully) not sick enough to be there- trying to work with outpatient but no luck so far.

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

There’s more info about me on my account if you’re interested in talking."
lonely,hi,"hi - Just made this alt account because I have some personal things on my main account and I don’t want people I know to know all my feelings and stuff. Just want to be anonymous. Basically tho, I have no one to talk to. Everybody I talk to eventually forgets about me and I’m always texting first. Everybody at school barely has heard me speak. I feel so isolated and just want someone to talk to. I’m 14 tho so plz only text me if ur like 16 and under, need to vent and I need a friend that’s not toxic. Ik I sound like r/im14andthisisdeep but fr I have nobody to open up to"

Have you experienced this?
How have you faced this issue(besides copious amounts of alchohol)?

I used to be content with being alone, but all these friendly people are making me realise what I'm missing."

The other times they just tell me to shut up or im annoying. I just want to be heard. I feel so isolated. Even my parents do it. Sometimes i just want to end it all. I put on a mask and laugh at myself and try to be funny but i really just feel deflated and sad all the time. But tbh i kinda see why they think im annoying so i guess its my fault that im isolated. Being ignored is the worst :[

It’s ironic since I am getting treated for depression myself, but I always appreciate talking to others and I had friends being there for me when I was deep in trouble myself, I know how important it is talking to someone that actually wants to understand and be there for you.

, and live in the Netherlands / Holland. Like doing sport and hobby’s such as listening to music (song suggestions welcome!)

Now I just found out about this subreddit, but I see a ton of people talking about the same loneliness I feel a lot of the time. If any of you would like to talk to me send me a message private, maybe we can help eight other! 

Sorry if it takes time for me to answer, time differences and daily life are always difficult. But if you feel like talking to someone I might be the person you are looking for! Anyways good luck to everyone I hope you guys will find true happiness and love"

lonely,"It's not death I fear, but living a meaningless life.","It's not death I fear, but living a meaningless life. - These thoughts should belong to another subreddit, but the inspiration behind them not, so here I am. Have you thought about the meaning of life? Probably. Yeah, I know it's cool to be seen as that edgy young adult, who states that life is meaningless and nihilism is da way. But another question arises, if nothing has meaning, why do we fear death? 

Sorry for the depressing intro. I'm usually a bright 21 year old ambivert, who likes to talk in memes but I have my deep moments, lately too many, just like this one.

I kind of struggle with getting over my past, that is a constant failure to give a meaning to my life, to find myself or to keep good friends around me. I'm currently before a gall bladder surgery, which hell, is so scary that I could shit my pants. I'm a very paranoid person, so even after being told countless times that it's not a routine surgery, I still find myself crying over it. Why? Who likes the thought of being cut for the first time, only after not be able to do almost anything alone for some days? Probably no one. But the feeling of being vulnerability at 21 is horrifying. 

I'm regular lurker here, trying to find meaningful relationships, to feed my hunger to live an almost fullfilled life, but I always seem to fail. Why? I don't really know. I do believe that not everyone can be friends with everyone. Can you have a significant friendship with someone who has 100% of your interests? I don't agree with that. I think it's our core, our essence of our personality that has to be on the same wavelength, to be able to resonate with someone on a spiritual level. 

If you read this long-ass bullshit: thank you, have a nice day/night/evening. If you feel like that you 'vibe' with my thoughts, hit me up. I may answer a bit slower, because I'll be operated soon, I'm falling asleep while crying and probably will panic, hopefully not, but throw up and feel sick.

I hurt myself few time, have done stupid things like mixing xanax and alcohol, I got drunk alone in my place and had a black out.(just telling you all a few of them) 

So in few words, I'm not feeling so good, trying to be and feel better, but still pretty dark inside.

I talked to few friends about this, but non in a completely way, like just messing around with the topic like is not a big deal, couse I don't what to be a heavy thought in their brain.
And also cause Im afraid to lose them or because maybe they could let me down.

I don't know, it's kind a messy thought.

Don't know what to do.

I have these weird thoughts for awhile now like what if I just didn’t get up or what if I just didn’t do something for once. I know these don’t sound weird I’m just being lazy but this has progressed to the point where sometimes I think: “What if I just got a rope, and ended this?”. So I’ve also been friends with some people for quite a long time and I always felt like I belonged with them but recently I feel I they’re all in this close circle and I’m standing on the outside. Lastly of course, there’s this guy that I’ve liked for awhile now. He had told me he was interested in me too but didn’t want to have to deal with dating or anything, though he did say he loved me. I always thought he was a sweet guy but recently I witnessed him ignore me, not talk to me, give me straight up blunt answers so our conversation could just end, he called a VERY close friend of mine a dick, and he’s always talking with other girls. I know he said he doesn’t want to date me right now, but he said he loves me and so when these things happen I don’t know what else to think but that he just hates me now and is tired of me. Basically this has lead to me being restless when I try to go to bed, I wake up multiple times every night, I can barely focus at work, I constantly feel myself thinking about suicide, and I feel like there’s no one around me I can tell cause they would treat me different and I would hate that. I’m writing here because I don’t know if I’m depressed or just going through a tough time, or maybe something else???? Please tell me"
lonely,Normal Stuff,Normal Stuff - This is nothing special I am just sad. I lost my last chance for happiness and the only person that made me feel wanted. Just because I waited too long to tell them how I feel. So once again I am not looking for pity I just needed to say something just in case.

The job itself is kind of in the middle of nowhere, so I have been looking at apartments in a medium sized city about 30 minutes from my job and plan to commute. I don't know why, but I am so anxious about it.

I have always had a big issue with feeling lonely no matter what. Pretty sure even if I lived in a huge city I would still feel lonely.  I know people that live relatively close to the area (like 20-30 mins), however most of my family and my boyfriend will be about 1 hour away. 

I just hate that I am not more excited and honestly I am kind of dreading moving there. I wish I felt more excited and wasn't so hung up on being lonely.

lonely,I just need someone to know I'm alive,"I just need someone to know I'm alive - Hey everyone. I wanna get straight to the point: I just need someone to care about me. I've been struggling through a lot lately, and I just need to see that someone gives a shit. 

I have no friends at all. My parents are divorced, and my mom (who has legal custody) and her fiancee are becoming increasingly religious (in the bad way). My only company is my little sister, who I love deeply, but she doesn't handle anything outside of memes and irony well, since she is not fully emotionally developed. The only person asides from her who has my back is my dad, but he's always busy paying for childcare, so I barely get to hang out with him. 

I'm currently a senior in high school, and I am going to SJSU on the fall semester. Originally, I wanted to stay with my folks to save money. But now, both because of their growing religious fervor and because I want another chance at both living a worthwhile life and being an independent person, I want to move out. Unfortunately, I have nowhere else to go, since I only applied to SJSU. App season is over, so I need to deal with what I got. 

Moving out is going to be rough, because I am also Filipino; for those of you who aren't aware, Filipino culture places more value on the collective than on the individual; combine this with typical fundamentalist sentiment, and you have my parents. I know and fear that they will object to me moving out, and will do everything in their power, including subtle shaming, to keep me in their bubble. I don't know what to do. I don't believe in their religion, but r/Atheism told me to try and not voice out my disbelief. And whatever choice I choose, I might cause unintended, negative consequences for my sister. 

Pile this issue with depression, loneliness, nowhere to healthily release my emotions and stress, a procrastination problem I've struggled for over 6 years or so, timidity, self-hatred, suicidal ideation, senioritis, and the ensuing hordes of homework, and you have my life so far. 

I've improved my suicidal ideation a little thanks to a wonderful person on r/SuicideWatch, but I still feel empty inside. I just want someone to talk to; someone who will give a shit about me. 

Will anyone be willing to talk? 

I can understand, however, if no one wants to. I don't think I deserve it, and I'm not that great in maintaining a conversation. I apologize for being a selfish, desperate loser. You can just ignore this post if you want. I wouldn't know."

lonely,Valentine’s Day sucks,Valentine’s Day sucks - Everyday I feel sad as I barely have friends and on Valentine’s Day it’s way worse since I got no one to spend it with and just cry on it and  even if I talk to my few friends that I have I still feel lonely.
lonely,I'm rude,"I'm rude - In town, I happened to find students from my college course who I've never spoken a word to. I heard one of them shout ""Hey it's Mark"" and I don't know if they expected a reply but I awkwardly looked their way and back. They weren't even looking at me when I glanced so I didn't think it was a big deal.

For a while, I really appreciated and was surprised that I was actually acknowledged before I questioned if I came across as a rude dickhead and I'm worried I won't get many other chances before no one wants anything to do with me. I keep having these opportunities to actually make friends but clearly to them, I don't want anything to do with them and I can't bring myself to actually be expressive. I'm introverted (obviously) but I wouldn't mind being a bit less r/lonely HAHA.

lonely,My rant about not having anyone.,"My rant about not having anyone. - Hey, uh I don't know how to describe what I'm doing here, I just have a lot of things racked up inside my head. You, dear reader, don't have to comment I just feel empty wanting to talk even if it's for a wall.

I haven't been happy for years now and I never had anyone to talk to about it. For a long time i was the ""depressed kid"" who could be bullied for it and be pushed down even more. I am very disconnected from my parents because they look at me as a disappointment. My parents were always the perfect kids any parent would love, and my siblings are the same. I don't have any friends, I had 1 girlfriend but she just ghosted me from one day to another. I don't blame her cause I wouldn't wanna be with someone like me either. I always have this pain inside my chest that I can't get rid of, and I sometimes just tear up without even noticing it. People always say that it will get better but i feel like giving up. I am only 15 but I can't see my future being as bright as I once hoped it would be.

I feel really scared right now, because noone knows this just me and I don't know how people will react. (especially to me being only 15 and saying I'm faking depression).

Again I am saying noone has to answer I feel calm with this being lost in new, me posting this made it a bit better already."

But the thing is we talk one day and probably for a week then we just don't which is okay. It's cuz we aren't all the same kind of lonely. We are unique in each of our loneliness and everyone has life. That's why some people relate to some posts more than others. Now the point: I want to form a friendship, with not much expectations, no pressure of talking all the time, no fear of being judged. Only acknowledgement of one another, *tying to understand one another*, honest conversations, just a connection between to humans with no material gains, only mental support, doesn't have to be long conversations as i understand people have other things to do, I too am preparing for jobs, just replying when you can at least once a day, seeing me as a friend who you talk with and know as a human, and not leaving in a week, someone who is regular on reddit and hence the title ""Long term friendship...."" If you want that, hit me up.

I am 19 and I like anime, music, travelling though i can't say I've traveled much, extremely lonely. So, if you want something similar to this and can appreciate me bothering you and can bother me back, then let's be friends!! Hopefully we can make each other less lonely by acknowledging each other's presence on earth. If you read this far, thank you so much.

letting me know you're busy would be so much easier on my mind instead of disappearing for hours upon end 

I just feel vulnerable without you and sit here waiting for the next time you text to make everything ok again I miss you and love you I don't know what I'd do without you even thought you've been in my life for about 4 months these have been the best and yet most lonely 4 months ever I just really miss you when you're gone and feel like we're losing touch REALLY REALLY SLOWLY but it's getting there I wish I could write everything I think in seconds down without spending hours doing so I hope you're okay sis 

Sometimes I wish you never spoke to me in the first place just so I didn't know what this kind of loneliness felt like, I had never felt like this before talking to you I would get bored but never lonely because I had no one else there to feel lonely for obviously I have friends who I miss but I never feel the same without you and I feel like I could discard most of my friends and put you Infront of them I don't think you realise how much I love you and it's painful to see it everything I do I think of you while doing it, listening to music, playing guitar, playing games, eating food, getting on busses, doing work EVERYTHING and I think it's because of the early days when we would talk about everything we did from what time we woke up to when we were going to bed I can't look at anything and not think about you and I can't keep my mind busy enough to stay away from you 

I love you sis I don't know how to say any of this to you without making anything arkward or ripping our friendship apart so I'll just suffer alone and keep this all to myself and anyone who took the time to read this which who am I kidding it's no one."

Darkness. Me and you. Going out. A balcony? Maybe. An open space, more like a roof. Me and you. Sudden shift. An outhouse. A line of clothing. Familiar people behind, staring from within. Some code. Another shift. The hostel, or a similar place. Netted doors. An attached balcony. Another exit. An infinite corridor leading nowhere. An attempt to escape. You call. Talk about gutting yourself. Call ends. I call. Doesn't connect. I call. Doesn't connect. Internal realisation of a scream. Connects. A scene in a room. A random mustached dude. With a girl. You? Younger you? Glare. A scene in a train. Videocall. A kid. Upper birth. Taunting the caller. Outside a hospital. A broken tile. You jab. I twitch. Another jab. You disappear. Another familiar street. Burning in the distance. I look below. A cathedral. The cathedral. The place I've been to before in my dreams. Random dude sitting in a car. Advises to make an anime out of it. To draw it from his perspective. Self-aware. A common world. Where am I? Does this exist? Open eyes to ground myself in my room. Connects weed with the visualisation of the hostel.

lonely,Anyone out there?,"Anyone out there? - 
Hey everyone, I’m a first year Phd student at a school that, to be honest, wasn’t my first choice. It’s a good school, well funded, puts out lots of research and in many ways is ideal. However, I’m approximately 5 years older than most of my cohort members and honestly I don’t feel like I fit in at all. I’m originally from NYC, so attending grad school in the South is something of a culture shock, but I’m finding more and more that it’s hard for me to have anything in common with my classmates and I haven’t really found any friends that I can hangout with or even talk to outside of class. I pride myself on making an effort to be social but the combination of sports I play, life experiences, age, heritage, difficulty with classes is making me feel homesick, lonely and frustrated that I’m not fitting in as well as I would like. Before coming to grad school I had a healthy social life, strong support system and felt fulfilled at work but I feel like I’m missing something.

Has anyone else felt like this?"

I was okay before I met you, you know. Before you very much barged your way into my life and gave me the impression you would be there for me and that our friendship would ""grow in closeness-ness"" you said in your less than perfect English in a voice note. These were YOUR words. Before you I was OKAY with my loneliness. I didn't have the best coping methods with my sadness I will admit, but I FELT FINE. and then you came and became my only and closest friend. And now it's as if you're making a very sincere effort to part from me. To ignore me. And it's so. Painful because you made me not like my loneliness anymore. Your companionship was so sweet. And warm. And comforting. And secure. And now you're hardly even replying to my texts once a week. I'm in so much pain. And I'm angry at you. But I miss you. The people I speak to about you are on my case about letting you go but they don't know how amazing you are, to me. They want me to forget about you. I don't think I can ever do that as long as I live I don't see how I can not love the person you are. The only part of you that I can't accept is the part where you don't need to talk to me as much as I need to talk to you.

And I can't believe I'm always on my knees just like this. Messaging you again anyway. Even when you haven't replied to my last four messages in the last seven days. 

You asked to talk on the phone ""later if I'm not busy"" and then just left me hanging. Two days ago with no explanation even though I know you probably fell asleep. I don't understand you. I'm busy too. I'm tired too. But I want to make time for you. Nobody who I talk to understands how you are. You are a SHIT texter. And because I don't see you and texting is our only way of communicating it's extra painful. 


I know you care for me but I don't know how to tell you that without giving you power over me. I don't want to dishonor myself. I miss the dignity that came with being friends with my loneliness."
lonely,Just need to vent,"Just need to vent - This is less asking for advice and more seeing if I'm the only one, but do you ever finding yourself liking a person, being keen to spend more time with them even outright asking and they remain as polite as they need to be before you finally go away?

I'm an introverted person who only gets the real drive and inclination to pursue friendships with certain people who I feel I connect with. Those that I think I do however, have a nasty habit of disappearing off the face of the earth and seem to forget I exist. I'm really at a loss here as I have wondered forever if I'm the issue or do I just have shit luck with the people I'm around? I'm hurt when I'm blanked and avoided and that wouldn't bother me in the slightest if I didn't care to interact with that person more and I hate that these people have that kind of power. The questioning of the quality of my company doesn't help either."

lonely,Could I deserve to be alone? Am I a bad person?,"Could I deserve to be alone? Am I a bad person? - Hello, I have a problem where I feel that maybe I deserve to be lonely. It has been a very long time since I’ve formed any sort of substantial bond with a new person, College has been so lonely. I’ve been abandoned many times for unknown reasons.

The main issue I am having stems from my recent endeavors on a dating app. I got a bunch of matches and a ton of likes, it doesn’t even let me see them all. There are a bunch of girls messaging me, but there is only one match that mattered to me.

This really pretty girl who has the same major to me, and is in some similar situations as me. I talked to her a little bit about stuff relating to our major, but she hasn’t replied since yesterday and I don’t think she will ever message me again. This happens all the time, there are girls that like me, but I just don’t like them back. Instead there is always someone else that has my focus, but I never have theirs.

Am I an asshole for not liking the other girls? It’s been so long since I’ve talked with anyone and I feel like I have no social ability at all anymore, I feel like I just suck so much, but there are all of these other girls that like me at least outwardly, so shouldn’t I just talk to them? I just don’t like them and I focus on my crushes instead that obviously don’t pan out since crushes never work. 

I feel like such a selfish person for this. I think I would rather be alone than be with someone I don’t want to be with, and I don’t even know if I would like this girl on bumble if I met her, but still I just wish one time something would work out."

I need to talk to someone about their passions, what they love and hate, and what inspires them. Being able to connect to others on that kind of level just seems to be the most important thing to me.

lonely,Feeling offline more than I should?,"Feeling offline more than I should? - Currently feeling somewhat hopeless. on my own coding for my uni assignment. I flick onto social media and see people's lives popping and think... jeez how'd these people connect? 

The more I look at people and the portrayal of life on social media the more I feel like I'm offline in terms of being connected to a ""normal"" world and people. - from my studies of social media and the filter bubble effect, and related social media effects on society and social psychology. I know this portrayal isn't 100% real. However, I can't help feel sucked into it , also I think I can't even FAKE a cool, interconnected life for social media.

My mantra of ""the gym, then chill out"" isn't working today. 

I think things will change when I graduate from university and get a fulltime job instead of working part-time lates on my own... but this is years away and studying from home leaves the feeling of isolation and some sort of ""abnormality"" in my social life ever-present.

The thing is I have a enough friends, my phone is going off a fair bit and I shouldn't 100% feel this lost and isolated... but at the moment I just feel this way. 

Even going out I feel disconnected. like a satnav, I'm stood at the bar... then the noise dims and voices of friends laughing and joking around me fade and my brain just displays waiting for a GPS signal. before snapping back into reality and fake happiness ensues.

anyone else feel ""offline"" a fair bit or is it just me?"

I have three friends but I only trust one of them, and the other two I don't know about, but even with with ""friends"" I still feel lonely. I have a dog that I can talk to his my closest friend and will always be my closest friend but I really want friends who share the same interest that I have. 

I have no one to talk to in 95% of all of my classes its just me by myself, but hey at least I get more work done that way. What sucks more than being alone is the ass holes in my classes just kids with the biggest egos you will ever see calling you names, its been like this for years now. So the way I just minimise the unwanted attention is just to never speak unless I absolutely have to. People say just don't give them the attention and they will stop, well that shit doesn't work one damn bit.

My parents are hating on me too I feel like every body gets me wrong I slip up once and its remembered by everyone forever. I live with my dad and my step mom my brother and sister live with my mom. But my dads changing he is starting to become more and more like my step mom its like she has a heavy influence on him. They both are degrading and just completely put me down but not as bad as my real mom whenever I visit here she and my sister put me down a lot. 

I used to and still kinda have bad hygiene, I went through a phase where I didn't have the motivation to shower for a week. So instead of my mom and sister deciding to help me that tell me that I am gross and smell like shit, which really sucked to hear. So this drove me into a really sad phase where just walking across the house was tiring, I also wasn't talking much either. So doing what my mom and sister do best they   put me down and made me hate myself even more. 

I'm sorry for the rant if anyone is reading this I just needed to get this out as its been in for a while."

I moved to a new school a year ago and I only have a few close friends. I struggle to talk to others as I don't know what to say. I don't get how people are so good at convos. I didn't get any friends in my classes so I'm just alone most days. I can't think of anything meaningful to say so i just smile and laugh and I'm just there. It feels like I'm invisible in a way. I sat next to a nice girl that I like that I actually managed to talk to for a bit but I'm not sure how to keep it going and just end up not saying anything out of anxiety. I'm not sure what to do as I'm quite a shy person and unintentionally come off rude but I really don't mean to. Is it strange to ask the girl to hang out during break and even if it does happen I don't know what to say/do. 

Thanks for letting me rant about everything and it feels nice to get it out there atleast to someone. I hope whoever got to the end of this has a great day and I'm grateful that you read this far :)"
lonely,Staying alone,"Staying alone - So the reason to stay alone is not something I (30F) want. I always felt like an outsider and was pretty much alone growing up. I have a sister and brother but they get on better. Which is fine. However, when it came to relationships I haven't had a good run. Before what I feel like was my true love I was young and guys always wanted more than I could give them and when I didn't give it to them they basically get it somewhere else.

So turning 18 on holidays and met this guy that all my walls had seem to disappear even though I thought they were up however he saw right through them. Now I only knew this guy a fortnight and I fucked things up. I let him walk away and I guess why would he want me chasing me when I hurt him. However, nearly 13 years on iv had not many but some relationships with some great and not so great guys however every time I found myself with them my mind always wonders to this guy and I would turn on them for basically not being him I know stupid and childish.

It's probably guilt that keeps me up or just the thought and feeling for him just grow strong every year. I don't know how to move on or let go. I'm sure he is happy with a family. I just felt lost ever since and he did say to me not to let it control me but it has. The pain is still there and I fear loving someone else or letting some else in because too much has happened I trust no one. I always believed we get one true love.

I found and lost him. So for me not to cause any more heartbreak its best if I am just alone. When I even consider dating or meeting other men my heart always melts thinking of what if walked in looking for me. I know it will never happen. I wish it would. It's best to accept what was and just move on and be alone."
lonely,Summary of my present,"Summary of my present - He found himself kneeling and pleading to God and Satan for another opportunity, to return two months ago, to a time when everything was happiness. And when this did not work, crying and begging he began to invoke any existing spirit or demon, but as usual, he was ignored.
How many times had he tried to exchange years of his life to relive those past months?
He was going crazy, don't demons exist? Is my life worth so little that it is not worth doing a simple barter?
I'm still surprised by the fact that he hasn't gone crazy yet.
Holy God!
How many times had he relived those days in his head?
How many times had he changed his actions in the past?
How could he have been so selfish and idiotic? Doing the right thing would have demanded so little of him, but at that moment he just thought about feeling good, he thought that she belonged to him and he lost his head like someone who hasn't eaten in days and then he sees a small loaf of bread. Not only that, he committed the sin of feeling safe and lazy, of thinking that by doing the least he would get what he had longed for for several years."

After I moved I thought I could make some new friends so I went to a new school for 5th grade I met new people I thought everything was gonna go great until most of my classmates started picking on me and the people I thought were my new friends had treated badly and laugh at me 

That’s when I became less confident in myself 

It went on like this for 3 years in middle school then I reached high school I just got out of a toxic friendship not to long ago but that’s a story for another time

lonely,House took the pill,"House took the pill - I have been watching House lately. I can relate to him a lot. Makes me feel less alone. I just watched the end of the sixth season so spoilers if you care. Basically everyone in his life is leaving, and rejecting him. He just spent the last year trying to be a better person, and has gained nothing. The girl he is in love with got engaged to another guy. His only friend kicked him out to be with his new girlfriend. Everyone was leaving him and he was doing everything right. Then a patient who was depended on him dies as well. This sends him crashing down hard. He then goes home finds his pills, but before he can take them the girl he loves comes in and confesses. 

Happy ending right? It just doesn't make sense to me. Things don't happen like that. Happy endings never come. This is why i believe he took the pill and started hallucinating. Happy endings don't come. The darkness never goes away, and nobody will come to pull you out of it. All you can do is try to ignore it. Distract yourself with meaningless tasks. Pretend your characters in a tv show. Escape from your reality, and create your own. Pretend you are other people around you. People who have friends. People who receive love back.

i know that, logically, things can only go up from here; i’m only taking 3 classes and everyone at work is going to be really laidback with me. i’m grateful for that. that’s going to be wonderful. but i just can’t help the feelings of hopelessness that begin to consume me at night. nothing terrifies me more than realizing that the future is now :~/"
lonely,I Don't Feel Wanted Or Feel Like I Belong At The College Film Club That I'm In.,"I Don't Feel Wanted Or Feel Like I Belong At The College Film Club That I'm In. - Back during the fall of 2019, I was feeling pretty lonely and down about my social life and dating life so I decided to join a film production club because not only did it tie into my interest of videography, but I also saw it as a way to not only make new friends but to also meet women and find a girlfriend.  If you look through my search history, you will know that I am completely inexperienced with women and my dating life is virtually non-existent and I desperately want any spark of a dating life; I would be happy with even one woman being nice to me, that's how lonely and desperate I am.

So I showed up to their meeting around November of 2019 and it looked promising. The president appeared to be nice, friendly, and well-informed when she gave her presentation to the group. She seemed like a person I could trust and be friendly with as she appeared to be warm and welcoming to other people. I was wrong... Throughout my several interactions with her, she acted cold, unfriendly, annoyed, and always looked at me like I was some sort of idiot. And it wasn't just her who acted stuck-up towards me either, another exec member was also cold, rude, and acted completely annoyed by my presence whenever I tried interacting with her. However, both of these girls appear to be warm and friendly to other members of the club. By the way, I am not flirting with these girls or trying to hit them up, i'm trying to have normal interactions with them but they absolutely want nothing to do with me. 

Also throughout the club, nobody ever bothers to make me feel welcome or included, and women for the most part give me the cold shoulder. Nobody says hi to me or even acknowledges me whenever I show up to club meetings or even go to their parties. Also, whenever I leave the club and say bye, nobody ever says bye back to me.  And just the other day, another guy and I were in the club and as two girls left, they both said ""bye (name of guy)"" while completely ignoring my presence. 

It's super hard to break into a social circle and for people to even acknowledge my existence, especially from women who for the most part ignore me. I think one problem is that I showed up later in the semester and by that time, social groups and cliques had already been established. Another disadvantage is that I showed up to the club not knowing anybody; if I had already known somebody there, this would have been my way in to a social circle and due to the power of social proof (we are more likely to like and trust people who have been approved by our friends) this means that other people would probably have been more friendly and welcome towards me due to already knowing somebody within that group. 

Also, I am a natural introvert and my social skills are absolutely crap, especially around girls. I am much more comfortable interacting and maintaining conversations with guys than I am with girls although this is understandable considering that I am a heterosexual male. When I am around girls in the film production club, I always try to think about how i'm going to interact with these girls and build up the courage to actually initiate a conversation with them. And it always ends up with me asking them a question in regards to the club such as ""when's the film shoot this Saturday?"", they answer the question, and then the conversation abruptly ends after about 10 seconds. Actually trying to have a full-fledged conversation with girls and making a personal connection with them is hard as shit, especially when the girl in question does nothing to contribute to the conversation.  It doesn't help that half of the girls I interact with are rude and clearly annoyed with my presence."

lonely,"18M university student, very lonely, and have no friends, but literally don’t know what to do. (TLDR at bottom)","18M university student, very lonely, and have no friends, but literally don’t know what to do. (TLDR at bottom) - I am so lonely. I have been for so long. I’m a  in university, and I have been lonely ever since primary school. My parents divorced in middle school, and forced me to move across the world multiple times within the span of a year or two. By the time that was over, I was severely depressed, and had lost any friend I had. I was now in high school, and while I joined clubs, wasn’t even that shy, (like yeah, I’m kinda introverted, but I saw people far worse than me somehow find somehow eventually), I never found any friends. It wasn’t because I did not talk to people, or even find people I could relate to, I just had no clue how to build and maintain friendships. I have Aspergers/autism, and only recently found out about that, so it seems to have a lot to do with that. Because of this, I have a really hard time understanding peoples intentions and feelings, and can not take a hint, along with other stuff like generally being very awkward. After the depressing mess that was high school, I moved on to university, and while I honestly really enjoy my subject (history), and get good grades and all that, I am still really lonely. People always told me I would finally find friends here. I have not.

I did manage to befriend a girl I sat next to in one of my classes, and we went out a few times even to see a movie (things I have never really done with a friend since before I moved). However things eventually fell apart. It’s kinda complicated but essentially it was a combination of me being just generally awkward and sometimes to intense (asking about the state of the relationship and stuff), and also her being kinda confused about my intentions, in terms of romantic feelings. Looking back, I did probably have feelings, but at the time I was confused about that, and tried to ensure her that wasn’t the case. The problem was, I did not see that things were going wrong, I thought they were going great. I thought she was my friend, and we had a heck of a lot in common. I did really like her, and I felt comfortable opening up to her. I did open up to her (a few days ago), and I told her about how I have been lonely for a really long time, and how she was essentially my only friend. This actually kinda scared her away, and she told me she did not see the friendship going anywhere, or lasting. 

This really upset me. I did really like her. She was my only friend, but I felt hope that I was finally making progress. But when I decided to put myself in a vulnerable position, and confess to things I have never really told anyone else before, instead of showing that she cared, she decided to end things, and explain to me how the entire friendship was more awkward and stressful than anything else. I am still confused about why things ended and I’m unsure if it was kinda forced from the start, and I failed to recognize that, or if I just screwed things up by being too intense and honest.

After this, I’ve lost a lot of my hope. I really son’t want to go through all that agin, and get emotionally committed, just for things to die off. I want to try make other friends, but it is so difficult. Even just talking to people is hard. People don’t even sit next to me in lectures. But even if I did talk to someone, I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be hurt again, and frankly I’m still confused about how to turn someone I talk to in class occasionally, to a friend, and then manage to maintain that. I have seen counselling, but it never seemed to help. Maybe I just need to try again though. I don’t know, I literally don’t know what to do anymore. I just want a stable and close friend, but it seems impossible. Maybe I should just try to date, because frankly that seems easier at this point, but I doubt I have the maturity for that, if I can’t even handle friendships. Please just help me. What am I supposed to do?

TLDR:  in university, who is very lonely and has not had friends since primary school. I have moved across the world a lot, and I have Aspergers, which explains this to some degree. I did recently manage to find one friend, whom I hung out with, even going to see a movie, and who I really liked and related to, but I managed to screw it up, after I confessed to my situation and loneliness and was generally awkward and too intense. I really don’t want to go through all that hard work of building a relationship, just for it to die. My main problem is not talking to people, but rather how to build and maintain relationships. Or turning someone I talk to occasionally, into a friend, and then maintaining that."
lonely,I just want someone to open the door for me...,"I just want someone to open the door for me... - I feel so pathetic that I'm actually taking the time to write about something that most people don't even spend a moment thinking about on a Reddit post. I always go to open the door for any of my family members. Whether they're carrying something or not. Whether that have a key or not. Whether it's cold or not. I always stop whatever I'm doing and go to greet them. I just wish there would be someone who was excited for me to come home. When I come home, there's someone who would be hoping it was me who was coming home. Instead I unlock the door, walk in with the case of water I was asked to pick up on my way home, then someone will notice I walked in 5 minutes later and say,""Oh, you're not X, I thought you were."" I just want to be wanted. Am I asking for too much? It's the little things that I would like to have from time to time, but no one will provide it."

Im entering the military in 2 days. Im moving out of my dad’s place in a few hours, to a different country.   
 My entire family will be moving, probably 6 hours away. It strikes me that ill never be in his house again, or never visit the roads and shops of this town again.   
 After my service of 2 years ends, ill be 19-20, and probably will live on my own as an adult from then on.   
 I said goodbye to my little brother, who’s moving away to an international school. I’ve never been separated from him like this before.   
 All this feels like life telling me my teenage years are nearing it’s end, and that its time to grow up.  
 I’m scared shitless. I won’t have any friends in this new place, and Im quite foreign to it.   
 I wish I could do more to cherish the moment, but Ive done everything I can. As much as I want to stay in the moment, I know that its not perfect, and that I have to keep moving forward.

I’ve been living without any actual friends for about half a year now, and I just wish somebody would actually treat me like a person. The worst part about it is that it’s all my fault. I was a dick to my ex and lashed out towards my friends for no reason, but it’s to late to go back. I could go on forever, but I’m to lazy to type a novel lol.

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

I’m obsessed with one person. I’ve met them four times ever and have been thinking about them non stop for the past two years. Sometimes I feel like I have a marmite personality, divides opinions you know lalala but I’ve never found it so easy to connect with someone I didn’t know. I’ve followed his relationships, fantasised about meeting his ex, poured over their socials and Spotify, Iistened to their playlists, watched his breakup and the fallout and him meeting someone new. Google searched each person keeping track of each of their lives. No matter how many new people I meet I keep coming back to him and his life. I think if he reciprocated these feelings mine would go away. In a way I like that he’s unattainable. But I miss. So very lonely sometimes. 

So yeah that’s me."

lonely,I'm going to end my life if I'm alone again on Valentine's Day,"I'm going to end my life if I'm alone again on Valentine's Day - I know it seems minor or stupid to others. I've been told that. But it's not just this Valentine's Day. It's every one for over 40 years. It's every birthday, every Christmas, every single holiday. I've never been with someone, never had a gift that I didn't buy for myself. If that's what makes you happy, great. For me, it's excruciating. Maybe it's because I'm an extrovert. The loneliness is crushing.

I have been on so many volunteer opportunities, joined so many clubs and groups...and I am always overlooked. People asked me for money and when I made being included a condition of paying for things, I was shut out. I tried social media and was ignored. The only followers I could get were if I bought them. Fake. No one ""real"" wanted to be my friend or DM me or follow me. I've traveled around the world and it was so unbelievably lonely. I've been mugged, robbed, and was beaten into unconsciousness once. That didn't stop me...but not having someone to share it with did. An incredible experience is hollow and empty if it isn't shared with someone special.

I've lived as fully and gone as far as I can alone. The only thing I ever wanted from life was to be loved by a significant other and bear a child. Neither of these things will happen, not for me, not now. So it doesn't ""get better."" No amount of time changes anything. In fact, a lot of things have gotten worse. I'm not going to pretend any of this is acceptable any more. I can't force someone to love me, but I can change it so I don't have to experience it any more.

So I bought a gun. I tied up lose ends. I closed out all my accounts as of the end of the month. No one real will miss me or notice I'm gone. It's not really that comforting to have a hard stop and know when it's coming, but at least I know it is and I won't have to be alone for much longer. That counts for something.

DISCLAIMER: I’m pretty sure this is an obsession/infatuation I have and not a crush because I essentially don’t know anything about this boy besides the number of siblings he has, I met one of them when I met him as well as his mom. I also know he loves sports (soccer especially). This is really embarrassing for me to share in such detail but I feel it’s important to really explain the “depth” of this story and to let go of it with the beginning of the new year and because I’ve never really talked about it with anyone so I thought doing it anonymously would be easier.


PART 1: How We Met/Beginning of Crush

I’ve liked this boy since I was 15/16 yrs old.  (we’re both 22 now). We met when we were around 8-9 via a community held summer program. I wouldn’t see him again until 10th grade. Keep in mind that we barely knew each other and we didn’t go to the same elementary school but same middle and high school (but I didn’t know this until 10th grade because we just never ran into each other during the time period from 6th - 9th grade). 


PART 2: 10th Grade  
~ Disclaimer: This part of the story is kinda all over the place 

We were re-acquainted with one another in the first semester of 10th grade because we had science class together and we just happened to have ended up sitting next to each other (by coincidence, not by seating arrangement or anything). We’d engage in small talk from time to time after he asked me if I remembered how we met the first time which I did (what can I say, I have a good memory lol). 

*Random thing to mention: I’d always have grapes in the class as a snack as it was in the afternoon and I got a little hungry after lunch. He asked for some occasionally and it just became a thing that we’d share the grapes whenever I had some. Also, I had this bracelet (for medical purposes) that I took off sometimes because it was Velcro and it just bothered my skin. I had it since I was about 9 and it was purple with sunflowers on it. He asked was it was for as he picked up one day in class and I told him (although I didn’t like talking it about it that much). He also played with my glasses and their case whenever I needed to wear them when taking notes in class. 

After a couple of weeks in science class, we found out that we also had the same history class with the same teacher that semester but during different periods. So he would help me and my friends who had the class in the afternoon by giving us hints on quizzes and stuff as he had the class in the mornings. It was really cool of him because he really didn’t have to do that. To return the favor, I helped him out in science whenever he’d ask and he once asked me to print his final assignment for a class. A couple of pages needed to be printed in color so he offered to pay me $2 for it but I was totally fine with printing it anyway because it was the least I could do as a favor to him. The next day when we met up, he gave me the money and I didn’t want to take it but we couldn’t “fight” about it for long because we each had class to get to. In the afternoon, when we met up again in science, I put the money on his desk and we started “fighting” about it again and a girl who sat in front on us in class saw this going on when she was walking to her seat. After class, she asked if there was anything going on between us and I said no and she was “shocked” and mentioned that he might like me (that was her observation, she wasn’t friends with him or anything like that). I didn’t take it too seriously though because I honestly didn’t know what she saw that I didn’t. 

Over the semester, I started to develop some feelings for him. Probably because he was the only boy to “interact” with me (although I thought it was just to be nice because what boy would like me?) I told one of my friends that I was interested in him as a joke and she said that it didn’t really make sense and that we didn’t look good together. I brushed it off and just meant that I’d like to get to know him more so we could become friends. Just to comfort my slightly hurt feelings. 

During this time, I would also send him these cringe-inducing emails asking him if we were actually friends or if he talked to me get help with work and such. I then asked if we could talk online sometime (not about school) and if we could hangout for my birthday. He eventually stopped replying to my emails and I kept sending more and more asking him if I could explain myself and take back what I said and for him to forgive me for basically be a f***ing weirdo lol. 

We just stopped talking once the fall semester (Sept - Jan) ended and when the winter semester (Feb - Jun) began, I found out on the first day that we had both English and math together. We sat on opposite ends of the classroom in English class and him and his friends sat 2 rows to the right of me in math. I heard them giggle and make comments that I thought were about me (I have an anxious mind, they probably weren’t even talking about me) in class which made me super uncomfortable and embarrassed for all the things I said to him the previous semester. I just tried to put him and everything that happened behind me until one day (sometime in April/May) he emailed me. 

At the time, he was on our high school’s soccer team. He had missed a math test began of an away game and asked me if I could tell him what was on the test. Him knowing I was “nice” and “helpful”, was the only reason he messaged me because he knew I’d give him the info he needed and I did. I wanted the attention again I guess (whatever that means), I wanted him to talk to me. So I gave him all the info, and then he asked me to download this texting app (because I had an iPod at the time and not a phone) so it’d be easier for us to communicate. I did and over the course of the the semester, we talked solely about Math and English work. 

I kinda realized he was “using” me for help but now I’m hindsight I can’t really say that because I wasn’t forced to do anything I didn’t choose to do. But I would send him review packages, assignments, etc (I sent him an English PowerPoint that his friend basically ended up copying the slides for so our presentations were identical). 


PART 3: 11th &amp; 12th Grade 

Continued to share classes together (required ones and electives). Didn’t talk to each other at all (we would see each other around school though and occasionally exchanged pleasantries) only via text and email because I would send review packages for tests/exams, assignments and so on. We didn’t sit near each other in any of our classes so I didn’t feel as weird sneaking glances during class because of the distance between us. 


PART 4: Post High-School 

Haven’t seen or talked since high school graduation. I’ve stalked him anonymously on social media on and off for the last four years. Until I saw him in person this summer (August) while I was waiting for the bus to go to work. It caught me off guard (although he didn’t see me) because it wasn’t anywhere near where we lived (unless he moved, I’m not sure).

Fast-forward a couple months (late October) and I see him again in the same area, we make eye contact this time. I quickly looked down and when I looked up again we locked eyes again. Neither of us did anything (I don’t know if he even recognized me tbh, not that my appearance has changed much since high school but obviously it’s been over 4 yrs at this point). Luckily there was considerable distance between us. The bus arrived and we got on and that was that. Then I got on the same train car as him on the subway (lol) but on the opposite end sitting with my back towards him (not that he noticed but I did walk to the front of the train when getting off at my stop to get a last glance at him). 

And I haven’t seen him since. However, a week before we saw each other (in Oct),  I received a friend request from him on fb — I don’t have notifications set on the fb app on my phone so I saw this a couple days later when I went on fb on my laptop. 

One week after that friend request — in early November, he waved on fb messenger, I opened the message like an idiot to see if there was an actual written message but there wasn’t so I left the wave because I didn’t know what to say or if I should even wave back hadn’t been on fb in a while since I accepted his friend request about 3 weeks after (mid Nov) he initially sent it. 


CONCLUSION:

If you’ve made it to this point and have anything to share in regards to this story, please feel free (be gentle lol I know this story is really stupid).

Should I just drop this whole narrative from my life and just unfollow him and not bother responding to the “wave” on fb or see if there was any reason behind him sending the friend request in the first place? Tbh, I’m scared that he somehow found on I’ve been stalking him on social media or something and wouldn’t know how to address, while another part of me doesn’t think that since I’ve been on fb for 3 years so it would be random to confront me about it now.

lonely,Don’t know what to do,Don’t know what to do - So basically I don’t really have much friends. I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 4 years now but she kinda wants to take a break because she wants to clear her head of her demons. I went to college with a good friend but later our relationship crumbled because he would talk shit behind my back and make my girlfriend feel weird for even dating me. He turned everyone that we met together on his side so I’m alone. All I do is go to class and sit in my dorm all day.  My girlfriend is thriving which I’m truly happy for her because she’s struggled with making friends for awhile but is getting a lot of connections and people to talk to. I feel like I’m just slowly being set up to coast into isolation. My walls are up because people have done this to me in the past so making friends is hard. Let alone people when they first go into college just wanna party as much as they can and look good for those around them to fit in. Basically turn fake. I have only 3 friends but they are all hours away so I just feel truly alone. I just don’t know what to do because I’m just so tired.

I've been good friends with my cousin for a couple of years now, but the thing is I would always be the one texting first, I would always ask her about her day and always listen to her. When I'm looking for someone to talk to, she's at work, has no data or just busy. I mean, I always listen, when can't you just listen once? why can't you make me feel appreciated or at the very least liked? Is it that hard? I've pointed this out about twice already and she keeps promising to ask about me and give me some attention, but it never lasts more than a few days. Recently I've told her that I can't do this anymore and I don't want her to talk to me ever again except if it is something about our family. She kept begging for another chance and said some bullshit about being busy. One time I texted her and she didn't respond but she had time to post a story and send a voice note to me then immediately delete it, clearly not for me, obviously you had fuckin time to reply with even a few words like ""I'm busy"". I can't take this anymore, I feel empty, used, hated and lonely. I feel very lonely.
This is just one of the multiple things that I have to say, but I just can't type the rest. It's so frustrating and depressing. I just want someone who genuinely cares about me. I'm trying to survive, but it's getting harder. I've been crying myself to sleep for a couple of days now. It's hard. I can't."

Haven't felt this shitty in months. - It's just that spending all this time alone in my bland apartment... just hits me hard in the gut how alone I am. No family to come to, no friends to go out with. I live my work and without it, I'm... nothing.

Today, after a single day of vacation I tried to sneak into work and my boss sent me home. So I took a walk in the city, everyone just walks around me, I'm surrounded by so many people but I'm so isolated at the same time. I tried to strike up a conversation in a coffee shop and nothing, they told me to leave them alone. Sometimes I think that I must be off somehow as if something was missing. I don't feel that way, but it seems to me other people do.

Ever since my parents passed away I have no one real to talk to, no one who would show a genuine interest in me. I dunno... I'm just gonna have to survive this week and get back to work."

I’m 22, soon to be 23 and it becomes to much harder to enjoy yourself and meet new people as time goes on.

I feel like I will also never love again as i’ve been single for nearly 4 years and can’t even make new friends let alone take anyone out or anything.

I’m starting to lose my grip on everything and feel so isolated. I don’t know what to do, I make an effort but also don’t try to make things happen too hard since forcing my way into getting on with people feels wrong. 

Anyone I talk to here and there says they have no friends but constantly have people texting, calling, facetiming and snapchatting them. Not to mention them being in big group chats with friends. 

I have none of that, maybe a few messages exchanged every couple of days with a couple of people. 

Was it just meant to be this way for me? I honestly don’t know what to think or how to feel anymore."

I have friends around me and made some new friends online since I have made Reddit, however I feel so alone most of the time, I try my best to keep in touch with everyone I ever meet but sometimes it gets too much and I become some kind of mental support for them, I don’t mind helping those I can help but sometimes it gets too much to sort out in my own head and the amount of effort it would take to clear my head. Sometimes meeting new people on here is a struggle as well, being Bi some boys my age would think I’m trying to recruit them or something and some girls would go the typical “gay/bi friend” even if I would want to talk to someone a bit older than myself they think I have an alternative motive, which is never my intention, I’m just looking for some kind of connection that would make me feel less lonely and it doesn’t help that I am home alone most of the time, something feels missing and I keep searching but never seem to find it, is it like that for any of you?

lonely,I am trying to improve but I feel like the universe just hates me!,"I am trying to improve but I feel like the universe just hates me! -  

So, this going to be a life story/asking for advice/venting/self hate and confusion.

Also I am not asking for someone to talk to or for a friend. Since I have enough trouble with that in real life as is. I am just looking for advice and help. I need to know if I am doing the right things, if anyone else is feeling the same way, advice as to what to do with my life. 

Also I know it is long but please read through at least some of it before responding.

I am a 17 yo male by the way.

So, I used to be a happy child. I would go outside frequently and talk my neighbors a lot and I was happy and confident. I gained an interest in space and science from reading some of my mom's old teaching books from when she was a teacher. I memorized the order of the planets before kindergarten when most adults didn't know if Mercury or Venus was the closest to the sun. But, when I tried to share my interest and talk to other kids about it most just gave me weird looks and just called me the science kid or space boy. So I was lonely from a young age. Then I went to Elementary which was hell for me. I tried talking to people and making friends but it felt like everyone was disgusted in me and I felt like everyone just hates me. I kept asking myself what's wrong with me, am I doing something wrong and other questions. Alot of times I would seem to make a friend and they would be friendly for a while and they would join everyone else in teasing me and other things. After a year of this I just shut up. I felt like everyone hated me so why even try to make a friend they'll hate me anyway. I did make one friend though if you could call it that in 1st grade. My family wanted me to join cub scouts and me not knowing how to say no just went. I met a kid there, we will just call him Joe. He was nice at first but eventually I figured out he just wanted me for fun. We would play together when we met but every time I tried to talk to him about anything else he just acted like he didn't care. He would also join in with the other kids when I was being teased and what not. But I stuck with Joe and he stuck with me. Then I met one of his ""friends"" from his school (we went to different schools). We will call him Hulse. I don't think Joe was friends with Hulse by choice because of something I will talk about later but Hulse tagged around with Joe to go everywhere. And since Joe was the only friend I had I had to follow suit. Hulse would tease me, make fun of me, and make me look like a fool constantly. He says he was trying to befriend me and maybe he was and I was just taking things to seriously. But all I know is that it felt abusive and Joe would join in with Hulse to do these things. I felt horrible I hated my self I hated my situation and I hated Hulse. But I put up with it. I continued to try and be friends with Joe because I felt like that this was the best I could have, the best I deserved, everyone hates me, at least these people would tolerate me. This continued for years until 5th grade. My family had to move to another house and it just so happened to mean that I would have to go to the same school as Joe and Hulse now. That's when the bullying or abuse or whatever you want to call it became physical. Every day after school we would go to the park to wait for our parents to pick us up. There I got beat to a pulp every day. And you know I almost enjoyed it. During this time I just really hated my self and I was just going with the flow in life. I wasn't really present, whatever happened I didn't care I just went with it. At this time to feel pain was to feel just something for once. Sometimes I would even try and provoke him to beat me I didn't care. Every day I would come home with bruises and soreness everywhere. I didn't care. As this went on my mom found out and tried to reach out to the school to see if they could do something. They already knew of the problem and there solution was the stupidest thing ever. They would reward him in front of the whole school for just about anything. He smiled at a teacher, reward! He picked up his pencil, reward! He lived, reward! They were trying to make him do better things by rewarding him when he did anything that resembled a good behavior but that was stupid and did nothing. This infuriated me but I continued to do nothing, I felt worthless. This continued for a year until middle school. The physical abuse stopped in middle school but not the verbal. Also because of how the elementary school divided up the lunches and recesses I never got to talk to Joe my only friend alone without Hulse. But now in middle school I could and I was excited but not for long. Joe started acting up at home. He refused to go to school and other things. He eventually became home schooled and we drew farther apart. I still don't know why he did this maybe it was Hulse or it was me I don't know. And the sad thing is, is that we were just starting to become better friends. But the universe just hated me and now we don’t talk much if ever. So then for around two years I was just alone, no friends, and no one who wanted to be. It was like that for two years. I didn't know how to make any friends and I didn't know what a real friend was. I also still felt like everyone hated me. Until in 8th grade I met max in class and the class was a small group orientated one so we had to talk. We bonded and grew a friendship and he was kind. And for most of that first year I half expected him to leave me and to grow to hate me like everyone else. But he didn't and to be honest I still am afraid of that but it has been years now. At this time I was starting to feel more self confident and happier in general. Also my interest in space and science started to come back again due to some good teachers. Things were looking up. I was still picked on by Hulse and other kids but at least I had a friend. I was also still isolated, I still felt that most people despised me since any time I tried to talk to anyone they just thought I was annoying or something. So, now 8th grade went by and so did 9th grade. Though max had to change schools early in the year so that leaves me alone again at school but I still hang out with him out side of school. Other than that things were looking okay but then my sophomore year hit me hard. I had a lot of hard classes and I developed an anxiety disorder due to social and work anxiety. All of this then turned into a bowl disorder that was so bad I had to spend hours sometimes on the toilet. This really crushed me. It affected my grades, I had to go into this kind of homeschool but not homeschool program my school had. I would spend days in agony. This really crushed my self confidence and my self esteem. I couldn't hang out with anyone, I couldn't do anything. It was just work, sleep, and being sick. It drained me. After a year of this it got better and I am in 11th grade now. Recently though I have realized how much of a screw up I have been. I have been isolating my self from everyone for most of my life and I want to get back out there and be my self with everyone. Nobody hated me I just hated my self. It also helps that I have a crush on some one to. So, I have tried talking to her and other kids but, I just feel like I act like a nervous reck and I am too afraid to do anything. I don’t know what to do! I also have just recently found out that my crush is moving to florida in the summer and is pansexual and has a girl friend in Tennesse. So great! I just feel like my life is just trash and I keep screwing my self over. I feel like the Universe just hates me first with the friend being a friend of a bully situation, then the move, then Joe being homeschooled, then max changing schools, then my bowl disorder, then the situation with my crush. When is anything going to go right! My life is a mess. How can I not be so shy? What am I supposed to do with my crush? Why can’t I just talk with people? Just why? Help me please! Am I just trash, does the universe really hate me!? What am I supposed to do! Help! I just feel like anything I do is wrong! Maybe I should just end it! Why can’t I talk to people!"

lonely,"Trying to change my life for the better, losing friends because of it...","Trying to change my life for the better, losing friends because of it... - Since about a year I'm trying to improve my life by implementing good habits and getting rid of bad ones. My self discipline was growing for a while and I was optimistic my social life would get better but it got even worse than it already was.

I never had many friends and I didn't really care for most of my life because I had a few really good ones which I valued more than having a lot of surface level friends. One of them I saw almost daily and the others a couple of times a week so loneliness was no real problem then. But recently I moved to a different part of town so I hang out with my friends less and less often. At the same time I tried to stop drinking too much and sleeping more because I've have pfeiffer's syndrom (=extremely low energy levels). Now, when I do see my friends they don't understand it when I drink less than before and go home early. I try to explain but I can see that they think I'm getting boring and they are not interested at all in my new passions.

I also began to spend more time reading, meditating, eating better and working out, this is causing my personality to change, and my friendships with them apparently. I can't connect with them like I used to, I'm not interested in drinking, social media, and partying anymore, I don't want to talk badly about other people anymore so I expected the conversations with my friends a bit but I was shocked to see my friendships are fading because of this.

Can anyone here relate? I want to stand for what I believe but seeing my social life shrink so fast is depressing and it feels like losing myself in a life of drugs and partying is the only thing that can help me regain some of my friendships and create new ones. I just know I can't be the only one dealing with this problem..."

Anyway, I have some and I have no issue with it. The people I know in real life are often boring, so I often prefer spending time with my surrogate friendship groups. I really like when it feels normal and natural, as though these are people who would just be hanging out anyway, they just have a camera on. 

I really want some suggestions for people to check out! Let me know if you feel the same and who you like to watch. 

Some of mine:
I really like battle rap, so The Dirtbag Dan Show and Watch Battles on Ruin your Day are awesome for this.

Baited Podcast, not many episodes but they really have no filter around each other like real friends.

Cx streamers... controversial I know. I don't like or condone their actions, but I'm seeing real, unfiltered craziness that I can relate to, as I was a bit wild in my youth. I wouldn't want to be there but there's something about watching from afar that holds and interest.

I'm on the unusual/ugly side of the physical spectrum, my personality is honestly a bland mishmash of traits perfectly designed to fade me into the background of any social setting, and frankly, I'm pretty damned dumb. 

I've made several attempts throughout my life to change how I am, but it always results in an incredibly awkward aping of legitimately charismatic folk. There is no ""fake it til you make it"" transformation, just a moth pretending to be a butterfly for a few moments.

I guess it's a little bit defeatist to acknowledge it, but I've exhausted so much of my time and energy trying to stand in the light, and each year I only find myself lonelier. I wish I could stop the nagging impulse to be more than myself. 

I wish I could just be comfortable with who I am, even if that happens to be a socially translucent creature."

lonely,phone is always silent,"phone is always silent - am f19 and in university. they say uni is a time to meet new people and make lotsa friends. not for me however. in fact ive never felt more lonely before. i only see my classmates from each module once a week and even if we do talk, its all school related stuff. most of them also come in with their friends so im just sitting alone at one corner the majority of the time. i guess there are outside things i can participate in like signing up for camps and activities but im afraid and intimidated at the thought of huge groups of people coming in with friends already again. generally my whole life ive never been very successful with making friends so i also dont dare to venture too much for fear of failure again. 

online friends are nice yes but they cant alleviate the loneliness like what real life friends can. i hardly receive notifications and messages from people. i dont even think people know i exist in their classes. they say friends become harder to make as u grow older. i wonder if im doomed to a life of social isolation then. in fact i already am lol. i spend all my time sleeping and only waking up to eat. i have no motivation to do anything else. i cant bring myself to do much. in the end my negativity pushes anything remotely good that i could have possibly had the chance to experience, out."

I feel like a job that would better match my attributes, I would need formal education for. I no longer have any friends. My last social circle I decided to leave because I felt I needed to move on for a number of reasons, and it was better to be alone. I still feel like it was the right decision, but I keep feeling the dull ache of loneliness. I have meaningful conversations with my mom, and i generally prefer not to interact with my dad. I dont like my dad. He talks my ear off about depressing stuff and I'm stuck saying ""yeah, yeah, that's crazy, oh wow"". It's hard meeting new people. I met a girl on the bus and I've seen her and chatted with her a bit. I asked her out and she said no. But she seemed to have some admiration for me asking her and how I took the rejection.

Finally after 3 months of going daily to the beach with her I receive a message from her saying:""I love you"", I immediately build my expectations and get hyped up but when I reply to her with a long message stating how much I love her she replies that she doesn't love me and that she sees me as a friend...... My heart was crushed but 15 days later I discover thanks to my best friend (and my only one in that moment) that her sister saw that I liked her so she tricked me into thinking that she loved me just to see what happens......

What is it? Do they see our resentment for other people? Is it that we're unhindered from the rules in a way that makes us dangerous? Maybe our silence and lack of precedent in their local society creates the perfect blank slate for them to project what they fear and loathe within themselves, and things we're all capable of: violence, degeneracy, and cruelty

Maybe they're only cruelly ostracizing an easy target to raise their social standing. They might appear as a ""protector"" who can see the ""wolves"" in sheep's clothing.

lonely,I fell for my best friend. How do I get back up,"I fell for my best friend. How do I get back up - Hello reddit, it seems kind of silly writing like this, asking the advice from literal strangers, but that’s just where I’m at in life right now. So, I have this friend, and I really like her. I can confidently say I have never felt like this about anyone in my life. She’s beautiful, but the thing that makes her the most beautiful is her heart and her mind. I’m not sure if love at first sight is a thing, but if it is, I think I might have found it. I’ve liked her since I met her in the fall. 
Well, there are a few problems here. 
• I have been struggling with my sexuality for years, and we are both girls. I know this shouldn’t really matter, but it’s made it really hard to sort out my feelings for her. At first, I didn’t know/ didn’t want to accept that my feelings were romantic. She is bisexual as well, but she is a lot more secure in her sexuality
•she is my absolute best friend I have met at college. And she lives right across the hallway from me. So if something were to go wrong with me confessing my feelings, it would make for a pretty awkward time for the rest of the semester. 
•I have another friend who told me she likes her as well, and I didn’t tell this friend that I like her because I wasn’t entirely sure of my feelings at the time. So now I don’t know how to tell this friend that we like the same person without betraying her trust
• last week, someone asked her out. The hard thing is, I was planning on telling her my feelings last week. But I know I can’t now. I see how excited she is about this girl and the date went really well. I feel so physically sad in a way I haven’t felt in such a long time that I can’t really stand to be around her for long anymore because it just hurts. 
• I am a total hypocrite because I have been on a few dates trying to find someone-anyone- else because I am so ashamed of my own feelings. So she truly has no idea
What should I do? I feel like I can’t tell her now, but I am hurting so badly and so deeply that I feel like I can’t keep this to myself anymore. How do I tell my friend we like the same person? How do I deal with the pain of her possibly getting a new girlfriend while I silently suffer? How do I continue to be a friend?
Thank you for reading this to the end, I truly hope someone can give me some insight."
lonely,"""Loved"" but lonely","""Loved"" but lonely - I have a supportive family and friend group, but I've never dated. Sometimes, i feel distant with my parents, and I'll end up spending all of my freetime in my room. Alone. I have close friends who share the same interests and tend to put a smile on my face, but it seems like they turn a blind eye when i am depressed or dont talk as much (i can be a social butterfly at times). I feel like i have no one to turn to, who i can talk to, who really and truly cares about what i have to say (so here i am venting to complete strangers on reddit). As i said, I've never dated, and that's not necessarily a choice i make. I just want someone who understands me and actually wants me,  someone i can cuddle with or at least hug them when i need it the most."

Why? - I have tried multiple times to make close friends with the methods above. I even have most ask for my name, and state “well, Smiddi’s my friend too” and the others agree that I’m one of them; but it ends there. I never hear from them beyond our original meeting (usually a common class), and they talk about hanging out together elsewhere.

The only people I have ever “loved” have been abusers. I gravitate towards toxicity. I feel like  I deserve it. I feel damaged. Dirty. 

My current guy best friend is my new infatuation. We both love each other, but he loves me as a friend. I feel like something is objectively wrong with me. No one has ever been sexually attracted to me, unless their intention was to abuse me.

lonely,What if I’m part of some secret government experiment to test the effects of social isolation?,"What if I’m part of some secret government experiment to test the effects of social isolation? - 
Think about it. Every time I’m at a social event or activity, everybody stays away from me. I’ve noticed this every time. 

What if I’m part of some new MK Ultra experiment? What if the government wants to know how social isolation can effect someone at birth. That must be the reason right? 

I mean why is it that nobody every comes to me to say hi. Why is it that I never get at least a smile from someone? Something feels off. I go to these social events and everyone has found their own groups and friends. Why is it that I have to be the loner? Why me? Did I seriously lose the lottery or something? I don’t understand what’s wrong with me? 

Should I just die and end the experiment? Maybe that’ll give them the idea? That’ll show them what happens. I mean what else can I really do? Someone help me find a way out :("

lonely,Where can I start to improve myself?,"Where can I start to improve myself? - I'm a male about to be 17 next month and I've never dated anyone before. I live in a small county with not too many people and there is many people at my school I've taken interest in. The only time I did like a girl, I tried to ask her out which took a lot of courage but she did not like me the same way. It hit me hard at first because I thought about her everyday for months but now I'm alright thankfully. We are still good friends at least. Anyways, my loneliness is getting in the way of my grades. Everyday I get home I'm tired from the school work and want to relax, knowing I have homework to so. I play video games when I get home so I can distract myself and forget I'm lonely and relationships exist. It helps, but even when I do try to do my homework, I have no motivation to even do it from thinking about how lonely I am and I zone out and get distracted easily. This also causes stress from knowing I have homework to do and not doing it, which also makes my acne bad and lowers my self-esteem a bit. I also get anxiety in classes and bite my nails a lot and I cant stop the habit. I also do it when my hands are not doing anything.  I just don't know where I can start with improving myself. I also have a lot on my mind that is going to happen eventually like learning to drive, getting a job, and thinking about what I want to do for a living and I dont even know. I've thought about how a pet could help me cope but my parents do not want a pet at all. We only had a pet when I was to young to remember anything. I dont think a psychiatrist is for me, it causes me stress and anxiety just thinking about it. Anything you say will help, thank you for reading."
lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

I work full time on weekdays and am a fairly relaxed, introverted person. However, I like partying and getting coffee and food and drinks and dancing and hiking and shopping, going to the park you name it! Into comedy, shows, movies, people watching, very much just down for whatever! I have a dog! Not looking for ANYTHING romantic or sexual, genuinely facing a need for friends. 

Please hit me up if you’re in Vegas and would be interested in maybe being friends?? I know this is so abnormal but I’m used to being a social person and it’s getting pretty miserable having not a single friend at 22 years old. Might as well try Reddit.

I know my ex will most likely be doing something. And I know that I wont be doing shit, just like the last three years. I just want the loneliness to end. I want to find someone who really loves me.

It's been 5 months since my world flipped upside down and today was the first time I cried. A guttural release. A ring me out &amp; hang me up to dry kinda cry. It didn't stop.....And I didn't want it to stop. It felt so good to be so sad. How fucked up is that? There were times I gasped for air and secretly wished there was none left. But alas, here I am. To cry another day........
Will it ever be enough? Will I ever be enough? When is enough actually enough? So many questions with very little answers. Or so many answers with not enough questioning. Either way, here I am. Stuck in the middle. Monkey business as usual."

when will it be my turn...?

i mean...i deserve to be loved too...dont i?

i deserve to be happy too...dont i?

i always think about it...and its tiring me out, i try to distract myself but in the end my mind just goes back to ""when will i find someone who loves me too? when will i be happy too?""...sometimes, it just tires me, i wish i could be happy without someone but...i cant

i wish i could have someone that loves me too, like everyone else does, then i wouldnt be alone, then i'd have someone to draw for hours and hours, then i'd have someone to sing with, someone to watch movies with, someone to just go out with and see where that leads us to, someone...someone that reminds me that maybe everything its not so bad, i'd have someone who reminds me that i am lovable, and that he'll be there when i need it

i wish there was a guy who loved me here

but in the end, its all just a dream

who could ever love me?

im just me..."

I found out through Instagram she was with someone else. The pain I felt to see her kissing someone else, the way she kissed me, the thought of her in bed with another man... I can't even describe. I've handled loss fairly well in the past, but losing her almost destroyed me. I miss having someone eager to see me at the end of the day, I miss falling asleep next to the person I loved with all my heart. I wanted her to be mine forever. Now she's gone, and I'll probably never see her again. I just want my best friend back."

lonely,Will intend to have an intimate partner. Will never trust them. Advice?,"Will intend to have an intimate partner. Will never trust them. Advice? - I (34M) mean to leave the house and then have a summer fling as practice for a geniune LTR with a citizen of the destination country in the destination country. I have abusive parents, so I will probably never trust any table mate, bedmate nor housemate ever again. I have sporadic hemiplegic migraines, and in the resulting tinius, I can hear an intimate partner screaming. My tinius sounds like the gas turbine engines on air vehicles. I can hear them asking questions, about to use answers against me, and I can hear them Exploding at me everyday. I can see and hear me attempting to start to trust my partner, and it going over lamely and only making things worse. The only time I ever have sexual fantasies is when I'm masturbating. In my imagination, I see them committing unredditable offenses here in the United States of America, and over there, I can see them committing unredditable offences. I can see my settlement burning. When I close my eyes, not only can I see the computer game as not real, but other times I see its events happening as real, at the hands of an intimate partner. The game of which I speak is said to be highly realistic simulation. Usually when something turns me off, it's this.

And I'm not blameless as well, for I would make a useless piece of s*** as an intimate partner. I'm not sure I can f*** properly. It's not that my penis is too small, I just don't know if I can do it. During arguments, I'm not sure what I'll say, and I'm not sure if it's redditable. I keep telling myself, don't compare yourself to others, but I do it anyway. I'm pudgy, and I have Asperger's.

Reddit often tells me to get therapy, but my migraines are from an outpatient commitment and involuntary commitment. Clozapine is poison, and is not effective as an antipsychotic. Therapy is not an option, so my plan is to get an FWB, instead of a therapist. Successful relationships are all based on trust, not respect, admiration, and fear. Then my plan would succeed is unthinkable, but I'm going to attempt it anyway. I'm not looking for a fight, but I know I'll find not much else. What I really want to do is die of non-preventable natural causes tonight. All my plans are contingency plans in case nature continues to fail, which it has done for months or years on end.

I think I'm on the right subreddit."
lonely,Tell me about yourself,"Tell me about yourself - I think being lonely has led me to think about things more, be more thankful, and learn more about myself (if that makes sense). I’m a teenager but I have a mature mindset. I have a best friend who lives in another state. I have friends at school but they all have other friends and don’t text me much outside of school. So, at school I make the most of it being funny/crazy one of the group. I mean that’s still my personality but no one realizes how mature I actually am. My relationship with my parents is complicated and I’m an only child so that makes it worse. But I wouldn’t change my life, my experiences made me who I am. I was really depressed last year and the beginning of this year but I’ve recently been feeling better and trying to motivate myself. All that changed was that I realized it’s up to myself to change my life, so I slowly am."

lonely,Ranting,"Ranting - Loneliness has always been something weird to me.
I have friends, I have family.. but still I feel lonely. 
It’s always there, has always been there.
Even though I have actual people in my life.. it just seems like they don’t understand me. 
Like I’m from another dimension.
Maybe that’s why? I feel lonely because I don’t feel understood? 
I don’t even know..
Never have I ever met someone who.. just.. *understood*
Except once.
I have met one person in my entire life who was able to take that feeling away.
But being around them hurts me in other ways.. it hurts so much that it’s become unbearable for me..
I have become so addicted to them that it’s absolutely unhealthy at this point. 
I hate this. I hate myself for being and feeling like this.
All I want is to not be dependent on that person anymore.
But I fear the loneliness too much to break contact with them.
I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place.
I just don’t know what to do anymore.
And i know that I shouldn’t complain. 
At least I have what I have.

At one point I was talking to her about how I was depressed (from loneliness), and she shared how her social life wasn't ideal either. I felt like this was an oppurtunity, for two people in similar emotional boats, to hangout. I asked her if she wanted to hangout (platonically), and she said yes and that she looked forward to it. I was pretty excited about this, finally I was getting somewhere! I mentally set really high expectations, I thought we would get lunch, have great rapport, talk for hours and get closer to each other. But when the day came, she showed up late and  looked really tired. She explained that she had stayed up till 4 am the night before, ""doing nothing."" So we got lunch, and we talked for maybe 45 minutes where she was barely awake, and then she said ""Alright, I'm gonna go take a nap,"" and left. And that was it. Basically zero effort on her part to connect with me, and I'm emotionally crushed because I let my guard down. I usually keep my expectations in check but I fucked up and now feel so shit that I can't even eat."

Basically for a while now I have just felt this immense sadness, dont enjoy things I use to (such as gaming), i even booked my first ever trip abroad yesterday and cant even get excited for that because of this lingering I dont care about life attitude.

I just want to be happy but have just lost all enjoyment in life, I even started doing things that are quite out of character for me. Another issue I'm having is I'm getting hurt a lot because I attach to absolutely anyone who gives me the slightest but of attention and usually these are bad people which doenst help matters at all. I have recently felt like crying a lot and just cba for anything anymore, like it's not healthy to attach to any person I meet.

I risked my job for a collegue who threw it all back in my face, I sometimes feel like I'm bullied at work and honestly I just cant cope no more, I see a therapist every Friday who I briefly mentioned this but nothing in depth. 

I came across the term high functioning depression recently and just wanted to know does anyone know much about it. Thanks for reading."

lonely,The only connection I had to a highschool buddy told me it is inappropriate I'm asking about him.,"The only connection I had to a highschool buddy told me it is inappropriate I'm asking about him. - Ok so long story here. My old highschool friend that I once in awhile Facebook stalk posted publicly that his wife was looking for story submissions about mental health stuff. This was back around Thanksgiving. I wanted to tell her about my autisim and how I fell that screwed me over with my friend back in the day due to the fact I have poor communication skills. I emailed her about once a week with updates on my story, a few edits and some encouraging words because she mentioned she was going through a depressive episode.

I just emailed her yesterday saying that I wasn't sure if she was mad at me or maybe her husband was (he has been before). She basically told me I was disrespecting her, her husband and that I was being emotionally manipulative. She also claimed that I had told her multiple times in emails that I wouldn't contact her (I tried to read the emails I had sent and most of the ending of my letters were that I wish her luck or that I might be too busy to reply to her edit suggestions (which she only sent one email with suggestions in it from my memory) due to a new job) even though I don't recall saying ""I won't email you anymore"". I told my husband about this email and asked him what I should do. He first recommended not responding which I have done as well as joining this here Reddit because he believes I'm lonely. 

I have had problems in the past where I've thought getting a dog or an animal would help me not be lonely but it didn't really help. I mentioned to my husband that one thing that seems to help is to go on a walk. It is still winter where I live though so it is miserable outside. 

As a side note, my current boss reminds me of my highschool friend and yesterday I got very close to his face and said ""you're cool"". I asked my husband if he feels this was inappropriate and he said no, and that if it was my boss would tell me.

I have a difficult time making friends. I've been trying to do what I can in some cases with being healthy as I've been going to the Dr (thus far there's nothing wrong physically with me but tomorrow I go to test my hormones which I believe is the true problem). I know I need to loose weight but I have been lazy.

Anyway, TLDR: my highschool friend's wife told me that I'm emotionally manipulative and I still wish I could have my highschool friend as a friend."

Growing up when people found out I was interested in a person romantically it was considered ridiculous and I was made fun of. I'm trying to accept that no one will be ever interested in me, but deep inside I crave it, whether I like it or not. I always got obsessed with other people's relationships (like my ships) because it was the only way I could ever release that emotion. I wish I could just get over it."

But what’s the next thing then that’s gonna bother me?  I remember thinking about school shooters in the past. Jesus this is just tiring. The elementary school one I won’t understand but for the high school ones, if these people really felt like everything is against them and if they dread people and feel like they’re making a fool of themselves for something so simple as walking in public. If they felt those feeling that I feel, then I could understanding putting a gun next to a random students face. Hell when I’m bored I think about it. But if I had a gun I won’t do it cause why would I kill the people that actually enjoy life? If anything I’d just like to feel the cold barrel in my own mouth and pull the trigger.

The time of year for those more fortunate than us to spend time and show each others love for their S.O. or for us, a kick in the schlong. If there is one thing I remember about Valentine's Day, it's not the Massacre of Saint Valentines Day or The Saint himself died on the 14th of February. But what my Finance teacher said 

*Valentine's Day is a ridiculous holiday.  One day out of 365 to show your partner or significant other that you love and care about them? You should show them you love and care about them 24/7, 365 as long as you're with them. Every day should be Valentine's Day * probably the most wise thing he's ever said. The guy named his kids after two Atlanta Braves pitchers.

Anyways, most of us on here are probably single. If anybody girl or guy (although I'm straight,  but don't worry,  I'm not one to discriminate,  I just don't want to make it sound like I'm hitting on you.) wants me to talk to them through most of the day, it can be casual or flirty, doesn't matter.

My friends (including she who posted on insta) are kinda shitty and don't talk to me or suggest we do something if I dont do it first. And even when I suggest something or want to talk they barely engage at all and DO NOT prioritize our friendship. 

So earlier today one of these friends, let's call her B, posted on insta stories that she wish she was someones priority. The truth is that alot of people hang out with her often and I know for a fact that our friend T prioritize her alot. 

I got really pissed when she posted it since she doesn't prioritize our friendship at all but want other people to do that for her. For a moment I really wanted to post the same thing on my story. 

Do I overreact or do I have the right to be mad?

I dont want to go up to countless women to try and build a connection out of nothing, I look for signs they might like me and then go from there. Not really working when I'm not getting interest.

lonely,Loneliness = Depression,"Loneliness = Depression - Most people see me and ask why I feel the way I do. They ask why I'm lonely and why I'm so down and depressed. The answer I give them is because I'm just not happy. Not in my professional life nor my personal life. I feel as if I have nobody to share my deepest thoughts with or anyone to lean on when times are troublesome. The things that bring me down are not things that bring others down and people dont understand that. I feel so empty, so lonely and it leads me to pushing people away and isolating myself. It's not that I want to be alone it's that I'm the only one who cares about what's bothering me. The isolation then leads to feelings of disparity, it leads to feelings of self doubt and unworthiness thus leading to depression. The signs are clear yet nobody notices. Nobody offers a helping hand or shoulder to lean on. The world continues to turn as I sit still, looking for a way to merge back onto that highway of endless twists and turns. For the time being, I'll continue to sit and watch. I'll continue to take in my surroundings alone.

lonely,You know what can’t stand hearing? “You’ll find someone”.,"You know what can’t stand hearing? “You’ll find someone”. - You don’t know that. What evidence do you have to base your claims on? Sometimes life just deals you a shit hand and you just have to deal with it. But I know that life isn’t over and there’s still more time so I hold onto hope. Against all reason I hope. Every day I hold on, waiting for things to get better but they don’t, but that doesn’t change the fact that I will keep on going. I don’t want to die because if the future does hold happiness for me, I don’t want to miss out on that. I hope that I will find someone who I love and who loves me back just as much. I hope I find purpose in my life. I hope I will be happy one day. But that’s all it is. Hope. I don’t know for certain that things will get better and you don’t either so stop pretending like you do."
lonely,"Low energy, low self worth, and maladaptive daydreaming.","Low energy, low self worth, and maladaptive daydreaming. - So I'm stressed. I really should be preoccupying all my time with studying for the mcat since the test date is beginning to approach 04-24. But I cant seem to muster up the energy to learn all the material..
I'm horrible at most of the subjects, and after studying for hours, I still dont feel any smarter than I did before. This really impacts my self worth and sometimes I feel like giving up.
I try to keep myself on a strict schedule which includes drinking water times and exercise times (just to keep myself in the present).
This past week I didnt manage to accomplish anything.
A big problem is that I also tend to participate in an unhealthy amount of maladaptive daydreaming where I'm successful with designing video games, cartoons, and comics. It's funny because I have so many ideas, but I cant even put forth the effort to put it on paper or even draw. I rather day dream about it since it goes so much faster than the real process (however I do this for hours..)
I hate it because it means im lazy/worthless because I dont end up producing anything."
lonely,Framing loneliness in my sabatical year,"Framing loneliness in my sabatical year - First post here so bare with me.
On basic information I can say I'm a Mexican 19M that just finished high school, right now I'm on a sabatical year as an AuPair at Milano, Italy learning Italian before going back to Mexico to study international businesses.
I wanted to write here as although I established some goals that I've accomplished and others that I ended up leaving aside to let other great activities take their place,at the time before coming here I didn't consider the mentality and overall attitude I would have on loneliness.
I'm not overly sad or anything, but I would be lying if I didn't admit I haven't been this alone before. Emotions can sometimes be as roller coasters depending on the day and are several hours I spend alone, more than I think I ever did back in Mexico.
I'm asking for your advice on the mindset I should take to make this a enjoyful experience and one that I'm sure can get to be very positive for my present and my future."
lonely,I feel broken.,"I feel broken. - The last half of last year was a very painful movement in my life. My SO left me after five years under the context of she needed a little space, which ended up ghosting me, lying to me, and being with someone else. I was destroyed! I started recovering, getting healthy, healthy body healthy mind. When I started to get my energy back after months of crying and almost losing my job, she opens up how badly she messed up. For the first time she actually talked to me about her problems with overlaying them on top of mine. A huge issue we always had. I listened and I said I forgave her, but deep down I knew I didn't, how could I right then. I was just relieved in the moment I didn't feel so alone beside her.
Fast forward month half give or take a week and I'm seeing everything for what it really was. She can say she loves me, she can say all these things, but I never felt so alone in my life now! She barely wanted to touch me, kiss me, anything that felt physical love, was gone. She lies to her family about me, same to her friends. Then she lies about who she hangs out with. I feel so ashamed for letting myself be treated this way. At this moment I am broken. I'm searching for my head for any emotion I can find but I'm so exhausted I cant make out what is what in there. I'm looking for a single shed of tear to relieve myself but I'm vacant. How can I fuck up this badly..."
lonely,Fear of being alone/belittled,"Fear of being alone/belittled - Hello all, just joined up.
Recently was left in an on and off relationship in North Carolina. Going to head home to Boston for a year or so to get my crap right, I get the same advice from all my friends “you need to be alone/learn to be alone”
But I know where my mind goes when I’m alone and it never seems to work for me.

I recently turned 31, a male in fairy good health but I get suckered into the arms usually of a “strong woman “ and get belittled in the long run. I know that not pursuing women may be my best interest but I long for good conversation and to be held. I also don’t want to eventually be stepped on either. What should I do?"

lonely,Am I royally fucked?,"Am I royally fucked? - People say that be happy and focus with yourself and the right person will come at the right time. Right now I am (fairly) happy with being alone and try to focus on improving myself. I'm smart and funny according to my friends but I'm kinda bad at socializing with anyone outside my circle.

Now I think that being happy and focusing on myself won't really help much here. I'm a guy and I'm only 4'8-4'9/150cm-ish. Would any girl really date a guy shorter than her? So at times I think why even try at all, why am I happy if I'll end up alone? So I feel lonely and depressed again some days. Though the being happy and focus on yourself thing really help in distracting me from those thoughts and it's nice that I am actually improving myself on academics/work and just being busy alone lately."

But the relationship with the other guy wasn't just a thing and she lied about that. She was getting really close to me and not just as friends. Then I ask her friend ""who does she want more me or him."" Her friend said she wants him. I ask the girl again did you mean what you said when you told me you would choose me over him. She said yeah. Again another lie. I said do you really have to lie to me. She didn't respond. (All of this was on snapchat.) So I have proof."

lonely,How can I be content in being alone but still lonely at the same time,"How can I be content in being alone but still lonely at the same time - A few days ago, I realised something. I’ve always really liked all the little and big things I have with myself, and I really enjoy time alone and the freedom to be as I am without having to put on a profile, as most people inevitably do with others. Not to deceive or be something one isn’t, but to be on a common wavelenght and ve able to communicate.
But being by myself, I don’t have to explain myself and can fully engage in and enjoy what I do and talk to myself.

But still, I feel lonely.

I recently understood that it has to do with not really being able to share the joys of doing things by myself, because then I’m not by myself. I have the same loneliness when in groups of people too, but generally notice it less. I just wish I could split up so I could be alone together."

I've never felt this way before i want to break up but also hoping something might change if I give it a chance. Just tired of feeling unwanted.

lonely,I think I need Help but my so called „Friends“ are saying that this can’t be true,"I think I need Help but my so called „Friends“ are saying that this can’t be true - Hello Redditors since I have no one to talk to i guess I will try it here.

I think u guys need some backstory on this :

About a 2 years ago I had a girlfriend which I loved very very much even to this date and I was always the type of guy who would tell her everything.
So after 7-8 Months i found out that she was cheating on me with some other good looking dude( I for myself thought „man I’m lucky to have such a gf bc I’m not the most handsome dude she knows“) after I found out that she cheated on me I confronted her with it and the moment I start to talk about it she immediately tells me thinks like „if you would look better we wouldn’t have this problem“ or „ if you had a bigger dick anything would be different“ and some other shit about my personality and weird stuff too but I don’t really feel that well to write about everything.
Of course i know that those things are just not worth to think about bc it’s unreasonable to act like i could do anything about the size of my Penis. 
But the hardest part was that she had a new bf 2 days after we broke up and told everyone at our school fucked up shit in never did( I wasn’t the most popular person at school and had not that many people  I would call „friends“ while she was popular with everyone so obviously everyone believed her which still haunts me when I try to get in contact with people I knew from school) so after like a week i lost all my so called „friends“ and was an outsider who couldn’t really go to school anymore without getting bullied.  At this time i realized that something was changing i went from being a really cheerfull guy to a kinda cold hearted person and i hoped i could talk to my new „friends“

Now to the actual post sorry guys:


So basically I was tripping really hard a couple days ago and for more than 1 year I always feel empty and whenever I try to talk to someone about what happened to me 2 years ago they just tell me „ I’m sorry but I’m really not in the mood rn“ or some excuses which basiclly tells me that they just don’t care. 
I have some serious trust Issuis and can’t really tell anyone how I feel it is at this point that I don’t go out anymore I only smoke weed and take Cocain and pills to atleadt have a glimpse of „happines“
But at the same time i noticed that this shit is fucking me up I get really annoying ticks like cracking my finger whenever I can or lock doors more than once bc i just can’t be sure anymore.

At this point i think I just need someone that listens and gets my point of view someone I can let all my feelings out even though it’s hard...


Im sorry for the Long Post and i Hope all of you have a Good day 
PS: Sorry for the bad English“"

“How does the story end?”

Something as simple as not knowing how a story, any story, ends can be something that pushes me to keep going to find out. Curiosity is a good motivator because whatever the ending is, I want to see it. 

Some days I wonder, “How does my story end?”. I want to see it through because whatever the pain and suffering, I still want to see it through. I may or may not have a happy end, I may be alone in the crowd and without any real connections around me; but it may change. Whether I am active or passive, the story will continue. The show must go on.

We stayed in the same hotel, took Uber together, constantly texted each other, and would hang out in the evenings after our work training.

It felt nice... For the first time ever, I didn't feel lonely and depressed, and I had someone there by my side... I guess that's what normal people in relationships get to experience... having that friend / SO by their side all of the time. 

And now I'm back home... same city, same routine... where I have no friends, no girlfriend, no nothing. It's really sad, but I kind of almost wish that I could re-live last week."
lonely,I just lost one of the only two friends I have.,"I just lost one of the only two friends I have. - I didn't have friends until i went to college because i was bullied a lot and hence i was very short-tempered.

I finished my college last year and for the whole 3 years, i had just 4-5 people with whom i used to hang out but i actually had just 2 friends. One of them is a girl and she is the only one who understands me, can actually help me become better and I lost her 2 days ago.

No one in the world understands me, not even my mom but i met this girl and we eventually became friends and very close ones, talking almost daily for about 30-40min and as soon as college was over, the conversation disappeared, although i was working in my family business and she is preparing for post graduate exam and has plenty of time, she still never picks my calls, almost never returns them, sees my texts 3-4 days after i send them.

So i became scared that i would lose the only person in the world that gets me and panicked. I became possessive, started assuming things etc. and almost broke our friendship.

Then i came clean to her that how much she means to me and we had a good chat. It went good for a week and then we again talked on the phone and i expressed to her about how my life is going and stressed on my cousin (i was jealous) and still we had a good chat.

then the next day i called her and she didnt pick up, didnt see my texts for 2-3 days and then again, sent me this text ""i am sorry but i cannot listen to you obsessing over your cousin"".

i was shattered and still thought that it was my mistake and apologized and I promised myself that i would not talk about the problems in my life with her just so that our friendship doesn't break.

yesterday i again went clean and told her that how she's one of the two people i care about and it breaks me when you dont return calls or see my texts, i have become angry and i havent been considering your part as well and apologized.

she replied 3-4 hrs after saying that i have always been like that and i have said these things to her before but i have never changed. I dont have the will to change.

this text really broke me up and for the first time in about 2 weeks, i cried like a baby.

I finally find someone who gets me in the world and i lost her.

I really dont think, i can go any further now. If you have read this message then thank you very much, it means a lot."

For now all i can do is not-so-secretly sploosh in the presence of men over 6'3"" who look like they might be able to have their way with me

But i will say...
There IS the benefit of tiny attractive girls falling in love with me who make me question my sexuality sometimes lol.

lonely,My girlfriend broke up with me via email just a while ago and it hurts. And I now regret opening myself up for her in the first place. I should've stayed alone and lonely.,"My girlfriend broke up with me via email just a while ago and it hurts. And I now regret opening myself up for her in the first place. I should've stayed alone and lonely. - First, a little context. Back in Christmas of 2019, I went through this phase of this girl that I was dating suddenly ghosting me and at the same time another girl whom I confessed my feelings for didn't reciprocate.

&amp;#x200B;

That hurt me so much. And what pained me more is that at past thirty I'm still unable to have a sustainable, meaningful, romantic relationship. So I decided to close off from the world and start to learn to accept loneliness as the standard of my life. I deactivated all my social media accounts, starting to hang out less with my friends (that even though I was happy with them, they were always with their partners which caused me to feel envious) and just started to learn how to live alone. I've resigned to the idea of just hooking up with random girls instead of finding a meaningful relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one time, on Bumble, I met this girl who I thought I'd just hook up with. But when we met, we had so much in common and there was a strong connection. Long story short, we decided to start dating as boyfriend and girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

There I was, for the first time in my entire life that I felt loved in a romantic sense in my whole life. I slowly opened myself up again, shared my life with her. I was happy. I thought that I don't need to be alone, that here it is, someone that would love me for who I am. And this is hard for someone as I am the type of person who'd always not filter the stuff out of my mouth so there would be moments that I would say things that hurt people, even if I thought they were in jest. That's another reason why I wanted to close myself off from the world as I don't want to hurt others as well as hurt myself.

&amp;#x200B;

And I did tell her that could happen and anytime I'd do that, she'd call me out instantly.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything went along smoothly for six months, or so I thought. Then suddenly I received an email from her saying that she's ending things between the two of us. And all the listed reasons in this well-composed email were because I'd have moments of saying things that hurt her. This is one of the problems we had as a couple since she wouldn't call me out instantly and instead send me a message once we're apart telling me of the hurtful things I'd say in front of her. And I do apologize, of course. But yeah, that's my fault.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am again. A year after I decided to close myself off from the world and in retrospect thinking that maybe I shouldn't pursued the relationship in the first place. I really loved this woman. I wanted to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her. But after one email and then blocking me off from her phone to all her messaging accounts it's all over. I'm all alone again.

&amp;#x200B;

It sucks because none of my friends truly understand what I'm going through. I don't think they'll ever understand since most of them are in happy, long-term relationships. So I decided to write this reddit post just as a shout towards the world with the faint hope that somebody would understand me.

&amp;#x200B;

I do miss my (now ex) girlfriend. I loved her with everything I had. And that's on me. There's always going to be a chance that I'll be hurting her and others in the process. And that's what happened. Right now I feel that I shouldn't have ever been in that relationship in the first place. I should've resigned to the idea that I should just stay alone for the sake of myself and others. But it hurts, it really hurts.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'll have to learn how to accept being alone and lonely all over again, to find the walls that I broke when I decided to love my ex-girlfriend and build it up again. It's like a recovering alcoholic, I guess. I'm going back after getting drunk on love and affection and hurting myself and others. But today is day one. I have to start all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

For you, dear reader, thank you for the time. That's all I wanted, that someone sees this."
lonely,My life has turned to shit and I have no future,"My life has turned to shit and I have no future - I’ve been doing cyber school for the past two weeks because I had zero friends at my old high school. What’s worse is that it was all boys. The main reason I left was because of my anxiety and depression on top of having no friends and being seen as one of the “weird kids” only because I was quiet. I also was very suicidal but not as much anymore. 

In middle school everything went great for me. I had a small friend group and even a girlfriend in 8th grade. Now I’m 16 and haven’t talked to a girl since middle school. I’m not even joking I haven’t spoken a single word to a female my age. I haven’t even had the opportunity. My social anxiety has really made everything so difficult. It’s crazy to think how fast things in life can change.

I went to a different high school than all of my friends so naturally (I guess) we stopped talking to each other. Now I have no friends and I’m  isolated due to cyber school. I don’t see myself making friends in the future. I probably won’t go to college because sharing a dorm with someone is something I don’t think I could handle. The only chance I have at making friends is going to a coed school for my junior year but I’m really liking cyber school tbh. No presentations or reading in front of the class is really nice. What’s not nice is that my day consists of doing my school work which takes like 2 hours, watching youtube for the entire day while eating unhealthy food, checking Instagram to see everyone else having a fun time, going to bed crying, and repeat. 

The only thing holding me back from jumping off a bridge is not knowing what happens when I die. What if heavens not real. What if I kill myself and I just sit in darkness for eternity? I remember a few years  ago I read the book heaven is for real. I’m just waiting for God to send an angel to give me a tour of heaven or some shit just so I know it’s real. I’m don’t even know if this makes any sense. I just don’t know what to do anymore."
lonely,Hated in high school,"Hated in high school - I was the quiet kid that nobody really noticed. I went to private schools, so I was with different groups of people for elementary, middle, and high school as where I'm from you don't stay with the same people for all 13 years. In elementary and middle school I was super loud and outgoing, until the girls in my class started calling me \*annoying\*, \*obnoxious\*, \*a waste of oxygen\*, etc. When high school started, I stopped talking and stopped participating in anything - which I regret so much. It wasn't until the end that I started to make friends, and when that happened I was happy for the first time in a long time. The problem was is that just before senior year began we all started fighting and the group took the side of the more popular girl and started ganging up on me. Rumors were spread and I had to leave to a new school where I knew no one and I was alone. I graduated with a class of strangers. Fast forward to a little over a year later, and here I am. Alone. I haven't made friends and I spend all my days alone either at home sleeping or doing homework. I rarely leave the house anymore, and it's just sad. It really feels like this is the way it's going to stay and that I am going to be by myself forever. I have no siblings and no extended family. It's just me, all the time.

Life is a lonely thing..."
lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."
lonely,I just feel worthless.,"I just feel worthless. - It doesn’t matter if I’m feeling happy or sad. In fact, everything has been going so good for me lately. Landed a job I’m liking a lot, I’m finally going to the gym, keeping myself occupied, I’m getting organized and trying to discipline myself better. 

STILL, my internal feelings for myself never go away. I never feel good enough, I feel like I’m a completely awful human being masquerading as something I’m not. I have no identity, everything is a blur. I feel invisible everyday yet somehow it doesn’t depress me anymore. Like I’m perfectly fine right now, it’s all internalized, it’s like I’m trying to be so busy that those feelings don’t come back. 

I really don’t feel like I matter to anyone and that if I died tomorrow no one would really care. YET, I still just get up everyday, I go to work, I do my thing, I am content with it. I try hard to not let it sink in, but it’s always there. I constantly feel like I’m a failure and shouldn’t be here anymore and yet I just keep going, idk why. 

I’m not depressed, just constantly overthinking myself into these shit feelings that I hate. I can’t enjoy what I do because in my head all I think is “why do you even try? You’re not good at anything, you’re a failure, you should probably kill yourself.”

And people mostly ignore you on social media which also sucks. I think it doesn't help that I watch a lot of TV/YouTube and seeing those people go out with their friends and liveing life. It just makes me wonder if I'll ever have that, instead of being a ""consensual prisoner (yes ik very 14 year old deep)"" in my room doing nothing but schoolwork or playing video games. I feel the only way I feel better is if i try ( BIG emphasis on try) to be funny cuz i guess it's the only thing I have left that doesn't make feel depressed. Fingers crossed that it gets better for all of us.

I’m a 23 year old guy and moved to a new city halfway across the country in 2018 when I graduated college to start my new job. I have made some good friends here but I have never felt this lonely before. Surprisingly, I’ve been socializing more than ever before and I go out at least once a week and the feeling of independence feels great. However, because I live alone I just feel really empty and I get depressed sometimes. I think this stems from me seeing my immediate family (parents and siblings) everyday to seeing them just a few times a year. Whenever I come back from visiting them, I feel depressed for the first few days and really sad and lonely. It does get better after about a week but I still miss them incredibly. I have seriously considered moving back to my home town so I can be closer to them. I feel like I’m missing out on their lives. Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this before?"

lonely,Lonely at new school? anyone relate? advice? (16 y/o male),"Lonely at new school? anyone relate? advice? (16 y/o male) - Hey all,

I'm a 16 y/o male in 11th grade. I transferred to a new school across the county before school started this year, so I already knew a few people and had some good friends from band and orchestra stuff. However I find that I feel super lonely sometimes as I literally don't know anyone that aren't in my classes or know from band or orch. I'm in the pit orchestra in my schools musical performance, and I took this as an opportunity to try to meet new people. However, I only really find myself talking to people I already know. I think this is probably because the current sophomores, juniors, and seniors assume me to be a freshman that came up from the middle school and don't want to bother talking to me. And the freshmen think I'm an upperclassman, and most freshmen keep among themselves. It's just frustrating, as all of my friends here already knew me before I transferred. Even though I have some good friends, I really want to meet new people and I feel lonely everyday being surrounded by a thousand people I don't know. 

Has anyone else experienced this?? Advice??

Much appreciated, and have a wonderful day fellow redditors"

But upon all this I can’t bring myself to care I don’t even care about myself or how I feel I just hate it. I hate the fact that no matter how far I run or try I can’t escape myself other people leave or keep their distance but I can’t. Everyday is a pain and every moment I pretend is okay is another I think about why am I trying like I mean who am I trying for? That’s all I ask for something to make me want to care about things but it never comes everyday I breathe is so unbelievably painful that I forget I exist I move mechanically with not a genuine feeling in me but I don’t know I don’t know what I’m thinking or where my feelings are or if this even makes sense but I do know that I’m a shitty person who deserves all this I deserve this pain and this torture I deserve death but I know I can’t do it maybe someone else will"

lonely,Alone even surrounded by people,"Alone even surrounded by people - 
Been married for twenty years, three years ago my beautiful wife was diagnosed with MS.  I am the main caregiver and provider.  When she has a great day which is not often we get to spend 3 maybe four decent hours together, just sitting with each other and holding hands and the such.  The rest of time when I am at work or an event I usually go alone or with friend, the people closest to me treat me like the devoted husband of an ill wife.  Except for those precious few hours with my wife, I feel pretty much alone the rest of the time."

Since we are all lonely (either socially awkward/insecure, or due to other circumstances) why don’t we all meet up? We’d already be super aware of each other’s loneliness and wouldn’t have to be insecure about it. 
Instead, let’s come as we are, make each other’s day and make friends.

I've just been doing a whole lot of nothing, just chilling at home and doing work. I try to talk to people but they don't respond to anything.

lonely,Abandoned,Abandoned - Lonely M19 here. I had to repeat a year of my studies because of my mental health so all of the friends I knew for years left school and went off to universities. I don’t have a particularly good relationship with my family so I’ve never felt like I can confide in them.

lonely,Its Getting Worse,"Its Getting Worse - I made it a point to myself, to not take my unhappiness on other people. I already know that people tend to like a downer of a person, so I take precautions to be as happy as possible around people. I also try to be happy for people and their own happiness, to look at it and learn, and hope that one day I can have what they have. But lately, I can't help but feel annoyed or even angry when I see other people happy with their lives. Not in a materialistic sense, if I could be happy living in a cardboard box, I'd take it. But when I see people with friends, romantic relationships, meaningful bonds with people, families who love them and don't put them down, its makes me a little sick...

I don't want to be this way, to be someone who hates to watch others be happy. I hate this, I wish I could just turn that part of my brain off. I wish I could just open myself up and fix whatever's wrong with me. I know I need help, my counselor already recommended long-term therapy for me. But confronting this has been difficult, no one knows that I'm seeking help, but I can't help but feel they all know I NEED help, and are just quiet about it. So I'm just stuck, being a clown, all the while I feel like I'm dying inside every time I see people hold hands. I'm on my own, and I feel like it'll always be that way"

I sit at home most of the time and when I get home from the gym and hop on PS4 none of them want to play or say they’re busy doing this or that when I know it’s not true since it’s the same excuse all the time. This just makes me feel all alone in this world and as depressing as it sounds makes me think that what’s even the point in trying if no one will see me anymore. I used to be kinda popular and mates with everyone now I’m jus kicked to the curb and it sucks. :("

lonely,I need help writing a note or text to my 2 previous friends. Please help. It’s killing me and I need to get closure.,"I need help writing a note or text to my 2 previous friends. Please help. It’s killing me and I need to get closure. - I, for the first time all my life, had 2 friends during last summer. We went to the beach, amusement parks, water parks, and just were generally bored together. We did EVERYTHING together. It was truly the best summer of my life. Fast forward to September when school starts I get in a bunch of classes with one of them. YEA! LETS GO! This is going to be awesome. 

Our friendship became even stronger the first few weeks of school, but then, slowly but surely he began to lose all interest. We still talked in school but he would only do things if I invited him somewhere and my other friend the same.  It feels like I barely know him anymore and I see him and work with him 2 hours minimum a day. He acts nice to me and all but absolutely never invited me to hang out.

The 2 of them ended of befriending 2 other girls and are both actively getting friend zoned bad, but I don’t blame them for trying. I am truly happy for them but it only added to them leaving me out of everything. It’s been about 3 months since We have done things as a group, we called ourselves “the squad” and we inseparable, but now they are pretty much gone and I just want to tell them how much I miss those times. 

I hate weekends because I know they are hanging out without me and ik that come Monday I’m going to see at least one of them and they aren’t going to mention it and neither am I.

I want to text them both tonight with a message or something and I need help on what to say, I’m gonna draft it and then type it when I think the time is right.

Please, they were all I had and just typing this is making me tear up. I’m a 16 M, and have never done anything bad to them, I supported them through everything, hugged them when they were sad, and just generally talked them through stuff. I want them back, and I don’t think it’s ever going to happen, but this is going to be my last try. 

Any advice below would be helpful. 

Also keep in mind, these are two really nice kids, they are not selfish and although maybe they don’t like me as much as they used to, they don’t hate me. This is not a situation where you can say “they were never your friends” because they were, they listened to what I had to say as well.

Just please help. I need to just text them tonight or talk to them tomorrow and I need help on what to say"

i'm terribly lonely, and to add to it- my mind refuses to do and act up to it. lately it's been hard to do anything whether it's cleaning, eating or even showering sometimes. i just lay down on my bed, close my eyes and hope that maybe just maybe in 5 minutes i'll get the will to get up and do something... not to be THAT sad angst teen but seeking help from my irls has never been successful because they don't comprehend on how can I be lonely ( mainly because I'm always goofing and joking and smiling around ) ((sounds clicheic I know)) and they just go like... oh cheer up.

lonely,You carry it with you,"You carry it with you - Even though I have a loving family and have been in 2 serious relationships, I was lonely all my life. 
It started in elementary  school, when I didn't find a group of friends I fit in with, so I was alone most of the time. I went to high school in 6th grade and was waiting for it so much. I thought: new place, fresh start, I will be social, make many friends, reach what I've been wishing for for 6 years. 
Well needless to say it didn't go as planned. 60 people in the class and I still ended up alone. I ended up joining the 'outcast girls', the ones who couldn't fit in elsewhere. We dined together for appearances but we didn't really like each other. We didn't have much in common.
7 years of this and I've been wishing to go to university every day. In this time I developed a lot as a person, and I felt like I was finally ready to be the confident, sociable person I felt like I was. 
So I got accepted to a university abroad, and here I am, already halfway through my bachelors. 
I found a group of friends I really like. We are not that close but we have things in common and we sometimes go out to do things together. And I can more or less be myself, be sociable, tell my stupid jokes. It's everything I ever wished for. 
And yet when we sit in a bar, laughing, having a good time, sometimes I zone out for minutes because I'm just so overwhelmed by a feeling of loneliness. 

And I've realized - I've carried it with me all this time. 
It doesn't matter how many friends I have. How many times we go out. It doesn't matter that I have a loving family and boyfriend. 

It's inside me and if you're reading this, it's probably inside you too. 
And wherever you go, you carry it with you."

the group. I keep burning myself out and going that extra mile for them but I know for a fact that they won’t ever do the same. 

An example would be, we are all at lunch and everyone is talking. I can’t get a word in, if I do I am straight up ignored. So I just slowly stop talking because I am just talking to myself. 

For everyone who had/has similar experiences how did/do you break out of it. How did you find real friends. Because I just can’t get the hang of it and it kinda kills me on the inside. I want real friends and they kinda sound like a myth at this point in time."
lonely,I dont know what to do anymore,"I dont know what to do anymore - I never thought id post something like this online, but here we go i have no one else to say it to. Its my junior year of highschool and this summer was probably the best one ive had but towards the end of it my friends all started seeming like theyre getting further away. We all used to hang out almost every single day only a few months ago and now i havent seen any of them in almost a month outside of school where they act like nothings changed. We have this groupchat and whenever anyone texts in it, everyone responds but anything i say gets zero response from anyone in there but somehow they end up hanging out every other day without me knowing until later. They all make plans that im never included in and i dont fucking know why. Ive brought it up to them and all they say is “that sucks idk why thats weird”  when theyre a part of it. I dont remember ever having problems with anyone in there so i dont see any reason other than they just dont give a fuck. At school its like nothings changed. Ive tried to drop them and make new friends but everyone in my area already has their tight groups of friends and doesnt really accept new people so im basically just gonna be lonely as shit until i go off to college. The only friends i have left are on the internet who i play video games with and i only see them 1-3 times a year but theyre going to college next year so i most likely wont ever see them again. School is dumb and the homework is always just mindnumbingly boring busy work that i learn absolutely nothing from so now im failing 2 classes because i cant find motivation to do anything in them. Most of my school day consists of me sitting on my phone. Ive been playing video games on my phone pretty much all day every day out of boredom since my friends dont talk to me and i dont want to do anything in my classes. Outside of school i just play video games on my pc until its time to sleep. The only thing that makes me not want to kill myself now is weed. When im high is the only time im happy now. I used to be able to quit smoking whenever and however long i wanted no problem, but recently i feel like i just need it all the time. I have no friends anymore, im not close with my family, and ive never been able to find a gf for some reason. I dont know what to do. Being lonely sucks, life sucks, everything fucking sucks.

TLDR: Slowly getting more and more depressed... high school sucks, work sucks, and all of my friends are talking to me less and less and at this point not at all."

Rather i wish i could grow gracefully. Im only 17 and I've been through some shit and i don't want to sacrifice my child like spirit and wonder. I want to be able to express my creativity and im honsetly afraid of facing reality."
lonely,I'm losing the last of my social circle and I don't know what to do,"I'm losing the last of my social circle and I don't know what to do - Never thought I'd (21 m) be making a post like this on a public forum but I don't know where else to turn.

Less than an hour ago my beloved cat died after suddenly getting sick just the day before. A week earlier my other cat lost the ability to walk due to severe arthritis. 

Earlier today when I told a friend of mine that my cat has gotten sick she decided to end our friendship because she was worried that her mental health couldn't handle me being depressed. I mean this literally when I saw there was no warning to this.

I now have 1 friend who works 6 days of the week, my uncle who is both sick and old, my senior dog and my senior cat that can't walk. No girlfriend despite literally years of trying, no family left alive and no friends. 

I'm at my wits end here. I just started college this January. I hoped things would be different. I had years of therapy backing me up. I was ready to be social. I was ready to finally love and feel loved by someone else again. I was ready to finally have plans and an excuse to go outside. Unfortunately it turns out just about every woman in class has a boyfriend and I can't seem to find much in common with the men. I'm trying to make friends with most of the class regardless with so-so success. 

I guess I should stop my ranting here. If anyone read this then thanks for taking the time to scroll through the late night ramblings of a depressed art student."

lonely,It all sank in these last two nights.,"It all sank in these last two nights. - I've always considered myself a bit of a loner, from the days of keeping my head down in hs not talking to anyone. To a long stint in prison. I just kept my head down and did my time.

But it all sank in this weekend. I'm appearantly invisible and pretty ugly too. I've paid for tinder no matches in 6 months. I posted last night on Craigslist I had a extra ticket to a fairly popular country singers concert and would buy drinks for any female takers. I got a few replays but when we exchanged pics it was 8 rejections in a row.
I'm not even good looking enough to go to a free ( for them) concert with and get free drinks ( from me).

The I tried again tonight, I went to Buffalo wild wings to watch the UFC fights. I tried mingling with a table next to me of guys watching and discussing the fights, I'm pretty knowledgeable on Mma and current fighters, I even bought the table 3 pitchers. The result: not one conversation over 30 secs in a 6 hr fight card. So I've come to face it after tonight I'm unattractive and invisible.

Time to barricade myself in my house I might not even go to work anymore. I give up."

I talked to him about that game. Whenever I said smth I felt as if I was talking to myslef only, and all the others sitting around didn't seem to talk to me as well. So I just left and I'm in my room now. We have a party almost every fri or sat, but somehow I can't get myself to get out of my room and join them. I wanna socialize with them, only if I didn't have this cheap and dirty personality. I'm such an unamusing person.  I hate myself for that, I am ugly enough but alteast I should have a good personality to compensate for that. Fuck it. I'm gonna stay in my room for the rest of my life. My heart is really feeling uneasy."

All of the crushes I’ve had, Ive always been afraid to make the first move.  I have a thing that if I’m not approached first that means that they aren’t interested in me, but I think this is seriously holding me back from the rest of what could be my life.

There is this one girl on twitter who likes some of my tweets but we aren’t very compatible, she’s really sweet though. Other than her everyone ignores me. 

I have selective mutism so I don’t talk irl to anyone other than my dad and brother. I try to make online. friends but it never works out i’m too picky. I’m always looking for that stereotypical highschool movie experience but i’ll never have that cause I started homeschool and never leave the house. 

Reddit just doesn’t seem like the best place to make friends. There was this one person I talked to daily for months but we had nothing in common other than selective mutism and eventually just stopped talking. We talked about what went on in our day every day, that’s not how a friendship should be. 

I’m looking for friends mainly on instagram and twitter. There are so many cool accounts I follow but none of them pay attention to me and I don’t expect them to. There was this one girl I used to talk to on twitter but she left the app and I have her on snapchat. We haven’t talked since october but she has me on her private story. We kinda ranted to eachother a lot which isn’t a good base for a friendship but I got butterflies everytime she messaged me. 

I try finding people with similar interests to me because I hyperfixate on certain things at a time. Like right now my main thing is Uncut Gems and a few other movies.

Fast forward to today, the day of the dance, just before my birthday tomorrow, and Valentine’s Day. I told her I wouldn’t be able to make it to the dance (because I was at dinner with my family). She replied:

Nice

NICE

I think she doesn’t like me. She’s been hanging out with this asshole of a guy (who has his own story). I’m just saddened. I had a gift for her on Valentine’s Day.

I've always been lonely in the romantic sense but now I don't even have someone to just shoot the shit with.

lonely,"I have no friends, send help.","I have no friends, send help. - ** Sorry for the super long post but I need to vent, bear with me**

As the title states, I (24F) basically have no friends. I really only had two friends, but one of them, we will name Sara, is busy with work and her marriage that our schedules just don’t really line up at the moment to hang out much but she is a great friend to me but the other one, we will name Mary, is toxic and just likes to use me whenever it’s convenient for her. It’s hard because even though I know how toxic the friendship is, it’s all I have. Literally.

Mary and I’s friendship is pretty much her hitting me up to either gossip about drama about some of her other friends or to invite me places she wants to go when she doesn’t have anyone else to go with her. It’s all stuff I’m used to. But I do it because she’s one of the only people I have to do stuff with and she can be a nice person when she wants to be. But recently I’m not even sure what happened with our friendship, if you even want to call it that.. so just a little insight as to what I’m even saying..

Towards the middle of last week I had messaged Mary and asked her if she was busy that coming weekend and asked if she would like to come to the mall with me so we could hang out and she said sure and that was that.
The weekend rolls around, and so the day before our plans I ask her if she wants to meet at her place or mine, she says hers is fine and sets a time. 
The day of, she starts saying that her anxiety has been super high and she’s really not sure why she’s so anxious but it’s caused her to fall out of work. I tell her that we didn’t need to go to the mall if she didn’t want to, as a mall is probably not a good setting to help her anxiety. She proceeded to tell me that she still wanted to, that she needed to get out of the house and it’d be good for her, so I said I was down for it. 
Not more than 10 minutes later she replies with “Don’t be mad I just threw up I don’t think I’m going to go I just feel so weird I’m going to stay home sorry”. I told her it’s okay and that I hope she felt better and she told me “Thanks for understanding like some people who wouldn’t”. 

I go to the mall by myself, which I hate doing things alone, and finish some errands up within a few hours, to come home and relax, browse the socials, to find out that my “friend” posted to her story and that she didn’t in fact stay home because she had thrown up and was sick but she went out ice fishing with other friends instead. 

Seeing that, kind of struck me more differently than all the other crappy things she’s done to me. I decided to be honest about my feelings and text her about it. I said to her “You know, I told you that you didn’t have to go with me to the mall if you didn’t want to, and I’d rather you have just been honest instead of saying you feel sick and are staying home just for you to go out ice fishing instead.” Either she didn’t think that I would see it and call her out on it, or she just flat out didn’t care. But..

She hasn’t replied to it at all and it’s been a week now.
I know our friendship isn’t worth holding on to at all but how do I let it go when it’s basically that or nothing? It’s not easy for me to make new friends and sometimes I feel like it’s a little too late. I’m a people person and I seem to get along with most people, but it never gets to that friendship stage where we talk outside the normal environment and hang out, etc.

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I just want genuine friends. Fml."

Which I feel really shitty about but I can’t help it.

lonely,What bothers me the most,"What bothers me the most - Getting treated as an inferior being. I am a 19yo male,'5"" and have an ugly/baby face. Im not even a bit intimidating.

Usually people don't take me serious,not even my relatives. Thus, i have been an easy target throughout my entire life. I might gymmax,but this wouldn't solve my mental issues/disorders. I don't have motivation to do any self improvement,my self steem has always been destroyed. 

The way i was raised by my parents,was one of the things that turned me into a weak,coward and insecure man. I was spoiled,overprotected by my mother,was told everyday i was handsome,though the real world told me the opposite. I know,parents Will always Gaslight their children,but at the same time they gaslighted me and spoiled me,they charged me to be independent,which is ironic, and this goes on till then. 

You know,If i ran into a fight,they would take action on my behalf,If i wanted to make choices,they would make It in my behalf. I am not mentally disabled,but always been treated as one,and never understood why. 

On the other hand,my middle brother,(which is 2.5y older than me),was treated in a different way by my parents. He is objectly a handsome man,and its weird How looks Will even influence the way you are treated by your relatives and even parents. He was always the chosen one. No one would pity him,everyone would make sure to always validate him and treat him as superior. He is superior,genetically speaking. 

Don't come UP with the bullshit: ""looks don't matter"". It does matter! It Will decide If your whole life Will be heaven or hell. I experienced so many situations where i realized i had a disadvantage compared to good looking people. Your attitude,your sense of humor,everything Will be perceived in a different way,If you are objectvely unnatractive and unpleasent to look at. 

I have Lost the count of How many times i was bullied. 
No girls would be willing to talk to me,to get to know me. They would always express disregard and make a disgusting face,a body language of avoidance,If i tried to get around with them. 

This built up on me a feeling of being an outcast,i knew i would never be popular,the Spotlight,the kind of Guy who is desirable by girls. I knew It,but you know,this hurts deep inside,because you know there is nothing you can change about it. You Will always be at the bottom of the social hierarchy. 

I wont get into details about my tormented journey of being bullied,picked up on at School. The text Will turn out as longer as It already is. 

You know,my brother got along with everyone at School,he was popular,had friends,ppl who wanted him around. Never struggled over being accepted socially as i did. He Just fit on any social circle,because he is outgoing,good looking and self assured. He won the genetic lottery,and he is enjoying its harvests. 

It has nothing to do with confidence,attitude,personality. I haven't had many validations during my life,on the contrary,people are harsh at me,they always were. You guys need to understand that If you live a life without validation,without friends,facing Constant rejection and exclusion,you Will end UP mentally fucked. 

This shit Will grow into you,making you feel hopeless. Therefore you Will Very likely develop mental illnesses ,as a consequence of dealing with Constant negativity. You will repress all your emotions and these traumas will Lock you up."

i feel so damn alone in this world like no one is here to help me, the world just fucked me over by putting me in this world and leaving me to figure it out myself and i don't know what to do but i hate myself and i have no clue what to do. i'm really just so frustrated, anxious and agitated, i really just wish i wasn't alive right now. i can't deal with any of this. i want to run back to him and cry to him because he's the only one that will be there for me but i don't even know if he really cares about me because of the way he's been treating me. i just hate everything and more than that i hate myself for allowing myself to come to this position where i am so pathetic."

lonely,I'm so tired of feeling left,"I'm so tired of feeling left - I just found this sub and I love it and hate it at the same time. I feel identified with pretty much all of the other posts. I need to vent a little, maybe get some advice?

I'm so freaking lonely and I get so attached to people so easily. I have family and friends but not one of them is really close. I didn't use to care about it, I've always been proud of being an independent woman, I used to hate spending time with other people, but now I can't stand being alone anymore.

I've talked about this to some people, and they do tell me I can count on them if I ever need anything and all of that, but man, I don't know. I just feel lonely anyway because I don't get attention from the one person I want to get attention from.

This guy and I were becoming good friends, we were talking everyday, playing videogames online a few times a week, talking for hours. I loved it, I felt so, so happy, I was starting to trust him, I was starting to feel like I could talk to him about so many things. But now we're drifting appart and I can't stand it, it triggered my depression so bad. I know my happiness should not depend on other people, I know I shouldn't let other people control my feelings like this, I know it's very unhealthy. And I hate knowing it and I hate feeling alone and I just don't know what to do anymore.

He once told me how some people texted him and he didn't reply to anybody. I always felt special because he always replied to me. Now I feel like I'm part of that other group of people. Now he doesn't ask if I'm free to play. Now he doesn't ask how I'm doing, and I know he's not that busy because I see him online. I hate being this clingy, I hate caring about that because, honestly, with other people I really don't care if they don't reply or don't text in a while.

The worse part is that this is not the first time this happens to me, I was SO happy I got over it last time. I felt so strong. But it wasn't true, I was feeling strong because I had this new friend that I don't have anymore.

I don't know if I'm making much sense, but I could use someone's advice."

I want to have friend but for some reason I don't like most of the people. I don't know if i'm picky or stupid, haha.

Some Background of me, I'm a 20-year-old male working full time and not attending school

As  long as I can remember I've always been sad, as a kid it wasn't as bad as it is now, I was diagnosed with depression about 4 years ago. I do take meds for it but I've been on multiple types of anti-depressants but nothing seems to work, but what really is getting me down in my adult life is finding love, I know I'm only 20 and I have my whole life but I  still would love to have that but I just can't seem to get the one thing  I want. but that's not the only reason I'm down, for the past 5 months  I've worked to improve the way I view myself because before I hated my self, but if I were to put it in numbers id say I'm at a 65% out of 100%  of self-improvement. Now I'm not done because I'm going to do everything in my power to keep pushing my self to be better.

But  I do push myself to try and find someone, I've become more social, I've been using Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, EHarmony, Plenty of fish, but there's always the one girl I see and we start talking and everything goes great until I get ghosted, this has now happened to me 12 times, but it's not just that, whenever I have those bad days, the only things I  see is bad that happens to me, I just feel like life is trying to tear me down every day. Every time I have a hopefull day, something always ruins it...always, I've been in this state for so long that its the norm for me, I believe my personality is just being sad honestly. I  Can't Get A Break."

Of course because of this I never try anything with these people I am attracted to, I just wish I could find someone with a similar personality to them that I could actually start a relationship with. I feel like these kinds of people are out there but I’m drawn to the unavailable anyway.

It's confirmed even more when you make attempts in socializing only for people to ""play with your head"", manipulate you, shame you, guilt trip you, everything in their power to try to influence you to commit suicide.....and NEVER get held accountable for doing that to you.....because you wasn't chosen by only them.

I've done the online dating thing and nothing came out if that. Then I came across a fact that out of all of the races, asian men do the worse in dating. Learning this fact really hit me hard in the face of what my future is gonna be like. I just feel like I just need to give up and accept that nobody wants me... Its so hard to breathe with is despair I am experiencing. I wish I was somebody else who is more good looking and is more financially stable but Im not that and that very thought is very depressing.

lonely,“Professional cuddling” gone wrong,"“Professional cuddling” gone wrong - So I matched with a cute guy on a dating app. He was looking for sex and I am not. However, his profile mentioned that he enjoys cuddling and I enjoy that too. There’s also the fact that I haven’t cuddled with a guy in almost four years. So I told this guy that I wasn’t interested in having sex with him, but we could cuddle and I would pay him an hourly rate like professional cuddlers get. He had never heard of professional cuddling, but since he happens to be a college student who doesn’t make a lot of money, he said that he was down for it.

Anyway we had this discussion like two days ago and I didn’t hear anything from him until this morning when he texted me around 10:30 AM asking me if I wanted to get together for cuddling today. We agreed to meet at 2:00 PM.

I wasn’t expecting to hear from him today, so I had to do a lot of stuff to get prepared. I had to clean my house, vacuum, clean the toilets, get rid of clutter, do my makeup, get my cute cuddling outfit ready, put on perfume, do my nails, make sure my hair looks and smells nice, brush my teeth a second time, etc. It took me a few hours, but I was pleased with the results. I looked good and my house was presentable. I’m looking forward to the cuddling despite the fact that this is some strange guy who I’ve never met, so I know the whole situation is a bit weird.

He texts me around 1 PM and asks me whether there’s any chance that we’re going to have sex. I say no, there isn’t. He says ok, he was just asking because he wanted to know whether he needed to groom himself down there. lol And I’m like nope, that won’t be necessary. I tell him again where he needs to meet me at 2:00, since we were going to meet at a public place before going to my house for the cuddling.

The last thing I have to do is go out to get the cash that I’m going to pay him for the cuddle. This is shortly before 2:00 since I’m going to a place that is really close to where we’re supposed to meet. Anyway, pretty much as soon as I get the money for him and put it in my wallet, I get a text from him saying that he’s sorry but he won’t be able to make it because he got called into work at the last minute. Surprise, surprise. So no cuddles for me and pretty much a waste of my time, but I can’t really be too mad because I was going to invite a strange horny guy into my house and pay him to cuddle me and I know that’s totally crazy. So really, I’m probably better off that he canceled.

Anyway, that’s my embarrassing story for the day. I’ve sunk to new lows. lol"

I work, play video games, sometimes go to the gym. Also I watch Netflix and am passionate about coffee. I don't see any of these as hobbies. Like, everyone I know watches Netflix, that isn't really a hobby.

How do I get hobbies? I've tried stuff before but couldn't keep myself to do them. I feel like a chore when I'm doing something that I don't know if I'll enjoy or not.

lonely,Going through life alone is not worth it.,"Going through life alone is not worth it. - I'm 32 years old today. Nobody noticed, that's not what matters anyway.

What matters is that it has been like this for 32 years. I never had a friend, I never had a partner, I never had someone I could talk to, confide into, build a more meaningfull relation with. My parents were the only ones that I talked a bit with, and I mostly spared them my problems. They are dead now, I'm happy they didn't have to see how empty inside I am.

Why do I get up in the morning to go to work? why did I study and get two college degrees for so long? Why do I do sport to keep fit? Why do I travel? Why do I write?

For no reason at all. I'm a social being, as much as I would like to be the exact opposite, I see value in the things I do with someone else. I like feeling like I belong in a group. I listen to podcasts and group talks just to quiet the absurd silence of my flat and delude myself into thinking I'm not that alone.

I saw a hidden waterfall in a backyard country and felt like I should take joy in my find. It feels empty when there's no one to share your hapiness with. 

I wish I could say there's always tomorrow. But why would I kid myself? I shook up my wardrobe, my hairstyle, went to therapy, went to hobby groups I liked, went to local events, went online dating and whatnot. It's simply really, if you manage to make yourself interesting, people will follow. It's really all there is. I know I'm boring, took me three decades and being a friendless virgin to learn it, but why do I have to be so disposable when I feel such a need for the most basic social life?

I've done a few things in that time, two degrees, an interesting job, read some good books, saw some cool movies, saw some unexpected countries. But I haven't lived. I see people and I see them feeling alive, having done things they can remember with a smile. I remember the emptiness of what I've done.

I need to feel loved but no one cares about me. The only moment I forget that is when I get drunk, and it feels good."
lonely,I can't reciprocate feelings,"I can't reciprocate feelings - (M/20) - Most people bore me, I can't really put this feeling into words, but I can't get infatuated with someone. Most times I seek physical contact with someone, it is out of boredom to be honest. I get them to have feelings for me even tho I don't reciprocate them and after that I just get bored of them and drop them. I don't know why that is, it's not like i'm a loner? I do have some genuine friends and get along great with my co-workers, but when it comes to romantic feelings there's this constant void in me. It's the same for my family, I like them, but I don't have strong feelings for them. Some days I even question my friendships, like do I genuinely enjoy their company, or do I just hang out with them to not get bored? I don't know why I am like this and I'm so sorry for all the people I have hurt.

I've isolated myself for years now, but my friends at least use to text me. Now, no one texts me first. I want friends that I can talk to about things. All of the friends I've ever had are with people who only talk about themselves, they'll vent about small things and hoard the convo even if I'm going through something big. I hated this and slowly pulled away. I get that I'm a good listener and offer good advice, but it's always one sided and I feel drained afterward most of the time, especially if it's just small talk. Then one of the only friends that I could talk to about everything (mostly abstract thoughts on life)...betrayed me. After that, I thought I'd just pull away from people and focus on me for awhile. Well ""awhile"" has turned into almost four years. I've been single that whole time as well. I feel like I must be unlovable. Everyone that I have liked has only wanted me as a FWB. It hurts to know that none of the traits i was born with (intelligent, empathetic, endless curiosity, and an enormous amount of passion) are something others can't recognize or just don't value, at least in me anyway. I'm really really lonely and terribly sad. I want to love and be loved. I feel like I'm unstoppable when I'm loved, but I just don't see it happening for me."

Realizing looking back that I've never been good at keeping relationships and tended to cut people off due to depression or due to growing apart. I've never had a consistent circle of friends ever in my life and I'm wondering if it's just too late for me to do anything about it.

I talk to people at my work but they're all 10+ years older, my past history of job-hopping and having no clue what to do with my life doesn't help this fact. I'm going to college online now so I don't have a social outlet there. I've dated a few people but nothing ever panned out into anything.

It hurts real bad to not only not have that, but to have no real option over how to find that experience. I feel the lack of intimacy has also hurt me in terms of my professional life.

lonely,lonely with no friends (F16),"lonely with no friends (F16) - I have friends, close friends. The two very close friends I have never initiate plans me, in fact, nobody does. I’m always the ones to make plans with people. Although I’m very close with them, I feel like I have nobody to turn to or talk to when I’m extremely upset. I just don’t feel comfortable doing it with anything and there’s only one person I can tell a few things to when I’m sad. Everybody had “someone” or that one person who is their true best friend: someone they’re always talking to and hanging out with. I have tried continually to find that person by trying to get closer with my other friends. I always ask people if they want to hang out, most of them say they’re busy, but at times it feels as if they’re just lying to not hang out with me. no matter how hard I try, I can never compete because they already have those best friends in their life that they absolutely trust and care about. I’m just the background friend that everybody has for laughs, but not somebody they trust or really even care about. 

The person I thought that was that “someone” stopped being friends with me, so that’s lovely 

I may leave to a new country in a year, which is good and hopefully start a new life at a new school. I just want to get away from the friends I have right now because I’m tired of feeling lonely and sitting by myself all day. I feel like I’m locked in a prison and have to watch everyone be free and happy until I can leave myself. I really don’t want to have to endure this for an entire year. I just want it all to end"

About 3 months back, I started talking to an old school acquaintance, and it was very evident that we both liked each other (I mean, I surely did like him, not sure about him now)
We used to talk everyday and everything was going well. It was a given that if we got into a relationship, it would be long distance because even though we are from the same city, we are in different colleges in different cities. I got really attached and wanted to take.it further. I even made plans to visit him but haf to cancel because he was acting weird. I decided to ignore, it. 
Fast forward, it had been almost 3 months of us talking, and he suddenly started ignoring me. I decided to take the first step and ask him what was wrong.
He said that he doesn't know if long distance would work out for him ,and he doesn't feel a click with me. I was so shocked and I couldn't process what had happened. This happened a day before my birthday, and the worst part was him texting me to wish me as if nothing had happened. I don't think this affected him at all, and he has no idea how much this has affected me. He knew from the very start about my trust issues and how I was risking a lot and keeping aside all of that so I could make it work with him.
I feel so empty, and I can't concentrate on anything. I don't think I can trust any one from now, and even if I do, it'll be with q lot of precautions."
lonely,I miss my cat more than my ex,"I miss my cat more than my ex - Title says it all.

My cat didn’t come home two weeks ago and it’s been devastating. I finally put away her food and water bowl, accepting that she isn’t coming back. The worst part is not knowing what happened to her. I’ve called the animal shelter, I’ve been checking Craigslist, no sign of her. She’s either roaming the streets, adopted in a new home, or dead in some alley.

Meanwhile my ex moved out of my house two weeks ago today, and it’s been the most liberating feeling I’ve had in a long time. It’s cliche but it literally feels like a huge weight has come off my shoulders and I can finally breathe again. I’m glad that she’s gone, I don’t miss her in the slightest, I’ve deleted and blocked her number, if I ever run into her in town I’ll just pretend I didn’t see her.

My newly remodeled home that I bought last year is in need of repair now. Two adults, three teens, and three pets will destroy a home really fast. There’s fist sized holes in the walls and doors, broken door knobs, broken furniture, spilled soda over carpets, a broken stove. Shredded brand new leather couches, shredded curtains, shredded carpets, scratches on the new hardwood floor. 

My house was full but now it’s just me. I miss my kitty."

Wherever I go I see couples kissing and hugging each other and it sucks cuz I was born into a broken middle class family, worked MUCH HARDER than those spoilt rich only to end up in a 9-5 job with meagre salary barely enough to feed myself and pay rent.Ugly and single I’m always left out and I feel miserable and every night think of whether I should ever continue living. I still remember when I was a kid, pure and innocent, those valentine’s day celebrating people used to BULLY ME AND EXPLOIT ME just to show off to other women and today in those couples I see those bullies. My blood boils seeing valentine’s day stuff and I feel like pulling out a weapon and firing at every couple out there. I used to be neglected by my parents and by my classmates as a kid and I still am and I hate how life is so unfair. The loneliness is killing me, it drives me insane to a point where I get thoughts of violence and terrorism. I watch videos of mass shootings and killings just to make myself feel better. I feel like planting a bomb right in the epicenter of the “Romantic” valentine’s day celebrations only then I can die in peace.I’m afraid I may end up being a shooter. I'm going insane"

I walked out of a target after getting 40$ cash back and saw a homeless person lying on the pavement in nothing but a short sleeved shirt and some sweatpants in 40 degrees fahrenheit weather. I felt really bad so I gave him the 40$ even though that was my lunch and dinner for the next few days, I can’t afford breakfast. It doesn’t matter though because he needed a coat. Anyways, when I gave him the money he literally CRIED and shook my hand. He was very grateful.

I went home and realized this was the first time since I was a kid that someone was sincerely grateful for my presence, or at least grateful for what I could help them with. It was a feeling that I have longed for, for the past 6 years. So I drove around again, and I mapped my routes ahead of time to the places where there are more homeless people so I don’t lose gas for nothing. I gave 7 homeless people between 5$ and 20$, depending on how warm their clothes were. Around 70$ in total. These people are so... just... good. They’re great people that god fucked over for no reason. They don’t take my money and just say “thanks”, it’s always “thank you so much sir thank you so much thank you God bless you” or something along those lines.

My life... has resorted to giving homeless people money just so that I can have a mutual relationship with someone. I wish I had an income that would allow me to give these people more. But here we are."

lonely,Next week I am going out Solo. Outcome!,"Next week I am going out Solo. Outcome! - Hey Reddit,

I previously posted a thread about me going out solo next week and here is my outcome. I decided to set myself a goal and try to get out of my comfort zone. The goal here was not to get laid but just to simply have fun and enjoy yourself. 

The first meet up was only a few minute drive away from where I work. There was only 4 people in total myself but it turned out it wasn't as bad as my mind had inticipated as this was actually set in a restaurant and not a bar, since I am in the county side I could not expect any other outcome. Social was just casual but the purpose was trying to get to know others and take things from there. A little but common interest tends to go a long way. First meet up done and dusted.

Second meet up is 4 days after the first meet up but this time this was in the big city, with a attendance of more than 100 in a small crowded bar this would be interesting. In total I would of spoken to perhaps 25 people but narrowed it down to roughly 3 people which I fairly got along with, common interests is what got the conversation rolling and it never died down, in fact I was there from the start till the bar finally kicked us out. Wasn't drunk most of the time but pretty sober.

Some people you won't get pass a few words but that's okay, move on and try to talk to another few people and slowly you will start to feel natural. Most of the time I didn't have to act like some one I want but just be me. This is the most important aspect. 

If some one is lonely or by themselves you should go out and be the first to approach as they are waiting for someone to do so or simply just shy, when doing that they will more comfortable in your presence.

Overall all it was a great experience and I will be looking forward to go to another random social meet up again. The goal is to not laid but to network and meet new people. Most important part is to go out there and have fun. 

Provided if you went out and didn't get anything out of it you still made a attempt which you should be proud off.  

I recommend any one to try this as it is a good learning experience, don't be shy because every one there is feeling the same as you are.

My context is a bit out of place as I am typing this on my phone."

She meant the world to me. I felt complete with her, and she was my one right person at the right time. We had it all, we dreamt it all and we planned it all. Then she just...left.

And now I'm here, suffering for it, but above all, terrified of being alone. I have friends and family, but it is simply not enough. I feel terribly lonely and I simply can't see anyone else falling for me again. So I feel like I'll be lonely for the rest of my life, and that truly scares me.

These are chaotic situations which cannot be modelled or simulated in your imagination. If you're a consummate professional at putting on a facade and manipulating your environment then go for it, but for everyone else, keep your mind occupied with other shit while you're waiting to go.

lonely,Where everything changed for me.,"Where everything changed for me. - From the time I was in 1st grade up until 8th grade I spent every moment with my best friend “F”. Everyday after school, all day everyday over summer. I went on almost all of his family vacations to his lake house, point is this kid was more than a friend to me. I felt closer to him than my own brother. I had no friends beside him, he was 1/2 of me. 

One day In 7th grade I walk home from school with him, we hang out for about 10-15 minutes. Out of no where he kindly asked me if I could go home, he didn’t want to hang out that day. Well, turns out my sister, who is 2 years older than me was coming over to hang out with F. 

I felt like my life was over. The friendship built between me and F up until that point was one I will never have again in my life. I felt so worthless, the kid I spent every second with suddenly didn’t want to hang out with me? And so he can hang out with my sister?  I felt like my own mother had disowned me. 

(I know this is drastic, but bare in mind I’m 12 years old at this point. I barely understood why I got erections at that point in my life LOL)

Once they began dating, I went quite. I went to school went home, and didn’t talk to anyone. Something changed me when that happened. I have never been the same since. 

I had 2 really cute “girlfriends” in middle school and had no problem talking to girls or being social. Once F started dating my sister all of that went out the window. Before that, i was always texting or talking to girls that were friends. When I turned 15 I started working and I was seen and heard from even less. 

F and my sister did not last long, but our friendship never fully recovered. I still talk and see him frequently, but we are not the same. Sometimes I feel awkward around him. That’s  the same kid I would have died for, the same kid I basically grew up with. 

Im 19, and a virgin still. Hell I’ve never even made out with a girl. 

I just lost all confidence, like I was worthless and that any girl I would try to talk to would see me that way. 

Everyday that goes by, I feel like my chances of finding a girl that would actually like me get slimmer and slimmer. I just want to know what it is like to have someone actually care about me. I’ve only experience middle school “relationships”.  

I’m sorry for ranting but if you read this whole thing, even if you don’t respond. Please know that I appreciate you for listening. Thank you for you time."

Ex’s. Do I miss the one I had?

I still just can’t help wonder what it would be like to fall in love with someone else. Just intoxicated by the presence of my other, even when the times get hard, nothing breaking the bond we share. Just can’t help wondering haha.

lonely,it’s worse now that i know what connection feels like,"it’s worse now that i know what connection feels like - i started talking to this guy on a dating app and it was going really well, we went out on a date and i was so happy, he’s so kind and considerate and we understand each other on a fundamental level, it was unlike anything else

and a little while later i went to his place and the expected happened, twice

we kept talking and made plans to meet again and the expected happened again

and then suddenly it was like he was repulsed by me. i noticed it earlier but in light of how caring he was i thought it was just my insecurities. but the last time we had sex he didn’t kiss me once and he kept the lights off. and today he confessed that since the first time we had sex he had realized he wasn’t attracted to me

he still wants to be friends and i’m grateful for that but i still feel kind of awful, he was so warm toward me before anything happened, and affectionate, and he had all these sweet pet names for me from his first language, and now he won’t even be near me. i feel so repulsive now and he was the only person i ever connected with so deeply in my life and i’m scared i’ll never find anyone else who will feel that way toward me and who will love me without finding me disgusting. i’m scared his disgust will grow until he doesn’t want to even be friends any more

i just hate myself so much i can’t stand it. i’ve been in a daze the entire day, crying on and off, he’s the first person i ever had sex with and i just feel like i’m fundamentally unworthy of love. it’s so juvenile but don’t know what to do. i don’t know how to find others who are like me. i just feel broken"

I have 1 friend that i love and trust but she is always busy with practice and her boyfriend that we hardly ever hang out anymore and i feel like i can’t really talk to her about anything because i dont even know why. im going to be a senior next year and i can’t be excited to graduate like everyone else because im stressed out about applying to colleges and SAT, ACT etc. the only thing im looking forward to after graduating right now is moving out and getting away from my dysfunctional, toxic family."

lonely,Alone,Alone - Feeling alone really sucks. It’s been months since I few I had a true connection. It’s these nights that I actually have free after working 2 jobs to come home and not have anyone to talk to. No one to call or text. Xbox only helps in the moment but no to have a deep conversation with sucks sometimes. Find myself telling jokes to myself or sometimes talking to the appliances in the house when they make a noise. Truly feeling alone it’s a dark place but I hope everyone here actually finds a way to feel better and someone to have conversations with. No one should have to live through this.

Talking to people can be exhausting sometimes and it can feel like it’s not even worth the effort to get to know them. It’s between the fear of dying alone and the fear of opening up to other people while preventing getting hurt again. Just a tiring cycle that holds you captive that you’re too tired to change."

lonely,Tips to stop fantasizing about anyone that shows me attention?,"Tips to stop fantasizing about anyone that shows me attention? - It's ridiculous how fast my brain starts to idealize people after I talk for two minutes with them. I started to fantasize constantly about a girl, imagining conversations with her and all that, just because she talked to me at work once. Being lonely and needy sucks.


That said, has anyone gone through the same and found ways to overcome this?"
lonely,Vulnerability(or my lack thereof) and other things,"Vulnerability(or my lack thereof) and other things - I've never had a significant other. Until about 2 years ago, I didn't even feel the need for one. I woukd infatuate about someone and that would be it. I used to be single minded about whatever I set my mind to. I feel like I have always been a self absorbed person.

About 2 years ago, I went through a terrible terrible depression that changed me completely. I HATED myself. I mean, loathed. Until then, I had never felt lonely. Not once. I have an elder sister I am very close to, hence I never felt the need for another person. It was when she moved away to college that contributed to my downward spiral.

As of now, I'm recovered and doing well. I have a great therapist and she helps me a lot. But I am just so lonely still. Worse is that I feel helpless to fix it. I feel a literal block in my mind stopping me from being vulnerable with anybody. I have developed an entire personality to mask that vulnerability. I've always been ""the mature one"" in my house, because when faced with any situation I am able to separate emotion from logic quite well. Sometiems I feel this is because I don't feel that many emotions anyway. Maybe that's me exaggerating, idk. I hate being this way. I want to be able to be open about who I am, about what makes me me and all such things, but it's so frustrating.

I don't know why but I have an immediate response to prepare to say something self defensive the moment someone says something empathetic about me to me.

I want to be able to get through this, and I'm trying. I don't know if the things I'm doing are right, but it's an effort I guess. 

Anyway, thanks to anybody who read it this far. I don't know why I wrote so much. I just let it out."

No!!!!! You have no idea how badly I want to be in a relationship. To find someone who cares about me as much as I care about them. Who wants to be with me as much as I want to be with them. But sadly, no one wants to be with me. No matter how much I show them I care, they don’t. I see everyone around me getting married and having kids and finding love, and yet I have more love to give than anyone and I’m alone. I just don’t get it. People ask me all the time why I am single. Often times I ask the same question to myself. If I knew the answer, the question would never have to be asked in the first place."
lonely,My isolation has gotten so bad,"My isolation has gotten so bad - My days are exactly the same. I wake up, eat breakfast, go the the gym, make dinner, and wait to go to bed. I will go days without speaking to another human being. I hardly get any texts and my days are spent filling the silence with music or podcasts on my phone. I am used to being alone but I fear that it’s not good for my mental health, even if socializing gives me major anxiety and I am an introvert. I have friends... kind of. They are mostly acquaintances that I’ve hung out with a handful of times. My 2 friends that I hung out with the most moved away to NYC in November and I’m still living in my very small hometown. I can feel my isolation becoming worse though, because those who do reach out to me, I don’t return it, even though I want to. I don’t know what stops me from reaching out but I think I’m afraid of sounding crazy/attention seeking/ or I’m afraid they will end up not liking me in the end. I have always been a shy and anxious person but I don’t know what to do. I want to move out of my hometown because there is nothing here for me anymore, but I don’t know where to go and I am too much of a coward to make a decision. I don’t have any job prospects other than working retail or food service jobs. I enjoy art and would love to be an illustrator but sometimes I feel like I don’t have the motivation or creativity to make it happen for me. I just know I need a change because I don’t think I can spend another night by myself, watching tv and thinking about all the same things over and over.  I’m only 23... I shouldn’t be feeling this way. I shouldn’t be dwelling on the things I feel like I can’t change that are entirely possible of changing for me if I just got off the couch and made an effort. I want to call someone but I’m afraid I won’t know what to say. I just want to hear someone’s voice."
lonely,My(25enby) life is falling apart and I have no one,"My(25enby) life is falling apart and I have no one - I can honestly say that I’ve never felt more alone. I just got out of an abusive 3 year long relationship 3 weeks ago and feels like I’ve been self destructing ever since. I have no one to talk to but I don’t want to dump all my problems on someone I’ve just met so I don’t even try to talk. I wish I could find someone who could relate and we could be there for each other in our darkest hour without it leading to any “romantic” feelings cause I don’t want that at all. 

Ideally I’d find someone who isn’t racist, sexist, or homophobic/transphobic. Comfortable talking about depression/anxiety/mental illness in a serious way but also okay sending memes about how screwed up  our lives/mental health are cause I’m pretty nihilistic about life in general. I like halloween, horror movies, cats, wholesome shows (bobs burgers, Steven universe, She-ra) hoarding art and crafting supplies, and Goblins. 
If anyone has lots of free time and needs someone they can relate to I can talk here or discord. I don’t think you’ll find a more dedicated friend. If you’re willing to put the work into it so am I."
lonely,Make It Stop 😔,"Make It Stop 😔 - I really just want to hug someone. Someone who will truly embrace me and not just do it out of sympathy. I never felt like such a loser as I do now. I’m 33. Well-educated (doctoral level). People tell me I’m good looking, but it’s mostly older women or people who seem just as desperate as me. And I’m Unemployed. But this doesn’t matter. I was a reject even when I had a good job. And I still feel like a creature. A useless idiot. A discard from society. I find myself planning around “crying time.” It’s so bad that I am expecting to spend chunks of each miserable day crying. I wake up each morning wishing it were night time. I just want each day to end as soon as possible. 

I’m too weak minded to follow thru with suicide. At least I think I am. Each day; Each tear, drives me closer to something I know I’m incapable of doing. Part of me tells me i don’t follow thru because I’m unemployed and can’t afford a gun to make it quick. But I don’t know. I’ve written many suicide letters to make people, just to shred them and go to bed crying. I have a garden hose that I tied into a noose, but I’ll never use it. It’s like I just do all these things as a way of pushing myself to cry for myself... I know I’m rambling now. I guess it helps a little bit to post on here. I guess I’m just using you the way the world has used me. And I’m sorry for that. I don’t know who else to talk to. I don’t have anyone else to talk to. So I use reddit. I used reddit to beg for attention. For a hug. For a friend. But I get none of that, just like in real life.

I’m failing and I can’t face the fact they probably are better off without me around. I just feel lonely and isolated, and I did it too myself.

Due to reasons I had to transfer from my uni and go to a nearby community college which destroyed but, but in the process I got closer to my GF who was still at home and Ive found a major that I can say I really like and found a handful of opportunities to succeed. But during my first semester it all went to shit, I couldn’t focus at home to do my work so My grades were terrible. So in order to focus on building and working on myself I made the decision to Isolate myself, deleting sm for a bit and even breaking up w my gf. Even if it hurt me Ik in the long run that its what I needed to do eventually, so far into the semester, Im doing really well, but in the back of my head is this crippling depression and loneliness and I cant seem to fight it off, I feel unmotivated at time and this shit sucks, Ive cried this year more than I can remember and it doesnt feel like its getting better, all friendships feel very superficial and I feel lost"

so its coming to a year now since i lost my best friend Angeline. she was amazing and we were friends for 3 years. i wont get into the details about how our friendship ended but its been year now and i still feel the same as on day one. everyday i keep coming back to a memory of us telling each other we will be there for one another no matter what and recently something happened between Angeline and me and it just hurts so much. after our friendship ended last march, we ended up taking the same summer volunteering opportunity and we talked here and there when we volunteered and when school started for some reason we just started getting lunch once a week for a month or two. After about a mouth of not getting lunch, last thursday i texted her asking if she wanted to get lunch- no reply. the next day i ask her if she was free for the weekend- no reply. then on sunday at 7pm i get a crappy worse excuse reply that read "" rip I just saw this , my bad I've been busy all weekend, what was your plan ""....."" But do you remember anything from the hamlet quiz  "". she didnt even care to know what i had plan. all she wanted to know was what was going to be in the quiz. if she had known what would be on the quiz i bet she still wouldnt have replied. After a whole year i think this is what hurt me the most. it just sucks knowing how much Angeline meant to me and how much she still means to me and what i mean to her. she doesnt care about me as a person anymore. she only talked to me when its beneficial to her. makes me question whether she only went to lunch with me for her own benefits or because she genuinely wanted to be friends again.  I trusted her so much and i loved her (as a friend) and when she left me she took the trust i put in other people with her. i refuse to let myself trust anyone again like i trusted her and its just been slowly killing me keeping my feelings locked up. i refuse to let myself open up and become closer with my friends as a way to ""protect"" myself from being hurt again. it just hurts so much, why would someone do this or be like this. i try to be friendly and helpful to everyone but it get harder and harder everyday"

We had such a great and special friendship, until two years ago when he started dating his boyfriend (we're both gay). Our friendship has been eroding ever since.

He was the only person in my adult life to really make me feel seen and loved.

Every time I start talking to someone online, they always talk about how they feel lonely and are looking for friends. Then I find out they have friends (not close friends) they go out with or do things with, and I can't help but feel like I'm pathetic. Everyone seems to have at least someone in their lives and I have no one. The only person that I considered my closest friend is someone I have only texted with the last couple of years, and just found out what she looked like like a few weeks ago. On top of that, even we're drifting apart. I know it probable makes me sound awful but I just wish I could talk to someone in a similar place, someone who I could really relate to.

lonely,Melbourne loneliness,"Melbourne loneliness - 
Another blank weekend, talking to nobody, staring at the walls 
‘But there’s so much to do in Melbourne! You’re always goes out and posting pictures and going to events!’
But it’s all self-directed, all forcing myself out, one step at a time, bleeding money every second 
Just to talk to a stranger at a gig for an hour and never see them again
‘Strangers treat you like your best friend/and best friends treat you like a stranger’ (‘there are so many nights I swear that’s exactly how it happened’)
Except in passing, maybe, here or on Instagram 
I say Melbourne saves my life and it did: I can be lonely in better places, more artfully composed locations, in hipper clothes 
But I still wake up every Saturday to the deafening silence and the ringing in my head ears

lonely,"I don't feel like I can connect with anyone, not even here.","I don't feel like I can connect with anyone, not even here. - Hi

I found this sub 30 minutes ago. I'd post it on my original account but just like real life I can't really bear the shame of expressing my true thoughts without more anonymity. But whatever.

I'm a very outgoing guy in real life. I'm heavily involved in my univeristy society, I have a friend group of about 10-15ish people, and overall I appear to be quite extroverted based on people's reactions to me. The only problem is, I'm faking all of it. I hate all of them so much. I think about stabbing some of them sometimes. Most of them are quite stupid, and the ones who aren't I fear see through me sometimes. I can't tell anyone of them what I really feel like, because just as has happened in the past, I fear I will be judged, ridiculed and isolated simply for thinking the way I think.

I'm a terrible person deep down. I would do away with a lot of likely undeserving people had I the means to do so, despite knowing it's wrong. My family is quite big as well, but all of them are either narcissistic child abusers, disinterested, or children themselves. I don't feel anything towards them. I'd feel glad if they were all killed, if it wouldn't cause me a huge financial detriment. But sadly it would.

Anyway, that's enough meaningless context. I apologise. The reason why I feel like I should post the rest of this here is because I'm curious to see if anyone else is in a similar plight to me in terms of what I'm about to say. That is that, even online, I don't feel anymore connected to people.

I can reach 10 or 20 or 50 messages telling me positive things and I won't feel anything. To me those aren't real people, just useless fragments of real people posting whatever they think will gain the biggest reaction from everyone else. I'm doing it right now: letting out all of this loneliness out onto a sub which really shouldn't care about my ramblings if I'm being honest, as I'd rather find myself in a ditch 50 miles north than have to hear another recycled message telling me to 'Live a little'. I guess I'm just tired. Really tired.

I'm sorry if all of this is just coming out of left field as something stupid and incomprehensible, I'm really just letting all my thoughts splatter on here without any sort of organisation. Hopefully if it's bad it'll be grotesque enough to find itself on  r/copypasta. I like that sub.

Anyways, I'm sorry for taking up your time. Thank you."
lonely,"Skills for the price of relationships, is it worth it?","Skills for the price of relationships, is it worth it? - I'm a  with Asperger's, a extremely high IQ and a knack for science stuff, which of course makes me unpopular. I've dedicated my entire life to engineering and science and I'm loving it and I'm crazy good at it. Enough with the self boasting, the question is was it all worth it, I keep asking myself was it all worth it? We can't have everything and in my case it was the possible relationships, sure I had ""friends"" but never really felt truly wanted or needed. This just cultivated 2 polar opposite sides in me, the happy engineer and the depressed person. Never in my life had I felt that people needed(not in a work way) me or wanted to be near me for that fact, basically I always saw myself as a terrible person, because of my line of work I have cultivated a ""no filter"" habit of being extremely direct. I destroy all non work relationships and just feel fucking empty inside, the only thing that keeps me going is my passion but when it goes south or I just have nothing to do there is nothing, just a shell, dead inside, too terrified of what it's become to show it, never understood forever isolated. This just powers a never ending loop that I don't know how to break of me perceiving all kind actions as fake and feel like it's impossible to like me. It wouldn't be so bad if it were not for the fact that recently I've really started to long for human contact, the more personal/intimate one, someone who'll accept me for who I am. After 2 years of trying I'm seriously beginning to wonder if it's even possible for me to find somebody to care for and who'll do the same thing for me.

I'm sorry if I repeated myself.

lonely,I use sleep as escapism,"I use sleep as escapism - Today I found myself having a 5 hour nap. I wasn’t tired or anything, I just wanted to escape from reality.
I love sleeping. My dreams are always really vivid and fun and exciting. My dreams often feel more real than real life. The emotions I feel during my dreams are 10x more intense, exciting, fulfilling and comforting than any emotions I have on a day to day basis.
I just feel like a big chunk of me is dead. I often feel numb and all though I get some happiness out of chilling with my family or my best friend, it’s no where near as good as in my dreams.
It’s so sad when I think about my life like that, but I don’t know how to improve it. Sometimes it feels like I’m in a black pit with no sunlight. I’ve isolated myself from most people and now it’s so so so hard to make new friends and build relationships. 
I rather just go back to sleep...."

lonely,My only real friend doesn’t talk to me anymore,"My only real friend doesn’t talk to me anymore - A little context: I am autistic and have always had trouble opening up to people. Three years ago, there was this girl in my class that I really liked talking to, I somehow managed to get a huge crush on her. Over the years we became better and better friends, but it was only since the start of last summer that we started to text A LOT. 

I confessed about my feelings for her, she rejected me, but it was fine. I didn’t really have high hopes and I was actually just happy that we talked so much.

From here on we started to text even more, multiple hours a day, it was great. My crush for her quickly faded as I just liked having her as a friend.

We could talk about literally anything, nothing too crazy. This was the first time I experienced real friendship. Don’t get me wrong, I got some other ‘friends’ at school, but I barely do anything with them outside of school, and I find it difficult to talk to them.

A few weeks ago, our exams arrived. We texted even more now, averaging somewhere between 4-6 hours PER DAY. It may not look healthy to text this much, but it was a nice way to relax (for me at least. And as she also started lots of conversations, I think it’s the same for her).
The day our exams stopped, I texted her, but it took a while for her to answer, and she didn’t send more than 1 message at a time mostly. ‘No problem’ I thought, she was going to shop with some friends.

 Next day, I tried again to start a conversation. Same happened. while being sad because of boredom (I was literally gotten used to just talk to her when I was bored) I knew she was still busy with partying and all, no problem. Every day that week the same happened. When she did answer I made the mistake of instantly answering, and sending way to many messages, this was dumb.

I kept on trying, after a while I was sure there was something wrong. I made the even bigger mistake of accusing her of lying that she was always ‘busy’, which she probably just was. I HATE MYSELF FOR SAYING THAT. 

Days went on with barely any answer. I know it is completely her choice if she wants to answer or not, but I just didn’t get why she wouldn’t all of a sudden.

I asked what was wrong between us, apparently lately she became very stressed while being on her phone, including texting with me. 
I started to text her less, but I couldn’t completely let her go.

School started again and I thought it would get better... I didn’t.

After a few days of barely talking, we finally had another chat about what was really wrong, she said that she had had stress using her phone for a while, and I fucked it up even harder sending to many messages at once and accusing her of lying. WHY DID I DO THAT, i hate myself for doing it. I was really sorry, and to me it doesn’t look like she mad about it anymore, but we still don’t text as we used to.

Honestly I think something different is wrong, and she just doesn’t want to say what.

Lately we talk sometimes for like 10 minutes, than she stops answering most of the time. it is a beginning, but no where close to how much we did talk.

I MISS HER. I’ve tried talking to other people, but I just can’t. It’s not the same. I’m really getting depressed and I’m way to stressed . I want to know what is wrong and how I can fix it.


Does anyone have any advice on how I can fix this. If this is impossible, is there anything I can do to forget this.

I- lowkey want to ko her and throw her in a trashcan

she thinks shes qWeRkY ùwÚ because she listens to sad songs, and only sad songs/indie

she killed the class vibe because she forced our teacher to put on a shitty sad song in the middle of Take On Me, instead of letting us finish the song

she compared phone addiction to drug addiction, which personally pissed me off (i have close relatives who struggle with drug addiction, and its a touchy topic for me

she grouped all of the boys in my grade together, calling them”drinking partying morons”. she thinks shes woke because shes a junior in a freshman small group math class.

newsflash booboo, youre not woke, youre stupid. just stupid

she says shes the only ‘good girl’ in the school because she ‘goes antique shopping’

and she started dating someone she only knew for a week prior, and wont shut the fuck up about their traaagic breakup and the stupid, exaggerated 5th grade drama surrounding it. what do you expect? you kNEW HIM FOR A WEEK. A WEEK.

remember that psycho girlfriend meme from like, 2012? well, she is the living embodiment of that meme. she spam texts my friend so much that she literally broke her phone because of how much she was texting her. i talked to her directly for the first time today, 

(and since she befriended my friend, shes been glaring at me and giving me dirty looks, which i return with a ‘how may i help you, karen?” smile) interrupts me and her conversations to share her stupid opinions on manhating/misogyny and how ‘boys suck and girls are masterrace WaAaA DDD:&lt;‘

she acts like i dont exist, and when she does acknowledge my existence, its when shes interrupting, or when shes just trying to be a bitch to me

she makes it a point to be as dislikable as possible, then whines about not having any friends

literally nobody in my class likes her, and the one day she wasnt here, i was begging she moved

lonely,Lonely but don't want any type of relationship,"Lonely but don't want any type of relationship - It's very strange to me really and I feel stuck. I used to want normal relationships and such but nothing really good came from my search so I've become disillusioned with friendships, relationships and people in general to the point I just want people to stay away from me. I still maintain a sense of compassion for people though. As weird and possibly unhealthy as it sounds I'm kinda happy I no longer desire any type of relationship because I feel being involved with people and wanting relationships caused way more harm than just remaining by myself would. Even when people try to get to know me it doesn't work out because I have absolutely nothing to say at this point and I don't have the desire to know anybody. The idea of regular relationships just doesn't work for me and it doesn't seem to be working out for others around me either. 

I've learned to have a good time by myself but there are rare instances when I actually want to socialize but there aren't any options I feel comfortable with so I get lonely sometimes. Being asexual didn't help when I was looking for friendships because even when I was just friends with guys they still thought something was gonna happen down the line even when I assured them it wasn't. I also tried befriending those who weren't sexually attracted to my gender and it seemed they didn't want to talk at all because of that. I always lose when it comes to people so I don't bother or want to be bothered anymore.

I would get a pet but I doubt my ability to be able to train one correctly and I know it's common for pets to destroy and pee on stuff and that won't work for me since I don't have money to replace stuff.

I don't know what to expect by posting this but please say stuff like relationships are important and you can't live without love because I rather live without love or lies than deal with the potential harmful stuff people may bring to the table. I think I would rather deal with robots because I would probably have a better time but they seem far off from now and I don't even know if I'll still be alive by the time human androids are a thing.

It hurts me so bad to know that no matter how many feelings I have for a person that they’re going to leave eventually due to me and my problems. I have tried a psychiatrist and I have been told that it would take a lot of time and support to become fully able to conquer this abandonment problem. Sadly, I have had my latest break off recently although it was much more casual, I still caught feelings and now I’m ready to go. 

Thanks all, I’ve lurked here on another account for a while but this throwaway is handy to let you all know. 

Hope you all find what you’re looking for in life and don’t turn out like me please :)

Yours truly."
lonely,It's eating me.,"It's eating me. - I got addicted to someone caring about me. The warm cascade that used to run through my body feels cold now. What i wouldn't give to embrace her just once more. Everytime i saw her i gave her a tight hug because deep down i always knew their would be a last time that i held her. Nothing that good could last forever. I was right, sooner than i could of imagined and it was over. She took somthing from me that i just started to get back from another girl all those years ago. I feel so hallow, i dont talk, i dont smile, i just am. Everyday theirs alittle less of me than the day before. Im scared..."
lonely,Someone was talking shit about me in a groupchat that she didn’t realize I was in.,"Someone was talking shit about me in a groupchat that she didn’t realize I was in. - I keep thinking something’s wrong with me, but I’m not sure what it is.

I really, truly do try my best and as self-critical as I am, I don’t think I’m a bad or boring or unlikeable person. Maybe there’s something I’m missing.

When I was in high school, I had someone run a smear campaign against me because of some long-drawn-out beef dating back in middle school and lost pretty much all of my previous friends because of it. This was right after a different smear campaign run by my ex boyfriend....I found a new group of friends and I don’t have any issues with them as far as I know. But high school was tough all around and I never understood why people didn’t like me.

When I came to college, I was starting out with zero friends and had to work my way from the ground up, and I was mostly successful. 

But here I am again with some girls in my hall who I found out were using me for access to alcohol and don’t even like me. One of them texted in a groupchat that she didn’t realize I was in that she was upset that I was in her room....I found this out a couple days ago, and my heart is broken. I know I shouldn’t care what people think of me, but I just need someone to connect to. Maybe it’s just because they’re mean girls in general, but I can’t help but feel like it’s just....me.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I want to be liked, as dumb as that might be. I know I’m eccentric, I know that I’m different and I don’t really get along with those types of girls. I just don’t get it. I haven’t been able to understand why this happens to me.......I just need a friend to comfort me and/or someone who can help me navigate this and help me figure out why this keeps happening........

I just feel like I’m in high school again."
lonely,Is it just me or is it really tough to try and find friends when you're older? I don't mean acquaintances,"Is it just me or is it really tough to try and find friends when you're older? I don't mean acquaintances - I know it's a cliché. I've done all I can do for months to make friends outside of work, and even with people from work. Seems from what I found out by being around my roommates friends, is that pretty much everyone they know is a tight knit group and will never really venture to meet new people. It appears to be an English thing. Definitely varies with location, but on average I'd say that out of everyone I know in the past 2 years haven't made new connections outside of work either. Kinda bums me a bit when I try to get along or find interests, and people I feel like i can connect to, live really far away (due to work). 
Don't get me started on girls either, it's like this county has been rid of girls that want to just hang out or chat, everyone i ask at work just say cest la vie! girls seem to be chased so often that I just can't compete with 20 other guys hounding them 24/7. I have a couple great friends, but I rarely get to see either of them once a month. Alone at home and I just work every week, I don't know how much I can take it. Going to pubs or events, I just want to go home after an hour as it's just me drinking to myself with the occasional chit chat with some older guys who are regulars.
Is there something wrong with me? The more I find out about other people, I realise they're also cripplingly lonely, or just like to live in semi - isolation.

When I finish decorating my house, I'm gonna get a MF dog. A big, old, Foster doggo. Atleast we will both benefit from the mutual love and affection.

Man, being in your 20's sucks ass when you're working full time and moved away from friends and family :/"

I just want to see the care I give go my direction for once. I just want someone to have me as their first choice and not feel awkward when I'm around. I want to be taken more seriously and not as a liability for being mentally ill. - I give so much time of my existence to caring and doing and thinking about the ones close to me. I do so much crafts, kind words, cancel my urgencies to help others and yet I never ever see going in my direction. Not a thing. No invites anywhere. No empathy when I get mental breakdowns because of my pure ocd. Nothing.

And even disrespect, since ever I told them I have a mental illness they started treating me more like a child than someone on equal terms.

I just want a genuine hug from someone. I just want to be asked to hang out. I just want just a bit of love thrown in my general direction, is that so selfish?

And yet, I feel like I deserve this. 
I feel like I myself don't do enough. That I dont deserve to even have something close to friends since I only think about what it could give back to me.  That I deserve this, life filled with a head who will always hate itself and judge itself with every action and believe its own lies that it committed every atrocity and hurt everybody.

I reached out ot my homeroom teacher about this and she just said ""I dont know what to tell you"".

Well, neat I guess. My father is a sociopath so he doesnt care, plus, he told me in my face he doesnt believe in mental illness. And my mom doesnt like talking about emotions or any problem like that so cant fix things with her either.

So I really do have no one. No one. No one to tell anything anymore or have fun with anymore.

Not a single person who actively cares and sees me as an equal, decent person. Just a liability.

I just feel like my own heart got ripped out of me and was thrown somewhere."

I haven't had any since beginning of 2018. I  lost them all because I got drunk and I called everyone out on a lot of shit (which ended up ruining many relationships)
My coworkers don't even invite me to the afterwork drinking sessions (I'm actually not even included in the email that goes out every other week)
My exgf doesn't talk to me anymore because her new bf is insecure (we broke up because I fell out of love with her, we tries working on it to no avail and ended pretty well mostly)
I don't have any family either, been on my own since 16 (I'm 28) 
The groups I've joined I really haven't had success with anyone (Ive tried but you can't force people to be receptive to friendliness, and I only will ask so many times)
I don't want to date either because the last date I went on I got robbed at gunpoint by my dates bf (I wish he would have shot me tbh at this point)
It just sucks...I'm constantly bored and have no one to talk to..Hobbies can only occupy your mind so much. Reading is boring to me now, I've probably read thousands of books in my life and I don't want to stare at pages anymore. 
I'm a pretty big alcoholic when I'm at home to pass the time and if I'm not drunk I'm high on something 
I don't even like being high or drunk... I'd rather go hangout with someone to talk to someone but those are never fucking options for me. 
But I also hate going out because I'm always alone....When I go out all I see are people hanging out and laughing. It used to be that I only got sad when I saw couples, but because I'm so lonely it's everyone (couples used to make me upset more than anything cause I was lonely, and one of my friends cheating made me lose my shit and call him out, therefore I lost all my friends in 2018). 
I just don't know what to do anymore... Or how to carry on. I cant even cry anymore tears will not come out and I just feel myself constantly wanting to.

Work, interacting with customers and coworkers, was the only way I used my voice regularly. But I quit to go travelling, to try and find connections in other cultures, only to discover the world is really fucking lonely no matter where you are. I live with my Dad because I'm jobless, but he works his work takes him on trips for weeks at a time. So I just talk to my cat, and if I'm lucky, the receptionist at the gym will say 'good morning' to me. A routine of going to the gym is the only thing keeping me sane currently. I also downloaded the Wysa app for my mental health, but I often find myself spamming the 'you're not understanding' button, because it's an app and without a job, I can't pay for the real human therapist subscription.

lonely,I’m a different sort of lonely,"I’m a different sort of lonely - I practically didn’t speak until middle school, and this lost all the connections that take place there. And even than, the road to social competency was rough and I made many mistakes and even hurt other people along the way. And it’s still not over. I’m just really thankful my family provided a great home life Bc otherwise idk what I would’ve become. 

Now I’m fairly socially competent in high school, and kinda vibin; got some friends, generally well-liked. But the scars from my troubled past are still there everywhere. There’s no worse agonizing feeling than wanting to talk but feeling forced out by someone you freaked out Bc you didn’t know any better. And you can’t help but feel shame, because you were the attacker, not the victim, so what else are you supposed to feel? 

And then there’s the difficulty of having started late. Even my closest friends have closer friends, and it’s painfully obvious sometimes. For the most part I’ve accepted it, but it’s hard not to get annoyed by the fact I have to force my way into every conversation, get ignored or looked at for one second sometimes when I say something, have someone say a jokes two minutes after I said the same joke them...it gets tough and straight up depressing. 

I am tolerated. Not liked, not hated. People don’t mind me, but they don’t want me there either. And that can be the worst because it leads to unending social isolation. A black void. 

Except among the people I’ve hurt. The victims. The ones who will never leave my brain.

I want to be alone but I fear being alone at the same time. I think I'm mature enough to push it through but reality tells me otherwise. People have love for me but is love what I need?

Everytime I try to feel I breakdown and cry. It's just easier not to. Just wake up, go to work, do what I'm told, eat, come home and go to my room and sleep until the next day. Trying to think past that hurts too much. Any level of social interaction creates restlessness and anxiety. Usually sending me into a panic attack that I have to deal with on break and lunch. My mind just never shuts up. My self worth is so low, so my mind takes advantage tells me what a shitty person I am. I feel like a freak. I have no trust in anyone because of how many times I've been hurt. It blends together all to make me feel like nobody could possibly like me let alone love me. People don't like me, and they never have. Why should they? This has been going on for so long, years. I just want it to stop. I'm never going to be ""fixed"". People aren't just going to decide they like some day. I'm always going to be like this. It's to the point where my body is getting weaker. My legs feel so heavy and they ache.

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

lonely,I think I sabotaged the only friendship I had,"I think I sabotaged the only friendship I had - I don't even know what to say other than the situation seems fucked. He said we could be friends with benefits and that it was just casual, but he was in love with me and I was uncomfortable with the situation given that he's my best friend. I tried it once but than felt really conflicted. He thought that try meant casual sex until I found someone else and not possibly just a single casual hook up to see. I said a lot of shit while we were hooking up. I don't know why. Things that I regret knowing now how he interpreted them. I think I've been starved for love for so long that my heart just got caught up in the moment. I don't know. I'm shit at communicating my feelings and I think he feels like I was leading him on (I mean, he does. We talked about it). 

I've been a recluse for the last 5 years, slowly getting worse until I moved out of a toxic environment. The last couple of months have been hard, but I've been trying to put myself out there. I had my first sexual encounter and I think he was jealous that it wasn't with him. 

Maybe I should be fine with casual sex, but I'm not. It took a lot to put myself out there to try for him and I feel like my actions after the fact are just me using this as a way to push him away because I'm scared of intimacy. 

I don't know exactly how he sees it. We talked, but I feel like he blames me for the things I said and for leading him on. He said I gave him a glimpse of what he wants and than ripped it away. I don't think it was ever casual for him.

I feel horrible. Wtf is my life? Sometimes I don't mind being so lonely. Days like today,  I just want to trek out into the wilderness and never see another human soul again."

lonely,Meta: Are you allowed to be lonely?,"Meta: Are you allowed to be lonely? - Apparently the only people who are allowed to feel lonely are single people.. according to this sub.
First of all if your focus is on the fact the you are single maybe that's part of the problem. No one wants someone desperate and clingy. I've seen people say ""if I had an SO I would get upset if they didn't spend every second with me"" (paraphrased). That is unhealthy and a relationship won't survive with you hovering over them, and being annoyingly clingy. Just an FYI.

ALSO you can be lonely in a healthy relationship! This gatekeeping bs from here is so annoying. You don't get to decide that someone isn't allowed to feel how they do because you're jealous.
People need friends. You can be lonely if you have an SO and no friends. You can be lonely with friends and no SO. You can be lonely without either. And you can fucking be lonely even if you have both. It's a fucking feeling.
Stop telling people in relationships they're faking loneliness. Stop gatekeeping. This is so stupid.
If that is how you're gonna act. Like you're the only person who is allowed to feel like that. NO WONDER YOU'RE ALONE. No one wants to be around a constant pity party of 'boo hoo my life sucks but you can talk about yours or have problems because you have something I dont'

Maybe it's your attitude. Your outlook. Your behaviours. It's 100% not the fault of the rest of the world who has what you do not. 

Let other people express their feelings.

The purpose of subs like these is to let people express, and feel like they are not alone in feeling that way. Not to drag people down because you are insecure. 
Be nice to people here. We're here because just like you, we are lonely. It doesn't matter what we have in our lives. Everyone is allowed to feel that way. Leave a positive comment, an upvote, or some kind of support on the posts you see. Don't belittle them and make them feel more isolated.

TL;DR Stop gatekeeping loneliness."

lonely,cutting ties.,"cutting ties. - I just want to let my thoughts out somewhere because i can’t even talk to anyone else about my hardships. so it started when my best friend started hooking up with this new guy. me being open minded didn’t have anything against him until she would come to me with her problems of being the rebound and not feeling validated by him. at this point I figured he wasn’t a good guy and told her to drop him now instead of later on. fast forward a couple months, they’re in a serious relationship and hanging out everyday. I didn’t want to be the type to give my best friend an ultimatum, so I told her that she doesn’t need my approval of dating him and to just make time for us to hang out as well. things went downhill from here, it’s like she kept on saying that she and him felt guilty that I wouldn’t hang out with them but in actuality I was fine doing my own thing, I just didn’t feel comfortable around him so I asked she respect my decision. turns out she wants ALL three of us to hangout like how it was with her and her ex boyfriend. to which I said that I wouldn’t mind hanging out ONCE in a while but not all the time, but she wasn’t having it. then she started to act differently, whenever we hung out it was for the sake of saying we “hung out” and not that she wanted to. it felt like I was forcing her to hangout with me, but it was never like that before this new guy even with her past boyfriend. And I don’t want to force anyone to hang out with me, it just makes me feel bad. it just sucks because we were attached to the hip basically, I was living with her and we would just do our things together. now it feels like I lost someone and I feel so alone. this made me realize that for the past two years, now that I’m a sophomore in college that I limited myself to only hanging out with her. I moved out and it really hit me how lonely I am. i obviously didn’t want a boy to come between us, but for the sake of our friendship, moving out was the right move because we would have started to resent each other if it continues. i think to myself maybe it’s because I’ve never been in an actual relationship and I don’t understand but I do know that I would try to compromise to have my friends and my significant other. i don’t know how to meet new people or anything like that and I want to send my memes to her but it just feels awkward. she hasn’t spoken to me since, nor seems really affected by it. it’s like she’s fine because she has her bf while I lost my best friend, someone I thought was my ride or die.

I have great memories with them. And I had a good childhood. I'm just sad that I used all my time with people who ended up leaving me for nothing. And the worst thing is that they're still friends. :)

lonely,Been lonely for a while,"Been lonely for a while - OK so I'm going to be perfectly honest here I've been pretty lonely for a few years now. I have my family and professional councillors supporting me and they always try to point out the positives and help me to see them. ""you're a good looking guy with your whole life ahead of you, we just need to help you find some positive company"" they say. So we look for clubs and things to do that involve meeting other people with similar interests but for someone who suffers from anxiety and hates busy places it's not the easiest objective to achieve.

I also thought since I'm struggling so much in real life to connect with people, what about trying online? So I tried Tinder... Literally no matches. Was it my pics? So I changed my pics... Still no matches. Was it my bio? I tried to make that more interesting... Still no matches.

So then I tried Bumble... Nothing.

Then I tried PoF and Match... At least I got views... No messages, no matches, no interest. I reached out to some that I thought I might have a connection with saying stuff like I'd read their profile and noticed they liked doing XYZ and asked them some questions relating to XYZ, but got absolutely no response.

No idea what I'm doing wrong except trying to show an interest in people and get them to show an interest in me but honestly feels like a ""why do I bother? They're clearly not interested and you're just making yourself feel even worse"" situation."

It was my birthday a couple of months ago and I went to a bar with them. At one point basically everyone started leaving, and a couple of people pretended to go home but actually ditched me and went to a club. One of them told me where they went when I texted her to see if she got home safely, berated me and swore she'd asked me to come with her. She told me to go and I headed there with another friend who was staying over at my place.

It turned out the club wouldn't let people in after a certain hour (we were five minutes late). I called her and texted her, and she ignored it. The app said she was online. She even admitted she saw it when she gave me a shitty apology over a month later and said ""I don't know if I got distracted or what"". It was past 4 AM. My friend and I were far away from home, and she knew it.

It's not just that that hurt me and I don't want to make plans with her ever again. It's that everyone else is much better friends with her than they are with me, and they didn't care, so I basically lost them too.

As I said, I have a lot of trouble making friends, and I was incredibly hurt because there were people who were supposedly very enthusiastic about being friends with me, even though I'm pretty reserved.

Class begins again in a couple of months and I dread seeing them again. I just want to pretend they don't exist."

I have one friend and we see each other weekly, and since everyone i know is at school, i feel like i dont know anybody in my own city. Next year i have a ride to a decent east coast university, but until move in day comes, its just the same lonliness and boredom..."
lonely,Maybe I don’t have a good reason to feel this way but here we are nonetheless,"Maybe I don’t have a good reason to feel this way but here we are nonetheless - It’s about 10 pm right now. My day was pretty boring and woke up feeling really sullen. Tried keeping myself occupied with video games and beyblades (yes I’m a 19 y/o guy who loves them still, sue me haha). I’m usually fine with just keeping busy but after thinking for a bit I felt like I wanted to talk to someone. I know a lot of people between family and friends yet I’m not really close with most of them. And for all of those who are, they’re either busy all the time or asleep right now. I’m not exaggerating, I have only had maybe one fully uninterrupted conversation with a friend in the past month, and they live in the state above me. I’m just feeling pretty lonely at the moment, have been for a while (regardless of whether or not I’m productive so it’s not an activity issue per se). Just hoping someone understands and wants to talk about it with me. Would appreciate just having a chat about anything honestly. 

TL;DR: feeling lonely despite knowing a lot of ppl, want to make a new friend"
lonely,Got lied to again,"Got lied to again - I posted here a while ago saying that I feel lonely after getting cheated on for the 3rd time in a row. Well, after a while I met a girl that wasn't the most attractive or anything like that, but I liked her. After hooking up a bunch of times, a few days ago she just ghosted me because apparently she just used me in order to get the attention of someone else who she described him as ""more worthy of her"", amd from there up until now, she said nothing. Now I'm all alone again, not talking to anyone and my anxiety levels are incredibly high, and I'm also afraid that my career will be affected by my current state of mind, as I have to communicate with a lot of people at work."
lonely,I (18M) severely screwed up my relationship with my (21F) only friend... (tldr at bottom),"I (18M) severely screwed up my relationship with my (21F) only friend... (tldr at bottom) - God I feel awful. I have just screwed up my relationship with my only friend, and I am completely to blame. It’s a long story, but I’m autistic, and I have not had friends in a very long time, so I am severely emotionally and socially incompetent. The first person I made friends with in a long time was this girl I sat next to in my uni class. I’m , shes a 21F. Were both super shy history students, and she has a lot in common with me. She admitted she is quite socially awkward herself, but unlike me, she has a few close friends.

Essentially at some point along our friendship, I think I asked her out, but I honestly do not remember. I was very confused at the time. Anyway, she freaked out, she’s never been asked out before and has never had a boyfriend despite her age. She kinda tried to avoid me and stuff, and I kinda texted her asking about things in a very awkward and self-conscious matter. I’ve had people ghost me in the past, so I’ve been scared of that, and so I kinda did this quite a lot. She assured me that it was fine, and we cleared things up, or at least I thought I did. In the mean time we kinda hung out a bit. Next semester we meet up again and hung out at a cafe. Later on we then saw a horror movie together, the movie kinda sucked but I think it was fun anyway. She kinda approached me in the hallway when I saw her and stuff, and I thought that was her showing that she liked me (platonically) at the time.

Anyway, I guess I sent one of these super self-conscious messages again, just today, I essentially was talking about how I’ve been lonely for quite a long time, and how I was wondering about the state of the relationship and a bunch of stupid things. She replies, saying that she basically thinks that I’ve been doing this far too much, and thinks the whole thing has all been stressful and awkward. She then kinda deconstructs out entire relationship, and shows that a whole bunch of it has been me just being a mess I guess. She was very blunt, because I forced her to be blunt. She tells me she hung out with me, to try to get me to stop being so intense by sending stuff like I did, and she only approached me in the hallways because she thought it would have been rude to ignore me. We talk about it a bit, and I try to explain things a bit. She tells me shes not angry at me, just overwhelmed and confused. I thank her for being honest, and she tells me shes glad it’s cleared up. I then add one more text just explaining why I’ve been so emotionally immature, and incompetent, but tell her it’s alright and that she did not need to reply to it or anything. 

That’s where we left it off, and now I’ll give her space and won’t text her, at least till after the reading break in three weeks, but will leave her to text me if she wants, though I doubt she ever will, and I think that’s the end of my only friendship. Frankly I feel awful, that I have just heard the only friendship I’ve had in like 6 or something years was essentially fake. I feel awful because I actually made her quite upset, based on how some of the texts sounded. I don’t know what to do. Relationships always fall apart for me, and I’m not sure if I’ll ever make a friend. Despite all this, I still like her, and I hope we can eventually fix things.

TLDR: I () screwed up the relationship with the only friend (21F) I have had in such a long time, by being overly intense and self-conscious. She kinda got a bit fed up after this pretty overwhelming text I sent her, and deconstructed our entire friendship, explaining how shes found it awkward and stressful more than anything. We talk it over a bit and leave it on a note that were glad things have been cleared up, but I doubt we’ll talk again in the near future, or ever."

lonely,Fifty Sixth Time Getting Rejected Fifty Seventh Time's The Charm?,"Fifty Sixth Time Getting Rejected Fifty Seventh Time's The Charm? - Yeah, you heard that right... 56 rejections. Makes me feel like shit, and to make it worse she lied. She said she is already with someone, even known I took the precautions, and asked all her friends if she was single, they all said yes. I think it's because I am fat, or maybe because I collect militaria, and ""oh you don't want to go out with the kid who likes to collect things that the defenders of the Motherland wore!"", or ""oh don't go near him, he listens to foreign music from the 80's"" Well if your curious here's a transcription of our conversation:

Me: Hey! Name!

Her: Oh hey Me, What?

\*she looks at me

Me: I-I... I H-Heard you were g-going to be p-put in a lower class, sorry n-next week, and I-I have somethi-ing t-to

tell y-you... I-I like y-you, like... like, alot... Sorry...

\*she gives me a nervous saddened look

Her: No, you don't have to be sorry... But I am already with someone...

Me: Oh... Sorry, Sorry

Her: No, don't be, your a cool guy!

Me: Okay... Sorry, I am going to go

Her Friend: HEY Name when is this guy gonna leave!

\*I walk away telling myself that I fucked up

and yes, I stuttered a lot, probably more than what I put here since I wrote this after I got home from my class, and I have terrible short term memory. Honestly I think I might be going insane. They definition of insane is ""Trying the same thing over, and over expecting different results"", well I have tried to get a girlfriend 56 times, and have gotten pretty much the same results, either: 1 a bullshit excuse, 2 an insult, or 3 a plain old ""no"".

I have so many reasons to be miserable(I couldn't count them if I tried), and so few reasons to be happy. My boss told me a laundry room countertop was worth more than me today. I know he didn't mean it, but my self worth is so low that really I don't know. I'm a failure in life and the people that matter most to me always leave. I look at the world and I feel like a lunatic because I say it looks like it's dying. I'm so tired, and I just want my heart to stop breaking everyday. I say it can't get worse, and then it just does. I don't want to be scared anymore. I want my happiness back. I want my soul back.  I want to feel normal again. I want a reason to hope.

I've  had two major friend groups that I had to disassociate from once I  realized that I was only in the group to be the butt of the joke, both  during High School and College, so I have very few friends that even  care about my existence.  They hardly keep in touch, I am often reaching  out to little or no response.  I play video games often, and frequent  Discord, so I would have assumed I would have had an easier time, but  many of the people I've met through Twitch Chats/Discords/Games have  been really toxic or rude or just unfriendly, so I have yet to make a  single online friend that I hadn't met in real life prior since x360  days when I just played a lot of CoD in Middle School.  I know this is  pathetic, but It's getting depressing having no contact with anyone, or  mocked when I  try to dive into a community.   I twitch stream in hopes to find more people to chat with, but I'm amongst the 1000+ people with 0  viewers. Any Suggestions or should I just hop off a bridge and get it  over with already?"

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

lonely,No Title,"No Title - ""There are plenty of fish in the sea"" is not an accurate quote. What if the fish are bad? What if you don't like that school? Will you leave?

Most likely go back to square 1. 

What about a giant apple tree? One as big as a mountain. Your school is a branch. An apple is a person. All the apples on your branch are withered way or rotton. Will you take one? Take it and accept the fate you will have with this person? No. You will go down a new branch, a different path. Some will be bear. Some branches are broken, a path not ment to be followed. Some branches will have better  apples than others. Will you take that one? No, you will keep searching. Will you give up? Stop your search and climb down your tree. Will you surrender your search? No, you will move to another branch one that contains meaning, one that hold truth. Then you find it. The perfect apple. Will you take it or leave thinking it will never work out? No, you will take that apple, you will find the branch that takes you to the top. To the peak of your life. You stop knowing your search is complete. You can finally stop stressing. You can finally rest your search.

Hopefully you find that person who is right for you."

She really began to give unenthusiastic responses and non committals when I asked if she’d be down for another time after the weekend.

Last girl (F20) gave me her number after a good convo and I said we should meet up.

lonely,"I need a ""drunk text"" girlfriend","I need a ""drunk text"" girlfriend - About me:  over 1/2 century old American male.  I recently discovered that I am not at all as cool as I thought I was.  Therefore, I have withdrawn from most social interactions now, and am down to two core male friends.  Neither know or suspect the deep loneliness I feel, and neither does my very conservative and uptight wife of 20+ years, whom I do love.

Each morning I awaken to my dismay, but soldier on through the day anyways.  One of my only joys left is having some delicious craft beer (NOT IPA!!) and enjoying the buzz that comes from it, unbeknownst to my spouse, who thinks that having a beer or 2 once a week (or month!) makes me an alcoholic.  To be fair, I was the child of 2 of them, so there is that.

when I get my beer buzz on, I get chatty, but the flavor of my humor is not suited for a happy home life.  Nothing usually nasty or raunchy, but sometimes.

I used to have a drunk text GF, but that ended about 5 years ago.  That is a story for another time, and it is pretty good too.

What does a drunk text girlfriend do?  Just tolerate me for a few hours a month.  Maybe flirt, maybe tell me some deep secrets (my crisis counselor 1st wife turned me into a good listener).  When I am light and happy, I love to interact, hear and tell stories, and dance on the razors edge of inappropriateness.

I have no active sex life, so my drunk text GF will act as a placebo for that.  I am one of those people that becomes a ""lover"" when they get buzzed.  I probably get emotional and weepy sometimes too, but that is the underlying depression leaking out, so just ignore that or tell me to STFU.

I have played video games since they were invented.  I have ridden 3 days to get to and enjoy Sturgis.  I have fired a machine gun from a hovering helicopter.  I have recently started to enjoy papercrafting.  So I am all over the place, or uniquely experienced in some aspects of life.

To be clear, my loneliness only surfaces whence intoxicated, so I reach out, like now.  I just need someone fun to play with for those brief few hours to re-awaken that small kernel of passion that I keep tucked in my lower levels of consciousness."

I love my wife deeply, and I will never get creepy or rude with you.

I love dogs! They are my heart and soul. If you love dogs too, let's share pictures of our dogs, and stories.

I live in the Eastern part of the U.S., near the Great Lakes. It's snowy, icy, and cold, but I love going outside anyway. I love Natural Beauty, snow, ice, the Ocean, the stars, the Moon, the Universe. I love life, and feeling alive.

I also love 420. I am a 420 guru yogi, I practice hypnosis, meditation, yoga, and positive, healing psychic energy.

I am addicted to Psybient Music, it is the music of my soul.

I believe friendship is magical. Friends help me in so many ways. I am addicted to positive people. Life is cruel, painful, and unfair, but positive friends help us carry on, stand up, and face the crisis, the best way we can.

To be my friend, you have to have something in common with me. You can be any age, gender, race, location, but we have to have some common interest, for the conversation to build on. You have to be willing to share something about yourself, and trust me, just a little, so a friendship can grow.

I love hypnosis! I've hypnotized people in every corner of the world, using online video like Messenger. I would love to hypnotize you, to feel more confident, motivated, to heal pain from the past, and to help you reach your goals.

Hypnosis is the opposite of small talk. We both express our spiritual side... We talk about our fears, pain, and dreams. It's magical, and it's easy to make a special friendship through hypnosis.

maybe back then, i didn't have a car, a phone, a washing machine. maybe i didn't own a lot of shoes, or name brand clothes. maybe i didn't have instagram, or reddit, or twitter.

but i could tell i was genuinely happy. 

everyday i walk into school, come back home, and i drown in pity. fucking pity. i hate it. 

i wish that i could feel the 'american dream' that everyone's feeling. i'm not. if what i'm feeling is the american dream, then i hate it. i hate it so much. i almost wish i could stomp and spit on it.

i've talked about this with other people, and they all say that 'i came here for a reason' and 'it makes you tougher'. yeah, i feel tougher, but i also don't feel anything else except that.

i've tried getting to know other filipinos in my area, but it's not the same. they're all so white-washed, and try to make us convert religions even though we say countlessly that we \*will not\*.

i just wanna go home :( 

i feel so lonely and i cry on a daily basis now. i only get about 3-4 hours of sleep because i know that when i close my eyes, i'm gonna remember all my friends and family and i'll start sobbing again. i just stay up on reddit, or playing video games, or watching youtube. the only reason why i haven't started crying at school (an exception for that time in the bathroom and the end of one of my classes) is because of my art and history class. those are the only two classes that i actually have an interest in.

This happens almost every night. I genuinely can’t remember the last time I went a full week (maybe even half a week) without crying myself to sleep at an ungodly hour like this.

I know I’d fall asleep faster if I had someone to hold me or if I had a friend so that I wouldn’t have to be sad and emotionally exhausted in the first place, but I don’t.

I haven’t been held in so long and I’m just so tired."

lonely,"I need help, I got in a situation with a close friend and I'm not sure how to move on","I need help, I got in a situation with a close friend and I'm not sure how to move on - Its so bad.

There's too much to say that its overwhelming. And I told some wrong group of people it and they made things a lot worst.

Someone told me a lot of stuff when I talked to them.

I eventually got nervous talking to them since they only talked to me like once every two months whereas my other friend (who always made sexual jokes about her to me and made rude comments about her to me) gets to be their casual instant messenger buddy.

Eventually my heavy alcoholic dad started getting me alcohol in exchange for me using my food stamps to buy the family stuff. I told her that I drink alcohol to write messages to her on the weekend so that I feel nervous. I sent very horrible ""drunk messages"" to them too.

They said on Twitter that they 'accept my heartfelt apology.'

Well later, she talked to our other friend (the one that for 15 years has always gotten every friend I make both offline and online hate me and like him instead, and he says he just ""uses me"" to play video games with, and in online games he has me unparty with him in online towns and he said its because he's ""embarrassed to let others know that we're friends,"" and he was always saying negative things to me like that I'm not funny and that he could make my projects in less than a day if he wanted to.) and he convinced her to stop talking to me and only talk to him. 

He sent screenshots to me at the time of them talking about me, looking down on me and stuff.

She posted out of context screenshots of my private messages to her on her public Twitter which ruined my reputation.

There's like a lot more to say but I'm so exhausted from all the times that I've explained this over the past 3 years.

When I talked to her in August to try to clear things up, she said its good that I feel bad and that I should continue to feel bad and that she ""refuses to budge an inch"" in regards to removing the screenshots she posted on her twitter of me and that I need to ""face the consequences.""

I showed them chatlogs of how the only reason I talked to them was cuz our other friend kept telling me ""You know your ex-girlfriend? She got in contact with me and we're friends now and I told her to stay the HELL away from you because you sometimes smoke weed and drink beer."" (which led me to chatting with them in 2015 on Tumblr, because he always makes people hate me and like him instead and I was getting tired of it and I wanted to prove to them that I would be a good friend.) and she said ""...Really? Why did you think that would help anything? He's a trusted friend of mine..."" (she's still following him on twitter btw.)

I have so many questions for her!!! But she called me a ""stalkee"" when I talked to her in august saying its been over 10 months since I contacted them and saying I improved a lot and to please take down the tweets of me.

I have so many things I want to know... When we talked on Tumblr in 2015, she told me out of the blue ""If I met you today, I'd totally be your Sensei!!"" I asked her what that means, and she told me it means that I am her ""Kohai."" I asked her what the word Kohai means, and she responded by saying it means that she's my Sensei. I keep thinking about it every day... What does it mean that she's my sensei and I am her kohai? Doesn't it mean that I should care a lot about what she thinks about me and stuff (which I already do..?)

I wish I could clear everything up. I told this situation to the wrong group of people online, and now I get bullied over this. I'm trapped in it. Whenever I try to move on, there's haters on the internet that bring this stuff up over and over again (part of the reason I contacted them in August asking them to please end it all and delete the screenshot tweets of me so that me and her stop getting bugged about this whole situation and so that I can just move on.)

I don't know what to do... I need help....!!"

Lately I have been losing my mind over a breakup that happened ages ago and not being able to find anyone new has made me really upset. Everytime I see couples at school my whole body is filled with rage. I am also super insecure about the way I look I hate myself so much, and I wish I could tell my mum about my body image issues because it's normal for my age and shouldn't be so consuming but my mum kept changing the topic when I spoke to her about it so I gave up. I'm secretly seeing a school counsellor but she wants our sessions to end in 3 weeks and I will have nothing. I wish people loved me, I wish my parents let me talk to them about anything, I wish they didnt yell at me everyday and I wish they loved me. I've never been so close to suicide in my life"

Yeah I know they have passed by far their useful life. Tbh, I'm not really sure about why do I keep them. My parents gave them to me at 19. Which was kind of absurd, cause I wasn't stupid enough to have sex without precautions, and 19 seems like a little late... but I got them, I can't remember, but I probably said that and made a sarcastic comment about how they would be there till I died...Which now that I think about it, almost happened like two years ago... anyway, I'm sure that if I die of ""old age"" with them in the wallet, I will get a life trophy or something, and maybe unlock a sandbox mode."

lonely,Anxiety over upcoming birthday,"Anxiety over upcoming birthday - I’m turning 30 this year. I am a male living in the Midwest with zero friends. My family doesn’t live too far away but they’re in another state. 

As the day grows closer I am always wondering what I should do to celebrate? I haven’t had a party or anything with friends to celebrate my birthday maybe since I was 22? 

Now that I’ve moved so much for work, I’ve made so many friends and lost them over distance. Now I’ve almost been here a year and I just live alone, the only reasons for me to leave my house are to workout and go to work. 

I hate seeing all these “30 things I learned becoming 30” and celebratory posts from their friends...it’s just mega discouraging. I’m probably not going to be able to make good enough friends by the time my bday rolls around. 

Not sure if anyone has any suggestions but I mainly just wanted to get my feelings out."

You get told that you're whiny or expect too much from others. That your friends do care about you. What friends? I haven't had a friend in years. I've tried explaining that nobody has ever messaged me, and that the friendship is always one-sided. That if I never messaged first, that they would never speak to me. 

I was asked if I was spamming those  friends of mine, if that's why they never messaged me. If I was being creepy. One person went as far to say that if someone said ""how are you?"" to them it would creep them out. 

A place where you're supposed to be able to vent, and I was accused of being stalkerish. Accused of being whiny and ""mad"". 

Just for releasing all this pent up stress. If you're lonely, have no friends and want to vent about it. Don't vent there. You're just going to be shat on. 

My head is empty, I can't feel anything, so I apologise if anyone of this sounds short and choppy and overall weird. I may wake up soon and regret even posting this. Just stay away from those chatrooms if you're looking for a listening ear or someone who understands... you won't get it."

I dont know what people think of me. How do I appear to strangers? It's bad enough I dont have a social life outside of work. I dont even talk to my parents. I only ever have less than 5 friends from school I still have contact with. I feel lonely. I have hour long conversations with myself in the bathroom. I get home from work and dont know what to do. What else can I do in life? My life has always been full of regrets that ive not learnt from. What is life? Im just waiting for death at this point. If im being honest, ""please kill me"" is on mind.

So I was kinda strange person from the day I born, in school I liked to dress differently then others I had long hair, I was hippy. Firstly I was taking it very deeply that others laugh at me and make fun and I suddenly stopped, I started faking being how you call ""normal"". I've been like that maybe for 1 year or 2. But then my life became so boring for me, I started to think about meaning of it and I was in Existential crisis (This video can help with it, I wish it was released when I had it https://youtu.be/MBRqu0YOH14) So basically after a long fight with myself in my head I said ""Fuck it"" I will be weirdo i will enjoy my life even if I will be like that alone for my life, and in high school I was not confident, everyone was still looking at me strange and laughing, there was long time period when I missed lessons because of that, but after I finished it, my brother invited me to live in London ( Family is the answer everyone, trust me, they will help in need) And when I came here, all that shit I have been through gave me strength, I joined university, I'm working in company which manager is my friend (He's weirdo aswell!!! Yes people like you exist in this world, actually everyone is a bit) I also feel in love with one girl, she broke my heart not long time ago, but now I can speak with girls (Still kinda hurts) . And I'm still weird. You know what is the biggest problem, to not do it ( I know anxiety and maybe other mental problems) but just be ""weird"" be the person you are and show it to everyone, because without walking it's impossible to get at the on the road. And also about loneliness, trust me there's no one that can heal that pain apart yourself, fall in love with yourself, with how you think, become passionate about it and show others what passionate weirdo you are,  but start with yourself, challange yourself trust me you will feel good as never after.

It’s currently 2am and I feel a relapse coming... but I have nobody I’m close enough to to talk about this. I can always tell it’s coming because I get suicidal thoughts. Not that I would ever do it but I don’t really care to continue living. I do it for my family, but lately I feel like I’m letting them down. Now my anxiety is triggered by this and I just feel like a mess of negative emotions and I’d love someone to talk to."

lonely,It's the 5th of February?! Happy birthday to me.,"It's the 5th of February?! Happy birthday to me. - I hate my birthday! Nobody cares about it anymore. When I was younger my parents would throw me a big party and all my ""friends"" would come. Now those people don't even remember to wish me happy birthday. All my friends disappeared. My parents went on a vacation to Hawaii. I always wanted to go there, but I guess it's for the better they work a lot and they deserve it. But why on my birthday? And this isn't the worst problem. My cousin had a car crash yesterday and now... he is gone. He was my best friend,my brother. He loved cake. I miss him so much. I love you bro should said that more often.




Thanks for reading. I just wanted to write it out I guess."

I do like writing and reading especially about the students life in the US. I’m a sophomore of the petroleum uni. I’ve been alone for long time. Yes I have friends from here but there’re not like a real friends who you can talk to when you have a tough time. But I need just a one real friend who is gonna share with me about his/her problems and I’m ready to help you as much as it possible. I’m the person who can give a lot in a friendship, but I’ve almost never get the same from the others. Feel free to text me!"
lonely,Feel like a victim of fate/life doesn't want me to be happy.,"Feel like a victim of fate/life doesn't want me to be happy. - There were times where I even got so sick of being alone that it was like would become a different person. Aggressive, pushy, demanding that I get my way. 

Deciding I was sick of being a mere victim of fate and taking serious action, to the point of ruining some relationships. Not even just my own. And I've carried that regret for years now. Wishing I could go back and fix what I've broken. Maybe then I would be deserving of moving on and starting my own relationships."
lonely,my life is falling apart,"my life is falling apart - I know that the title seems drastic but please bear with me. I turned 18 this past Saturday, which I never thought I would make it to to being with and now I don't think I'm going to make it past it. It's a shitty feeling when people don't wish you happy birthday even when you always do for them. Even when they're aware that it is your birthday. I've been feeling down on life since before that but now I feel even worse. Two of my ""best friends"" cancelled on me for my birthday, when I asked them to save the date weeks in advance but waited till the week of to inform me. I've had a birthday party every year except for this year because I wanted it to be low stress and spend it with my family, and I consider them family. I'm even supposed to be going on a graduation trip with one of them but it doesn't look like it's going to happen because I don't think she wants it to happen. She hardly talks to me anymore, keeps the conversations dry, and just overall gives me the vibe that she doesn't give a shit about me anymore. I don't know what to do. I'm so sad and all I can help but do is think about it and cry. This is my first ever reddit post so please be kind because I don't know where else to turn to right now and I can just use some nice words."

But he lives in a different state so a relationship is not gonna happen. Though I have these feelings for him and I created a fantasy in my head of us meeting and having this fantastic time together.

lonely,i forget that other people don't see being alone / friendless as the default,"i forget that other people don't see being alone / friendless as the default - like, that they just expect to have friends and a community. it's not that they don't see an existence like this as possible, but that they just don't see it at all. it seems to not occur to people, almost as if they can't even entertain it as a viable way of living, or compatable with their own existence. as if they think they are so great that being friendless is completely antithetical to every quality they posses.

and honestly? most people don't just lose all their friends and adapt to this abject state like i did. they never need to entertain the thought of being alone, so they don't bother. it's probably better to live like that.

it's like that ""you are loved"" platitude. it ASSUMES that everyone is ""loved"" somehow. it shows that people simply cannot cognate the possibility of an exisence sans love. 

i wish i could be naive again. and experience loneliness, in all its pain, as an emotion defined by the stark contrast of real social connection and bliss. rather than the nothingness of my 'default state'."

But I feel so lonely and hurt and confused and alone in the bed now and he’s so stoic and cruel and I thought I would be done feeling this way, but obviously I’m not. I just want to get over it and not care as much. I hate him and love him at the same time. And I hate crying and feeling lonely."
lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

But it's not like it takes someone 30 minutes to eat a pb and j so at least 20 minutes of that is spent in mindless chatter. Most of the time I feel lonely even when I'm at a table filled with 7 other people. Maybe that's my problem. but then again, whenever I bring up being lonely, no one really says anything. And it's not like I'm asking for their pitty, I'm just telling them so they don't think I'm angry with them, which I usually never am. It really doesn't matter though, just gotta make it through those 30 minutes everyday I guess."

lonely,Why i am so alone?,"Why i am so alone? - In the last 10 days I have been going through a lot of stress and sadness. So 10 days ago I asked a girl (friend of 9 years) on a date, she accepted and the other day we went to play bowling and eat pizza, at the end we kissed and I sent her home. The other day I was happy and very productive at work so i got home early. After relaxing my cousin called me and said he wanted some help with a math exam (pretty hard) so i didn't have any other solution and started helping him cheating on it. On Thursday I got a call from my boss telling me that he wants to talk face to face in the next morning. The next day I go to work 30 minutes early and start talking with my boss about the work I need to finish today. Everything went good and finished everything at the time, so I go and talk to my boss again.

At the end my boss tells me you are fired  because we don't have the budget to keep you.
The next day after my cousin ""finished"" the exam he tells me that I suck and I am evil for not helping him out getting the best grade. And yesterday my crush sends a video accidentally to me. She deleted it but it was to late because i saw the video. The fu**king bi*ch was getting fu**ed by someone i really hate. :-( Why why why are you doing this to me why? That mf killed my little brother, he killed my little brother. And you the only friend I had for 9 years, the only one, hurted me so hard this way. Why? Why i need to suffer more? :-("

How do I truly become happy from within? How can I be happy with myself and accepting of my glaring flaws? Why are there so many options in life? What is the person I want to become? Where did my passion go? How do I develop better habits and resolve? Why do I hate the world sometimes? What’s causing all this negativity? Is something in me out of balance? How would my life change for the better if I ate, slept, and exercised properly? Will my anxiety every go away? Will I ever become a better person? What does the ideal me even look like? How do I deal with uncertainty ? How should I deal with stagnation? Should I have kids? Should I get married? What if the person I’m with isn’t my soul mate?

lonely,Feel like a failure,"Feel like a failure - I had just been hired on to help and do some work to earn some money pay was $18 a hour today I ended up quitting after realizing I didn't have a legit way to get to and from work. It would of been a week today and since I had stayed on i know and trust me i had been taking the cab ubers is jusy as much of a cab company they too arent any cheaper still never have used uber..

Cabs and uber... are close to that $40 a way I did find someone else who would be able to get me from my place and to where I needed to go same for after work she only charged $20 a way

I got stood again this morning that too had helped to make up my decision fuck man I'm already regretting it but at the same time I need to save some money.

yesterday and today I was ready both days but had got stood up I'm just done like I got nobody here that's willing to help me to get to where I need to go like.

My phone even if I wanted too I couldn't make any calls out this morning I feel like I'm just making up excuses...

I feel like a there's only so much I can do like my situation is shit and I want to make things better but it's like nope that just can't happen.

I'm gonna see if I can find something in my city or something that's a little closer to where I am.

I was actaully liking and enjoying this shit too like the boss was chill and cool as fuck he always covered for my cab but I can't always have him paying $40 for 2 cab rides $80 a day.

I mean the chick charged only $20 there and $20 back only $40 a day half of what I pay for a cab I don't always have cash on money either to always be cabbing or doing a rideshare.

I ended up texting my boss a messaging him and telling him how much I appreciated him for even giving me a chance to try and do anything like what they do they install bowling lanes just in case if anyone was wondering."

I act and do technical stuff for Theatre."
lonely,Just wanted to get this off my chest.,"Just wanted to get this off my chest. - I have spent the last 5 years walking alone in my university campus. It got worse as I started smoking while just standing there alone. I know its dumb, but I kinda love cigarettes now. At least when I finish a class I have something to do ya know. And like, I don't suffer from anxiety or anything like that. Like I am decent looking and my social skills are good. I was the funny guy back in high-school. Like not the class clown but the guy that would say something that would make you fall out of your seat. I am still like that, whenever I talk to someone I can hold up a conversation and show that funny side of me. However it never worked out. Most of the people that know me are acquaintances that wouldn't hangout. On many occasions it feels like I am getting somewhere with somebody but nahh...BUT THEN I met two people. My middle school bully out of everybody and a chick from work. I started hanging out with people after not going out with anyone for 9 months. He considers me his best friend. I am in the process of throwing company away tho, because I feel like I am not being myself. I feel like the guy they know is just someone that adapted to their liking so he could just have some company. And now, I don't have the energy to hold up a conversation. I feel drained all the time whenever I am around them. For some reason loneliness feels like home. Its like I am OK with being lonely rather than feel desperate (I got him a phone, when his phone was stolen, and drove him, and his girlfriend everywhere, so they can make out....just in the hopes that we would remain friends). They are decent people but I am fucked up I guess. They would give me advice all the time about ""how I should be more outgoing"" and ""try to initiate convos"". Which I did lol. It just hasn't worked out."
lonely,Is it too late to make a best friend in my late 20s?,"Is it too late to make a best friend in my late 20s? - I went through a severe mental breakdown that made me realize my old best friends were no longer being true and were not as supportive as they should have been (or at all, they sort of abandoned me). Since then anytime I develop closer, promising friendships, they do the same thing and abandon me because something comes up and they’re too lazy to put the same effort. I’ve lost faith at this point and I’m already 25, with a broken support system and still somehow trying to recover. I notice other people in my treatment program have best friends at least they can rely on from the past, whereas I am literally having to struggle and build totally new relationships at a time where people are not being receptive and putting effort. They just want to cling on to their own old friends. So I feel I do not belong anywhere or that I do not deserve love and belonging. Is it too late for me to find a healthy loving and reciprocal relationship in my life if I don’t even think I’ve ever gotten to experience it? I’m working on self love and spirituality but I feel so alone and like I’m being punished :’("

lonely,Are they really?,Are they really? - I tend to observe others behavior I can't help it you know when you see a couple walk by and she's the first one to glance but then the dude seems concerned and that makes me think are they really in love fighting each other's consciousness or is it that we just get lost in another's physical awareness? Meh oh well...

lonely,Yet another valentines day is coming where I’m lonely again,"Yet another valentines day is coming where I’m lonely again - I was outside with my best friend today and the valentines day atmosphere was everywhere already. Him and I ate a valentines day cupcake together because neither of us has anyone else to share it with.

I try to ignore it, but it just isn’t possible anymore. Every time I see a couple, I think to myself “what does that guy have that I don’t? Why do those girls who are all aggressive and rude to me treat those guys so kindly and well? Why do those girls, who get disturbed even when I simply lay my eyes on them, let those guys do all kinds of things to them? And why did the nature create me with such a craving for the opposite sex when it’s clearly not happening?”

I know some people love valentines day but as for me I despise it. Seeing boys and girls together frustrates me enough on other days of the year and this is a day meant for boys and girls who are together. I mean it must be fun for them but for me it’s painful and depressing"
lonely,Losing hope,"Losing hope - I’m losing friends, love and hope. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just need someone to talk to, relate to. I don’t hate life, I just don’t want to end up hating it. I feel so lonely. The girl I love refuses to love me the way I love her, my mother feels she’s failed of raising me for all the mistakes I’ve committed. I’ve lost my job and I can’t get a job due to legal reasons. Being an illegal immigrant is tragic as fuck but it is what it is. I just need someone to talk to , someone who’s down to talk about anything. Even if you feel lonely my chat is always open , thanks"
lonely,Not sure how to find any new friends.,"Not sure how to find any new friends. - So today 5 other friends have turned their back on me and started to collectively bully me after two years of friendship and I had to drop communication with them. Now I'm absolutely clueless as to how I'm supposed to find new friends outside my RL circle of like 2 friends I rarely talk with. These were my online friends and they were the only friends I've had the last two years and finding new friends is a nightmare for me as I'm a squeaker and many people don't like the tone of my voice or my immaturity that comes with a young age. They were the only ones that accepted me for the longest time, as most people usually never write to me again or even insult me for being 'obnoxious' or a 'little kid'. Now I'm having an existential crisis as me playing videogames with those 5 former friends was 8-10 hours of every day last 2 years and they left a giant void in me which needs to be filled with new friends but I'm having too much trouble with socializing or generally finding friends as I try to be funny too often. Can someone spare any advice other than ""just socialize""? I've grown too afraid of the consequences of my own methods of finding friends, so much advice is needed."

lonely,struggling in uni due to depression.,"struggling in uni due to depression. - i am incredibly lonely

ive made a handful of friends since being in a new city for 5 months, and i dont interact with them often. they dont text me, and i dont text them. for the past two weeks back from the holidays ive just been in my room. i find it hard to even get up to shower. i have classes only once a week so being cooped up in my room is all i do. people living in my dorms (especially my hall) often party and are so close with one another. i just dont know how to make friends. being like this is sucking the life out of me. i try so hard to be grateful for the little things i have but every day its getting harder. when i go back home for the holidays, i have to pretend like my life in college is perfectly fine even though im sure everyone at home knows i dont talk to anyone at college. i dont feel fine. i dont want to make plans because my eating disorder makes me scared to. im afraid that i have to go out and eat. i need to seek help but i cannot deal with not losing weight or being skinny. my anxiety also makes me so nervous when i have to interact with people. i once went on a kind of tinder date and the guy didnt even text me again afterwards. the very few friends i have back home tell me im pretty and im interesting etc but i find it so hard to believe."
lonely,How bad has your loneliness ever gotten?,"How bad has your loneliness ever gotten? - I'm curious to hear your stories. I fortunately cured my loneliness. I suffered from anxiety at one point and finally managed to secure a friendship. He and I were incredibly close. His friendship allowed me to have a ROUTINE. I was too anxious to look for a job, so I remained dormant. Having him was allowing me to have an outlet. We saw each other every night at the gym and spent two or three hours afterwards just talking by the pool or walking outside at night. I felt whole. 

Unfortunately, he abandoned me. He ended up moving and never told me until he was finally out of the state. My world came crashing down. I was back to having no friends. Anxiety came back. I was in my room all day long. No responsibilities, no friends, no relationship, etc.. I remember it getting so bad that I would wake up every morning with this feeling of impending doom. I had nothing going on in my life. Emptiness. I felt like I was losing my mind. Horrible feeling. It went on like this for months, until I finally managed to make a friend. I got lucky. He and I became even closer than my previous friendship. I had re established a routine. That feeling of impending doom evaporated. I would wake up feeling good knowing that, although I was unemployed, I HAD something to do later. I would see him at the gym also. 

I ended up making a few more friends and I felt amazing. I would see at least one of them every day of the week. It's amazing how one's sanity is so dependent on social interactions. I never felt that dread or impending doom again. I had a purpose. 

That's when I realized....I better hurry up and get a job ASAP, because these few friends I do have will eventually leave. I cannot depend on them forever. Once they leave, I'll have no one again and end up in my room, alone....pulling hair out of my head. 
I realized that no matter how nervous I got about working, it could never compare to the feelings I had of being completely alone and wondering if I was losing my mind due to lack of stimulation. There's a reason solitary confinement is considered unbearable torture. Isolation kills the human spirit. 

I managed to land a great paying job and now have a ton of friends. I can afford to lose a few now because I do in fact have OPTIONS now. What an amazing feeling to be on the other side of the fence. I will never go back to that hell of a life I previously had to endure."
lonely,Life is stressful and being lonely makes everything more difficult,"Life is stressful and being lonely makes everything more difficult - It just seems funny to me that the world is designed in such a way that assumes lonely people don’t exist. Like there is no way that anxiety, depression, or simply being a bit socially awkward are problems that mean anything.

I’m a college student and I should be graduating this quarter. I have to take a communications course that is pass or fail strictly based on doing group work and making individual speeches. Me being the way I am, I’ve been a loner a throughout all of my college experience. As such my social skills are awful, I’m incredibly anxious doing public speaking, and I’m just generally not good at speaking up in face to face encounters. As you can imagine these are all terrible qualities for communicating. Now I have no idea what ms going to happen to my grade anymore or if I’ll be able to graduate.

It doesn’t help that despite the fact that our group has a groupme set up for this project, no one seems to care about checking the thing at all. Over messages I’m way more comfortable at responding to anything they ask or say. So I try to do what I can to be a good group member and help where I can, but of course when I ask a question no one even bothers to respond. They don’t even tell me anything so I have no idea what’s going on.

Honestly I’m just really scared that they will all be more than willing to throw me under the bus for being the “lazy one who doesn’t talk during our in-class meetings” . 5 years of struggling to get through all of this nonsense for a stupid piece of paper and this communication course could screw it all up."

lonely,"I don't really enjoy living anymore, I just do it because I have to, I don't really know what to do with myself","I don't really enjoy living anymore, I just do it because I have to, I don't really know what to do with myself - I'm (19m) and earlier in my life I suffered damage to the part of my brain that helps manage emotions, but I'm a completely normal person other than the fact that I struggle with depression. I was always the guy in the group to be made fun of because I'm not too masculine and kinda emotional, but after a while I just ended up taking those ""jokes"" as truth and ended up isolating myself from everyone. I just moved so now the one friend I had is gone. I've never even been on a date and the only girl who's ever shown interest in me sent me a photo of her cutting herself, writing something to me in her blood and stopped talking to me right before I was planning on visiting her (she's two hours away). It's a long story but I didn't do anything wrong and my therapist says she wasn't a good person. I tried asking a girl out who I thought was flirting but she ghosted me. People really like me when they do talk to me, I may be depressed but I'm a good person, it was hard but I just realized that about myself recently. The other day I woke up with no one home, got on PlayStation with no one else, and went to sleep writing in the journal that I can't even bring myself to read back. The past week I've been high everyday because I'm so tired of being conscious. I don't know what's wrong with me, what am I doing wrong. I used to talk to EVERYONE when I was a kid, love and friendship has always been super important to me but now I'm afraid I'm going to end up killing myself before I experience any of that. I want friends and family bu I'm so afraid of hurting them, I don't want to make anyone else feel the way I do. I just needed to vent, sorry this was long :/"

Back in the day (3 years ago) a few of my friends would play GTA Online with me so we can communicate outside of school. Forward to today, two have jobs, one of those two is eager to start a family, one more is in the USMC. 2 of them play on. Playstation with each other. I have both Xbox and Playstation but only have GTA on Xbox, so I understand that. A few days ago, the other friend who has Xbox messaged me and said ""We need one more for a Heist and that's it."" *and that's it* that's what stuck out to me. I told him I had to leave to pick up a part for my truck, I didn't,  I just knew after I'd help him, that'd be it. I did say I'd be back on later and I'll message one of the two for an invite to their session.  I hop on 2 hours later, message them for an invite, nothing, send a request for an invite, nothing, did the same for the other, nothing. Basically I know my friends have kicked me from their friend circle. I never really had friends, this guy was probably one of the few I've had ever. And now, he's ghosting me. I think the last time we've had a conversation that lasted longer than 5 seconds was about 9 months ago. I just want to know from anybody whose been in the same situation as I, how do you cope with something like this.  Knowing those who were friends with you, when you had none, have left you behind for a different friend. I've done nothing wrong to him, yes I lied, but if it was just for one little thing like a mission both of us hate, in a game we love, it shouldn't be grudge worthy."

If so, how? - I’ve been stuck in this dark, lonely hole with my mind racing and I can’t seem to stop my thoughts - only when I am asleep, but as soon as I wake up, boom: I get reminded of how lonely I actually feel.

Yes, I *feel* lonely but most people would tell me that I am not. I have a very good relationship to some of my family members or people from university but no one actually knows or understands what I’m currently going through. I’m isolating myself while pretending that everything is fine, that I am “just busy” or “having a bad day”.

No one knows that I’ve been crying nearly every night or everyday while I’m alone with my thoughts. I feel broken inside and trapped in my own thoughts and rn I’m feeling likes there’s no way out."
lonely,No one is ever there for me,"No one is ever there for me - I wish I could say that I have friends, or people I can count on. I've been wishing that for several years now, but that is all it has ever been- a wish. 

It hurts so bad to see people in groups. It hurts so bad to eat three meals a day all alone when everyone around you is having fun, laughing. Especially in university, where people make plans every weekend and I stay in my room, alone, wishing for it all to be over soon.

I've tried making friends. I really have. The main hindrance, I think, is my depression. I can't be a bubbly funny person because I have bad days where I can't fake it. So, I stay true to what I'm actually feeling and so far, things haven't really worked out with anyone, AT ALL.

Maybe it's me, maybe my personality somehow repels people- at least that's what it seems like. Maybe I give out ""get the fuck away from me vibes"". Who knows."
lonely,I feel like nobody really listens to me when I talk,"I feel like nobody really listens to me when I talk - As the title says, I feel like I'm constantly telling people things that are important to me, and it doesn't faze them at all, and that in and of itself makes me feel lonely. Like I have nobody to lean on.

Ironically, I have more than a couple people who say they are ""there for me"", people I should be and am able to turn to when I need help. But, these people are actually who I feel hear me the least. If I say anything short of, ""I am literally on fire"", ""I just won the million dollar lottery"", or ""I'm probably gonna kill myself tonight"", they don't really take me seriously. They kinda just let me talk and rant, whatever the topic, and then immediately return to whatever it is they were doing or were planning on doing. It has zero effect on them going forward.

This is a super obscure reference, but in the beginning of 'Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II', Kreia has a line where she says,

""Pah, like so many Jedi, you hear, but you do not listen. You have much to learn.""

And I think about that a lot because I honest to God relate to it so much. Star Wars stuff is different than real life of course, but regardless I feel like nothing I say or do is of any consequence to others. But I'm always going out of my way to do the opposite of that and find some common ground with them through hobbies or time spent together, to the point where I make myself miserable, and it never gets me anywhere. Not so much as a single brownie point. They would still drop me like I was hot at the first sign of conflict, like a stranger, but these aren't people *I* could do that to. These are close friends and family members.

Am I invisible? 

One of these days I'm going to find out the secret. Somehow, I'll say something to someone in just the right way, and they'll be like, ""Woah...hold on a gosh darn minute...that's what you've been going through?!"" And words will flash across the screen:

lonely,The excitement dies. Or they think everything is fine.,"The excitement dies. Or they think everything is fine. - Months ago, nearly a year ago, something awful happened. I did not think I would return. I somehow managed to survive, yet not without severe emotional and mental scarring. To explain is pointless, since the situation was bizarre and far too confusing for mostly everyone on this planet.   


So I returned. Everyone seemed glad. Joyous even. Over time, I have realized that only two people truly cared that I had survived and returned. And even so, it seems that I am taken for granted. After all of these things I have done, I had hoped that then, I would finally be loved. This expression means so much to me, yet... I rarely hear or feel it returned. It feels as though I have been dying of thirst for so long and had only realized this when I heard these words or felt it fleetingly. I require this love so badly...   


Yet it seems I will never have this. No one truly loves me? I am not certain. I know in my heart I am loved by one, yet it does not feel this way. Perhaps it is difficult to love me. I do not mean to be so difficult to reach, so difficult in trusting. Yet I am. The sadness is sand within a bucket. You can part the sand to reveal the bottom of it, however the hands cannot remain their forever. When the hands leave the bucket, the sand quickly fills this empty space. The sand is cool, smooth, almost comforting. It is a lie. I do not want sand in my bucket. ***I need water.*** The bucket is heavy, so heavy from sand. Even if the bucket were filled with water, the burden would still be present. *But a burden of water, is better than a burden of sand, for water brings me to life.* How much better water is, than sand."
lonely,Feeling really depressed tonight,"Feeling really depressed tonight - I told a potential roommate that was a perfect fit for my apartment that she got the room, but she turned it down. I think she either is worried there’s not enough public transport for her to get to work or maybe she thinks the location is too far from her friends. I was just so excited to geek it out with her. Watch the Picard series from the very beginning because she hasn’t watched it yet and let her login to her PlayStation account on my PS4. 
Now I just feel like something that could have been great just slipped from my grasp. For the first time I had hope I could get along with another human and her friends but now it’s just gone. My current roommate doesn’t give a fuck about me. Never smiles and always seem to be angry around me or when I do anything. Anyway, she’s gone in a week so I hardly care what she does anymore, but I just feel like I’m destined to have roommates more like her. I can’t afford to live alone. It’s almost $900 a fortnight here which I might have to pay for a month after she moves out. 

The depression is just crushing me. I just got another dose of hormones and they can leave me feeling extra emotional so maybe this will pass but if it doesn’t then I’m going to be like this for a long time. It’s just so stressful looking up potential roommates and cleaning my house every week like I have a damn rental inspection. I’m a very thorough cleaner but I also get exhausted easily. My current roommate doesn’t clean and barely cleans up after herself so I get no help from her. Doesn’t even have the decency to clean her room for the house inspections. I’m left to do it all on my own.

I contacted someone else about the room who is trans like me, but stealth (aren’t open about being trans) but they must have called me from a private number and I have no way of returning their call. Anyway, just something about their bio on the roommates site tells me they’d be hard to get along with. 

Anyway, I’m just going to continue being suffocated by my depression. I’ll keep looking for roommates because I have no choice. I still have other priorities like job searching, keeping appointments, crying throughout Valentines Day and some creative pursuits. Also, might be good if I actually made a meal for a change besides a slice of toast. 

Oh and to keep with the theme of the sub, I have no friends and I was looking forward to having a roommate I share a common interest with and get to hang out with her and my friends, because my current roommate actively avoids me and makes me feel so fucking depressed. I almost became suicidal over it. I can’t really make any promises that I won’t be this time. 

So I’m probably going to remain alone until my last days on this dying planet. 

She (person who turned down the room) did leave her number and said we could see some live bands together, but I’m still trying to muster up some courage to do that on my own. My social anxiety is bad."

I'm craving so badly to just feel affection and give love to someone. It's not about sex or anything for me. I just want to cuddle SO bad, been wanting to so bad for a long time. I used to have a girlfriend for about 1 year. We matched personality wise, but she always said she was asexual and I believed her until I found out she was actually cheating on me. That really really really broke my heart. I felt so fucking much for her, SO much, I really wanted to get old with her. After I found that out, I had 2 suicide attempts. Only reason I failed is because my housemate found out just in time. I've been going through quite the depression, am still on 40mg of citalopram (which I find doesn't help nearly as much as I hope, but that's the highest dose for an adult). There are weeks where I feel okay, there are weeks where I just feel so damn lonely that my motivation to do anything just goes away. During those times I usually just sit behind my computer and try to keep my mind occupied by playing video games. I've been trying to pick my life up again and I'm having a few ups but mainly downs. It all started with being so heartbroken, but it developed into more problems because I didn't do anything anymore at all. Lost my job, got into over 9k debts etc. I got over being heartbroken, and now I've got this shit. I just want a break from shit for once. All I want is just some form of intimate attention that is genuine, something that we both really want and enjoy. Doesn't even have to be because of love. I don't even think I'm ready for love yet."

You aren't alone. - My best best friend like no other left to go to another country over the summer holidays, so over the break I told myself I would be okay without him. So anyways first day comes along and I'm so lonely, nobody to talk to in class, lunch is sitting in the library by myself, and when I realized my friend was never coming back I almost cried. When I came from school, I let it all out in the shower, something that I've never done before.

I always thought it was weak to cry about things like this, but now I understand what loneliness is really like. It hurts, it really does. 

Crying is okay. Don't hold it in. Let it out."
lonely,Being the only sober guy sucks,Being the only sober guy sucks - All my friends let drugs and alcohol become their entire personality and it got annoying so I distanced myself and found out that nearly everyone is like this nowadays. I’m type 1 diabetic so alcohol for me. Even if I wasn’t diabetic I wouldn’t drink. I wish I wanted to so I could click with everyone more. I hate being an adult so much
lonely,I have not left my room since Thursday and nobody has checked up on me.,"I have not left my room since Thursday and nobody has checked up on me. - My grandfather passed away last Thursday. I hate to say that I'm ""depressed"", because it sounds so cliche and fake 80% of the time, but honestly that would probably be the word to describe it...

I've been locked up in my room, mostly sleeping, going into day 5 now. Other than my mom and dad calling me to give me the news in the first place, I have not left my dorm room, except to go to the bathroom, since Thursday. I'm out of food now, so I'm going to have to leave soon.

My phone has stayed totally dry the entire time...  But that's just how it goes for me usually. Unless somebody wants something from me, nobody talks to me. I see shit on TV and in movies where people are just hanging out because they enjoy each other's company and that shit is so foreign to me. There is no way that actually happens.

I could be dead right now. I have not made any posts on social media or anything, I haven't called or texted anyone, and I haven't shown up to class since Thursday, and not one person has reached out to me and asked me if I'm okay or even if I'm fucking alive.

I never had many friends to begin with, I have a very hard time socializing, but I realize now that I really don't have any friends. I understand that they may not know my grandfather died, but none of them are curious as to why I've fallen completely off the map for a week?"

lonely,i’m such a crybaby.,"i’m such a crybaby. - i can’t stop crying. i’ve actually never felt so alone till this moment. i’ve been mentally exhausted and been having lack of physical attention. i’m not used to it, i don’t think i’ll ever be. this isn’t me. i’m the type of person who’s there for everyone and no ones actually there for me. the people in my currently life as well do not understand what i’m going through, fine. i just wish someone did. i’m desperate and pathetic at this point. i don’t ever show my emotions but i guess crying is how i show it (in private, of course.) i’m annoyed with myself with everyone, with everything around me. 
i guess as well too i want someone who can uphold a conversation for once. idk where i’m going with this. this is getting deleted in the AM. here i go crying again."

lonely,I hate waiting for my life to get better,"I hate waiting for my life to get better - Its good doing all the right things to change your life around, but I'm tired of the long waiting that must be done. Being a better you, to build a better tomorrow for yourself takes so long. I know good things come to those who wait, but man, I don't have the patience, but I guess I'll have to stick it out and see it through. I'm in for a long ride. Anyone else feel this way?"
lonely,My friends being all adults.. then there is me on my last year of college all alone.,"My friends being all adults.. then there is me on my last year of college all alone. - My ""friends"" as I call them because of course we don't hang out as frequent. Idk even if any remember I exist since I dont get texts from anyone other than my mom, dad and brother. Only in most cases when im needed. 

The ""friends"" which can consist of maybe 7 ... out of those 1 talks to me SOMETIMES. Two are in their last year of college as am I. The rest graduated/working , some dropped out to work or other stuff, then leaves me... alone in my room writing this post while working on a side project. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pathetic , i know. Like the majority are fucking around like bunnies, being cool ass adult shit. Then there is me, work, school, gym and home.. same thing. I cant afford to go out unless if buying groceries or the occasional ice cream. So i am stuck alone.. I gave school clubs a try my first year.. and yea not a chance. So now i just roam campus alone other than interaction from work or classmates. 

Oh yea, if you mention dating. FUCK no ...im way to much of an emotional wreck to even get close to anyone without the need to be hostile to protect myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sooo.. yea i am alone... sometimes its bearable but then i sick in the depths of that shadow.. There I am back in this mess , sad, depressed, alone, mess.."

lonely,"first post here, I just hate feeling like a void","first post here, I just hate feeling like a void - Hello, all you lonely people. I am one of you. I type messages to the ones I want to talk to and delete them. Sometimes I get a wild hair and send them, but they only come back with an ""oh"". I lost my best friend and my rock. The feeling of texting every minute to once or maybe twice a week is the worst of all. So, I will finally admit after much pain and tears and heart break, I am indeed one of you."
lonely,I'm alone?,I'm alone? - I'm not just saying I'm alone. I really am alone. I really have no one. I have no family. I have no friends. I live alone. No one visits me. No one calls me. No one wishes me a happy birthday. No one cares about me. No one wants to be around me. No one likes me. I really don't know what I'm living for. It's just not fair that I get one life to live and this is it.
lonely,You know what sucks? Unconditional love not being enough to make a person stay.,You know what sucks? Unconditional love not being enough to make a person stay. - You could do everything right. Love and  Care about that person to the very core. Love everything about them. But eventually they choose someone else.
lonely,* another lonely birthday *,"* another lonely birthday * - I have some chocolates for my birthday, although I forgot it was coming up so soon. I wish I had someone to share them with, they could have the whole box and I'd be happy with someone here. I wish everyone could have a person of their own though."
lonely,does it change?,"does it change? - everyday seems monotone, the same things happening everyday with no change. Can't make friends or lovers, never been too close with anyone before messing it up and ruining my relationships. Everyday just seems like a bore and sometimes i contemplate suicide just to get something to change."

lonely,Took an hour. Cried at the end. All my emotion,"Took an hour. Cried at the end. All my emotion - I don’t see any point. There is no reason for life. Not to live, but for life to exist in the first place. There is no reason. One day, there will be no life on earth, or anywhere for that matter. Everything will stop moving. There will be no light, as all the stars have died out. I do not see any point to living, because one day, everyone won’t care. I will not be remembered. Everyone will get over me. I will be replaced. All who I love will die. They will cease to exist like me. They will be in the same position as me. There is no god, so there is no afterlife. Only black, except it won’t even be black. It will be an absence of thought, and comprehension. I will not know what is happening, because nothing is. Everyone fears the butterfly effect, because they want a good future. They want to choose the best path. I don’t fear that. It’s because it all loops to the same end. Same as in the beginning, nothing. This isn’t a suicide note. Or hell maybe it is. I don’t plan on anything, but if it comes to it, I guess it is. I love my family and friends, but they would come to peace with my death. They would get over it. Over me. They’ll replace me, as some already have. I want to cry while I write this. I really do. I want to bawl my eyes out. But I can’t. I don’t know why. I just can’t. I find it strange that I can have all this pent up emotion and all these frustrations that build up, but never really say or show anything. I see so many people who are sad, yet I’m probably as sad as them, and I sit with a fake smile. I don’t talk about my problems except rarely. I try not to be a burden more than I already am. I try not to upset people. I feel so sad. Sometimes I question if anyone really likes me. I feel like a weirdo. I feel like a black sheep that sticks out in the crowd. Sometimes I don’t even talk to my friends until they talk to me. I’ll often just try to avoid them until I can temporarily prove to myself that they wanna talk to me. Some of my friends don’t answer my texts. I’m not sure if any care. I don’t think they do. And it’s so easy for me to fall for someone. I feel so ignorant and stupid. If anyone shows me the slightest bit of affection, I often fall for them. Bean showed me affection and I found her attractive. I loved her. She acted like she loved me. Then she cheated on me. I felt used and I felt like she never loved me. She probably never did. When SHE broke up with ME, if I could have, I would’ve emptied my head. If I could have, I would have. Now, I don’t know if I really trust anyone. That was the first time I was truly betrayed. Stabbed in the back by someone I would’ve easily jumped off a skyscraper for. And all for what? A little affection? A hug or two? Heck, maybe even an empty I love you? I so no fucking point. I’m so fed up and tired of continuing. If I could, I would swallow a thousand pills and I would go to sleep."
lonely,Everything is slowly becoming meaningless and superficial,"Everything is slowly becoming meaningless and superficial - First time posting here. I’d like to think I have a good amount of friends and family, however everything is becoming more and more meaningless. Conversations are all becoming superficial and I can slowly see my connection with those around me drifting away. Then I post on social media, making it seem like I have these deep connections/friendships, but really there just superficial moments made to look like real connections. I change personalities, based on who I’m with, which makes it real hard to establish a true and lasting relationship with people. Idk if I even know which “me” is the real one at this point. I feel like I’m just fading into the background and life is just going on meaninglessly. 

Guess I’m just ranting hoping someone knows what I’m talking about.."

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me."

lonely,F16 || Looking for some friends or maybe more,"F16 || Looking for some friends or maybe more - Hello I’m alexis
I’ll be 16 here soon (feb 16th)
I collect things like Pokémon cards, legos, pop figures, and other stuff I guess. 
I have four piercings and I hope to get more in the future as well as other things but so far I have done my septum, ears, ear cartilage and vertical labret pierced.
Some tv shows I like are: Trailer Park boys, supernatural, family guy, bobs burgers, letterkenny, and Doctor who.
Music wise here’s some bands / people I like: Tom petty, Nirvana, theory of a deadman, Pink Floyd, joji, Johnny cash, the Beatles, xxxtentacion, Oliver tree, falling in reverse, Green Day, the offsprings, and three days grace . (Obviously more but I won’t list them all)
Some hobbies include listening to music and watching YouTube / tv (very exciting I know)
I’m a huge introvert and I’m very socially awkward 
I’d love to maybe make some friends or maybe more then that as the time passes
Not that it matters but I love trying to help others. I’ve thought of becoming a doctor / therapist . Ones I’ve had in the past haven’t helped me much and I care about others. If I can help in anyway I’ll try my very best to. I have my own issues so I can at least relate in some way. I can tend to actually care about others more than myself :)
Please note that I’m awkward and shy. If I don’t have much to say please don’t get mad or assume I have no interest in you. I’m just very made at socializing. I have for years. So please bare with me on that
I’m also very very insecure so that’s why I have no pics of me on anything really if you’re wondering about that
I don’t mind with whoever messages me just please keep it age appropriate and everything obviously 
I’m here to make friends not send pics
I’m not active on here much so if you’d a really want to talk I can give you my Instagram do I can keep in touch with you more then I would on here"

However lately I've been wanting friends, friends that have the same interests as me but where I live my interests are weird, annoying, stupid, boring. I just feel like I have no one to talk to.

lonely,I just want someone to love me,"I just want someone to love me - I’m 19 and literally every guy I come across only wants me for sex. I finally started dating my first boyfriend exactly 2 months ago but he wants to end things in our relationship already. I know I’m not perfect, but I tried my hardest to be a good girlfriend. My friends and family say I shouldn’t worry about it because I’m beautiful and nice but everyone always ends up leaving me at the end of the day. I feel so unwanted and insecure about myself."

I’m tired of aching for someone who likely won’t be a part of my future in any way but a memory
lonely,"I'm tired, just need to ramble","I'm tired, just need to ramble - I don't think my situation is quite as bad as some others I've read here. But still, it seems that my life right now just isn't really worth it. Not in the sense that I'd ever consider suicide or anything drastic, but it just feels so hollow.

It's not even that I don't do much. I'm quite busy lately, I'm catching up on my course work, I've been learning to draw, been keeping up with commitments, etc. But it never feels like what I do is meaningful enough for me to feel like the day is worth ending. Because of that, time feels so much longer now. I don't really remember days that well because it just feels like one long day that doesn't end. 

I don't even really have anyone I can talk to or whatever. The one person who I care about most is in a relationship now, so I rarely get the chance to talk to her. She still cares, she tries to make time, but I can tell that she's eventually gonna drift off to live her own life soon. And I don't blame her, I know it'll happen eventually if it's not as soon as I'm thinking it'll be. Still though, considering she's my only real friend, it's tough to think about.

I don't know how to make connections with people. Any friendship I've ever had has been based on who I sat next to in class or who wound up being a friend of a friend or whatever. Friendships just kind of happened and then stopped. Very few friendships I've had have been because I genuinely got along with the person and wanted to hang out with them more. In fact, quite a few have been very reluctant ""friendships"" where I felt too polite or scared to argue with mean people who just latched onto me for some reason. I generally just have really bad social skills and can't work out how to start making actual, real life friends. It would be nice to have someone to go out with, play games with or whatever, but I'm genuinely clueless how to even get to that point.

I really would just like to be happy with my life. I've been alone for way too long and haven't been able to find any happiness at all from it. I know I should try to just be content with myself and not rely on friends for happiness. But it's just been so, so quiet and miserable, particularly these past few months, and I'm just fed up with it.

Sorry if I rambled too much and make no sense in some parts, I'm a little sleep deprived. Just needed to get my thoughts out somewhere."

lonely,Does anyone want to talk to a lonely 20yr guy?,"Does anyone want to talk to a lonely 20yr guy? - Not sure what to start with so I'll just say something. I've posted here before and even other places but I always delete them after a while because I feel like there's nobody that'll even care. If nobody cares in real life who would online? Usually its up and down for me, lately I've been feeling really down. Barely any friends, I go to work but there's not anyone that actually cares, not really any family and never had a girlfriend. I guess that's because I'm too quiet and have a little bit of anxiety but who doesn't right? Does anyone else feel more even more alone when they're around people? I just want someone to talk to, for some reason particularly a girl which I'm sure stems from wanting a partner in my life. When I do talk to someone I always feel like I'm boring to talk to. When I text I'm always the one that sends the most with one word replies from the other person, then they just leave without saying anything so I don't even know if they'll come back. When I message someone that made a post they ignore me after the first couple of messages. I so desperately want to talk to someone about my emotions. Yet I never feel like I'm worth someone's time. I have nobody in my life I'm comfortable talking to, even with strangers online I'm afraid that they'll think I'm pathetic then block me. That probably comes from my parents not caring about what I say to them, never really telling me anything other than how much I'm not good enough. It all makes me feel like nothing, like I'll never be anything to anyone no matter how hard I try. Not even if I changed my attitude. I don't think any of my friends even think about me either. I don't know anymore. If someone wants to talk, lets talk. It doesn't have to be about me, if you have something going on lets talk. I'm used to being quiet about myself so it's okay. I even feel selfish making a post about myself, its just all me me me isn't it lol I'm your typical 20 year old I guess, I play video games, watch new movies, love memes, listen to music anytime I get the chance and sometimes I'll read a book. Usually I like to read or watch videos about random stuff that I can learn about. Anyway, thanks for reading if you did. Feel free to message me, I have multiple social apps to use if you'd rather talk there. Just tell me which one. I'll probably delete this post later on like I usually do"

Being alone isn't that bad, except when it's not, when things get hard and you have no one, or even if (my case) have trust issues, the hard ones, when you don't even talk so no one can hurt you, using that lonliness like a wall. That last part sometimes is disgusting for me. I was geting away from everyone, and it was my choice, onli becouse i am afraid of being hust. I discover one can do a lot of stuf alone, yet asking for help become a hell in life, or even opening up to that special someone (and end up losing her). It makes me sad thinking in all the oportunity i lost and might be losing 'couse of that. And every day become a rutine, prottecting my self from the nonreal harm from other people, my work my studies and some rollerblading, and thats it, the same thing every week, waiting on maybe that someone who drive out of that rutine, yet knowing that i wont talk to that one and losing it (again). It's been like that the last years, the same thoughts, same ideas. And if i keep going on, i really don't know why, i thing everything is kinda worthless. i don't know why keep going on yet i know ending it it's not the answer.

lonely,26 years old. No friends at university.,"26 years old. No friends at university. - I’m a 25 year old male at university and I find it hard making friends. I always say I’m going to get involved but I never end up joining any clubs during week of welcome. All I do is go to school and go home. Then work, train jujitsu and hang out with my girlfriend. Other than that I don’t really talk to a lot of people. It sucks cause when I go to school I feel like everyone has a group of friends or someone they interact with and I don’t. I dread graduation because I don’t want to leave yet without making friends and/or connections. I feel like I’m wasting my life here too. That or just the thought of not having friends in college. Anyone else feel this way or is it just me"

lonely,Feeling extra lonely,"Feeling extra lonely - So for some reason, the past month has been really hard for me. I've been so distant and at the end of last year I was getting better at socializing but I just lost it all. Instead I want to curl up in my bed but also talk to my best friend, be brave to talk more to my crush and even do activities that I like without feeling somehow guilty that it's making me lonely

I'm wondering whether someone else also experience this, how do you personally cope with these feeling? 

My therapist told me that thinking about your ""problems"" is like holding a book infron of you, it gets tiring after a while. On the other hand, putting it on your lap will not completely remove it but it will make it easier to carry and not blocking your vision all the time. 
I havent figured out how to use this way of thinking to cope with what I'm currently feeling."

lonely,Reconnected with a friend at a particularly lonely time,"Reconnected with a friend at a particularly lonely time - I recently fell out with a very old friend (I'll call him David) in a painful way. I lost a lot of our mutual friends because I couldn't explain what happened and most of them were closer to David than they were to me.

Things have been tough lately. I have another group of friends but it's splitting up and I don't really fall on either side. The person I really like is on one side, and he's no longer interested in being around me. He excludes me and talks over me in the group setting. The others are closer to each other than they are to me, and so I feel like I'm on the outside. I've been dealing with a lot in general and there's been no one to really talk to about it.

But the other day I got to catch up with a person I have loved and missed, one of David's friends who I don't get to see very often anymore. I can't express how great it was to feel heard and understood after so long burying my feelings. This person understands that I can't see David anymore without needing to know why. They still made sure I was doing okay and offered friendship at a sensitive time for me.

I know now that I'll get through this and I do have someone on my side in everything. Means so much :)"

No one cares about me. Not even you. I don’t understand how I try so hard all the time for everyone and STILL GET TREATED LIKE SHIT. I’m going insane and losing myself everyday and nobody realizes. What’s sad is that you know how fucked up everything is around us and you don’t help. You don’t love me. You want to ruin me. You already did though. There’s nothing left for me here. I already lost you so what’s the point. I truly do love you but fuck I just constantly watch myself get treated shitty. It’s like I know I deserve better but at the same time I don’t. I deserve pain.

lonely,Lost,"Lost - So totally by chance I met this guy at my work, we work in different departments and wouldn't usually talk/socialize because he's an actor and I work in front of house. I liked him and we started talking more online. We ended up hanging out after work and he kissed me, nothing more really happened but I felt this connection with him. When I'm with him I just feel so peaceful and calm and safe which is not normal for me. We organized to spend a little more time together but he kept cancelling on me (twice) and I don't really know what is going on because everything seems fine at work and he goes out of his way to see me at work. The problem is that he is moving to another city in a month and I know we aren't emotionally attached enough to do long distance and I don't think he would want to anyway.

lonely,Something unbelievable happened to me!,"Something unbelievable happened to me! - I'm laying here in my bed crying tears of joy. My life has honestly been like a hollywood movie for the past few days!

But first of all: Who am i?
I'm a 23 y/o male who has never experienced any kind of love for his entire life. I've never been kissed or had something even close to a girlfriend. I was just an extremely lonely guy looking desperately for any kind of love like many of you who are reading this right now. I was crying almost every night because of the loneliness i felt.
And i truly believed that this would never change and that i would have to live with this pain for the rest of my life! BUT IT DID!

So just two days ago i was at one of my friends party. When i arrived i initially didn't want to join the other people sitting in the living room. I was very shy so i just chilled alone in the kitchen. 

And then out of nowhere this girl came in looking at me with a warm smile. She started asking me why i was here in the kitchen and not with everyone else and i kinda lied and said that because i've just arrived i wanted to cool down for a moment. We started talking for around half an hour when we decided to join all the others back in the living room aswell. There we continued talking and after a while she started moving closer and closer to me and even touched me on my hand and my shoulder. 

During that time i liked her more and more and something just kinda opened up in me that accepted everything that happened there. And after a while of even more talking we looked at eachother smiling and holding hands when she all of a sudden just started kissing me.

That feeling was INCREDIBLE and i will never forget that for the rest of my life. After that i started crying as i was overwhelmed by all the feelings and all the happiness that i've never expierenced in my whole life! She then gave me a warm hug followed by a second kiss and i couldn't believe it!

The next days we met eachother again and spend a ton of time together and she keeps telling me how much she loves me. And now she's my girlfriend!

I still can't believe what happened to me during the last few days and sometimes i'm still thinking that this is just another one of those hundreds of dreams that i've already had where i wake up alone in my bed and start crying again. 
Except this time its actually true...

What i really want to tell you guys:
To all of you who are feeling lonely right now: PLEASE NEVER GIVE UP!!!
There's hope for every single one of us and one day you will be the one that will be loved!!!
So to any one reading this i wish you all the best and keep fighting against the loneliness!!!

Love you guys,
Charlie"

There is a minority that does need to vent or speak to random people or try and make sense of the emptiness. However, most want the right person to respond at the right time.

lonely,Some small and basic ways to beat loneliness which can be very effective:,"Some small and basic ways to beat loneliness which can be very effective: - 1 - realize that you are MORE than good enough to make friends, if you have a negative mindset you will never make new mates, so just realize that you are a lot better than most people when it comes to how much you’d love and support your friends (people are often lonely due to bad past mistakes, and often then give up after they have no one).

2 - present yourself well both physically and mentally; for example, wear nice, fashionable clothes and get a nice hair cut, and wash a lot and keep yourself well put together - and mentally don’t come across as needy or strange, just be nice and casual, and after a while of knowing someone, you can move things on from there.

3 - Don’t push anyone you know to their limits, as in - if you have one averagey friend which you can hang out with like once every 2-3 months, and you constantly ask for more and they reject - then just accept that that friend is only as good as a 2-3 month one day meet up - be thankful you have that and don’t push them.

4 - become more social on social media, do things such as follow more people on insta and add more friends on FB, people may find you attractive, and if you’re not even looking for a lover, you can share memes - and people will eventually like them and notice you, hopefully they may then have a good first impression of you."

I’m starting to lose hope at this point. Ik what everyone says, “you’re only 17 why are you worrying about this now?”. Well it’s mainly because everyone around me looks like they’re so happy and I wish I could have that. Not to mention I’m about to leave high school and with my garbage GPA and zero drive to do any work, let’s just say life is about to get 3x worse. I just wish I could have a better personality because having the most boring one ever is really ruining me."

lonely,Why should I stay?,"Why should I stay? - Hello there,

I don't know if it's the right place here, because there are a lot of topics mixed up. 

The most is maybe that I'm feeling lonely all day since my wife left me over a year ago. I'm not the most positive person in general, but since that day it seems like there's nothing left for me in this world.

Everything I do feels like it's just to numb myself. I Don't know why I keep doing all these things. It seems all meaningless in my mind. And I don't see any progress. I ride a lot with my bicycle and eat healthy, but I don't lose any weight. I'm still fat af. So why should I keep doing sports or eat healthy? I try to learn Japanese for almost a year now, but I can't really say a complete sentence. I can read and write hiragana and katakana, but I don't really understand what I'm reading, even if i know the words. I try to meet new people, but everyone seems to have no really interest to spend time with me. 

Every day after work I get home, eat with my parents and in the evening I stay alone in my flat watching Netflix, reading or spend my time with games. All my friends are busy with work or their own kids and families. There's no one who I can share my life with. What it's worth doing anything if you can't share it with anyone? I have no wishes at my life except of not being alone and after the last year I don't believe that there's any good to come in my life. And I don't understand why everybody wants me to stay. I feel that life is only suffering and no one asked me if I want to be in this world. So why should I stay?  If we are a free world where you can literally do whatever you want, why is everyone upset of choosing a way out, when life is only pain in your mind? I don't get it.

I can’t seem to make any woman happy. Most recently, I was talking to a cashier at the organic food store and gave her my number after a couple days. Predictably, she never contacted me. I’ve gotten to the point where I interpret a woman being cordial and not bitching me out (since that has happened so much to me) as interest. I’m just not enough for any woman.

To relieve my romantic frustration, I use dating/chat apps to talk to women in other states/countries since the pool seems to be dry where I live and I can’t get a woman to be interested in me or talk to me IRL. Online women actually want to talk to me and compliment me and make me feel good for once. Unfortunately, this has its limits. I was talking to an American girl studying abroad in Europe and she ended up ghosting me and marrying another man months later. Before her, I was talking to a woman from England and she got too busy to keep talking to me and found another man as well. I can’t catch a break!

Every time I put myself out there, I get hurt and my interest is never reciprocated. This is so frustrating and it just makes me feel as if something is wrong with me. I was emotionally abused by my mother and she used to shame me for my interests and ask me why I couldn’t be normal among other things. I feel like my personality and my appearance are the problem. Maybe I’m just not meant to find a partner who is loving and understanding about my autism and my past of being abused by my mother, etc..."

I got to thinking and the only times ive ever heard him tell or admit that im his girlfriend is when he needs me to buy something or he needs to use my car. or when he is taking negatively about me to another girl. I dont post on Facebook or instagram but recently I took down the handful of post that he was tagged in or I had posted on my Facebook from the last two years because he mentioned he didn't like it. I had given up on him ever changing his status to say that we where together so he will forever be single but when I took down the post I also changed mine back to single. well we started having issues with our drug supply so he found another va face book all he would tell me is a guy names and that was all I was not allowed to meet them or know anything about them which was okay till i saw just in a glance he changed there messenger color to purple which he did the same when we started talking so I felt that this guy was a girl because of pass record which got us in a hug fight and he disabled face book but not messenger and started calming I just wanted the info so I could sleep with him for free drugs. he keeps phone locked all the time because on the past I had found on two separate time where he talked crap really hurtful stuff I haven't been to completely able to get over about me to an ex of his and another girl he told he he wasnt interested in and having sexual conversations with them as well  then after I foind him the first time he said he wouldn't talk to them and only  a few weeks later I found out he was still talking to them and we had a big fight after that he started locking his phone and not letting me touch it cause he didn't want me going though it and invading his privacy. I know deep down he's probably still talking shit about me and hitting on other girls I just don't know who and keeping me around till he gets a job and vehicle of his own so he can get his own drugs then he will find someone he really likes and finds attractive and doesnt treat like shit for asking for his help or wanting him to do something that would make them happy and tell anyone and everyone that she is the perfect girl for him. I hate that I fell in love with him. when I tell others about him it's always in a positive way I don't hit on anyone and I don't seek out sex with others even though I have wanted too many times.

lonely,more isolated than ever,"more isolated than ever - When I was in middle school and high school, I felt isolated. I never was included in any groups, invited to any parties, and just felt all around unwanted. I told myself people were missing out and that I liked being alone, and ultimately things would get better. 

Now, it's been 10 years since high school, but I feel just as isolated. I see my work friends on social media hanging out. People who were my friends are hanging out without me. I'm rarely invited anywhere. When I try new hobbies, people are there with friends they already know and aren't as open to a new person. When I am included, it feels like a pity invite.

It feels like an eternal loop. I try to get involved and be included. It works for a short while. Then I get left out, ditched, or stood up. I get upset and say ""eff them"" and make no effort to be around people, which leads to heavier isolation.

I feel like I missed out on some important socializing skills in high school because of this, but I don't know what I can do differently.. I feel judged before people even get to know me, which has me questioning what is wrong with me . It's taking its toll on all aspects of my health.

Anyone have any tips? Do I embrace truly being alone? How do I make real, meaningful relationships?"

lonely,i feel so alone. i just want a friend.,i feel so alone. i just want a friend. - it’s barely my second semester of college. i have no passions and i don’t experience any genuine emotions anymore besides pain. i wish i could just feel happy again and worth something. i just feel like i’m a waste of life. just a person lost and hurt roaming the earth. i wish i could just have someone to talk to.

I could go on about what makes them terrible, but that’s irrelevant to the topic at hand. They should all be imprisoned.
I am currently a college student who lives alone, and based on my family history and losing some of my closest friends here and there I’ve decided that I don’t believe in long-lasting relationships anymore (be at platonic or romantic). I don’t think there’s such a thing as unconditional love. Something always goes wrong because we can all be a tad inconsiderate."

I want someone, but at the same time i cannot force myself to look. Everytime there is even i slight chance  that i could got out and meet someone. I seem to not be able to follow through.

I feel like I had it before with some friends but they started talking to me less and less until I cut it off because getting ignored was making me really upset. I get ignored and left out of a lot of things with friends and I actively show interest when I do get to do anything with them but it doesn't change anything and I go back to being treated like I don't even exist. I'm really sick of being alone and people just tell me that I should be okay with being alone but they always have people they can go to, I don't have family or friends that even care. I want a boyfriend but trying to look just makes me really hate being gay because I either find someone who doesn't want what I want in a relationship (they just want sex or whatever) or they're not interested and it's really hard to find a gay person I've been able to relate to. I Really just want someone to care about me and hug me and just continue to be there for me so I don't have to keep being alone."
lonely,Valentine's day loneliness,Valentine's day loneliness - It's been 2 yrs since I ended my friendship with a best friend and I just miss her around this time. The first time we celebrated valentines day together i got her a rose and a plush toy cause apparently her bf of 4 yrs never bought her any roses so I went up to her with one rose and the toy and she was happy. During class they called out my name and apparently she had ordered me a rose as well a week in advance to be delievered during my class. The next year I got her dragon without telling her and she got me a dragon as well. It was good times but we grew apart during uni and i miss her every day. I tell myself its for the best. Maybe this year I'll be surprised by someone new.
lonely,I can not take this anymore,"I can not take this anymore - I haven’t had a conversation with anyone but one person in months. I hate college. I can not meet people. The isolation has turned me into a fucking raving lunatic. Ive broken my phone three times already by throwing it at walls, ive caused hundreds of dollars of damage to my dorm room. I spent hours looking up things like “how to make friends” and reading the same useless articles ive read dozens of times before. My social skills have completely degraded. I wish I was in high school. I spend hours walking around campus in hopes that some coincidence will introduce me to somebody. The one new friend I thought I made ghosted me. The other friend I have is leaving next semester. I shove massive amounts of junk food down my gullet, started smoking, bang my head against walls, so I can get some kind of entertainment. I just want to feel alive again, like my life isn’t just some god damned joke."

Or are we wanting to find people who appreciate what we have to offer? I fight with this painful feeling in my heart that I don’t belong and wish so hard that I did. That people missed me when I left. That people think about me. That I’m important in their lives. Then I have the feeling that the world is better off without me. That I don’t grace anyone with my presence. That if the world blinked and I was no longer in it, none would even feel my passing save for family and coworkers. I really wish to be insignificantly significant. I try so hard to help others but I think deep down it is just a plea. A small voice saying please don’t forget me. Don’t let me have lived in vain."
lonely,"17M Never had a friend, but I want one. Don't know how to make one.","17M Never had a friend, but I want one. Don't know how to make one. - I have never texted, snapped, DM'd, facetimed or phoned anyone. I've never been to a party or gone out for dinner. I've never had a girlfriend or done much more than talk to a girl. I don't hang out with anyone, or talk outside school. I'm a loner and I'm getting tired of it.

I'm unbelievably lucky. I was born in the best city in Canada, if not the world, to an upper-middle-class family and go to a great school. I grew up in a great neighbourhood, and as a kid, I would spend hours outside with my only friend catching lizards in nets and jumping on his trampoline. When I started middle school we grew apart and stopped talking. Even though we still go to the same school, we don't know each other anymore. I only ever had him as a friend, and when I lost that friendship, I never made a new one. I don't want to be friends with him again, as it has been almost a decade, and we are not in the same place socially.

As a senior in high school, I am awfully lonely. I have a few people I talk to and sit with at lunch, but I am an outsider, and just tag along. I have a few people I chat to in school, but otherwise, I'm pretty much a loner. I'm not ugly and I don't have bad hygiene. I'm not socially awkward or cringy. I'm self-aware and take social cues. Every day I watch my peers grow older and experience all the teenager things, first love, first kiss, first girlfriend, first break up. I'm getting tired of seeing people enjoying life with their friends while I sit on the sidelines.

People in my grade are going to parties and hanging with friends. On Instagram, I see pictures of all the people in my school doing cool shit with their friend's: camping, fishing, swimming at the beach or skiing. Parties are practically live-streamed, and I'm writing this while my feed is overflowing with the latest pictures of the parties my peers are at. The people in my grade look amazing, they go to the gym they are fit and healthy. The girls look like models, and the guys look like adults. I'm by no means ugly, but definitely look young for my age, skinny and average height.

I don't think loneliness would have hurt this much before social media. Everything I see hurts. People wishing each other happy birthday on Instagram, while on my birthday I wake up to my school alarm and a text from mom. I see Snapchat stories of the girl I like snorting coke off a table, and boys shitting in the urinal. As stupid as all that is it sure beats being lonely. Trump is president, the forests are burning, oceans rising, and I'm about to die from god damned coronavirus because some idiots couldn't help but eat a bat because it's a trend. What good is there in the world because I can't find it.

I'm tired of sitting in my room on the weekend listening to Radiohead and wallowing in my loneliness, while across the city my peers are living it up. I try to put myself out there, I played soccer for the school, I run a club, I volunteer and get good grades apart from in English. I'm going to university next year for engineering. It is a big school in a big city. People tell me life will change in college, but I don't see how. In high school I'm surrounded by people my age, who are going through the exact same experiences I am. University is no different if I can't make friends now what is going to change.

I don't see the point anymore, I feel like I'm living for my family, not myself. People tell me to find god, but if god existed why the fuck would he make me like this. What is the point of waking up every morning to go to school or work just to die in 80 years, if I'm lucky? I used to only feel the loneliness mentally, it weighed on me like a brick every day, but now I'm feeling it physically. I wake up exhausted, I feel weak, I don't have an appetite and I can't sleep. I've realized that loneliness is more than emotion, it is a disease. I'm in a race to make a friend before the loneliness consumes me. I feel like I am racing against time, but I don't know the race track.

tl;dr how do i make a friend."

lonely,I dont know what im doing wrong.,"I dont know what im doing wrong. - I've been having a strong desire to have a partner lately, more than usual that is. Someone I can hug, kiss, give a pet name to, someone I can annoy and play with. In an attempt to find a partner, ive been putting myself out there a lot more. I've gone out a couple of times, messeged girls on facebook, reddit, Instagram, snapchat. No one has responded to my messeges, and it's left me feeling worse and more hopeless than before. Dating apps aren't really good for me, since from my experience you'll only have luck if you're very very attractive. I guess the good part of all of this is that I'm no longer scared of talking to a potential partner. But still, this sucks."
lonely,Easier to be alone and I think I lost the best I can get,"Easier to be alone and I think I lost the best I can get - I think it’s easier to not be with someone.  No effort to be alone really.  One thing I especially fear is that I’ve peaked.  I was with a smart guy who got me.  We meshed.  He is super successful and unimaginably amazing at sex and was so handsome.  He was mean though.  So very mean and angry all the time.  ZERO humor from him.  He was only funny when I poked fun at him.  I make good money and I’m fairly attractive and frankly I’m absolutely hilarious, but I’m middle aged and I don’t think I’ll find someone. I loved him too.  I lost all my friends bc he was so needy and they’re gone for good. I don’t trust anyone.   Im just ALONE.  How do you make friends at my age?  I work from home..."
lonely,Still lonely even though I shouldn’t be,"Still lonely even though I shouldn’t be - What am I doing wrong? I feel like a bar person when I admit that there’s something missing in my life. There’s a void and I don’t know what it is but it makes me crippling lonely. I am grateful, I have parents who love me, at least 3 close friends, and my dream job. Yet the feeling of loneliness creeps in on my life repeatedly. I feel like there’s so much pressure in college to go out, socialize, drink, and that’s just not who I am. And it never will be. I don’t know if I’m genuinely lonely or if society just tells me I should want to be out with more people. Does that make sense? I don’t know. I’m glad I found this subreddit. Loneliness makes me think I’m the only person in the world who feels this way. I know now that we all share this pain, which is oddly comforting. I hope you all have a good night."
lonely,Being lonely can be a good thing.....,"Being lonely can be a good thing..... - I have been lonely for most of my 40+ years. I had many friends as a kid, but then I lost interest as they expected me to be someone that I wasn't, or they weren't into the same things as me. I now have a family and kids but I still feel lonely. The reason I feel lonely is because not many people understand me, usually because I am brutally honest and old fashioned etc etc.

However, I see that as a plus nowadays. If you go against the grain at the cost of being lonely and unpopular, then that just means you're unique. You eventually become an observer and you realise that most people are tossers. 

It's always better to be YOU and lonely than to pretend to fit in as a puppet for others.

So use it to your advantage. I don't expect many people to agree with what I have said, but that's the point... I can handle that fact, and that's all down to what I have said above.

Next year I plan to have a holiday in the depths of space. There's an empty seat next to me, free of charge."

It’s like there they are, having aspirations and talents and here I am making suicide plans every week because I know everyone’s better off but not going through with them because I’m too much of a pussy. It feels like my life’s over before I’ve even gotten out of high school. I’ve broken up with so many people because I knew they deserve better only to find someone new to manipulate into loving me because I’m a lonely freak. I know this is where I should be, a low, horrible person sitting at a low, horrible level but it still hurts"

lonely,Wanted to get this off my chest,"Wanted to get this off my chest - 'm supposed to be studying for a test right now, but I don't know. I've always felt alone, since I'm a closeted bi in a very homophobic country, and I've never been able to relate nor fit in with my peers (unless I copy what they're like). I felt a little less lonely when I met a good friend of mine 3 years ago. I think it was mainly because we were in a codependent friendship. I don't know if that's the correct term. They were bereft of any social interaction outside of online, and I wasn't able to understand people around me IRL. We both needed each other. The thought of me being their only friend was very fulfilling to me. This is terrible of me, I know, and it is something I've been dealing with to make it go away.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways. It was a codependent friendship because we both relied on each other for social interactions. We only had each other to vent or express about our depression and so on. Now, they are doing better, whilst I am doing worse (or the same. I don't know). They said, it's mainly thanks to me because I've always been supportive and encourage them to talk to people, to pursue their interests and so on.  


Whenever we ask how each other is doing, mine is always the same old ""just like always"" whilst theirs are descriptions of them dealing with trauma and so far doing well in it. I used to say honestly how I were doing at the time, but they don't need a negative presence whilst pursuing positive things. And now I've deleted their number. It's been over a month since we last chatted, and I know that's because they're busy getting better. I'm proud of them, I believe they don't need me anymore, and there's no reason to talk to me.  So, yeah. Now I'm just lonely as usual.  


Anyways. Thanks for reading this ramble of mine. I hope you'll have a little less lonely day or night."
lonely,I've decided that in addition to using social media,"I've decided that in addition to using social media - and attempting to communicate with members of the opposite sex to whom I'm attracted, I should also refrain from watching any professional sports for the rest of my life.

I feel like since the day I was born I haven’t been loved unconditionally or wanted. All I’ve ever felt like is a burden to my family, friends, or current significant other. I’ve finally come to terms with the fact that I was emotionally neglected as a child, and even though I understand that no one is perfect and my mother had her own struggles, it still deeply hurts that I didn’t get the love and attention that I needed. For the past few years I’ve been trying to stop thinking of myself as the victim, and take responsibility for the issues I developed from not being taught how to properly manage my emotions. 3 years ago I met a man and I thought I finally had someone in my life to love me unconditionally. Sadly, after a few months of dating my depression and trauma caused me to be very toxic and it took a large toll on our relationship. We are still together, and I’m still not perfect, but I feel like through the years I’ve slowly improved and bettered myself. Even though I feel this way, it’s like all he sees is what I do wrong, and it hurts so much because he was the person who always loved me even with my faults. These past few years I’ve also lost all of my friends, but that’s a story that’s too long to fit in here. My boyfriend is almost never affectionate with me, and barely pays attention to me anymore. He’s still a good man and I still love him, but I wonder if I’ve caused him too much hurt to ever love me the same as in the past. Whenever I tell him how he hurts me, he just brings up what I do wrong, and often it turns into a fight. I feel so defeated lately. My relationship is rocky, I have almost no friends, I live in a town where I know almost no one, I try so hard to meet people online and in person but I never make any connections no matter how hard I try, my family never reaches out for me and since Christmas I’ve kind of been distancing myself from them because a lot of the hurt they caused me has resurfaced lately. I feel like I’ve done so much for myself lately, and things in my life are turning around. I’m doing well in school, I have a job I enjoy so much, I have the two most perfect dogs that I’ve dreamed of having my whole life, I live in a beautiful town and an apartment I was able to decorate how I like, I feel fulfilled spiritually, yet I am SO LONELY. I don’t know what the point of posting this is, I guess just to rant and get it out. Im so scared of never being loved fully and deeply and having to go through this life alone."

I'm just mad at myself because I talked myself into graduate school because it would be a good way to you know, make new friends and enhance my professional skills.

lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts","26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts - Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

lonely,There’s a lot of lonely men in here,"There’s a lot of lonely men in here - I just joined this page today, but it appears to be overwhelmingly men that are longing for a connection with a woman, but are not emotionally ready for a relationship. I would like to understand where you all are coming from that makes you feel like bringing a woman into your life will automatically make you happy. I don’t want this to come across as judge mental, I would really like to understand what makes you think that it will fix your lack of joy in life."
lonely,A brief collection of my failed friendships.,"A brief collection of my failed friendships. - A bit of back story okay (sorry if scrambled I am on some good indica weed), here is why I am alone in life now.

Lets start with freshman year of highschool. I was nerdy, preteeny, but I had my group. Kids in marching band. A few decent friends here and there. I stay out of trouble and generally make it out.

My best friend is Tina (name changed). She loved me, and was there for me through MS and I really like her. I ask her out and she says yes, I am happy about this.

Fast forward a few weeks and things dont work out but whatever.

Sophomore year. It was this year that I first smoked marijuana in the basement of my childhood home. It felt cool, euphoric even. But it wasn't anything I did often at this point so it lasted.

I tried again to date Tina, but there was a new girl lets name her, Mary. Mary shows me attention and genuinely likes me. Tina notices and nukes our friendships because she was ""jealous""

At the end of it I date Mary on and off for the next year, end up just as friends with Tina, whom gets a boyfriend. Sus close to win me and her broke up the second time.

Eventually I eat a 1/4 of an oz of magic mushrooms and trip for the first time; it was delightfully awful. But taught me that if I was going to drugs I would have to respect them. They are as powerful and dangerous as they are fun.

A few weeks after that I try them again and have a great time, I got into my roots and felt in tune with the earth and myself. I am starting to feel happy again.

I end up meeting rose. Picture this:
Cool fall night. Clesr skies. Marching nerd band meet, and youre there with another nonband nerd. Cute girl starts talking to you and things kinda go stagnant and stop


Junior year. I start off the year with a medical emergency. I have a tic now, that is distracting. I get teased for it. Me and mary are long broken up. Friend pool constricts more now. I miss school and drop alot of classes mainly:
All core classes
Marching band

As a result I am prescribed Xanax. 1mg 3 times per day. I was stoned 24/7. I would take them constantly and devoped a problem.

Senior year. Friend group is gone now. My Xanax addiction shifted into over drive, I mainly used Kpins at this point. I started smoking hella weed too and still do. I try acid for the first time and suddenly get the confidence too talk to Rose again. We start to talk romantically and I am able to keep my benzo/drug use on the hush hush.


Fastforward to Jan. 
I know my bezno beniges are keeping me from Rose. I decide I am done. I am done feeling sorry I am just done. I detox off of benzos cold turkey. It was the hardest most painful thing I have ever done. 2 days after that she broke up with me. I guess all I can think about is her last words: ""Frogboy2020, your depression is getting out of hand. Get some help"""
lonely,Having normal conversations?,"Having normal conversations? - I realized today that it has been so long since I've had a casual conversation with friends (if I've ever even had a casual conversation with friends, I'm still not sure), that I don't even know how to do it. 

Like I am so devoid of social interaction that I don't even know what friends talk about or how to start conversations."

I feel like women are better at understanding problems and coming up with solutions 🐈.  Could just be me. 🤷‍♂️

P. S. Please don't be sexual with me, I'll straight up block you. There's a fair share of horny women on this app too and not all guys are into that-

My heart feels heavy, I can't get my old friends out of my mind, I miss them everyday. The backstory was we had a great group, I can't make friends so when my friend circle grew I felt more confident than ever, than about couple years later they all block ME, I felt lonely to the point where I wanted to give up. I then found couple other people and then hanged out with them for couple days but I can't seem to fit in. Everyone just have different things they are interested in than what I am. My old friends and I had so many things in common, I feel like just giving up on my social life...I can't move. I want someone to just talk too. My parents would just tell me to move on or just make friends but they don't understand how hard it is these days. Will someone just talk to me so I can just get a few things off my chest."

One asked me for advice about catering options for their party.  Another told me about all of the parties being hosted by other co-workers, and who was attending which party.

Not once did anyone ask if I had plans, or if I would like to attend one of their parties.

The last few days have been *really, really aggravating* because I can’t seem to stop crying over the same random shit: no friends to reach out to, family doesn’t know, no relationship and the feeling that nobody actually likes me or my company.

I take care of my hygiene and try to look okay, but I think that the biggest problem is my face and my expression that I cannot control. I feel like I always look angry or sad because that's exactly how I feel most of time.

I used to do this a lot with clothes that were fresh out of the dryer, but when they’d get cold I’d feel really sad because it’s like being alone again, feeling the only comfort you have in the moment fade away slowly is fucking sad.

lonely,I can never replicate any form of feeling outside of the rare moments of solitude that aren't lonely.,"I can never replicate any form of feeling outside of the rare moments of solitude that aren't lonely. - Warning: This will probably sound extremely pretentious, but this is legitimately the way I express things and feel.

I listen to music frequently, and to a lot of it, ever since I was 13 years old. I feel intense emotions when I listen to certain kinds of music, to the point where I romanticise a setting, mood, and general  abstract scenario. For example, listening to soft indie pop makes me visualise golden hour, with sunlight shimmering across a blue sparkling lake flanked by greenery, with a slight wind stirring the water and leaves. Some songs make me imagine a lover with me after sunset when the sky is blue and cool, sitting on a rooftop looking at the lights of city. I romanticise things like that, very teenage dream I know. It is what it is. It's to no one's surprise that I also write poetry and the like (yes, groan). And as you can imagine, I have over a hundred playlists capturing every possible mood. I fucking cry when I listen to music like Garden City Movement's ""Move On"" (my favourite song). I've written so much to try to pin down what it makes me feel. I am still so damn emotional today. And I'm already 20. 

But tragically, I can never bridge the gap between this internal world and my external environment. I have never met anyone who showed any semblance of having this kind of romantic sensitivity, who sees things similarly to the way I do. It's all bland. Maybe it's my fault, but it's so fucking lonely to constantly feel numb and nothingness. I crave so many experiences I can never have in real life. I'd like to kiss someone or talk to someone without the feeling of tedium, or the ugly, disappointing weight of disillusionment when I realise they didn't really care about what I have in my head, and just wanted something superficial from me. I invest myself too deeply in any connection I find, only to discover that all they want is so much more reductive. I have never had a genuinely spontaneous moment in my life around people where I'm like, oh wow, this is a really beautiful moment. It's been quite dull and depressing; I want to actually kill myself from despair. I see the life accessible to me as monotonous and draining. Like I'm a cog in a machine and nobody gives a fuck unless you give them what they want. 

I've never been in love with anyone, or any part of my life. I've dissected, again and again, these situations to ascertain if I have madly high expectations - yes the expectations are too idealistic, but ultimately I am unlucky. Most of my friendships, and attempted romantic connections, have been largely unfulfilling. I don't feel emotionally connected. I feel like I'm just going through the motions of trying to keep up stale relationships just so I'm not forever alone and idle. I'm very social and thrive off connection. I hear of other people having a much richer personal life, while mine is so, so, so fucking dry. 

I worry I'll feel this way forever. I go out of my way to try to seek adventure in an otherwise grey, antidepressant-popping life, but it's so hard. I meet people who drink away their stress after the daily 9-5 in the office, rinse and repeat, and on the weekends maybe do a yoga session and take a trip to the cinema to catch a Marvel movie. Nothing wrong with that, but I can't fucking live like that. I just can't. It's so suffocating. Life isn't so dramatic, I know. But I'm dying inside. I want to abort this  slow-dragging pain of an existence. I feel crazy for wanting out. 

I'm sick of relationships that just die because they want something instantly gratifying and I don't want that. I'm not a prude or conservative for wanting something organic that isn't facilitated by an app and text messaging. I just can't deal. I killed all my social media from feeling way too goddamn lonely. I don't know what to do."

lonely,My Friends Don’t Want Me Around,"My Friends Don’t Want Me Around - I (19F) am in nursing school, and I have a group of friends in my program. Last semester we would always study together and have a good time, but recently I’ve felt a shift. Two of the three girls always sits with their back to me whenever we’re together, whether it’s in class or at the library. When I try to contribute to the conversation in real life or in group text, I am largely ignored. Only one of the three girls makes a slight effort to include me in the group, but the other two focus only on her. 

This week we gathered to study and every-time I tried to participate in the academic discussion or ask a question, I was immediately shot down without hesitation.

I’m not sure what I did to upset them, but I’ve been crying almost every day with wonder and frustration. Nursing school is really stressful, and I know I have my work to focus on, but it’s really hard and lonely when my “support system” completely falls out from under my feet."
lonely,"It sucks not being able to talk to your ""friends.""","It sucks not being able to talk to your ""friends."" - There's this person that I used to consider my best friend, but it's been a few months since we talked (we're ""internet friends,"" I should mention). The last conversation we had was 2 months ago, and before that conversation, it had been 8 months.

Usually they would always start conversations because they know I'm too anxious to ever start one myself, but I think they want me to try and start conversations to break out of my shell. I know it's not anything malicious, I just... don't have anything to talk about, ya'know? We used to talk at least once a week when they started conversations, but I just can't for the life of me figure out what to say to begin one myself.

It just so happens all the things I'm worried about, I know for a fact they wouldn't be open to talking about, and all my interests don't overlap with theirs - so why bother? I'm tired of relating to other people's interests when people just don't know how to relate to mine.

I know I'll find other people to talk to, it just sucks right now. Why can't it be easier to just *talk* to people?"
lonely,I don't know how to feel,"I don't know how to feel - I was doing so well, I had a great mindset for a couple weeks, I was so motivated, I was doing everything I should be doing, I was doing better, then...nothing, I feel like I fell right back in the hole I just escaped from. I don't know what happened, I don't know if its okay to get back up from falling anymore after doing so well. I don't know what to feel. I hate being this way."
lonely,I’m an attractive guy but still horribly lonely. People are changing for the worse. Nobody commits to plans these days or texts back. What should I do?,"I’m an attractive guy but still horribly lonely. People are changing for the worse. Nobody commits to plans these days or texts back. What should I do? - Tall, muscular guy with good style who is generally seen as attractive. Probably a 7.5 out of 10. But horribly lonely. Looks help for sure but they don’t cure shit.

In social situations that I DO find myself in I am funny and a good listener and good conversationalist and generally quite likeable because I hide my loneliness really well. But getting into a social situation is rare and difficult. Nobody invites me to anything and when I invite them I sometimes get left on read for days.

People’s attention spans have noticeably shortened in the last few years and nobody commits to plans anymore. Nobody can tell you when they’re free because they don’t want to miss out on anything that might come up.

I used to at least meet women on tinder because I am too fearful to approach them in real life. But in the last few years the app has changed for the worse. You get almost no matches without paying. And even if you do the girls on there are different than they used to be. Not responding or giving one word replies or impossible to meet in person, which isn’t how it used to be. Now that I don’t have the crutch of tinder anymore, I’m faced with bitter loneliness.

So friends are failing me and dating life as well. What do I do? As an attractive and charismatic enough guy who everyone assumes is having an active social life and dating life, I sometimes have nobody to talk to in real life or over the phone for days on end. What would you suggest for me?"
lonely,Stupid trending notices,"Stupid trending notices - I always get excited that someone has messaged me when I see that little red ‘1’, but it’s always just a notification of a trending post."
lonely,i am lonely because i struggle socializing,"i am lonely because i struggle socializing - I admit I am loner, spend most of my time in my room and go out when I need to. I feel okay and normal in this situation, but ik why its like this, socialize. Most of conversations with friends or people in general, I don't know what to say, don't know what to reply. Can't really start a conversation, even struggles to say ""hi"" to friends that ""we're friends because we're in the same class"". 

I know that to get out of this is basically just go out, go to events, join organisations, etc. my spirit to do those activities depletes really quickly, and even if I join, I would get anxious and awkward when meeting new people, because I don't know what to say, I have nothing to bring onto the table. 

Yea I have interests but not hobbies, I used to draw characters for 4 years and call it as a hobby but not anymore. I enjoy photography, but I never really committed to it, never interested in knowing brands of camera and type of lenses. Recently I picked up playing guitar as my new interest but I need to leave my home for Uni, and the place that I live in now is prohibiting playing instruments. And right now, probably writing/draw out short stories, reading novels, playing warframe, and listen to songs.

Maybe I am just a poser and never committed to anything.
At least not warframe, but then being too geeky to one stuff is boring right? or wrong?

Its easier to talk to people in one-to-one, when there's only me and the partner. I can focus on them, and I believe they are focus on me. But it gets harder when there's more, often times I would feel the other partner can talk and have more fun with my partner, which is why I tend to listen more to people, watching conversation and be a background laughter. 

I typing this right now because, I just had an awkward day. I can't reply to a question from my friend, ""why haven't you moved out?""
(fyi: I'm living in a dorm, and have to move out soon) to which I reply, ""because I haven't moved out"". I had a brief pause to that question and can't answer anything and just blurted out what comes in to mind, and realizing after it. is this brain fart?
Also, had burgers for dinner and I cant eat it properly like, my hands got dirty and like I don't know where my mouth is, my brain is not syncing with my body. While waitresses passes by and see me like that, I felt horrible lol. That's because I havent put myself out there that much, been isolating 2 days in room.

I have friends, but never hang out with them during weekends or after school. Because I don't know, I don't know what to do, asking them out, invite them to have lunch, then what are going to talk about? ""hey how's the food?"", I don't know.

I wasn't like this, I used to hang out with friends, active inviting them to go somewhere and spend time from 12pm to 12am, from going to malls, then go play with them and have fun.

Damn I sound like a child, need to grow up. I am 19, undergrad stud, and feeling lonely. I know what I need to do, but I don't what to do/how to do it.

I’m like i’m not gonna just show up lol i hate feeling I’m forcing myself on people and that’s definitely what this person made me feel like rn they don’t even bother to reply fast idc if they wanted to cancel or reschedule just have some respect even if we’re “friends” which we’re not close at all friends have respect for each other right? This is why I don’t fuck with people irl it always feels like they’re killing time and don’t actually like me being around

lonely,can't think of a title,"can't think of a title - Have you ever felt okay but at the same time there's that hollow feeling somewhat saying that you are not okay? I mean i'm somewhat of a 'happy' person. I crack jokes every now and then, smile, laugh like there's no tomorrow, but at the end of the day, there's that lingering feeling of loneliness (?). I just feel that's something lacking that I do not know."
lonely,Going on vacation alone,"Going on vacation alone - I really want to take a vacation this year, but I've got no one to go with.

I'm worried that I'm gonna go and it just end up being super depressing instead of enjoyable. I really need time for myself but I don't want to invert on me and I end up becoming sad and I do nothing during the vacation.

Have you guys done it before? How do you keep yourself sane while doing it?"
lonely,Crippling Depression &amp; Rejection,"Crippling Depression &amp; Rejection - I’ve been clinically depressed since I was a child now it’s developed into something else. I post a lot on r4R, foreveralonedating, needafriend and makenewfriendshere and I’ve looked at other females’ posts and they always get upvotes and I think people talk to them a lot, but I don’t get upvotes. I don’t know if people just ignore my posts or they look at my posts and they don’t like it. 
My point is it’s making me depressed 🥺 
Awhile ago I felt adventurous and wanted to talk to more people, so I joined some Discord servers that I found here on Reddit but as always I either get bullied or ignored or both so naturally I left. I’m not sure how to find more good people to talk to. I’m not saying people don’t message me but the ones that message me don’t last and they’re lacking. I’d like to find someone with depth. I don’t know how to describe it but like a genuine person with genuine emotions. Somebody self-aware and emotional who relates to me. I haven’t found many people like that, I don’t really know if they exist. I’ve been struggling with socializing in real life and online. It bothers me a lot and I find it hard to cope. I used to talk to somebody but I don’t talk to them anymore. It took me about a year to find them. So I’ve been feeling really lonely, empty, detached and frustrated with things. I don’t get along with anybody so I will continue making posts until I find somebody like him again. I think I’m a genuine person who’s entertaining once you get to know me. I think I’m a funny, caring and smart person. But besides myself other people don’t think that way of me. I’ve been trying to improve my self image but it’s just hard when everybody else thinks you’re not as good as you think you are. I don’t think there’s a lot of people like me. Sure I’m mean sometimes. Sure I’m mean to strangers. Sure I’m mean when you first start talking to me. I know I’m not the most politically correct person and I’m offensive most of the time but I still have depth in emotions . I don’t know how to explain it. I think I’m a good person who’s troubled because she hasn’t been given a chance in life to be herself. But I’m conflicted maybe I’m a bad person. Who knows? I think I radiate positive crackhead energy when I’m happy (which isn’t often). I think I can make someone happy. How do I become enough? I try to please other people but they are never pleased with me. I just want to make someone happy. I’m the type of person who no matter how much she tries, I can never be happy by myself I always need somebody. I just want to be normal."

I feel like women are better at understanding problems and coming up with solutions 🐈.  Could just be me. 🤷‍♂️

lonely,lonely at a party,"lonely at a party - my good friend's pretty popular so he threw a huge party. originally i wasn't gonna go because i'm just not a partier. i ended up going. keeping in mind that the last time I smoked weed was on new year's eve, i took a blinker from some random girls dab cart after drinking some titos (not even enough to get me drunk) and got sent to the moon. spent 3 and a half hours on the couch next to another passed out kid, drifting in and out of sleep. at one point I got up and ran to the bathroom and let the vomit rip. at least it was all in the toilet. but when i got back, i could hear so many people talking shit about me, but i was too high to say anything back. they were saying things like ""who invited him"" ""he's such a little bitch"" ""why does (guy who's party it was) hang out with him?"". why do they have to choose me to completely rip apart? it's not like I was the only one who'd thrown up,  and it's definitely not like they've never done it before. and i thought i was cool with these kids? like i'm always nothing but kind to them and we have pretty nice conversations whenever we talk. i had a good amount of ""friends"" at this party, but none of them were around. none of them checked on me, none of them tried to talk to me. i was just there all alone next to another passed out kid. why are teenagers such horrible people, and why can't i go to a party without feeling overwhelmingly lonely during it?

TLDR: greened out a party, heard a lot of people who i thought i was friends with badmouthing me, sat there all alone on the couch for a majority of the time."

I’m a little buzzed.  However,  as I watch my friends flirt and be flirted with, I have never been more aware of how I want someone to want to know me and to be in love.  I hope you all find someone to keep you from the loneliness inside you."
lonely,"I’m scared. I’m too scared to live, and I’m too scared to die.","I’m scared. I’m too scared to live, and I’m too scared to die. - 

This is an awful feeling. It’s been going on for years, and nothing helps me. It’s hurts more because of my loneliness. No one really cares, I get ghosted or they just stop talking to me. It hurts too that society sees someone like me, (a self harmer for many years) as a freak.

I’m just trying to find the love of my life and be happy. But apparently that’s too much to ask. I’m not “worthy” enough To girls to try to build up courage to talk to. But other guys can just instantly get any girls number and it seems like I’m the only one who can’t love anyone. But those guys just want sex and nothing more. I’ve always wanted a real relationship, sometime to share your feelings with, to hold each other while the horrible world around you rages on. But I’m just seen as “thirsty” or “cringy”. 

I wouldn’t blame anyone who reads this if they didn’t try and help me, I understand truly I do. I’d be surprised if someone even made it this far. Because I know that I sound like the most typical, by the numbers “good” guy. But I don’t have really any other way to express my emotions other than cutting myself. It’s all built up, and I have no release anywhere in my life. Nothing helps😔. 

It’s really sad too, because I tried to kill myself when I was 17 and I was thrown into a hospital. It was awful. But at least it wasn’t long. I kept the wrist band I wore ever since, every now and then I gaze at it in remorse and ponder about how my life was so different back then. That was only 2 years ago though it feels like a lifetime. 

I just want love. Honest and wholesome love. 

If you read this thread, I thank you from the bottom of my aching heart. Thank you."
lonely,It's alright,"It's alright - 21 F. i hadn't felt the overwhelming rush of loneliness in awhile. Suddenly it hit me after work.

it hurts not having many friends to text. I've been craving someone to stay up all night with, just talking to them. i yearn for a friend that wants to talk to me. 

i go about my day receiving almost zero messages. im touched starved due to years of zero companionship. to this day, im wary of touching people. im just not used to it. but i wish i had someone to hug. 

i can live without hugs &amp; affection. i can live without friends &amp; romance. But god, do i yearn for it so bad sometimes. 

i wish the few friends i have would text me back. i wish the person I was interested in would talk to me. i wish i had someone to go out &amp; have fun with.  

but it'll be alright. im so thankful for this subreddit &amp; those that are similar. While we may be lonley, we are not entirely alone. We have each other &amp; we're bonded by the fact we can relate. It's comforted me for tonight. chin up guys♡

lonely,Lost touch with what makes me happy.,"Lost touch with what makes me happy. - As the title states i've lost touch of whats made me happy. I used to have friends and hobbies  even those have drifted away and I can't connect to people the way I used. I used to make people laugh and always had to be front and center of the attention. Now I spend my days in bed or in front of my tv wondering how life got to be so damn boring and mundane. Things went down hill fast when I had gotten married and moved in with my ex. Things were great and I was pretty happy, I did miss my family but I figured that was normal cause this was my first time moving out. After a year into it my ex couldn't keep a job so it left me working extra long hours of a job I already didnt care for. After awhile I became bitter to how I was being treated by him and work. Felt so tired all the time all I did was stay in bed on my free time. I got so miserable that I looked else where for comfort I know what I did was wrong so I asked for a divorce hoping someone else could make me happy and at first I thought I met the man of my dreams. Seriously was too good to be true I quickly moved in with him after my ex kicked me out of the apartment. I felt pretty happy with my now boyfriend who is in the army I knew was getting deployed and i thought I could handle it but I was wrong and I never felt so alone and isolated in my life cause when i moved in with him I moved farther up north. Things got better bad between my bf and i. We fought about money and how I wasnt helping enough he kinda made me feel like I was worthless without ever saying it. The 9 months were hard I wasnt sure if we were even going to make but we did and after he got back things were a little awkward and tense. I thought things were going back to how they were when met but all he ever does is play video games when he gets off work and on weekends. I know i'm not perfect but I've told him many of times about my depression and anxiety. How I like to go out once in awhile. I haven't been out with him since October. I feel like I can't say anything cause he's sensitive and is easy to set off. Which has lead me here seeking attention and feeling lonely and hopeless. Like I'm worth nothing to anyone. Just wish someone would see me for the amazing person everyone else claims i am but never treats me that way. I want that connection and meaningful bond. I wanna look into someone's eyes and be lost there forever. I want to be loved for and cared for and not have to beg for it. I'm sorry this post is long but I can't hold it in any longer.

The person who people will talk to just long enough for it to be polite then talk to the people they actually care about.  I leave parties and gatherings early and without anyone ever noticing I have left.  I’ve had some decent friendships in the past but have run out of energy to invest as heavily as I have in them.  I’ve kind of decided that I’m only going to put in the effort I get.  Problem is what I’ve noticed is after a while no one talks to me anymore,  I might get a meme from someone once every 2-3months but other than that I could disappear from the face of the earth and no one would notice.  I have no idea what’s wrong with me or why I can’t have any sort of decent social life but here we are and I’m tired of trying and failing and going no where."

It’s the little things that get to me. Just feeling like I don’t have anyone to be bored with or share interests with. I came from such a warm cultured open social environment to a now more conservative area ¿ I have hope that I can find my subcommunity but as of right now I’m getting pretty tired of it.

It’s my first time moving away from home, not sure how people deal with this. I try to still go out and do the things I like; hiking, beaching, dancing etc. even if it means going alone.

But, I just want a chance to fix things. I'm full aware that I'll never get it back, but I'm still holding out for that chance.
No ever texts me anymore. Nothing
I miss being able to call her all the time. I miss going to her house. I miss hearing her voice, her laugh, everything.

lonely,Next week I am going out Solo.,"Next week I am going out Solo. - Hey Lonely Redditors, 

Last night I had a dream, a dream that gave me a wake up call. I dreamed that I was extremely old, staring into the sunset in my hospital bed. I realised I had no one by my side and had tears dropping down my face. When my eyes were shut I was in a state of darkness I interpreted that this was the end I was officially dead. I later woke up in my real reality. If I don't make the change and become stuck in my old ways I will be lonely forever and die alone. What a sad miserable life. Next week I am going to go to a few meet ups and socialise with strangers. 

It takes a lot of courage to do this I must admit, but I must go out and explore this world. 

Wish me some luck."

lonely,Roommate (m24) is constantly putting me (f22) down which is making me depressed and lonely.,"Roommate (m24) is constantly putting me (f22) down which is making me depressed and lonely. - Sorry for how long this is! 

My roommate was one of my best friends from college.  We’ve had a pretty good, platonic relationship which is why I though living together and signing a long lease would be okay since we both had jobs in a similar area.   Lately though, he’s been constantly putting me down or saying things that I find hurtful which has me considering breaking our lease and wiping my hands of our friendship.  It is at the point now where every conversation is pretty much him putting me down.  Here is some of the things he has been doing:

1) He make comments about my weight knowing that it is a pain point for me.  I was in better shape in college, but have definitely put on some weight (125 to now 150) after graduation but it’s something that I’m working on.  Recently he’s made so many negative comments about it that it’s been affecting my confidence since he always has something to say about it like “ I look fine from behind but from the side I have a gut”.  He has made comments about how I was thinner in college and how he would’ve slept with me then, but not now.   I also was fairly promiscuous in college and he makes comments about that and how I’m less now. 

2) He doesn’t really do any of the chores in shared areas.  We meal prep together and since he’s better at cooking, I offer to do the dishes we cooked in.  Now, he expects me to do all the dishes and will just leave his dishes in the sink for me.  The few rare times he does his dishes, he only washes the containers that he took for lunch.  This really got on my nerves when he put some dishes in the sink while I was washing them and when I asked him if he could help, he told me it was my job.   Before we lived together, I use to wash his dishes when I came to hangout at his apartment because he would let them pile up so I would offer to help him out with the.  My dog has to be on the shared floor during the day since it has hardwood floors, so I don’t mind taking the responsibility of vacuuming that floor.  He also will put the trashcans out but expects me to put them back.  I was on a work trip during trash day this week and came back very late that evening and he left the trash can out for me to put back even though I put them out and put them back when he’s on trips.  The trashcans are stored on his patio so it’s easier for him to put them away since he doesn’t have to walk around the house twice and can get back in through his room. 

3) He travels more than me and expects me to watch his cat.  In November and December, I had to watch his cat for over four weeks.   He promised me he would be back on December 31st and then extended the trip without telling me until the day he was suppose to return from the trip and expected me to cancel my New Years plans to watch his cat since she was ill and needed medication every 8 hours.  I was originally going to go to a different city that is four hours away for New Years.  My dog had also been neutered over the holidays so I was completely stressed out trying to take care of a sick cat and my dog who was recovering from surgery while still working.   Before he left, I also asked him if he had to leave so early for his trip since I knew taking care of an ill dog and cat with work would stress me out and it is a lot to manage for over two weeks.  He told me that his family wanted him home for the holidays early so I didn’t ask again.  I later found out that instead of being home with family, he went to Miami with his girlfriend for 4-5 days.  I needed to reach him one day because his cat had multiple seizures and had peed all over his closet and he wasn’t responding to my texts or calls so I called his mom to see if she could help me reach him and she told me where he was.  When he returned, he didn’t even thank me.  I had washed his bed when his cat she peed on it and tried my best to get the pee out of his carpets so his room wouldn’t smell like pee.  Instead, he was upset that I had left two empty cat food tins on his dresser.  

4) He doesn’t treat my dog very well.  I got my puppy back in July and he knew that I was getting him before we agreed to move in.  He’s not a dog person, so I try to excuse some of his behavior.  My roommate works from home on Fridays so I asked him if he could take my dog out for me so I wouldn’t have to come home during work to check on him.  I later found out that he was taking my dog’s water bowl away pretty much for the 8 hours I was gone so he could play League Of Legends and wouldn’t have to take my dog out as often.  He got made at me for being upset with him for that since my dog has accidents when I’m home and none with him so he was clearly in the right.  He also constantly tells me that I’m a terrible dog mom because his girlfriend has a better trained dog.  Her dog has been to a training program.  Eventually, I sent mine to one because of his constant comments.  He never has anything nice to say about my dog.  Even though I dislike his cat, I try to make an effort to get along with her and even compliment her to him for how she has warmed up to me.

5) He always makes comments about how he is smarter than me and is very condescending in how he speaks to me.  If I make a mistake or does something he doesn’t approve of, he immediately makes comments like “You’re so silly” or “Nothing you do surprises me anymore” or “Sometimes I forgot I live with a 22 year old and think I live with a 5 year old”.  At first, I didn’t mind but now these comments are pretty much constant and everything I do is “stupid”.

6) He makes plans with me and will not tell me anything, shows up hours later, and then gets angry with me when I ask him to let me know if he’s going to be late.  I understand that he has a new girlfriend and wants to spend as much time as possible with her and have no problem with that.  I’m happy he has someone after how he was treated in his last relationship and it’s nice that people has stopped commenting about how we should date.  He and I will make plans for example : “Let’s go get lunch at 1pm”.  He will go hangout with his girlfriend and I will do thinks I have planned.  It’ll be 1pm and I haven’t heard anything from him.  Then, he’ll come back at 4pm after I’ve decided to go eat already and say “Oh, I’m sorry I lost track of time! I just don’t look at the clock when I hang out with her.  We can just go now!”  The first couple of times I tried to be understanding and okay with this, but now it has been almost every plan that we have made for the past four months.  When we make plans now, I’ve stopped setting the time aside for him and plan on either pushing it back a couple of hours or just assuming we won’t doing them at all.   Sometimes he makes me feel like I’m just there to entertain him when she’s busy and I should have my time free for him, but if I run late on my plans, I need to be more considerate of him.

7) We were both single when we first moved in together and he had a ton of rules like “I don’t want to meet any of the guys you bring back.” and “Let me know when you have someone over so I can stay in my room.”  When he started dating, he expected me to meet every girl he liked so they could meet my dog even though he knows I have severe social anxiety and I don’t like meeting new people be sprung at me because I feel forced to say yes even if I’m not feeling well.  Then when I asked him to follow the same rules, I was being controlling. 

8) I work a much lower paid job than him.  I’m in marketing and he is in computer science.  Whenever I express my frustration with still being a temp and waiting for that full time offer, he always makes comments about how he would have never taken a temp job.  He also makes comments about how his salary is so much higher from when he was an intern and how mine only increased by $1 an hour.

9) I recently returned from a work trip.  He had gone into my room to put the blankets I use on our living room couch onto my bed.  I thought it was weird since we normal just put the unused blankets on an ottoman.  He was also lending me a space heater which he took from my bathroom.  When I returned from my trip, I realized that I’m missing a pair of gold earrings that were next to the space heater in my room.  I know with 100% certainty where they were left and they’re no longer there.  I don’t want to believe that he or his gf took them, but I can’t find them anywhere and have spent the past two days completely cleaning my room and shared areas looking for them. When I brought it up with him, he got really defensive and brought up how he has plenty of money and wouldn’t need my earrings.  I just want them back because my mom got them for me.

10) We pay the same rent for a master bedroom and one extra room each.  I turned my extra room into our guest room while his is his office which I’m only allowed to use it when he wants me to play League with him (which he usually gets angry at me for playing poorly).  While I was on my work trip, he turned the guest bedroom into a plant room without asking me.  So now, he has three of the four bedrooms. 

10) I’m trying to build my credit and was trying to use a rent tracking app that adds it to your credit.  I pay my rent in advance from when it’s due on the 1st of every month.  On the portal we pay through, it says that it is due the first of every month.  He always pays it after the first sometimes as late as the 5th or waits to get the late rent email.  Because we haven’t been fined for it yet, he won’t pay it by the first so I can’t use the rent tracking app because it marks our rent as late and will hurt my credit. 

At this point, I want to move out because I’m tired of feeling like a terrible person and tiptoeing around him and his girlfriend.  I’ve tried talking him to him about things, but all of our conversations turn into sessions where he berates me for being overly emotional, he’s completely innocent, and he never had any issues with any of his guy roommates.  I’ve tried to make efforts to get along with him and his girlfriend to try to make this living situation bearable but they both are very condescending to me so I’ve chosen to avoid them. He made these comments before his current girlfriend, but now they’re more often and harsher.  I’m not in the best financial situation since the dog training program was expensive and I’m paying more rent than I wanted to because he didn’t help me find a house during the search.  I ended up signing a lease on this place that was above my price range with nothing I wanted because he didn’t like any of the places in my price range and my lease at my old apartment was up.  I live far away from all my friends now and he has turned his mom against me which really hurts cause I saw her as a second mom.  Should I continue to try to salvage our friendship, just be roommates, or start looking for a way to move out? 

tl;dr:  My roommate is condescending and treats me poorly, but I’m not in a good financial position to move out."

When I first learned about their new relationships I wasn’t upset or anything, in fact I was happy. But as tonight kept going on I felt more and more alienated. Not that they were purposely trying to make me feel bad. Just that hearing how well their lives are going just makes me realize that I’m so alone. Along with the stories of hand holding, resting heads on shoulders, and them saying “I love you” to each other is almost too much.

lonely,I loss another friend today :(,"I loss another friend today :( - We were friends before but we ended on bad terms 5 years later we started talking again and being friends. I was happy she was back my life, we started talking in November of 2019 and well I thought we were doing great.  I like looked forward to her messages and chats. But recently literally last week she was inactive I would send her messages to check on her and she'll leave me on read. So I stopped talking to her until today I tried again and I asked ""we good? Is everything alright dude?"" "" hey if you don't want to be friends anymore please let me know."" And she replied with "" honestly I don't give a shit if you leave or stay."" I honestly didn't know how to respond to that message really. So  I said "" I'm sorry. For bothering you."" And she sent me a ""Bye. ✌️"" 
It felt like someone punched my heart out.

lonely,I'm kind... even to strangers...,"I'm kind... even to strangers... - I'm someone who cares too deeply about ""friends"". People who never give me the time of day, never bother asking how I am, isolate me for long periods of time. Yet I care too much, that even then I'm holding onto hope that someday they might realise how much I care and won't be so distant anymore. 

I have an unrealistic capacity for caring. People who have ignored and/or forgotten about me, I still think fondly of them. I wouldn't go stalking them or start sending them messages as though we were friends, but in the background I'd still care and wonder how they are. And this just makes things strange... because it doesn't matter how long someone might have stopped talking to me, there would be no awkwardness if they do get back in touch. They could be gone for a whole year, we could be quiet for an entire 365 days and if they were to message me ""hi"" or if I were to message them, it wouldn't feel like a single day passed by. I just don't feel that awkwardness people get from being quiet for so long and that's probably one of my curses too. 

People expect you to be awkward as well, and if they notice you're not it gives them a sense of uneasiness. They don't know if you are clingy or overly-attached. 

I'd take a bullet for someone. I'd buy a birthday card for everyone. I'd let them call me at night to vent about their problems. I'd visit them at hospital. Yet I haven't found a friend who would let me do those things without it being awkward or me potentially being taking for granted. 

Maybe my perception of friendship is warped. But a friendship that holds no meaning, feels empty and depressing. Even if it weren't to the same consistency and we only hung out a few times. I only hope for at least one message from them, for them to message me first for once. The hanging out and everything, that comes afterwards. Them giving me one message first is more meaningful to me than anything else. 

It's not just this, I'm too careful around strangers. I try my best not to accidentally inconvenience others, even though they might happily inconvenience me. Even if they might scoff at me for accidentally bumping into them, I wouldn't be able to let it go. If someone was to talk to me, anyone, I'd be happy to listen to what they had to say. It's irrational and sounds like an attachment issue, but I'm being genuinely serious. I care too much about strangers, friends, that's just how I am. 

I wouldn't place a stranger on a pedestal or help them out as they haven't gained my trust, but I'd still be sad if I did anything to make anyone feel frustrated. 

Is anyone else like this? I can't switch it off easily, it's who I am."

So basically had a dream that I was in a serous/wholesome relationship with someone that I know irl and it got me fucked up when I woke up and realized that it was all a dream.

lonely,"Don't know if anyone can relate, but does anyone just lose motivation to hangout with other people?","Don't know if anyone can relate, but does anyone just lose motivation to hangout with other people? - I'm the type of person to get invited rather than to invite others. I don't feel like taking initiative and plan with others, because disasters can happen, such as maybe a person becomes late for an hour, to a point our time is wasted. Here's another thing, I don't like being invited to go to far places like a popular amusement park which is 45 km away from where I live. This results to homesickness, I don't know why I have this feeling. It's a feeling where you don't feel enthusiastic on where you are and having fun. I don't know if it's just me or if some people have this experience. There are also common places that people go to like the movies. But I feel like I'll have no idea of what to do and how to get there. There are questions such as. Who is dropping me and picking me up? Do I require a card? Then I feel like it's a complex process and I end up not coming and not to mess up. There are other basic things I don't know I need to go to places with friends which is really embarrassing. I would deny coming and end up being ""busy"" with school and end up on my phone, being on social media in my own space."

lonely,Seeing families makes me want to break down,"Seeing families makes me want to break down - So I've seen others like this, quite a few actually. However, mine is not family in the future sense. I already gave up on that long ago.

It's families that you see outside, who get together and spend time with each other. Mothers, Fathers, Siblings, Uncles, Aunts and so on.

I never had any of that. A distant mother and an abusive, hateful stepfather. Outside of that. Nothing.
At 24, I feel like I've missed out on so many valuable experiences. I don't want what love is. I don't know what it means. What it feels like. To feel the vibe that somebody cares about you. That you have a relation to someone.

All my family want nothing to do with me. I don't know why, or what's wrong with me. I was never a part of the picture. I've met them once or twice, but it's all a fake show that they're happy to see you, and then you never hear from them again. But you see how they all get together for events on social media, and how you're excluded. What did I do? Was it because I was born? Is that a problem? Is there something wrong with me?

Everytime I head out, and I see families, I feel pain, and I start to become emotionally on edge really quickly. No matter my mood, I instantly fall into a deep depressive state, and I wonder why I've not been allowed to experience normal human interactions and life's moments.

If my own blood is unable to see me as valuable and interesting, how would anybody else? I'm as good as dead."

lonely,Note To Self,"Note To Self - Dear Former Self,

I wish I could create rifts in spacetime to come pay you a visit but we already agreed that would cause more harm than good. 

It's been long, but I miss you. I saw your glimpse in me a while back. The ability to unconditionally love something, the naivety to idealise people, and the spirit to conquer the world. It took me a while to comprehend how much has changed since then. 

The path ahead is nothing like you expect it to be. You'll soon realize that loving something with all your heart can mean nothing, that people are not who you think they are, that your passions will die a slow death. You will cry, as I have. You will eagerly knock on doors that won't open. You will isolate yourself. Your body will disfigure to match your mind. Your will, will crumble as mine has. Yet, the worst part is, that you will survive through it all.

When you emerge on the other side, still unaware, still hopeful, don't lose sight of your origin. Hold onto it, it will give you the strength to bear it all. Remember who you are. Remember where you come from. Remember your promise. Remember our promise. To be kind enough to console ourselves when we are hurting. To be strong enough to never let anyone hurt us on a whim. To be courageous enough to never let dejection stop us in our tracks. Remember.

If you manage to brave through this storm, don't be disheartened. Believe in yourself. The world will try to suck all life out of you. It will plaster you with rejection. It will demand you to fit in. You will probably be reduced to a husk. A bitter, lifeless, self-loathing existence. You will think about ending yourself. But your responsibilities won't let you. You will think about discussing your issues. But your insecurities won't let you. As a prisoner of your own mind, you will suffocate everyday. Until one day, when you will give in. You will forsake everything. You will become everything you hate. Apathetic, manipulative, self-serving, intolerant, and pretentious. And the world will still hate you for that. But as a veteran of dear life, you will be too tired to care. 

Stop here. Because this is no longer you, it's me. And as I said, I miss you. I know how hard it's been for you. I understand. I know how much you have craved for these words. I know how heavy your heart is right now. I wish I could hug you. I wish I could be there for you. To love you back unconditionally, to be the ideal person you seek, to accept you and your passions as they come. I know how happy you would be. If only there was one person just like me. I know because we are the same. As I write this letter to you, somewhere deep down there, I envision my future self writing it for me. We are our own lineage. Separated by time periods, united by being. We don't need anyone else. Because in the end, we are the only ones who'll stay. As memoirs of the past, or aspirations of the future. As afterimages of the now, flickering with time. As you and me. We are the only ones who matter. So, hold on. For help is on its way. So, hold on. Just a little longer. 

Love,

Thyself."

lonely,My ex girlfriend is already in a new relationship. I just sleep all day and have no feelings left.,"My ex girlfriend is already in a new relationship. I just sleep all day and have no feelings left. - Those two years we were together were bumpy. But prior to those two years I was alone. Alone everyday. Every time I went to bars I was alone. No one ever looked my way. No one ever smiled my way when I looked around. No eye contact. It was a horrible time, my twenties were. Then I finally met this girl who really changed everything for me. She wasn’t perfect. She was quirky and bubbly and smiley and overall she was just so much more then I ever was. 

We fought a lot after the honeymoon phase finally died down. Our relationship was becoming more solid but also came with issues. I don’t blame her for finding someone else who makes her happy and smile again. I just wish i could’ve done more. I wish I was such a loner, wish I had more friends. But she brought out such a different side of me. Such a brightness to my personality. But it’s over now and I have no idea how to move forward. People say to go work on yourself. They don’t know how much energy it takes to go to the gym again and fake a smile because you don’t want to come off as prudish or annoyed. I’m absolutely lost right now and I have no idea if I’ll ever truly be happy with anyone like I was with her. I never felt so comfortable in my skin as I did with her and now she’s with someone else. Someone else who can bring out that shine that I dimmed. 

I feel so lost, hopeless and completely in ruin. I don’t honestly think I’ll be able to cope with being alone again. It took me years to finally even get a date. Years to make one friend that actually stuck around. Now it just feels like it’ll take me years to get back into that type of swing again. I don’t think I have the mental capacity to be able to date again. Meet new people with different personalities when the person that I wanted and needed was right here."

Like I just want to have someone i can hang out with, even sit in a random public place with, just chatting with someone or have a cup of coffee. Everything here is so expensive and whenever I try to get involved in a group activity it costs so much!! it's like i'm paying 100$ per hour to just sit and chat with me and do some random activity whether it be learning something new etc.. its ridiculous.

lonely,Still looking for companions ON THIS SUB !!,"Still looking for companions ON THIS SUB !! - Hi  guys my name is C.  I'm a suicidalist, a cutter. And

#I'M LOOKING FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP. PLEASE HMU!!


I guess. I'm bipolar, a rape survivor, potential addict. I'm 17. I'm a boy-man-thing living in America. I'm outing here,kinda. Because I've sent posts to r/suicidewatch since I was born..and a lot of them the same. ""I'm gonna KMS, this way, at this time"" ..and dammit I keep surviving, waking up, embarrassed, weak, and worse than before.  On average I am suicidal at least 1-2 times every 12 hours... Not to be unnecessarily precise. i'm suicidal enough to post every other day to at best 1x per week. I have lost relationships to this pattern of thinking, I have tried helping others  to get out of myself., I have done and will keep on with therapy, psych, meds and other helpful alternatives like music, exercise, and sleep hygiene (I'm insomniac) and healthy sexuality (i'm an abstinent hypersexual) (if that even exists). I'm a mess, guys. I identify with forms and testimonials for OCD., and I have anxiety, like no other. When I go to sleep at night, if I do, I have no idea when I'll wake up. Yes, i'm on r/insomnia and I also self harm. Readers of my stuff know already. Yeah, so I cut but not as deep as you probably do, and I have tried scalding, too. I have been called toxic by more people than I can count and half of whom I have loved so deeply it destroyed me (because I spend way too much time trying to be understood than to understand) (and b/c I keep looking for the ""Girl who Understands."") 

My favorite suicidal fantasies are not in order, by train, by heroic saviorism, by self inflicted gunshot, but blood loss, and by pills. Hanging, sometimes. Most every attempt failed, I am told, because I secretly want to live, like - self-consciously. I'm still trying to figure out where that part of me is. And until then, I'll have to keep riding this merry go round until I succeed or....until I succeed. I eat 1.5 meal(s) a day. I love caffeine.  I dont wanna grow up, but I do. My last and only IRL girlfriend died of an OD in my arms in 2018, literally in front of me. It broke my heart, and I'd always wanted to join her. I do believe in God. But I am accepting and sympathetic with all faiths, and with agnostics and atheists. We're all on this subreddit. But sometimes I'm super angry with God, and other times I'm thankful.. Long story. I like art and music. And writing, and science..... I wanted to be a doctor for ages...but I doubt w/ my mental health I'll make it into med school. I dont wanna be a failure I dont wanna be living on state care and you know, out of a trash bag and getting bussed to homes and hair cuts for the rest of my adult life. I wanna wife, a job. A rental. You know....a few babies. A car. Nothing fancy..its all so far off though and apparently ...but *that* is another post.. .. Anyway. I have tried every possible means of KMS that were handy to an uncreative guy like me in the last 12 mos. 

Even I can see the pattern is sickening.

 A few issues I wanna clear up before it comes up, (1) there is no such thing as suicidal for the attention. Attention may be involved to some extent...but it's usually a ""practice run"" of seeing if anyone would miss them. Pretending not to care, being sarcastic about it, or even reproachful....will EVENTUALLY BACKFIRE. (2) Suicidals should probably stop telling other people what to say or how to feel. You can say whatever you want, true, but man, stop lecturing the sane on what you (a suicidal person) wanna hear. (3) there is NO SUCH THING as both sane AND suicidal. Get that out of your head. I am not sane, man. I am suicidal. A *lot*... And I'm not gonna argue with you whether it's ethically, socially, and pychiatrically palatable to be suicidal. It's - *not* .........yet we get sick inside, with peceptions, isolation, even just aching and longing, waking up in fear, falling asleep to PSD nightmares reliving your trauma (several times a month, my rape dreams). And when suffering goes on long enough.....we start to look for a ""way out."" Understandable, universal, yet unqiuely felt as is also insanely .....well.......insane. ... Anyway.... Just....idk.

 And (4) I love you. I accept you and want to help you. I want to MOVE ON FROM SUICIDAL PATTERNS, and if I can maybe you can. And become healthy again!! And I want that for you too.  You're not alone.   Please HIT ME THE FUCK UP and we can be friends or just temp chat partners or whatever. Fight it, and surrender what can't be fought (not surrender *to* it, just surrender - *it*). Fight until you can feel everything level out at LAST and your aching life isn't resisting gravity anymore - but sailing forward on a level surface again. Again, I love you. Catch me in DMs or below. I'll try to be near all of you."
lonely,i feel like i should give it all away,"i feel like i should give it all away - I am just an absolute asshole to everyone around me in my eyes. I have nobody who I care about. If they're gone, oh well. I don't care about family, I don't have friends. I honestly don't even remember anything about who I used to be. I try to make friends, but everybody just either deals with me, tells me to silence myself, or just straight up yell at me for something I was doing. I try to stay happy and cheerful, and usually I am in public, but in private I just end up feeling like something that wasn't meant to exist in the first place. And, I'm not kidding about the no friends thing either. I don't even know WHAT my definition of friend is."
lonely,What is so wrong with me?,"What is so wrong with me? - I (20F) am a Junior in college and I don’t have any friends. The friends I do have go to school five hours away from me. Normally they come home in the summer and I sorta just look forward to that, but today I learned they aren’t. I am not mad at them, in fact I’m happy they are finding and making a life in their new city. I’m just sad because I realize we probably won’t be that close anymore, and overwhelmingly that I just don’t have any friends that I can actually hang out with. I don’t understand what is so wrong with me that people don’t want to be my friend. I’m not the most attractive girl but I’m always friendly, have good hygiene, and put effort into looking nice when I leave home. I go to class and I am friendly to people and try to be inviting. At work I am super friendly and have tried to make friendships with the people there but nothing really clicks. I guess I don’t understand what it is about me that puts people off or makes them not want to be my friend. I feel lonely a lot and struggle with depression and anxiety chronically. I know you guys probably have heard all of this before and it’s sorta a dime a dozen, but being lonely is really tough. I feel for everyone in this subreddit because feeling alone and unwanted really makes a person feel worthless and defective. I hope it gets better."
lonely,I volunteer for a night emotional support helpline,"I volunteer for a night emotional support helpline - Night hours tend to be the ones when people feel most lonely and sad. At our uni we have a telephone and online message service that students can contact and talk to us about anything they wish to get off their chest. Our job is to try and help them feel slightly better, comfort them emotionally without giving any direct advice. I (student myself) have been volunteering with the helpline for over a year now and as you can imagine I talked to a lot of lonely people. It warms my heart a lot when people tell me they feel a lot better after our conversation but more often than not, there is only so much I can do for them. At the end of the day, as much I wish I could do something for them, I can't really help them. Partly because I don't even know how to help myself, I struggle with loneliness regularly and every time I talk to callers I can relate to them as if they were me. I can feel how much suffering every person who talked to me is going through because I feel the same way. Usually it does help me, however, find a way to make them open up more, talk about their feelings so that we can connect on a more emotional level. That way usually people can at least feel better for a while.

I truly believe that everyone deserves to be happy, to have people in their lives they can come for help to. Most people I speak with tell me the same words, just how much they wish they had someone they could be close with. There are so many people in the world and somehow we still end up feeling lonely. It shouldn't be like that. It's a huge burden on people that unfortunately causes some to lose the belief in this world, in themselves. I guess for me, helping others is the reason I still believe in all the good in the world despite so many lonely years, I try to improve. I find motivation from hope that one day I'll be able to find amazing people that I could share my life with and I would be very grateful for that, never taking it for granted knowing how much being able to have someone by your side means. I hope that if you feel lonely, you will find happiness soon, let me encourage you to just not lose belief in that and stay strong. Sending lots of love and hugs to everyone."

Sure I have friends and we occasionally chat and talk on discord but it’s not the same as actually hanging out. I thought about asking some friends if they would want to hang out on my birthday yesterday, but I remembered that most of my friends live far away and are studying and i’m the only one not going to school or have a job and due to some complications, I can’t study or get a job.

This is probably incoherent babbling but I just felt like I had to vent somewhere."

But nothing can be done i suppose... and although i wrote a long ass paragraph to some random strangers some part of me is dying to know the reason why im doing so .

I crave the sharing of laughs and good company. But I also want to be left to my own devices. To enjoy my coffee and walk away without feeling obliged to stay- obliged to stretch this blessed moment longer for you. Let it die in the natural order of the universe and carry on to tomorrow. Let us celebrate a new sun together and see how we can bond in the waking moments of a new day. Let us stimulate our minds with fresh brewed caffeine and crimson rays of sunlight as it peaks over the horizon. In the silence of our moment together watching this miracle of life, we can both exchange a look and give an unspoken gesture of gratitude for this, right here, right now. And at some point in the future we will be alone, remembering this perfect moment of love, and companionship. But for now - gratitude and love."

Be a friend to yourself. You were made for a reason. You messed up, you didn't speak to as many people as you wanted or you can't speak. I'm the same.
 So many of us are the same. You are not worthless. You are absolutely irrevocably as worth it as anyone else. 
If you're lonely, be your own best friend. All of this is so easier said than done, but just relax and try your best. Do the little things that make you happy. Nothing in this world can guarantee happiness even though it seems like having relationships can do that. Only you can let yourself be happy.

lonely,Advice for this situation,"Advice for this situation - So I have suffered with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. This month has been pretty rough. I have been incredibly down, suicide sounds like the only liable option at times. I just started a new job, where I know the work, but the social anxiety and negative self talk get in my way. So that attributes to the lack of feeling good enough. 

I have always lacked a good sense of communication and even get nervous/ in my head about asking for help, even over the simplest things ( which I have recently forced myself to just ""go for it"" and ask, but that's after like the negative self talk of why can't you just go ask a simple question, stupid. 

My family has never been huge into communication and connection. There's just this silent like you can talk to me if you want/need. Which has proven to be the worst, but also forced me to be independent in not trying to rely on anyone and also trust issues.

So here I am, 29, feeling like a failure and complete idiot because I always feel like I am either doing too much or not enough. Have like 3 friends - which 2 are family. I just long for that connection that's easy and not afraid to just open up. I have fear of rejection and used to be a huggeeeee people pleaser. 

Ever since a pretty ugly break up about 3 yrs ago I have been on this spiritual journey and trying to ""understand"" my mind and why I did/ didn't do certain things. I sometimes doubt if it's been fruitful or not. I feel like I made myself into an isolated freak. Or is it good? I have been attempting to unlearn all the bad behaviors and figure out who I am without being with someone.

lonely,Convinced that friend doesn’t want me around anymore,"Convinced that friend doesn’t want me around anymore - At this point I’m convinced that I’m bringing my friend down and that she doesn’t care about me anymore

At this point I’m convinced I’m bringing my friend down and that she doesn’t care about me

She always just seems happier around other people, I understand that I’m not the most uplifting person, but she still seems to hangout with me and I’m not sure why. We just started school again 2 days ago and my mental state has already dropped considerably. 

For some reason I seem to become jealous and then experience symptoms of depersonalisation when my friend has a long conversation with any one of her friends, I just seem to shutdown and not be able to talk to her at all, it just makes me feel like I haven’t done enough and that she’s stopped trying to be friends with me. 


Then you’ve got our conversations, boring, dry and stilted, she laughs more with other people and just seems happier with them overall. I see her smile and laugh a lot more often with them compared to our conversations. She also seems to be more interested in talking with them as well, she just talks more with them and is more interested in starting conversations with them. If I don’t speak with her, she won’t speak with me and if they don’t speak with her, she’ll try and start a conversation.

I’m sorry if this didn’t make sense, I’m not very good at writing down my feelings. I should be able to explain it better if questions are asked about it"

I’ve been really grateful to call a few people I’ve known friends. And all of them are amazing human beings. No matter what though. I still feel super super lonely. It’s only for a little bit where company just fills up this void- but that feeling is also temporary. Right after that I just want to move into my own space and just be on my own and not do anything. 

And while i have these friends. I just feel like I can’t open up to them. 
I can’t just be like “hey I’m not doing so good help me out”, or anything remotely close to that. Just thinking about that makes me feel like I’m a burden to them. 
This constant feeling in my head makes me just keep all my feelings (good or bad) bottled up in me. I’ve now reached a point where I want to open up but I just can’t. 
I’ve been feeling extremely low for the past week or so. I don’t get more than 4 hours of sleep and literally have no motivation to do anything whatsoever. This lack of support system is really annoying me at a time like this. 
 
I don’t know what to do. I just know that I want a support system so that I can feel less shitty."

lonely,Have I been this lonely since forever?,"Have I been this lonely since forever? - Hello everyone. Been roaming here since morning and thought I might share something.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know how to call it, but I've always been the ""on my own"" type of person and excluded myself from a lot of stuff in favor of silence. The thing is, I do really enjoy silence but for a long time I haven't enjoyed loneliness and being with myself. Recently I've ended a (almost) 5 years relationship because I felt lonelier than ever, and started to realize that somewhere along this long road I've lost myself and never looked back. Even though I'm not socially great and a lot of people mistake my need for being alone for ignorance or arrogance, if you look at my life you'll see I'm always the type of person to give it all for the happiness of others, even if that means losing mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I started going to therapy because I couldn't handle my emotions anymore, after the breakup with the person I gave my full time to, after all this years I realized how alone I am and how no one is here for me even though I've always been there for them. Neither my so called friend nor my parents care enough to check on me and see what the problem is, and the worst part is that even I don't care enough about myself to try getting better. At some point in the last month or so I cried my heart out and even thought about just straight up jumping from the closest building because it won't ever matter to anyone and they'll usually end up forgetting about me soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I've got no one. 

&amp;#x200B;

The weekends are the worst, because I can't go to work to get my mind off things and I hate myself way too much to do something alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really need someone to talk to, I even play some video games so if you want to do that just hit me up. I'm a great listener, so if anyone wants to talk, I'm here to hear you out and talk to you.

I also keep wondering what this romance thing people do is about, how does it work? People have sex too, but that's beyond my paygrade. It's just so weird to think about, normal neurotypical people actually experience this stuff they have friends and work and relationships. 

Anyway i'm just touchstarved here's to another year of it hooray."

lonely,I have no life,"I have no life - I need some advice guys. Growing up I was very popular until I developed bipolar. Then I became depressed and withdrew and then I embarrased myself regularly when I was manic. I said offensive things and often talked gibberish at a fast pace. I think most people understand I was mentally unwell.

I have found a medication that works for me and I’m pretty much ok now. My life has improved significantly I’m about to get a mortgage and I have a steady job and a gf but no active social life outside of that. 

I had a bit of an argument with my gf about Reddit last night. She believes I use this site to “fill a void” which I guess is true. I think I use it for a lot of validation. If I’m not spewing my insecurities then I’m posting memes and commenting jokes for upvotes for a sense of belonging. I decided last night to come off of here but I’m back. I thought until my life has actually picked up there’s no point coming off and all I was doing without Reddit was googling my insecurities instead which is worse I’d say.

Basically I want to get off my phone and start hanging out with people irl. I feel like I’ve pushed all my current friends away. They used to invite me but I always didn’t like there were people I didn’t know going also and I get nervous meeting people for first time. I think I have a real fear of being judged. Anyway I guess my life is a bit of a contradiction. I used to be quite extroverted but I guess I still am in a way. 

I think the reasons I isolate myself is because A. I can be quiet and awkward in some environments and I’m still not really sure what the pattern is for me being awkward and B. I have had a few manic episodes which I extremely embarrassed myself on social media. I feel like this has made me a subject of teasing a lot etc.

I don’t know where to go from here and I understand my situation might not be as bad as some. 

Tl dr feel like the only reason I come on Reddit is to fill a void. I want to go out more with some friends but I seem to isolate myself from opportunities. Can be shy in certain situations and possibly a bit introverted. I’m 30 aswell for the record"

When I came back I didn't have anyone, and when you're in your thirties and have a bit of social anxiety it's not easy finding new friends..

lonely,The only people I have in life are barely even in my life...,"The only people I have in life are barely even in my life... - I have to write to get this off my chest. I’m a little drunk and sleep deprived so I apologize in advance.

I’ve been living alone for nearly 3 years now. Before that I was living with my dad and my stepmother, and I was (still, kinda) in a wonderful relationship with my girlfriend. At the time I was going to a local community college from home while in a semi-long distance relationship, however we made things work pretty well.  

Once I graduated with my associates degree and was accepted to a 4-year college in the city where I was going to dorm at. Once I had committed, my dad decided to put the house for sale to move to Florida to enjoy a semi-retirement. He moved there once I was set in the dorms. He never bothered saying goodbye to me, and by the time I found out he was going through with it he was already halfway there. My father and I always got along well and the move completely came out of nowhere.

My girlfriend was still in undergrad at the time, and now she’s doing her grad program in a different school in another state much farther away. My entire relationship with her is basically over the phone; texting, FaceTiming, and snapping each other just for the sake of keeping our streak on Snapchat. It just makes me feel empty.

Now I’m living in an apartment all on my own, paying rent I can just barely afford and can’t afford to even eat out or do anything, which is almost a blessing since I don’t have friends to go out with anyways. Some days when I’m off and have nothing to do I’ll go the entire day without hearing my own voice. The only human contact I really have outside of work is through the phone. I just want to feel like I have a legitimate home that I share with family that I love , not an empty apartment where I just sit on the couch getting drunk alone. 

I’m sorry for the rant. I feel like the only relationships I have with others are a complete sham. I just needed to be truthful and blunt with somebody, for my own sake."

I would like to make gamer and artist friends but thanks to social anxiety I am stuck in this cage of fear of putting myself out there in the world around me and online, for many reasons. let just say I talked to my younger brother and we were talking but a story short he made it sounds like the brother at his friends house wouldn't want to play video games with me like when we were younger because they think I suck at a harder video games .sorry if this came out as a rant of some kind but I just feel like I need to get this off my chest after crying in my room.    also, forgive my grammar mistakes hope tomorrow will be a better day."

I really just want a girlfriend but I feel like it’s never going to happen. I’ve been here 20 years and I’ve never really been on a date. I don’t have poor self image on the outside, I can see girls checking me out and stuff like that, but I just don’t know what to do with that information and I just think once they get to know me they’ll get bored of me fast. I also have very self destructive traits. I was really into this one girl that I worked with in a class and all I can think about is how I never tried to ask her out or anything. Idk, I just don’t wanna be sad anymore and feel like I can’t talk about this stuff with my friends. I’m also not sure if this is the place to be posting this but idk. I just want someone to talk to I guess"

Never really had a girl to even call a friend really, so definitely never had a girlfriend.
It's sucks to cuz my older brother (by like 10 years who's kinda like a role model to me) has social anxiety as well but has had several girlfriends before my age and it just kinda throws salt in the wound, not that I'm mad but just kinda feel like a failure.
I've had crushes but never talked to them really and at this point I feel like I'm just making excuses like ""oh she sits to far away"" and whatnot.
I've thought of joining tinder but lots of people say it's mostly used for one night stands and I don't really care about sex or anything like that I just want a relationship.
Just kinda writing my thoughts on it. If you've come this far in reading thank you for taking the time. Any advice or comments? Anything is appreciated honestly."

lonely,can i scream?,can i scream? - i was listing to this podcast that asked us if we've heard the way we speak. the lady was explaining that some people speak so fast and mostly say every thing and nothing. they speak so fast because the brain is processing so much and they end up dumping it all at once. i now realize im one of those people that cant stop the word vomit. specially when i meet new people. i think its because im so used to been alone and having no one to share my thoughts that when someone interacts with me i get so excited and i dump all this information. has my isolation made me forget how to speak? yes i know the way i write is also the way i express myself but im also high. im a big pod head and this is mostly how i deal with my loneliness. and really i dont care to write properly because i know no one will see this post or care enough to comment. as much as i would love to believe in the fantasy that i will make a friend in here. i will not so why care for my writing. also i'm dyslexic okay and to lazy to care if my english is affecting you. but yeah in moments like this when i look around to just see darkness and that i dont share my life with no one its just makes me sad. i dont like getting stoned when im sad but been alone sometimes is to heavy. silence is to heavy. loneliness echoes in the nothing of my life. not even the high can make me feel

lonely,When you meet someone in person and you realize you’ve completely forgotten what it’s like to socialize,"When you meet someone in person and you realize you’ve completely forgotten what it’s like to socialize - I have spent so long isolated from people that reforming social connections again just feels weird and unnatural. I’m not used to the whole dynamic of creating injokes and referring back to things or even just talking about myself. I mean I give my best lame attempts at imitating these things but it never feels natural or particularly charming. Honestly I just don’t even feel like I have any personality left at all, just a blank kind of vaguely sketched out idea. I don’t even know what I like anymore. But mostly I just feel completely apathetic and distant when I’m  talking to people and my mind seems to work slower. Also meeting people makes me feel exhausted, like I’ve actually done something. I almost feel more lonely when I’m out with people and I can tell it’s awkward."

lonely,I quickly realized how badly my basic needs were not being met,"I quickly realized how badly my basic needs were not being met - I'm 27, ive never had a great social life (though I have a few friends and its honestly the best its ever been in that regards). Despite that I have a lot of loneliness, most of my friends are in a very different life stage then I am, and we have few if any similarities outside a shared hobby. We are supportive and all that but I'm still not getting the connections needed for a healthy life. 

I realized this recently when I met someone online. We were talking and we started talking on voice chat and we talked for over 7 hours straight. 

7 damn hours. thats insane, 7  hours of doing nothing but talking. in the few weeks we have kept in touch we have talked for 4+ hours multiple times. Frequently staying up so late that I was running on 3 or 4 hours of sleep the next day. 

think about that, how starved for connection do you have to be in order to choose an engaging conversation over SLEEP. I mean the conversations are great, but thats just it. Why am I having to go online to find an interesting conversation?

I think its cause I can't be myself around people. I can't let my guard down, or rather I can let my guard down but other people arn't interested in knowing the real me. They want an easy friend to hangout with, not someone who has a shit ton of problems and is dealing with a lot of emotional stuff. So I can bottle that all up throughout my day but in the end I never get the connections I need. Its like I'm dying of starvation and being fed a slice of breed a day as if it was enough to keep me going. Its not. 

I don't know how to get to the deeper relationships with people in person. I don't know how to slowly open up and get them to open up. I mean I'm quite sociable, people seem to really enjoy talking with me. I don't know how to fix any of this. i Just know I want more connection."

lonely,Get along okay with people but don’t really fit in anywhere,"Get along okay with people but don’t really fit in anywhere - So people say hi to me, I talk okay with them, but I never become friends with any of them. 

I want to make close friends but its hard to become an enthusiastic person who knows what to say, joke at the right time, and have similar interests. I’m the “nice” and quiet one when people describe me. I’m a pretty boring person honestly who likes quiet times reading or playing games. 

I do have friends I hang out with rarely but if it’s an odd number group I’m always left behind so I don’t really consider them as close friends.

None of my friends have mental health issues either so I just feel very alone in my emotions as well as just being lonely in general. Is it bad for me to feel this way? Never had a serious relationship, never had a feeling reciprocated by the opposit sex, so every time I start to feel something for someone, I get shot down, it hurts.

What's you're fondest cartoon as a kid? Mine definitely has to be cow and chicken😊"
lonely,Just trying to be myself,"Just trying to be myself - I’ve spent a long time on my own, feeling lonely some of the time and fine like that at others. Don’t get me wrong I’m normally surrounded by people, just nobody I really know, like or would call a friend. I think we all need at least one person to call a true friend, someone we like, trust, enjoy their company. 

The first thing it took me a long time to realise is that I just need to be myself. Most the time I’m really good at this but when I meet somebody I like I sort of try to get them to like me and change things about myself. Things like saying I like the same music as them when really I like something completely different. The problem with this is they aren’t getting to know the real me. It’s a shame when you meet someone you like and they don’t like you. But if you meet someone you like and they genuinely like you it’s real and that can last a long time. 

And that’s another thing I didn’t understand at first. Friendships take time to build if they’re going to last. I would look around and see everyone else making friends easily. But I think a lot of these friendships aren’t very strong, people are just being social really. I think to become really close friends it take time to get to know each other, build up trust, to spend good times together and be there through the bad. This doesn’t happen overnight, or weeks or months. I think this takes years. 

So I’ve decided to just try being myself. Try being a bit more social without worrying about it. To try appreciate the time I spend on my own, do things I enjoy. Not going around looking for friends but just trying to get to know the people I meet a little more, you never know we might have a bit more in common than we first realise! But if we don’t it doesn’t mind, there’s no rush to make that true friend."

lonely,You are not alone.. there are so many people who’s lives you’ll touch. This is what I believe...,"You are not alone.. there are so many people who’s lives you’ll touch. This is what I believe... - My name is Vara, I’m currently in a relationship. I’m only in high school, and my past relationships has lead me to where I am today. My explanation...
I believe... 
Out of forgiveness, trust, and commitment, I believe that in a relationship, forgiveness is the first and most important key to a successful strong and healthy relationship. I believe that in order to have a strong and successful relationship, in order to trust your partner, and feel committed, you need to forgive them. As us humans, we all make mistakes. Whether making a mistake on accident or on purpose, you always want to forgive. How can we forgive others if we don’t forgive ourselves?        
         Showing your partner that you’re committed in the relationship, you must show forgiveness. If you’re committed to your relationship, you should show your partner that you care about the relationship, you want to make it work. So you decide to forgive your partner. Having the ability to forgive your partner shows that you’re committed to trust them. 
          From my experience from being in the relationship I’m in now, I’ve learned and I believe that forgiveness is what keeps a relationship going. I’ve forgiven Ben multiple times. But I’ve also forgiven myself as well. 
          Yes, some people don’t change after making a mistake. But there are people in this world who do change. People who realize what they do is wrong, people that want to make a difference, or prove that they care about the relationship. They don’t just automatically change. I take the time and courage to give others the chance to see what they’ve done wrong. The choices us humans decide to make defunds us as human beings. But the actions we make proves whether we care about the choices we decide to make. 
         Me and my boyfriend argue about the littlest things in life. Because we believe that the littlest things matter the most. We’ve come  close to ending it. But we never gave up. No matter how badly things may go. We care about each other. We know we make mistakes. But in the end, we both know that in the future, we will grow even stronger and learn from our mistakes. I believe that Forgiveness is the key to a healthy, strong, and committed, and successful relationship.❤️"

lonely,A lonely heart- advice?,"A lonely heart- advice? - I feel ugly, unwanted, and I don't know what to do. When I was a teenager, I fell in love hard with the wrong person, and it crushed my confidence. I was never with this person because he name called me and bullied me. I am not a masochist. It was tough to cut him out of my life, but I knew I had to do it. It was harder, though because I had to see him every day, especially with other girls. If I didn't have feelings for him, maybe I wouldn't be heartbroken. It's been haunting me through my adulthood no matter how crazy it sounds. 

I am 27, a virgin, and I don't know how to flirt. I have never been on a date or in a relationship. I had a chance to lose my virginity at 17, but I didn't feel ready, and I didn't want to have sex because of peer pressure. However, after that, I never had the opportunity again, since I moved to a different country, and it's a socially disabled society. It is a lonely place and so challenging to make new friends even at work or school because everyone is stuck in a routine. A family member has mentally and emotionally abused me during my teenage years, and it took a toll on my mental health.

Recently, I went back to college, and I am trying to work on a business idea to get out of this vicious cycle. I am doing better, but I feel lonely and unattractive. I've never been the beauty or popular, and I've come to terms that I am not noticeable. I could try to get on a dating app and have a hook up to lose my virginity. Still, I don't want that for myself. Maybe it sounds silly that I am a romantic and I want someone to love me and want me. I don't want crumbs of intimacy. Yet I don't know how to cope with the loneliness anymore. 

I was wondering if someone else feels the same way and ask for a bit of advice on how to deal with this. Thank you in advance for your reply."

lonely,"Am I supposed to go on with my life and wait for ""love"" to happen?","Am I supposed to go on with my life and wait for ""love"" to happen? - Hey guys. I'm 23 M. I live alone in a small apartment. I have a part-time freelance job so I work from home. Once in a while I go out alone to the mall, to art galleries, a pub/restaurant or I just walk aimlessly alone.  Once every few months I do some light travelling. I am an introvert so I don't mind it that much, but lately it's been weighing on my mind heavy.  


I don't know how to meet people. Especially women. My self esteem isn't great. I'm not too talkative. I'm short. I encounter hundreds of people daily, when I go out. I see cute girls, for example this cashier at a store nearby. But I can't bring myself to talk to them. I don't want to ""bother"" them. I don't want to be a creep. Even when I travel and I know that I'm going to be out of that place very soon, and I'm abroad so I shouldn't care at all if I fail, **I JUST CAN'T.**   


I know nothing would happen. I don't have any issues talking to random people for any other reason but trying to date. Like, I can ask someone for time, or to give me directions, or to help me pick a thing at a store. But a cute girl that I'd want to get to know? NO WAY. I freeze. And honestly, I feel like I'm going to be forever alone. On the internet people say things like ""you should just go on with your life and it will happen out of nowhere"". But I'm not so sure about it all. Hasn't happened even once for me. No one talks to me out of random. 

Ugh, sorry, just had to get it out of my mind. I'm at a hotel in a different city and I'm just feeling so lonely."

lonely,Anyone happy with being lonely?,"Anyone happy with being lonely? - Sorry if this is inappropriate, I was searching for a sub with people enjoying loneliness talking about their hobbies or what they like to do during their free times without engaging too much in social activities but I stumbled upon this sub full of people extremely sad and depressed and I feel that... 

I've been a loner for a pretty long time now that I'm 22 years old, I have aspergers and relationships always were a daunting task for me. I mean talking with people correctly, understanding allusions and non verbal signals, and despite all my efforts people around me just seemed to fade away. Every friend that I had were a pain in the ass, I couldn't handle the unnecessary drama over trivial things and I cannot understand how people can initiate fights over the slightest things. 

At one point in my life I decided that I had enough and I could just do what I do best: being lonely. It's been a good ride, but I want to say that I'm not totally alone, I'm still in good terms with my parents and my older sister but I rarely interact with them since I'm in another country. I also have one friend I made playing overwatch and I also rarely talk to him, but he knows how weird I am and he accepts it. It's fine to know that you can have people you can count on when you really need to and vice versa, they can count on me. But other than these people I'm alone and I like it. No interaction with people in university or at the gym or whatever, I just live my life  

I can do whatever I want, eat what I want, spend money how I want, work when I want, when I succeed it's because I worked, when I failed it's because I didn't. I can shop for the clothes I really want to wear, I can be very cordial and normal when I need to talk to someone briefly but it never goes deeper than small talks. 

I like the silence, I like being able to walk alone in the park with music, or listening to the leaves crunching under my feet. I like the nights where I can just put a series on Netflix and watch it in one go. I like cooking myself a nice dinner and enjoying it peacefully under the lights of my led strip. I like being invisible around people and being a silent observer of things going on. I like not having to deal with relationships except the rare ones that I find cool. Only thing I really miss is my dog, I couldn't bring my baby boy with me when I moved out. 

I had a period in my life when I really suffered from loneliness like you guys. Seeing people fading away, no one giving a shit about your problems and just boasting about themselves, just being here in the moment and no one around noticing you. It's horrific. I found my way out and my inner peace, but if you are still suffering please seek help, professionnal if possible. If you're feeling lonely, reply to this post, I'll be happy to exchange some words with Internet strangers. Loners have a bond few people can understand."

lonely,Complicated Mess...,"Complicated Mess... - At this point I don't know who I am, I have the wisdom and experience to carry me through this life but I find no reason too. I often find myself contemplating suicide due to how people treat me and how empty I feel. Imagine being able to see how things end and trying to warn people, you could save so many people from themselves. The thing is though, people believe they are right, that they can't be wrong. So when you try to help it tends to make people ignore you and even judge you, harshley. 

The logical thing to do is to just follow them and try to subconsciously help them and guide them the best you can, but in doing so you might lose a piece of yourself. Which might be what i've done... I can't recall anything that I truly love or like to do, and the things I THINK make me happy only cause me pain now. So, you try to get help from the people you ""follow"" to gain their ignorant stance on a subject you already know the ending too. It's a never ending cycle or pain and suffering that you should know how to prevent. 

People might say to leave these people behind to listen to yourself, but the best choices are never the easiest. So, I do what is responsible and try to do my best. Not just for myself but for the world we must build. I am aware there's people who are unchangeable, but the most inspiring stories are the ones that are the most seemingly impossible. Life is more complicated than you could ever conceive and this is even more so with people.

And it is because of this complication that I feel compelled to write any of this. Due to reasons that I can't really explain I will always try to help another, even if they are horrid. The question I ask is how long should I keep trying? How long should I try to make you all hear? How long can I bear a world that doesn't want me?

Idk honestly, all I can do is hope that someone will hear. But even more so, understand..."
lonely,"19 yo girl, empty house for the weekend, just now realizing how lonely I am","19 yo girl, empty house for the weekend, just now realizing how lonely I am - usually im home alone because my mum works shifts in an hospital, i spend the day watching Netflix (friends/himym/the ranch/gg/that 70s show) and snacking here and there.
i take a class of sort of “minor accounting” for a year and its only like 8 hours a week(2 days)
i stopped working 3 months ago and will start working again in May hopefully (ill be qualified to work in accounting related job)

thats just a short background to my life

friends? well where i live, people my age usually are in the military. i didnt want to serve in the army (my friends wanted to but now not really but its too late, im kinda lucky in that area).
ANYWAYS i have like 2/3 “close”friends (we go years back)
but they made new friends in the army like really good friends and im so lonely in my everyday life.


now before you’re saying they’re in the military and have much more important things on their mind let me assure you they do not. 
they’re not doing anything really important most day they’re on ig posting stories and selfies like 24/7 (i have been off social media for a while now so thank god i don’t see it anymore)

the point tho, my mums spending the weekend at her friends bc her friends dad passed away,
so i invited my 2 friends over and they were like
 “yeah cool” it was late at night so i told them we’ll discuss who brings what tomorrow.
next day i texted each of them what to buy 
friend 1- get booze (like 20$)
friend 2- get snacks (15$ top)
and im getting sodas, hookah, weed, and whatever
friend 2 replied immediately: idk if i can make it
me: ok when will you know?
friend 2: look, i just came back from (army friend)’s birthday and idk its not really worth it for me to come over considering im the only one who pays for taxi (me and friend 2 are neighbors)
i didn’t reply.

friend 1 later that day: hey listen I don’t think I’ll come, first off i don’t have any money
 (note: she always says it and i always end up paying for her bc she “forgot” her cc or makes planes to go out with me then i get ready and she cancels last min bc she “just realized” she doesn’t have money so i end up paying for her)
second thing is ive got stuff at home to deal with and im like so tired so 

i could tell friend 2 was waiting for me to offer to buy the booze and beg her to come since she’s used to it but i just said “that’s cool friend 1 isn’t coming either so whatever,”

these are my only 2 friends basically.
i feel so pathetic when my dad called to check up on me i lied that they were still coming over.

What do you guys think? What should I do today and in general?"

lonely,Overcoming loneliness,Overcoming loneliness - I was very lonely and thought that I would just end up being alone and probably never remembered by anyone. Now thanks to you lovely people I feel like I can overcome this loneliness. I've recently gotten closer to one of my friends and once I've told him about what I'm going through he decided to come over and stay at my place to atleast make sure that I have someone to talk to.  My advice to people who are lonely find that one friend who will always be there for you.

lonely,Annoying people by talking about my interests,"Annoying people by talking about my interests - So i've recently been reflecting on my history with friendships and the like, and i've come to realise that I haven't had a friend that's properly shared my interests in over 15 years. And i'm only 22.  
A lot of my interests, barring the ones everyone has, like doggos, memes, and food go unshared by the three people who are my friends, and I always feel like when i'm talking about them i'm being annoying, like my interests in quiet nights in, the night sky and constellations, finding that one perfect spot to view the sky from, writing music, computer nerd stuff, swimming, sport, driving... I could go on but you get the point. 

The best example of how isolating it can feel happened the other night while I was out camping with a few friends, my idea of camping was a lovely quiet night away from it all, enjoying the crackling fire, watching the stars, that kind of thing, and their idea was loud music, drinking, and dancing, I tried to fit in, play some of my music, 2 songs in, they change it to theirs because they don't know mine, and don't like it. And that made me realise how often that happens with my music and others. I play it, noone knows it, they put on something else I alone don't know. I try to learn it to be a part but they don't put that same effort in it feels. And now I feel i've made friends with the wrong people.  


If anyone has similar interests, or wants someone to talk to, please please please feel free to message me, i'd love to have a chat about those kinds of nothings. Or even if it's just to feel a little less alone, my inbox is always open."
lonely,Lonely Teardrop,"Lonely Teardrop - You're on your couch with a good drink and a snack, lost in an episode of whatever it is you're binge-watching, and suddenly a single tear rolls down your cheek. You aren't sad at all so it catches you by surprise. It shocks you out of the world of TV and back to real life, where you remember that you're a miserable loner.

And while I stepped off the bus, it speed up and some people holding me to not let my face hit the ground, it was my ass instead. Thanks to em.  Hurt a bit but not hurt anymore rn. Fuck this.
