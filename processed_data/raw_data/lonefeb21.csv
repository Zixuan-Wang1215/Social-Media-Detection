lonely,attached to the thought of who you were.,"attached to the thought of who you were. - you used to be so lovely. now i look at you in disgust. you’ve stolen my lover’s ambition, their wit, their spark. how ugly they’ve become, so barren."
lonely,Out of Place,"Out of Place - It seems to be that no matter where I go, who I am with, or what’s going on around me I cannot seem to feel anything but out of place. I think some of this really stems from the fact that, from my view, I have such a hard time connecting with people. But I quite honestly don’t understand why. Is there something I’m missing? Something others can see about myself that I can’t? I feel, act, and look just like any other person. I know how to communicate and honestly do very well. I just feel like I’m always left out in a sense. I don’t know. It’s just really easy to feel like when you don’t seem to have anyone who really cares. 

May whoever reads this be more at peace with themselves than I am. All love."

lonely,Is it actually gonna be ok?,Is it actually gonna be ok? - I (22M) have been feeling lonely for the past 2 and a half years...what’s the longest you’ve gone feeling lonely!? I do have friends that I speak to daily. Don’t meet them that often because of covid. So I still feel lonely. I would like to have a significant other but i have trouble finding one. I’m not bad looking or anything but luck is definitely not on my side...I keep reminding myself that it won’t or can’t rain forever...that I will be okay one day but when? I also can’t sleep at night. For the past 2 and half years have barely had any good night of sleep which makes it 1000 times worse. Cause if you have a bad day or feel lonely your salvation might be sleeping but I can’t even do that. Trying to sleep is literally the hardest thing in the world for me right now. I’m studying at university so I live alone in a small apartment and I feel anxious 2-3 hours before sleeping cause I just know I won’t be able to get a good night of sleep. I try to not think about it but it turns out that I’m right about not going to get a good sleep EVERY. FUCKIN. NIGHT. What should I do? Pls don’t tell I’m alone in this...someone else feeling THIS lonely and sleeping THIS bad?
lonely,Being habitually lonely has left me with a hard heart.,"Being habitually lonely has left me with a hard heart. - Blah blah COVID, blah blah unprecedented effects, blah blah safer at home. 

Even before COVID, i had one friend i actually spent time with. Now she is pregnant and apparently a huge hypochondriac, because I haven’t seen her throughout her entire pregnancy. 

I. have. No. Friends. 

Facebook people are posting pictures of their nights out, spending time with friends, and all i can think about his how disappointed i am to not be invited, yet again. I find myself hoping they have a terrible night out, and then feeling guilty for acting like an asshole. 

I’ve tried to get involved and meet people, via church, meeting the parents of my kids’ friends, volunteering, I even put out a “hey, let’s get coffee!” R4R recently and.. nothing. my efforts have been fruitless. For a long-ass time. Every couple years I get this wild idea that I’m going to try again and meet new people, but it doesn’t work. 

I just want to connect. Why is that so hard? Am i brain damaged? Do i have a “hi I’m a giant asshole” sign stuck in my teeth? 
Currently lying in bed sobbing. I feel like such an idiot for even caring, but here I am. This empty life is just not worth the trouble."
lonely,"I’m done with myself, and the only reason why I don’t do something dumb is my mom","I’m done with myself, and the only reason why I don’t do something dumb is my mom - She wants me to be happy, and sometimes I do am happy, she’s the only person who I truly admire because she cares so much for other people and most of the times people are mean to her, and I hate that, but I can see myself being nice to people that treat me like shit, my 2 sisters treat me like shit, my “friends” treat me like shit, my co worker’s treat me like shit, and I don’t care anymore, I’m just breathing literally because I couldn’t do something stupid, I don’t wanna make my mom cry, but it’s so fucking painful living like this, why people are so mean?

lonely,Work environment leaves me friendless,"Work environment leaves me friendless - Since high school, all of my friends have been related to my area of work - a high pressure environment. I'm pulling away from that field, and am realizing just how tied my social life was to work.

I've long realized this dynamic was exhausting because even casual conversation felt transactional and tense. Now I have that in the fee relationships left and lovely otherwise"

lonely,Finding friends with age.,"Finding friends with age. - Does anyone feel as though with an increase in age, the difficulty to find friends who truly mean something decreases? I personally have found my significant other but I find it impossible to find a best friend especially with Covid going on. Once high-school finished, I find it ridiculously hard to find people with the same interests or hobbies, as other views or opinions can get in the way. Anyone else have a hard time finding people they vibe with or can become close with?"

Where I moved to there are a ton of shit ppl and no like real ppl who are good people. My friends from my old place don’t seem to want to be near me anymore, and no one seems to notice me anymore. I get no attention but I do nothing to get attention because there is no point if they won’t give it to me anyway. The only person I thought I could rely on doesn’t respond and it’s hard to rule out suicide. Help"
lonely,Feeling bad,"Feeling bad - I started antidepressants a couple months ago and they’re working. Everything is way better! Except now I have the energy and desire to go out and talk to people etc. but I have no friends:/

I get along with coworkers and others but don’t feel comfortable asking anyone to hang out with me and also can’t go out alone because it makes me too anxious. 

I literally just drove to a bar and sat in the parking lot willing myself to just go in and order a drink but I left and cried the way home. This is not even the first time I’ve done that.

I’m just feeling lonely and like a loser right now and wanted to get this off my chest."

lonely,Do you wonder if you'll ever have a true friend?,"Do you wonder if you'll ever have a true friend? - I get lonelier and sad thinking about how it's all been. I've always tried my best with others and just ended up hurting myself and caring too much. It's all or nothing because of my immense trust issues with others, but whenever I do try I mean it.

I've always ended up alone, like most on this sub, and we all know that kinda hurt. I will always hope though, I always do. I wish I had someone I could connect with, trust, feel safe with, have comfort with, and be happy.
I always cry whenever I think of someone choosing me."

lonely,"I lost the only person that cared about me, and it's my fault","I lost the only person that cared about me, and it's my fault - So basically i'm a jobless guy almost 30, with no friends and an abusive family. I met this girl that was so positive with me, that cared about me and build a bond with me. I was happy to have her as a friend because i'm probably asexual, so i didn't have a crush or something. But i still managed to fucked this up. I betrayed her trust and now our friendship it's gone. Now i have people with whom i talk online, but they don't care about me. Basically i lost a friend that would take a 2 hours train trip to see me, a friend that would ask me about my family, a friend that would remember all my job interwievs and that would make me feel i belong somewhere, just for my fault. Instead of worship her and treat her like an angel (if a have no friends it means something), i just treat her like shit. I apologize but it's not enough. Im judged by everyone because of my appereance, whilst she liked me even with my facial flaws. And she's so pretty, and a muscian too. I had got a girl, musician, scientist, kind and funny friend and i fucked up because of my insecurities, i dont deserve to live."
lonely,[14f] Have you guys ever wondered...,"[14f] Have you guys ever wondered... - What's the point in life if you're just gon' die? Why do we have to be different? Why can't people just get along? What's the purpose of this life? Why can't everyone just be kind? Why are people so rude to others weaker than them? Why can't we all just be happy and live life to the fullest?

These questions always run through my mind. I realize how much my life sucks. But the one thing I always remind myself of is that each day is a new day to fix everything. A new day to let loose and be free. A new day to enjoy life to the fullest.

I want all those mean people to do one kind thing a day. That's what I want y'all to do. Be kind, life is short. Do the things people say you can't do. Just be that one person in that crowd to show 'em how to be kind. 'Cause kindness is the best thing you can give anyone.

Sometimes I ask myself why the hell am I here? That answer is to make a difference. My past is really crappy. Been beat up and hurt, but each time I fell I stood back up again.

To all those people who have read this, God bless your souls. I wish you the best of the best. Please feel free to dm me, I'm always here to listen."
lonely,how can I forget something,"how can I forget something - I feel so dumb for this but a couple years ago I grew apart from a really close friend. I didn't really know at the time why she was mad at me and I tried so hard to grow closer to her and try to figure out what I did wrong. I never knew until a year later when another person told me, turns out it was because I was friends with someone she never liked.

I know it sounds stupid but I can't seem to get over it. I still feel like shit about it and I can't get over this. this situation just made me doubt about myself and wondering if I was ever a good friend. This situation was another source of doubt and anxiety and for a while I kept on stressing over what I did wrong. I thought she was gonna be one of those friends that I would continue to talk to in my future. We had such great times together which just made it harder to lose her. My friends and family are annoyed that im still hung up over it but it just doesn't leave. I forget about it sometimes but it always comes back whenever I doubt myself. I just feel like this is gonna happen again.

does anyone have any tips of how to get over this?"

lonely,Got my hair done and applied for a promotion at work...and no one to tell.,"Got my hair done and applied for a promotion at work...and no one to tell. - My (42F) parents are dead, I'm a single mom who is really proud of everything I've accomplished, raising 2 kids alone without a penny of assistance (my ex hubby found meth in PA). I JUST applied for a promotion that I have a great chance of getting, and I just got my hair done at LEAST 8 different colors thanks to my awesome stylist...and I have no one to even share these things with. And I look FABULOUS. But no one cares. 

If I get the promo...its my path to 6 figures. No student loan debt but 14 years of MY hard work and dedication to my career have put me in a great spot. I just have no one to share any of this with. I really miss having someone being proud of me. I miss you Mom. You would have been my biggest cheerleader. :( Its so hard to do these things without you."

lonely,I’m not good,"I’m not good - So apparently I keep ruining friendships. I’m definitely not a people’s person. 😞

lonely,Relationships nearly Impossible and it's killing me.,"Relationships nearly Impossible and it's killing me. - Sometimes I feel like no matter how hard I try to find one I get slapped in the face not literally. I started to hug my pillow at night in Highschool after I realized I couldn't find anyone who wants to be with me. I am 23 now and just as lonely.

Especially during covid I have seen my mental state drive through the wall. I realized that I do have friends but I could be alone forever and that scares me. I don't know if I can go my entire without feeling loved by a woman.  The job I have now is very high paying but I realized money doesn't make me happy. 

My one true dream in life is to find that someone and I really hope I can."
lonely,Not Alone?,"Not Alone? - Im always somewhat confused when people tell me they understand or im not alone. I feel so alone, i feel so misunderstood. I feel so misunderstood that it feels almost as though people are actively trying to misunderstand. 

I feel so alone and maybe that’s from the lack of understanding. I have a couple people but no one where i don’t have to explain chapters and chapters or context for them to get what the hell im even talking about. 

Im at a point where I’m exhausted to even tell my story because no one cares, i’m different, no one gets me. 

I just want to sleep forever.

lonely,Home on a saturday,"Home on a saturday - Anyone else feel like a fucking loser cause they’re home on a Saturday night just like every other Saturday night? No friends, no girlfriend, no plans, always being home on a Saturday night, just goes to show me how fucking boring me and my life is"
lonely,Loneliness sucks,"Loneliness sucks - You ever have that feeling of feeling alone, but you’re not? It’s strange. I’m surrounded by family and little friends but the loneliness won’t go away. I constantly use drugs to numb the feeling but it’s only temporary. My hurt runs deep (past trauma), years prior. I met this one really cool person. She gets me because she’s in the same place I am. She takes it away more than any drug or therapy could. It’s weird.
I don’t have much friends because I overthink all the time. I’m a mess."
lonely,I’m too proud to admit I want a relationship,"I’m too proud to admit I want a relationship - I’m a “bad bitch” on the outside and pretty out there regarding my sexuality. I’m all for having a hoe phase in your life and I’m still planning on doing that. But it’s just a big facade, I hate being a softie but that’s what I am unfortunately. 

Sometimes I just want to held and cuddled. I’ve never been cuddled. The last time might’ve been my mom when I was 8 years old when we were napping. I’ve never gotten hugs from my family until I was 17 and moved to a dorm for university, and even then it’s less than a second and it’s an awkward space between the bodies with a quick one, two, pat on the back. My mom never even took hugging seriously since she would just jokingly grab my boobs. I hate it, and I think she hated hugs too so she did anything to get out of it. I stopped hugging my mom when I think I was around 11 cause of this.

I think this has made me hate most people’s touches since I’m not used to it. I think about physical affection and I automatically get so sad I cry, idk what this reaction is, but I think it’s my body catching up to the lack of affection all these years. All I want is to know I’m cared for...

It terrifies me to want a relationship since I’m used to being abandoned a lot...sometimes I just want to pay someone to cuddle me just so I know for sure they won’t leave."
lonely,What to do when you know nothing but loneliness?,"What to do when you know nothing but loneliness? - My sister has parties almost every month... every twos weeks? All my family members are extroverted but also I’ve become so comfortable in my solitude because they misunderstand me all the time.. and we go against each other morals... 

Lonely for so long.. I’ve come to terms with it... I’m not sure what to do but suffer.. what can you do?"
lonely,Learning to live without having someone there.,"Learning to live without having someone there. - It’s been four months since my ex ended things with me. Four long months. I’ve been getting used to the fact that the love that was once there is gone and moving on to look towards the future. 

But I’ve felt extremely lonely. It’s a feeling I just can’t shake off. Yes, I have family. Yes, I have friends and coworkers I can reach out to. It’s the feeling that no one really understands me that makes me feel so lonely. For work, I’m a firefighter and it’s been hard to decompress with the calls that I’ve been going to. When my ex was around, I could really tell her how I was feeling and what I saw on the call. Now that she’s gone, it’s been hard to talk about. I can’t talk to the guys at the station (because we’re supposed to be big strong firemen), my friends can’t stomach the stories, and my parents are too busy to listen. I had a therapist but I ran out of sessions on insurance. 

Yes, I’m not a loner because I have friends and family who care. But the loneliness I’m feeling is within my own head because no one gets it. It’s hard. I’m sure I’ll be okay but I feel like the walls are closing in."
lonely,"Feel very lonely, feeling not human","Feel very lonely, feeling not human - Sometimes when I cannot sleep I listen to movie ads on itunes store. I saw one a few days ago where the main character was saying, he couldn’t complain about not finding a person he wanted to be with, because if he were blind or disabled, he wouldn’t be able to find a partner at all. This made me realize, I will probably always be alone. I am legally blind and have Autism, and (sorry, tmi) also have a genital deformity. I always knew I would be alone, but I suppose I just never really felt it until now. I am very lucky, my classmates and teachers are very kind to me, but I know they cannot regard me as a potential close friend or partner or colleague. I do not even feel exactly human myself, I cannot relate to most human life experiences. So I cannot ask for human intimacy. Usually I do not mind being alone, my field requires a lot of solitary work. But sometimes I feel so lonely it is almost like a sleep-deprived feeling, and I feel like i am going insane. I could never ask anyone for a partner-like relationship, I would be too ashamed. But I sometimes wish I had someone I felt safe around, who i could just go sit nearby when I felt lonely."

lonely,What do the lonely eat?,"What do the lonely eat? - This sounds dumb but I’m serious. 

Today, I had a ton of pancakes, solo road food, now homemade cookies and later a steak and potatoes. All on my beautiful couch, by myself, in a house where even with the tab and music on it is still so quiet, and the quiet is louder than packed bar at midnight. A bar where all your friends are gone, your ride is gone and you’re just killing time as you dissolve into nothing in the frothy fun splashing of everyone else, until your friends find you and the bizarre solo float in the sea of people is over. It’s not over for us, and it’s midnight at this shitty bar, and we gotta order something.

I don’t have appetizers, try a bite of friend’s food, share a plate of something made for two, or feel compelled to eat what normal people eat. 

I’m alone on the road through this wasteland, and today I ate pancakes, chocolate chip cookies and steak.

lonely,ironic.,"ironic. - i think i’ve grown to a certain level of maturity and understanding that the one person i’ve ever loved would in fact not be my end-all be-all. perhaps in response i’ve grown a resentment for intimacy? perhaps that fear of intimacy might only be coddled by them? i don’t know. a boyfriend after them with plenty of intimacy and i’d only felt my lowest. what do i feel? nothing? or understanding? nonetheless, today was lovely. i liked the water quite a lot."

I see people my age with their girlfriends and boyfriends and I cant help but seethe with jealousy, I hate being like this but its become a part of me I cant seem to shake, I talk to people occasionally but nothing seems to fill the void. I've essentially started to hate myself because I don't have what others do.  (sorry for my shitty structuring)"
lonely,"Never had a single friend, is it normal?","Never had a single friend, is it normal? - Is it normal to have never had a single friend in your life? I'm 23 (m) and never had anyone to talk to all the way from pre-school to college.

I never went out with anyone, had anyone show up for my birthday party, attended a concert, played with other kids at school etc. 

When it comes to dating that's like a whole different world to me, i never got a hug from anyone even.

Everytime i see these things on television i get a weird feeling of being a spectator and not able to relate to people. I'm still in college and talk to literally no one, not even online. (Classes are 100% online anyways)

Usually people say they have no friends but then they say they have just 4 or 5, so i cant relate to most subs for friendless or lonely people either

It's not all terrible but sometimes it's pretty odd being so different."

I don't have any issue starting a conversation and was curious if someone could tell me how to form a long lasting relationship (dating).

I woke up around 530 am to find her at the bottom of our running shower. Overdose. Fast forward to today, the only friend I have lives an hour and a half away. All I can think about is how awful and painful life is, and it's new(er), I never used to feel like this ever. I was positive. Always had friends, etc. Last year I let drinks and (prescribed) benzos get the best of me. It feels like despite my reaching out no one cares, I can't get the interaction with others I used to just take for granted. I haven't seen my son since his birthday in July 2019 when he turned Six. His Mom is a literal piece of shit, but I am calm, kind, and respectful when it comes to our son. She's either playing games because she feels like shit or ignoring me because hey, at least she has her kid. I miss my fiance Madison so much, my Dad says 'it's time to move on; new girls don't want to hear about her'. And while I know that, I can't. She was the best thing I'd ever had in my life. She'd text pics of the floors for example after cleaning or something hot while I'd be at work and just wanted to be around me as badly as I loved being around her. We were best friends I can't find or see meaning in life anymore and just sleep because it turns shit off or work because it's a distraction. The few times I'm in happy moods or feel social no one wants shit to do with me; and that feels like a new phenomena. I just don't know what to do and I'm sick of crying and miss my son and my fiance. Starting something new doesn't feel like a possibility anymore."

COVID-19 made us all hermits, while some were already. We can now justify it and pacify staying in our dimly lit homes with the curtains covering whether it’s day or night, letting the Postmates person know to leave it in the chair, on the porch, as we endorse the notes and hang them to the front door. Fresh air adorns the musty hall, something not all too normal. I sit surrounded by big dogs on my bed,  eating cookies, and watching what Fauci said on the news. Fighting the blues, was a process.

lonely,I need to stop kidding myself,"I need to stop kidding myself - He doesn’t care about me. He sure tricked me into thinking he did with how he treated me at first. It was honestly the most affection I’ve ever received and also the most abuse. I’m so torn. I want to hate him so much but I can’t because I keep seeing all the good in him. There is so much good and I keep hearing ‘I’ll always pursue you. I’ve never loved anyone like I’ve loved you.’ Over and over and over like a skipping record that I just want to shatter.

But he hasn’t put in any effort to regain contact. He hasn’t gone to treatment, he hasn’t gone to therapy, he hasn’t done shit. That’s more proof that he doesn’t care. If he did he’d get his ass up and go do what he’s supposed to so he can talk to me again. But he doesn’t have the willpower or urge to because in reality I’m not worth it to him.

Even without talking to him he makes me feel like shit. I hate myself for missing him and I hate myself for not being enough. I never feel like I’m enough."

This guy I fell in love w like never before. We were on again off again etc but he’d never actually commit to me. We’ve been trying to make a friendship work and now it’s officially over. I was just at his all night fighting and arguing with him and i just had to get in my car and leave. 
Haven’t slept since yesterday at this point. I’m fucked. I feel really alone in this emotion. I don’t have anyone I can turn too. 
And yes I’m seeing a psyc. 
He’s the only man who’s truly cared for me. Would take a bullet for me. Was loving, funny and care for me so deeply. 
I felt like he was my person. We kept trying to have some sort of relationship(friendship in the end) bc we both agreed we loved and cared for each-other. Different love obviously.....

Can someone tell me whos in the wrong in my situation ?

After we met on tinder we felt this immense connection, I would then stay at his laughing til 4am, fucking and cuddling for weeks on end. We were obsessed with eachother. I basically moved in. Then come a month later he says to me “look I just don’t feel that way about you. I think you’re amazing but I don’t have that romantic feelings for you” I was like wtf... okay. So we stopped seeing eachother for a couple weeks and then basically that would start again and the cycle would continue. [I must point out that in no way did he ever say I was his girlfriend or make anything official]
A couple weeks later I met his mum. Which was really special to me. 
He then said he shouldn’t of done that because he still doesn’t have feelings for me.... I really loved her. She was wonderful.
Months later, We then decided to “just be friends” then there was zero sex. But he still allowed me to cuddle, spoon, talk/phone everyday, kiss (not on the lips) and basically sleep over each night I wanted and fall asleep wrapped in each others arms. 
So me being me, gripped onto that so fucking tight and told myself I wouldn’t get feelings but then he would talk about woman at work and I’d get extremely jealous then I’d try to sleep with him and he didn’t want it at all which then make me try and figure out what is wrong with me. I became obsessed. I am obsessed. I would talk about having his children and marriage etc and he’d just laugh. 
He’d say I’m an amazing woman and he wished he felt more for me because he knew we’d be so incredibly happy but he just doesn’t “feel it” I don’t understand.... I don’t fucking understand any of this. I don’t know what to do with myself"

lonely,It feels like my heart just broke into a million pieces.,"It feels like my heart just broke into a million pieces. - I finally heard from him after over a week of no talking. I was so happy, for the first time in ages. Only for him to just turn around and use past tense on our friendship and say he won’t talk to me anymore. Obviously he said it in a nicer way than that but that was the gist. 

I am hopelessly, irrationally in love with him. Not just as a relationship, but as someone who was the best friend I could ask for. Now he’s gone, just like that. Any messages from him made my heart flutter and I could finally feel a positive emotion for once. It’s all fucking gone just like that. 

I dreamed of him last night. We were sat together and it was calming. He felt soft and warm to the touch, so much so it felt real. I pleaded to anyone that would listen in my mind for him to just text me again. I got my wish, but in such a warped way I would’ve just preferred if he’d left me the fuck alone. 

Now I feel absolutely nothing. I’m alone. Crushed. Heartbroken over a relationship that didn’t even happen. It was one sided anyway, he admitted to leading me on when I confessed. All I want to do is just fall asleep and never wake up. How I’ll be able to survive going to college in a fortnight without his support I don’t know. I just want to fucking die. My friend, my only fucking friend, gone in an instant. 

Maybe I really am destined to die alone. My new antidepressants leave me feeling numb and nothing these days, but now at least I can sob again. At least I can feel something now, even if it crushes my soul and makes me want to throw myself into oncoming traffic."

I just don’t understand sometimes because I love so much and I know I have a good heart and I know I’m a good person. But it’s also my fatal flaw. I love so much that I ALWAYS get hurt. I try and guard myself and my heart, but it never works. I see guys praise the ground my friends walk on and then I can’t even get a guy to have a conversation with me. So while all my friends are out with their girlfriends or boyfriends, I sit at home alone wondering what the point to my existence is anyway. I just don’t wanna hurt anymore. I’m so happy for my friends. They all deserve the best and I hate how jealous I get when I’m around them. It fills me up so much sometimes that I just have to leave and that’s not fair to them. I just wish that I wasn’t here anymore."

lonely,I hate it. I hate it. I hate it so fuckin much.,"I hate it. I hate it. I hate it so fuckin much. - I have been in a relationship during my life. Age of 16. She asked me to go out with her. She was in a much higher league than me.

Not only my first girlfriend, my first friend since i was born. Im not being overdramatic. I play videogames to burn the time untill i go to sleep. I dont have ""the bois"", who most of the gamers have. I play alone. Then i go watch Netflix, alone.

It's not that bad. Well at least it wasnt. Then, iv'e had a girlfriend, or most impotmantly, a friend. Since i did everything alone, i didnt have drama in my life. Suddenly i had someone who wants me to be there for her, listen to her problems and life storie and just take care of her. I liked that.

Then, we broke up. Happans, im not looking fot pitty. It was awhile ago and im over it. Theres just that problem, a big one ive never faced bfore - i know what i'm missing out.

I want to someone wants me to care. The last strow was yesterday.

Tow weeks ago someone i know, maybe i can say she is a friend of mine, had really raugh time. She asked another mutal friend of us to hang out with her and she asked her to bring alcohol. Lest call the friend who had the raugh time Noa and the mutal friend of ours Lilac. Noa and Lilac are close to the age of 17 and im close to the age of 18. Noa has never drank before but Lilac and i have been. I dont get drank easly and Noa knew that. One more thing, Noa has got out of the closet in font of me, not in font of Lilac yet. Noa has asked me to come with them too, so she wont make stupid misatkes like getting out of the closet in font of Lilac or strip down since she has no idea how she reacts to alcohol. I agreed, becuse this is what you do when youve been asked for help. This is how ive beeb raised and i belive in it too.

Yesterday, she got drunk. Not a littlt bit, A LOT drunk. Ive been watchibg her the whole night. When she just fell down and couldnt stand up, ive drew the line. I helped her standing up and baciclly caried her to the bathroom. She has deppreaion. She is not used to be happy. She is not used to not be in control. At least a little bit of control. Noa dont want to cry in public. I knew it. I saw the panic attack comming and ive locked the bathroom door. She got the panic attack the second i closed the door. She started crying and she couldnt control any part of her body. I calmed her down as much as i could, helped her to wash her face, gave her a glass of warm water and forced her to drink it. She couldnt even stay sitting. If i didnt force her not to fall, she would fall. She fell down every five seconds and i grabbed her back to sitting down postion. At some point she felt the vomit comming. She asked me to get out becuse she doesnt want me to see her vomit. Logical. Ive gotten out of the door and waited in font of the door untill i heard her stop vomit.  I got in back and gave her another half glass of warm water. She stopped crying at that point. Lilac have heard what heppend and wanted to come in. I asked Noa if this is ok, she agreed and i let her come in. Lilac has drank much before i started and i never got drunk, so she did know what to do from where we are now. Lilac helped Noa changing her shirt while i was outside (im a guy, i know what respact is). We dragged her to the bed where we have spend 3 hours listening and talking nonsence to let her fall asleep. Noa isnt the kind of people who fall asleep easly. Its been enoth time since her last shot and she was much better.

Now, i relize what Noa has asked me to do. What i agreed to do in theory and what i did practicly. Noa asked me to be there for her. She asked me to listen to her problems. She asked me to take care of her, when she is helpless. I did, all those thing. And now? Now it's over. Now she doesnt asking me to be there for her. Now she doesnt asking me to listen to her problems. Now she doesnt asking me to take care of her. And now, now i feel exactly the same as i felt when my first friend since i was born, disconnected from. Me. Now, ive had once again a taste, just a taste of someone who wants me to care, and when i do - it's over.

Imagine being dumbed by your imaginary girlfriend lol. Oh wait, i dont need to..

Now Noa doesnt want me to care, so it's pointless to care - so I... I dont care anymore.


Edit: to be clear, i dont see Noa as my girlfriend or as a potential romanic relationship. In the 9th peregarph i meant i feel the same way i have felt when i got dumbed by my actual girlfriend."
lonely,Wanting to be invited,"Wanting to be invited - F/17
Throughout 10th-11th grade (current) I've not had any close friends or anyone I even text anymore (like at all). I'm really wanting to be invited to hang out with people and be more social. So here's my question...

There's these 2 girls that go to the same church as me (I started going there because I asked one of them about a year ago). I want to hang out with them and be close friends with them eventually but have no clue where to start? I don't have any classes at school with either one but we see each other on Wednesday's &amp; Sunday's at church. I've seen where people just invite others to do something they organized themselves to start a friendship but I don't have anything I can invite them to like that at all.

How do I get invited to hang out and become closer?

Here’s the thing: Personally, i don’t care a whole lot. I’m not desperate to start making out with people and I don’t really need/want friends right now. Yes, it’d be nice, but I’m doing okay by myself as of this moment. I’m just *embarrassed*. I don’t want to be someone who’s 20 years old and has never X, Y, Z. I don’t like my self-image of this loser who no one likes or wants. I don’t want to *tell* anyone about this status.

lonely,24 M US Going Through a Difficult Time and Looking for a Long-Term Best Friend,"24 M US Going Through a Difficult Time and Looking for a Long-Term Best Friend - Hello all,

It is genuinely lovely to be reaching out to such wonderful people, I hope I can find someone who would like to be my friend. I am a male, 24. I am from the US. I would so love to make friends from all around the world, but particularly in the US or Canada as I can easily visit with you in the near future.

I am very much into music, I love folk rock and other classic rock of the 60’s and 70’s. Also am into straight-up folk, bluegrass, some country, singer-songwriter, and even some 90’s alternative rock. I love bands such as Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, The Eagles, The Beatles, Smashing Pumpkins, The White Stripes, Radiohead, and many more. I collect vinyl, or as I typically refer to them, records. I also collect blu rays and have a somewhat eclectic taste. I like all sorts of films but especially the work of Wes Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Danny Boyle among many others. My favorite film is Lady Bird. I also want to learn guitar and mandolin and get into photography. These interests certainly do not sum me up, I simply just want to get to know people. There is so much hate in the world and in all honesty I just want to share love and hope with some like-minded people that can hopefully stick around as long-term friends. To everyone who is reading, I quite actually need you. I hope we can be friends, I’d truly love to get to know you. I wish you all of the best!

Please let me know if you would like to chat, I will be replying to everyone. Even if it takes awhile. Thank you for your time."
lonely,I met a guy here asking for someone to talk to. I want someone to talk to me today.,"I met a guy here asking for someone to talk to. I want someone to talk to me today. - Last week I came across a post. A guy my age (25) needed someone. So I messaged him and we talked for a little bit. But he’s disappeared now. I guess he’s on his own journey and it’s probably tough for him right now. 

I need someone to talk to. I don’t really have friends. The girl that I care about and love so much doesn’t care about me anymore. I think so. Maybe she’s going through some stuff and I’m being selfish. 

I don’t know what to do. I try to take care of myself n stuff. I go to my therapist for help. My last session was last week Saturday. Sometimes I don’t know if things would get better and sometimes I feel like I don’t matter anymore. 

I try to take inspiration from people like victor frankl and David goggins and Jocko Willink. But still I end up here. 

Sigh. I don’t know what else to do besides cry. I know I probably sound pathetic. But I’m really hurting now."

lonely,I lost everything and everyone this year because of covid.,"I lost everything and everyone this year because of covid. - I am simply not the same person I was before covid. I finished highschool in June and I was really looking forward to university and meeting new people. I was at the best time of my life: I was with my friends, my girlfriend, my dog, my family. I was simply put happy. 
In october I had to move to Germany for university. I left everyone and everything, but I was hoping to meet new people and try and build my life there and ultimately find happiness. It didn't happen. I couldn't meet anyone, I couldn't do anything, and everything started to collapse inside me.
I cried every night thinking about my dog, the good times I had had with my friends, my girlfriend that I was madly in love with and the support of my family that had always been there. On top of that I was not happy with my my studies and I just couldn't take it. The only thing that kept me afloat was the thought of going back home and seeing everyone again. But that only worsened everything.
I felt that the relationship with my friends had changed after everyone had started their new lives; it was not the way it was before and I didn't think about that. It made me feel like it was never going to be like it was in the past. 
But in the end the thing that made me emotionally collapse was finding out that my ex-girlfriend (we ended our relationship after me leaving because we did not want a long distance relationship, but I still loved her more than anything) had a boyfriend. I still have not recovered from it really, it just breaks me every time I think about it.
The only one that made me feel happiness was my little boy, my dog. And knowing that I wouldn't be with him in Germany also broke me. 

Right now I am standing only because of the hopes that everything will eventually be good again, but I geniuenly don't know if it will last.

Covid has really fucked up my life."

lonely,This loneliness is my own doing,"This loneliness is my own doing - I just came to the realization that the reason I'm in this position is because of me. I've had friends and groups to be a part of but I still felt like an outsider. Almost as if I didn't want to get too close to anyone. Even with my own relatives I tended to stay quiet and not contribute to our family gatherings (which we did every sunday afternoon). I have anxiety and ocd which definitely has a factor in my behavior. I had two close knit friends that I hung out with since grade school. But I don't talk to either of them anymore. I lived with one of them and their gf until the stress of the pandemic and our run down house was too much so I told them I had to move out. I paid off my share but he still took it personally, so much so that he decided not to tell me that he got engaged. Seeing all of my peers having children and getting engaged is making me depressed. I had a couple girlfriends in my life but there was only one that I felt truly loved me. We dated for 4 years in college until she broke up with me. It was mutual but at the same time I didn't want to break up with her. I pushed her away because that's who I am. Now she's engaged to someone else so now I sit here with this overwhelming sadness. So here I am now 26m living back home with my parents with no one to talk to. I want to be close to someone and have friends, I want to participate in conversations but my anxiety makes it so hard for me to open up. Even writing this post is a struggle for me. All I want is to improve and be more social but I don't know how.

TLDR: My anxiety makes it hard for me to open up which has cost me friends and a long-term relationship. All in all it's just another brick in the wall."

Cause I have tons of friends, family and I had a girlfriend aswell. But still I felt the pain of being alone and went through severe depression even though I was surrounded by alot of people who actually helped me get through it. 
It’s actually about me and my ex. I met her at embassy few years back. So we began texting. We were actually started as friends. She was with someone else at that time. So after a while I stopped texting her. But 3 years back I was just checking my contact list and I saw her number so I texted her to know how she’s doing. She was going through hard time due to her breakup and all. She told me everything and I thought I should talk to her for a while that’ll ease her pain. So we began texting and calling again. So after a month she said we should give us a chance and I was the happiest man on the planet at that time. But deep down I knew that it won’t go very well due to the long distance. She live like 700 miles away from where I live. But I even thought about moving there. So we started meeting and it lasted like 2 years. Those were the most beautiful days of my life. After September I think her behaviour changed towards us. You know after that 2 years of relationship you feel it. She started saying that you deserve someone better and you should find someone who understands you and I am just a bad person. So it got to the level where we used to argue over this for hours everyday. So on her birthday 14th oct 2020 we had this messy argument which she started out of nowhere in the middle of the night. So I said I need space and I didn’t text or call her for 3 days. But after 3 days she updated her WhatsApp status to “ don’t say it’s nothing when there’s something” but I didn’t give it too much attention. So we resumed calling and I said I want to meet you. But she refused and I asked her the reason so she gave me one. She said that she’s getting in a relationship with her childhood friend who was with her best friend all along and they both had feelings for each other all that time. He broke up with her aswell, I mean her best friend to be with my ex. That absolutely broke me. I was extremely depressed and feeling really lonely even though I was surrounded by all those people. It still hurts alot when I think back. So I have decided to never get in a relationship ever again. I am isolating myself from this mess and I think it’s better that way cause the pain is not worth it."

lonely,lonely weekend - wish there were someone to talk to,"lonely weekend - wish there were someone to talk to - It's another lonely weekend. I've never had any really close friends in life, so I feel lonely quite often. Mostly on the weekends since I work Monday to Friday full time. I honestly don't think it's because people don't like me. I think it's more because people are just too busy and we never form a close bond and they value their other friendships.  I like meaningful conversation about movies, books, tv shows but also like technology (computers and some video games). Ideally, I would find someone to do voice chat (but no video) on a regular basis. And yes, we should probably keep this anonymous (Skype, Textnow, Discord, or some other anonymous voice call app) Just to chat about how our day went and talk about some common interests and provide some positive support and encouragement, but I guess most people aren't into that. But hey, if anyone is interested at all, feel free to send me a private message or reply to this post.

lonely,How much has covid fucked your social life up?,"How much has covid fucked your social life up? - I went through years of pure dog shit before uni, my friday nights consisted of sitting on my arse doing nothing i never had friends and nothing mattered. I go to uni in sept 2019 and everything changed i had a good social circle and met loads of new people and had my first relationship . This time last year i was in a really good place mentally like really good. Everything for once was going right in my life. Covid comes along all my friends drift into seperate groups and im stuck here. I have a small social circle which is shrinking and im not close enough with people to get back into the same social group. Nothing goes right for me im in the same position i worked so hard to fucking escape. Instead of having invitations every friday night for plans i have nothing. Maybe im just destined to be lonely and nothing will ever stop that. Im just too fucking weird and unlikeable"

lonely,I'm just afraid that what am I doing right now is just a distraction to my mistake in the past,"I'm just afraid that what am I doing right now is just a distraction to my mistake in the past - About a year ago, I faced two major choices that could determine my life after college. I was determined to take the first, but not long after that, I changed my decision and took the second one. I actually delighted to have both, but as the wise man said, you can't have a cake and eat them at once.

Fast forward, the choice turns out not to be as satisfying as I thought. And moreover, the universe is giving a signal that I took the wrong path. Now, I am disconnected with my friends that has chosen the first choice (they asked me why did you change), my family and relatives keep telling me that the first choice were better to make living, etc. I felt alone. 

I tried to enjoy things that offered in my situation now. I meet new people, learn new things about the major I take but somehow, as I saw my friends on the other side are having it too (with all the fun they showed), I sometimes wonder, what if I was there? I start to feel like I haven't let myself free from that decision. There is a guilty feeling that holding me back. 

I'm just afraid that I actually meant to be with them.
I'm just afraid that my choice was a mistake.
I'm just afraid that what am I doing now is just a distraction to that mistake, so I don't have to think about it a lot."

I’m stuck in the awkward void of pain. I’ve always been taught to keep my emotions in check , being called a “baby” or “whiny” when I cried when I was younger, so now I can never cry to release my pain. No one sees how hard I try or what I do right, only my mistakes. I’m a loner at school, basically sit by myself at lunch, no girls want to talk to me or go on a date.

lonely,"I'm very bad at making friends, what's worse is I don't know why.","I'm very bad at making friends, what's worse is I don't know why. - I don’t know why but I absolutely suck at making friends, not to mention keeping them.

As a person who never had many friends, I joined several clubs/societies right after entering university in an effort to make more. I’m in my second year and unfortunately, this has not seemed to work so far.

I did meet two of my best friends through joining clubs/societies and they are two of the best people I’ve ever met in my life, but that’s it. Meanwhile, almost everyone else I’ve met consider me as an acquaintance. Every time a club/society event is finished, our contact would cease.

I just don’t understand. Why am I just so bad at making and keeping friends? On the other hand, why is everyone I know so good at it? I’m confident, helpful, and polite. I’m by no means a people pleaser and would never change myself just to please others. I’m not a quiet introvert either. Yet, hardly anyone wants to form long-lasting friendships with me, even if I try to reach out in the first place.

I’m not depressed. I’m just……disappointed in myself. If everyone else has more friends than I do, then it must be my problem which, to this day, I still can’t figure it out myself……"

If only I can confide in one of my friends. Oh what's that? They don't care? Of course they don't. What kind of person cares for a stupid trash of a human being like me. A trash that, time and again, never learn from his mistakes. Actually, I don't know what mistakes that I did to them. I probably did something horrible, but forgotten about it. That makes me a trash and the lowest of the low. No wonder, huh. I kept blaming that one girl for interfering with our group's relationship with me, but that's just me trying to put blame on others...something that needs to stop.

Ever since the time where we stop meeting face-to-face with each other (way before COVID came), everything just became awkward. It feels like I'm being exiled from the group, and that hurts me. I did try to mend it, but it's useless. I suggested an 'after school' activity. But at the end of that day, while they were busy talking with each other on a table, I'm sitting alone on another with my phone, a cold tea, and tears that almost successfully forces its way out from my eyes. Imagine the embarrassment that I would feel if I do cry on public like a little child. Me being very grumpy after that probably doesn't help. Because of that, I haven't try to contact nor they try to contact me ever since. Well, its mostly my fault, I guess."
lonely,"Have I set unrealistic expectations predicting what others’s lives might be, and now nothing I do ever feels enough?","Have I set unrealistic expectations predicting what others’s lives might be, and now nothing I do ever feels enough? - This will sound very self-sabotaging, and it actually is. I am a lonely person, who has a dead social life. Sometimes I go out here and there, I have maybe two friends who are not entirely there, they dont think of me as their “best friend” or someone who they really want in their lives (as far as I’ve seen). I’ve been going out with one person for the past three years and thats my boyfriend which is amazing, but it doesnt cover for my social life. I always wanted to be an independent person, so now I kinda feel like if it wasnt for him, I’d be isolated and never meet people, or go out and make memories cause I’d have no one to do them with. While whenever I do something, at night I think of how other’s lives are like this every day... they get compliments, they go crazy with so many other people, go on car rides, be part of inside jokes, plan on going to trips, meet new people almost EVERY day and they make up for a new experience, they’re active and full of life and this makes me feel like when I enjoy smth, its embarrassing because its nothing special. 

Hell, I’d be too happy just as others are, if I had such a dynamic life, knowing every other day something will happen, someone will talk to me, someone will want to do something with me the next day, I’d have something to show, to tell, to re-call every now and then but my memories are empty. They’re full of people who didnt care about me, who treated me badly (all my friends from the past) and now every day gets worse cuz as I get older I meet less and less people. And I dont have friends to meet their people or any existing options for me to change my life. I feel inexperienced, and like a loser when I compare myself with what people have build off of their lives and how many interactions they’ve had, how many things theyve been part of (parties, festivals, sleepovers, hang outs on rooftops, picnics, drunken nights, car rides, vacation...) and I just feel like screaming on my pillow because I realize I havent lived."

She (21F) sent me a big paragraph explaining that she was too depressed to go to class or talk to anyone for 3 weeks. Apparently, she shut down for weeks and only managed to go to work and barely survive. 

Part of me feels bad for not replying to her but I’m also upset we didn’t talk for weeks. I have MDD, Anxiety, C-PTSD, and Suicidal thoughts. I don’t mean to put her down but I’ve also been very depressed and I get through it by talking to people about it. She gets through it by shutting down and not talking to anyone.

I have therapy once a week and have been trying to keep busy by exercising, focusing on school, and cleaning my place much more than I used to. I also have abandonment issues ever since my mother kicked me out at 16 and abused me. I’ve been a loner ever since I was a child. Being home alone everyday made me independent and I was bullied at school so I never had many friends. 

I always feel like my friends hate me and are going to abandon me. Is 3-weeks abandonment? I don’t have any other social media besides Reddit so our only form of contact is through texting. She also left me on Read according to iMessage so I am sure she opened it. Her apology starts with you know I am a horrible texter... but we used to talk everyday.

The problem is, despite knowing that I have so much work to do, I still feel so lonely. I have college and so many other things to be getting ready for but the future is just looking so bleak. I feel like I’d give literally anything to be able to talk to someone (somewhat frequently) who cares for me and genuinely wants to talk to me. I’ve become isolated from quite a few of some of my former closest friends and I feel its really taken a hit on me. I’m starting to think that there is perhaps something undesirable or bad about me that just causes people to not want to stick around.

I’m also feeling extremely touch-starved and am just really struggling with that. I’m huge on cuddling and being physically affectionate but my sister absolutely hates that kind of stuff. No pets or anything and I haven’t seen my friends in a year so its been really hard. I’ve literally resorted to curling in bed and engulfing myself in a large blanket.

I added the venting flair to this because thats what it is, but any advice on how to cope? There’s no guarantee as to whether or not I’ll be able to have a regular senior year and I need to ensure that I won’t lose myself in this time."

Obviously I do not miss that.
I know if I would have stayed I never would have been happy but I have a little piece inside of me that thinks “well it would be nice to see them”
I texted them multiple times tonight cause I am stupid, and didn’t get replied to. My ex is close with all my family. They hangout with my mom more then I get to. So they have been talking and texting my family all day around me, and I haven’t gotten a reply.
Is it gaslighting when in the past since we have broken up they get mad when I don’t pick up there calls but when I want to talk it’s crickets. 
I recently had a friend tell me that there are actually normal people out there who could give me a healthy relationship, I thought about that for a second and realized I have never had one single healthy relationship in my life.

As I was enjoying myself, I just had the heart wrenching thought of what’s gonna happen in a few days when I pick up the last of my things from my ex’s house...

It’s gonna be the last time I can look him in the eyes, tell him my real feelings face to face. It’s going to be the last time I ever get to hold him. My god it’s going to break me. The vision of hugging him goodbye just dropped my heart into my stomach, and tears erupted so quickly.

Fuck it’s so hard. I need to stay distracted at all times or I just break. I don’t know how I’m going to do this without him. I’m pretty positive he doesn’t want much to do with me either, which hurts equally as bad as the rest of the situation..

It hurts... she chose some other guy over me.. she knew she hurt me because she kept saying sorry, but still wanted to go with him

Why do I mess things up ao badly, even when I try my best to improve and be better.. I always mess it up somewhere down the line

lonely,“friends” creating boundaries,"“friends” creating boundaries - Someone toxic created a boundary

So I have this female friend I’ve been “friends” with . We’ve never met in person and we only have a texting or IG relationship. We vent to each other and text about spirituality and dating and crazy shit we’re going through. Sometimes she’s the one venting and sometimes I’m the one venting. Well, it’s midnight and she texts me this long message about 1,000 words long saying how she needs to set a boundary with me and I need to step away and how I don’t make her feel good. She then proceeded to nit pick how I tag her in my posts thinking I’m trying to “steal her followers” and how I never look at her stories or comment on her posts.  I replied to that part with “I am trying to not scroll on IG because it’s not good for my mental health”.  The part that really got me is when she said that I never shared one of her contests in my stories for exposure. I have more followers than her. The end of her message said , please take a step back and think about what you can offer me as a friend, because our relationship has not made me feel good. 

So yeah I feel like shit because this is not really a positive message to get before going to sleep. I’m so tired of the feminine friendship wound. This is why I stay away from females. It’s either I’m too over bearing, or I don’t do enough. I have one girlfriend in my life who actually likes me for who I am. This woman doesn’t even know me and i also feel really bad that I vented to her about stupid shit. But she also would vent to me during challenging times. It’s just like what is the point anymore?"
lonely,"It’s not the same anymore, but I have no one else","It’s not the same anymore, but I have no one else - I was off to college, and I’ve had to to comeback after the first year. In college , i guess I didn’t talk to my friends back home as much but I still kept contact and we used send each other memes and stuff but I’m back home and because of the pandemic I’ve been home for a while. 
When I tried to hangout it was so awkward. I agree I’m not the best at socialising or even reading the vibe of the room but even I could tell that it was downright awkward, and this was never really the problem before because we were really good friends and we vibed really well, but it just felt like i did something wrong or everyone was trying to hide something from and in general just unwanted, and it just felt like a courtesy.
It’s been about 3 months since I’ve had any meaningful contact with them, worst part is I never really made any real friends in college and so I don’t have a lot of interaction with them but it felt okay because i had my friends back home and it never made me feel alone.
But now, i feel so alone, i never get called to hangout anymore, but i can see their stories, i know my college friends are having gaming sessions late night but I’m not invited to those either and i just feel isolated and cast out.
It sucks"

To be fair, I don't think expecting a simple ""happy birthday"" from people who I regularly keep in touch with is asking too much; unless, I am actually the crazy one for expecting friendships to be mutualistic, as opposed to parasitical. I suppose this is just the first of many life lessons moving into what might be some very lonely twenties..

I have a pit in my stomach, I feel anxious and on edge and I just long for a hug, an embrace, some kind of acknowledgment that I’m not okay from someone I love. But I don’t love anyone like most people do and I’ve never felt loved the way most people do. I can’t feel it or reciprocate it, I just pretend and it’s incredibly lonely. 

I feel like it’s my fault, that maybe I’ve done something wrong or I’m not doing anything at all and I’m being punished for it because I despise people but crave companionship so deeply. My life is a paradoxical mess :("

I feel numb.
I don't like where i am. I don't like who I became. I have to suppress any feeling because they only know the ""happy"" side of me. 
Today I watched someone that had a problem, a problem that have many ways to be solved,but that person didn't even tried to do no even one, but lot of people came to them and told her to leave it and all went home happy.
I am like that person, when I have a problem, I don't know what to do I only want to cry or sleep, but I know that if I do it no one would help me, because of that persona I made of me. I do cry over it, and start to things to solve it, my body reacts to the things I do with strong pain in my heart and my body feeling as heavy as a rock. (Nothing medical I can assure. Since I do check ups on me even if I have to fight my social anxiety).
People say I'm strong, bit I only want to be treated like that person once in my life.
Today I zoned out for 3 hours remembering how all happened. How does it feel to be accepted, to be forgiven if your anxiety and attention deficit can't let you do things, that you do knowing that your body is fighting to tear you appart and leave you on the floor like garbage.

I want to wake up and feel my body relaxed after resting. See the sun entering my room and have a quiet day.
But even saying shit about my life. I'd take the same steps again. Idk I only want some affection, I don't know when I'm my life missed that path. I'll just stay alone. Idk I only want to be in bed all day. But I have to be in the doctor in 7 hours..."

*p.s. naturally this is going to be a long one, apologies*

Everyone in my family has been a loner all their life, it's only recently that I've realised this. My really understanding but a bit hot headed dad got dumped by my mom at the prime of his life and he never associated with anyone else again for 20+ years.

My mom who was criminally abused by her in laws left my dad with some difficulty and in turn got ostracized by the whole family (conservative Christians) who were literally her whole world before this and turned to someone else for companionship.

While me and my sister only ever had each other till she got married 3 years ago.

I'm shit at a lot of things but most of all I suck absolute ass at socializing and maintaining any conversations beyond small talk. In college I finally found a friend who had the same view on the futility of it all and happiness in benign things. We talked for hours about philosophy, life, religion, poems, indie artsy movies etc but the more we hung out the more I tried to change myself to make sure we were more compatible. Since I hung out with this guy literally all the time in college (honestly you could call me his puppy at that point) I naturally exhibited this kind of personality with everyone else I met there as well and became known to be like this guy who is ""beyond wordly pleasures"". Or as a normal person woul call it, kind of a buzzkill.

It's not like I didn't have slightly similar beliefs and likes as this guy myself but to deny every mainstream thing in life, to despise those ""less intellectually stimulated"" or to acquiesce to things you disagree with because life is meaningless anyways; all these were not my ideas of an ideal worldview, but I changed and forcefully sat through many books and movies and talks to make sure this wierd thing I had for the first time in my life which resembles a friendship works out. Long story short...it didn't.

The second side of my life is that in church. Please don't get this wrong, in not a conservative republican or come from such a family, we aren't even in the west. It's a very normal casual church where a lot of cool people also come who have problems but everyone is accepted and no one is judged, although yes, it still leans to the conservative side of the soectrum. I like many people there but recently my only reason for going there has been that I get to play music in the choir but..I detract. 

Basically since both me and my sis were loser loners we thought the world of our church people and their acceptance of us was a huge thing since a yong age. Being with the cool singers and musicians and the understanding pastors and other church leaders was also enjoyable. So naturally I also tried to mould myself to fit better with them.
I tried to clean up my humour, go to every organized event early and stay late cleaning up and trying to ""hang out"" etc etc. But this didn't work either, I saw people who made openly sexual and dirty jokes be accepted as life of the groups and people who didn't do much but had an excuse to hang out late since they had nowhere else to go join ""the gang"" while I watched. 

So now, I have these two very opposing ideals and perspectives on life between which I switch between depending on the environment, am still just as lonely as before AND am super conflicted on who the fuck I am and whether I even have an original personality or just a chameleon who changes entire life views to get a chuckle out of people.


Again, apologies for the long rant (and on retrospect some poor formatting). This post might not fit the sub perfectly but Im lonely and just wanted to let out for once. Thanks for reading people, have a good one."

We have been together for 5 years and were supposed to get married this year.

The last several years have been pretty rough as he's betrayed me a lot. I (22f) won't go into it but he (23m) has an addiction which he's constantly lying about.

A month ago I decided to move back in with my parents because I needed time to think about our relationship. I found out that he lied to me again, and really needed some space. After a while I was warming up to him again. I wasn't ready to come home which he respected, but I felt like we were progressing: we went to couples councelling and he was looking into therapy for himself. We decided to wait to get married until we sorted our problems out. But today I found out that instead of taking the time to become a better partner, he lied to me again.

So I broke it off with him.

I feel like my world is ending and my life has no meaning. I know it'll get better. I know that I'll heal eventually. But right now I'm in a dark place. I lost my best friend. The person I wanted to marry and raise a family with. My whole future was planned around him, I've been struggling when we met and became very codependent. I feel like I don't know how to live without him and I'm completely lonely. I don't know who to talk to, where to go from here or what to do.

My self-esteem is at its lowest. I constantly ask myself why I wasn't good enough. Why would he lie to me this much? He went great lengths to make sure I wouldn't find out every time. Alas, I did. God knows how many times he's lied, but the times I know of can't be counted on the fingers of both hands. What did I ever do to deserve this? I've never been perfect. Not even close. There's a lot that needs working on and damn, do I struggle with my mental health. But not once in my life have I betrayed or lied to him.

I could go on and on but in the end I just really needed to get that off my chest. I'm struggling with this but no one's available to talk. I messaged my friends but none replied. My first instinct was 'I need a hug from fiancé', my life is empty without him. I guess I really am just confused, heartbroken and lonely."

If only I had someone I could love and come home to at the end of the night instead of a toxic family and a cold empty bed. I just want to give up.

All I really want is a group of good friends and to experience what a relationship is like. But I feel like at my age I'm losing my opportunities quick. I'm not the most good looking person either so oh well.."

I don’t know why I do that. Like I feel high then I think to myself, “What if I could get higher?” So I do it. Then I’m so far out that I’m just floating by myself. It’s wild how lonely and isolating this world can feel. It’s kind of fucked when I really think about it. Like I’ve probably encountered millions of other people in my lifetime and I haven’t managed to form an actual human connection with any of them. We’re all living in our own worlds and it’s fucking bizarre. Shout out to whatever weirdo on the internet sees this post! You a real homie. Sending all of you guys love from all the way up here."

lonely,When you have no friends,"When you have no friends - Does anyone else see people that they know, and see how close they are with their friends, and you don’t have any so you just watch as people are building bonds and you literally have no one outside your family who cares about you? On top of that you also realize that you will never be able to have a social group, or be able to go out on adventures with others, and feel like you’re missing out on fun cause you have no friends. I’ve come to realize I will never have any close friends, I’m 23 and I think my life will always be boring and mediocre because I have no friends.

They always say shit like “I’ll message you every day” or “Talk to me anytime.” Same old basic shit, but the thing is they can’t fucking keep their promises. I try and yearn for someone just to talk to me even if it’s super surface level, even if it’s just a “how are you” I don’t even get that, what makes it worse is that a year and a half ago or so I wasn’t like this, I had friends dming me all the time, would go public events and now I have 6 people I talk to, half of them are my family and the half I’m forced to talk to. I just wish someone could talk to me. When looking for friends is hard enough for me, always thinking about how I’m wasting time really digs deep. No support nobody to talk to, makes my eyes slow, makes them take time. Who am I kidding probably 4 people read this and 2 of them are bots. I suppose if you want to talk shoot me a message, cya."

I have reached out in some friends subreddits here, but people just stop responding or talk to me about how they miss their life before the pandemic. It makes me feel even worse, because my life before the pandemic was exactly the same. I have also realized that I don't have any experience people my age should have.

I know it is my fault and there is no magic solution, because I don't trust people and making friends is very hard for me. I am tired of faking everything. I have no problem with talking to strangers or to my classmates, but when I do, it's like I have this happy mask on that has nothing to do with how I feel, I have no idea how to open up.

lonely,I will post here the poem i wrote to her,"I will post here the poem i wrote to her - The theoretical and metaphoric guide to turn a skeleton into a plant.

Someday somewhere somehow

Someone has ended his life

Someday somewhere sometime

A skeleton began to walk


He walked and walked and walked

With the lonely philosophy of a lonely one

His gestalt gray his ”life” in vain

He travel there with no one end


Some point somewhere somehow

He saw himself pass behind a line

With never ending vibrant skies

With everlasting voice of life


There saw a life with no equal

A beautiful giggle, a beautiful smile

There the wonderful witch of floral

A wonder existence, a blessing signal


But having nothing but his gestalt

He walk away with gray inside


There on his path he realises a tree

Massive like a castle, high like every dream

There he finds the wonder, there he finds the witch

Lying close the castle, lovely like a kiss

She realises the bony and began to sing


Want to take a color?

A soft warm dream color

I will give you then

The color of the morning

To take to the tomorrow

To take to what you are chasing

I will give you then

The color of the eve

To take to the peace

To take to the dream


Then he takes the color

The color of the morning

Then he finds his color

His color like the eve

There he lefts the gray

The gray that his life has taking

There the sky his wonder

Wonder like be living


But not having nothing but his loneliness

He walks away with no one else


There inside his travel

He walked and walked and walked

But having the color of the morning

But having the color of the eve

Make looks his travel like be living


Then he looks the castle

The top behind the sky

Walks close to the branches

Search the beauty one

She reach to the searcher

And began to talk


Want to have some branches?

Like the paths you feel

Want to reach the others?

Want to reach me?

Want to take the hugs?

Want to take the fists?

Want to have some sorrow?

Want to get to live?


Then he grows the branches

Like his legs and hands

Then he reach the flower

Softly takes her hand


But having nothing but a broken life

He walks away with the empty by his side


There inside his travel

He walked and walked and walked

But having branches likes his hands

But having tree trunks likes his legs

He reach to the others

And restart his dreams

There he reach the border

Border of the seas

There he reach the highest

Highest like a cliff

Looking to the witch

He began to think

What a lovely creature

Kind as no one else

Good as my memories

I need something say

How to reach so beauty

Beautiful smile

How to feel the softy

Softy wavy hair

How deny her cry

Cry that makes me weak

How create her laughing

Laughs with gracely sweet

But with all this travel

But with all in vain

I don’t have the feelings

I can nothing say


Then she says


Want to have a berry?

A tasty juicy one

That takes you bittersweetness

To keep you by my side

To return to be living

To remain like the past


Then he gains a heart

Takes again some air

Feel the pulse of heartbeat

Feels himself alive


Then I said


If i can be a tree

I will be a tree

To take care of you day and night

To be forever by your side

To be your shadow

To be your home

To give you love forevermore

lonely,Crappy childhoods &amp; their consequence,"Crappy childhoods &amp; their consequence - Trigger warning: trauma, self harm, isolation etc...

;

;

;

;

;

&amp;#x200B;

Recently been thinking a lot about 'traumatic aloness' and the cruel irony of those who lived with abusive parents find it much harder to connect with others - even though that is probably one of the most influential sources of healing.

I mostly live alone and a lot of the old baggage of a very dysfunctional family upbringing is becoming excruciating during these pandemic lockdowns. I'm estragned from my family and I've been single a long time (or had a few, brief, relationships that did more harm than good)

....

...but I'm here today to talk about friendships.

&amp;#x200B;

;;;;;

My friends are all lovely wonderful supportive people but I get really upset that some depths of intimacy always elude me. I wonder what magic trick these people have as so many things seem to just 'miss' me.

It makes me feel really broken and I'm tired having to always intentionally 'build' and 'work on myself' yet still be plagued by harrowing levels of anxiety, which at times turns into thoughts of self harm and suicide. I am so angry that this is the price I have to pay for a crappy childhood.

These days I am more being gradually more open with my friends about my past and childhood, but I still find some people prefer to back away &amp; keep a distance. I understand now that there are definatley less people in the world prepared to deal with the 'stuffness' that comes with people who carry this kind of trauma. I can't show up authentically without disclosure, but disclosure can be triggering or cause people to back off. Trust issues make things complicated - like I don't fully trust my own thoughts or reactions to people even.

I've got a 'bubble' during this pandemic but they're all struggling too. They have their various partners and I often feel left by the wayside. There is pressure to save face around them: partly so I'm not a negative nelly and partly so I don't keep re-triggering myself.

And I kind of get it from their side: you've got this somewhat needy friend who you love but struggle to connect with sometimes, you know they're struggling but they seem OK right now and you've got your own shit going on. So the friend slips a bit down the list of priorities as you drift towards whats easier for you and the comfort of your partner.

I'm just their friend and expectations are different, I'm painfully aware that I need them more than they need me.

It really hits hard that I'm actaully nobody's priority. Ok sure ""make yourself your priority"" I hear you say - but after years of doing that I can tell you this is exhausting and it isn't as fulfilling as those moments when you deeply connect with another. Tired of having to balance and negotiate casual commitments with a range of people to keep the pressure off and not alienate people. Lockdown has really messed with that &amp; so much alone time has intensified the echo chamber of insanity in my head.

I have a therapist but that such a relationship in a box, its been really helpful but it doesn't fulfill this nurturance that I'm really craving. Your therapist won't come over for dinner and wine when you're feeling lonely.

I also feel like there isn't a safe space to express the tricky feelings that come with this to my friends, because sometimes I'm downright angry with them and often jealous. Sometimes I feel left out, and other times I really AM left out, but though from their side they're doing what they can to help.

It exacerbates feeling broken, triggers thoughts that I am a toxic person, makes it hard for me to express my needs, I scold myself for having any. I become on high alert and very paranoid about all my interactions with everybody - looking for 'red flags' signs of abuse... if new people in my life step up to meet my needs I quickly become very distrustful of their intentions because I'm aware I'm susceptible to manipulation.  I have to do lots of talking myself down and reality checks, boundry setting. It's a harrowing place to be and I don't know which way is up half the time.

More and more there is just a deep fury that its just all so unfair that I have and work so much harder than others, and yet still be left wanting for things that are easy for so many others.

And I recognize its a long path to healing - but its long, its lonely, in some ways its more traumatic than the events themselves. I try to accept that 'this is where I am at and I've come a long way"" but I've been in a parched desert of lonely for so long and I'm aware that I might never ""get there"". When does holding hope become toxic and keep us stuck?

I spend so much time alone, there is nobody to bear witness to so many aspects of my life and its like they never happened and like bits of me are dissapearing."
lonely,i try to open up but nobody cares enough,"i try to open up but nobody cares enough - hi. so, i really struggle with opening up to people because i feel misunderstood constantly. i understand that not everyone needs to understand the way my brain works, but this has been difficult when i am trying to build long-lasting friendships, or when i am dating, etc. 

i feel like when i do open up (which is once in a blue moon), i am always shown a reason why i shouldn't. i get dismissed, or criticized, or told that i am ""wrong."" when this happens, i shut people out because i feel hurt all over again. 

i feel like part of the problem is that some of the people i attract are just not good for me, which is ok. 

sometimes i feel like maybe there just isn't anyone else who cares to understand. it feels extremely isolating. does anyone else experience feelings similar to this?"
lonely,"Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real 🌟), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀!","Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real 🌟), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts).

**How it works:**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.
* Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
   * [/u/finder\_of\_the\_humans](https://www.reddit.com/u/finder_of_the_humans/)/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"

lonely,Anyone else keep letters they wrote to the people that have hurt them?,"Anyone else keep letters they wrote to the people that have hurt them? - throughout my life I have met people I have either fallen in love with or close friends that have hurt me, sometimes I write a letter in a text document or word, I try and be mindful of how they would feel reading it, I write it with every intention of sending it to them, one I even translated into german (even got me to start trying to learn German) I fell tell them how grateful I am for the good memories we had, then I would go one to apologise for anything bad I have done, then I will go on to explain how I felt and how they might of hurt me.

I then finish it by wishing them all the best then I save the documents on my desktop and then never send it. Sometimes I open them up and I read through it, and I remember the people I had lost, people that I loved that decided to just walk out of my life.

I find myself writing again today, this time its a lot shorted then normal, someone I became really close to really quickly then she stopped interacting with me as soon as she got a boyfriend, idk if I should send her this message, maybe she will think I am jealous of her relationship (Im not I just want my friend back) maybe she will get mad at some of the stuff in the letter, maybe she won't give a shit.

I should just put them in a folder and stash them all away where I can't see them"

I just hate all of them. They are so nice to each other. They laugh with their friends and make plans for the weekend. Then they complain how they no one of their friends are in one class they have and how they had to eat lunch all alone. For the past two years I have been going to this school I have never shared a class with a friend. I have eaten lunch alone every single day. Then they complain how they only have a few close friends. I would sell my soul to have 1 close friend. Today we heard that we have online school for the next month. Everyone acted as if it is the end of the world when they can't see their friends. I hate all of them. Especially the new girl who just came to our school and everyone smiled at her and now she has made so many new friends and after two years I'm still there all alone

lonely,Feeling alone in my country no one shares interests,"Feeling alone in my country no one shares interests - Hello, im posting this to anonymously talking about how I'm feeling because I could never talk to anyone about that.
First of all I would say i'm not in a hard phase of life right now, everyones struggling sometimes. I have friends and live together with my gf. But one thing won't let me rest in the past time.

No one of my friends and not evene my gf shares my interets. Of course ther'e some, I do have and my gf takes part in. But the most time I feel disconnected from my friends and people around me. I often find myself watching the same old youtube video over and over again, talking about themes I like or hobby's I have and writing comments in realy bad english in the hope someone replys.
Also my friends are talking completely different about media than I do. I often can't talk to them how I wan't to because they won't understandand and I don't even think i'm a smart person. I see thousands of people talking about the stuff I like, but just online. I've never met someon in my country sharing same interest than me.

I'm known in my friend circle as the person liking weird things nobody knows and being anoying. When I'm talking to people about my interests it's always just me oversharing. And I know know there are people sharing my hobbys and interests but just not in my country. I like things which are very common and well known but just nobody I know is sharing these interest and I feel often like im different than others and it sucks.. 

I always have the impression that i'm just so different and disconnected from other people in my age. 

I am enyoing the things I do but in the end of the day it's just me and no one else I can talk to. I feel so alone even tho I am not.

PS: Sorry for my bad english."
lonely,My Reddit bot can give you some random subjects to talk about 🤖,"My Reddit bot can give you some random subjects to talk about 🤖 - **TLDR:** u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t can send you a random question which you can ask to a friend. This means that, you'll need to find that friend first. If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It’s also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won’t even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON’T be forwarded!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‘!’ as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

&amp;#x200B;

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: Tries to help you.

**!feedback** Can be used to leave feedback. Please write your feedback after **!feedback**.

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&amp;#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to.

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don’t provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won’t pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it’s good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON’T want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they’ll will still remain.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess… It displays all the commands and well… tries to help you with that.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.**

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

**Have fun :)**"

I thought it was real. We literally shared our SnapChats and phone numbers when we were done hanging out. Then I woke up and realized it was all just a dream. I don't know, it just really made me down and depressed waking up knowing that it was just fake. I remember hoping before I woke up that I'm not friendless anymore and that my life can actually be exciting now. But it was just a fucking dream."

I would constantly be worried if they were cheating or checking out other girls. I would always be scared that I’m not pretty enough for them. It’s better if I stay alone. It will save me a lot of pain.

lonely,I keep having massive drops in my self esteem,"I keep having massive drops in my self esteem - Hi.

My self esteem is dog shit, I keep getting way too withdrawn and cutting myself off, angry at myself for how unproductive I am, how I feel like a deadbeat that nobody has ever loved. I download the dating apps bumble &amp; tinder and only last a couple of days on them max because of nerves and how sad, lonely I get even though I get along with people messaging I just can't deal with my dire self esteem so I delete the apps. I keep creating and deleting Reddit accounts. I want to hug someone, someone, someone so badddd. About 2-3 years ago a girl touched the back of my neck and that's pretty much it for intimacy I can think of. I had screaming matches with my family earlier, had to go for a long walk for hours to get out of the house, I just wound up sitting in a place in the dark waiting, not wanting to go back to where I live.

I just want someone to look me in the eye, and be affectionate with me, I can't get my mother or father, or siblings to look me in the eye and be open with me.

I was on twitter for the first time some time last year, never was on social.media before that. I had to deactivate my account because I can't get over how sad, withdrawn I feel over everyone is excited to get outta covid lockdown, and excited over things like.drinking out - I have never had a social life, I sorta struggled with eating &amp; anxiety disorders in the past and I feel so left out in my home country, confused around my home city and feel full of shame.

I've wasted so much of my life :("
lonely,sad but no other choice,"sad but no other choice - Hi, coz this place is anonymous I guess I just wanted to throw my thoughts out into the internet.

I feel horribly alone as per usual, but I feel like I have to pull myself together and I don't have room for sadness,  I need to be strong, no one but me cares for me so I gotta be my own lifeline.

I think I want to try dating(?!) for first time in my life. I don't know, all i know is that I have always had these fairytale ideals I held onto for so long, plus, being a social pariah didn't exactly help matters, but I think I deserve some happiness in my life, so I'm sick of the loneliness, I always thought that a weird specimen like me could never date or have anyone want to be my bff or bf, but I have needs too and I just want this year to be happier than the last three years have been.

Only problem is that I've always been such a dull and boring person :(( I just want someone to like me for me, I'm not sure how to go about doing that, but even a boring, weird, childish woman like me needs people."

This happened because when we made the plans and signed the lease, things were fine. However, during moving in my mental health was really being pushed, so I became distant and irritable. I've been fighting hard against depression for some time.

We haven't had mutual touch, kissed or had any moments of intimacy in almost 2 months.
I can't even lie beside her in bed because I try to touch her gently or cuddle up to her, but she flat out ignores me like I may as well not exist and it's not even happening.
It breaks my fucking heart so much that I leave to be also on the couch and sometimes cry, I won't lie.

I don't currently have work but I've taken up a new course and I'm applying for jobs, I'm receiving therapy for my depression every 2 weeks, but for every step I take forward, her hatred of me brings me back two steps.

I can't get out, not until I'm back on my feet and can afford my own place. I'm stuck in this dreadful endless lonely hell in which I spend every waking moment alone or rejected. Not even my brother wants anything to do with me. He just be comes home from work every day and flat out ignores me, then goes to his room.

What the FUCK do I do?? Being single is less lonely than this because at least then there's the excitement of meeting new people, and dating with a bright future."

lonely,A big thank you (slight NSFW),"A big thank you (slight NSFW) - Thank you to my old best friend, for never visiting me when I became agoraphobic and mentally ill. I remember how I spent so much time trying to back you up and support you, when your mum seemed to love your sister more. 

All that time gone to waste. All those memories of joking about, hanging out with each other and sleep overs. Dead. Gone. You could've reached out to me. 

Also to another friend who I considered close back then. You messaged me in 2016 and I couldn't believe my eyes when you told me you wanted us to hang out again. You used to be the weirdo in school, which made you extra special to me. Even had a crush on you. 

So we hung out, you decided to let me into your house. Me being naïve, autistic and happy to meet up with you again after all these years was tricked into helping you paint your bedroom. Yeah. And then afterwards over messenger you technically changed your attitude, told me to get lost. 

Thanks for that too. 

Also a big thank you to the guy who knew I was severely depressed in school, who used to offer me a listening ear whenever I was mentally rotting due to the severe bullying, and then met up with me in 2016. I overcame my depression that year, agoraphobia and untreated PTSD. Was always smiling and so bubbly, full of love. Stupidly I admitted my crush on you, and you accepted it. 

Then decided to finger me, took advantage of me by ramming your tongue down my throat, and left the blood on your bedsheets because you didn't want mummy to find out that you had me over. All after you dumped me on the spot. 

They say date someone who's a best friend. They say find people with common interests. They say ""love yourself"" and I did. I did love myself and he fucking wrecked me. 

Thanks to the girl who ran the college LGBT group, inviting me out to a bowling night, left me sat on a bench feeling anxious as her and the other group members ate the entire banquet and never spoke to me. You're brilliant. Also thanks for coming out and attacking me with ""I worked so hard on this group! You must be grateful!"" after I mentioned why I went home early. 

Thanks to every friend I laughed with, looked up to, and genuinely felt happy around for ditching me. Wonderful people you are. Expecting me to message first always. Never asked me to meet up or anything. I've always been a side friend. 

Thanks to another friend who I met up with for coffee in 2020 before the pandemic hit. We hung out in college a few months before, we used to be school friends too, and you acted like you couldn't remember who I was. You agreed to meet up with me, though. Called me a weirdo for even considering meeting up with you. And then told me to ""piss off"", when I asked why you couldn't remember my name. 

My therapist advised for me to hang out with an old friend, to reconnect, that you'd love to hang out with me again. I tried to explain you wouldn't, guess I was right. 

Also thanks to everyone who never gives me a chance because I've got situational mutism, who gives me strange looks whenever I attempt to speak - backing me into a corner further, for seeing me as a creature void of personality, for assuming I'm quiet and shy, for making sure I'm isolated in every single social setting. 

I've been single for 6 years.

But god does it hurt. Knowing that I won’t be able to lay in bed next to you ever again. Knowing that I won’t be able to see the family members I loved so deeply- as if they were my own. Knowing that I won’t have my partner in crime with me at the next show. Knowing that I won’t be able to show you off to the world anymore. Knowing that I’ll never be intimate with you again... 

Knowing that we just couldn’t work after trying so fucking hard. All I wanted was for you to respect me, without realizing that by staying for so long, *I* was the one disrespecting myself. I wanted to feel like who I was, was enough for you. But it wasn’t. So I chose me, when nobody else did. 

And I know I’m guilty of hurting you after being hurt for so long. I turned into someone I’m not, I lost myself in the process. And I’m sorry for the things I did when I was broken. 

I love you.
I wish I could hold you one last time.
If I knew our last kiss truly was the last, I would’ve locked our lips for longer.

I’m so sorry."

The pandemic has made things worse, but I hate to use that as a scapegoat.

Idk how I feel, I do a lot of weed to get by, mainly weed edibles and vaping. I have no siblings and I live with a single mom, so the loneliness is quite amplified.

I just hope my future doesn't feel like a shit hole like it feels now. Having a partner would be nice, but also idk if I can fully deal with my insecurities without projecting it on her. I just pray and hope things change, not only for me, but for everyone who feels lonely, betrayed, confused, eager, and vulnerable. If anyone wants to talk to me on my bday it would be nice. Would like to make reddit friends too.

lonely,Me sad af,"Me sad af - tldr: found out my friends had a group chat without me, I'm sad


So I and my group of friends were sitting together, and they were discussing about a photo they saw. I asked one of them what it is, and he asked me ""You're not in the group chat?"" I said ""No I'm not in it."" He never offered to add me and I didn't request to join either since it would be so weird. I felt really sad and he never brought it up again. 

That night, I texted the same friend and just casually asked him who's in the group, out of genuine curiosity. He first ignored me for hours, then just replied with a sticker meaning secret stuff? Then I said ""oki :)"" so he wouldn't think I'm sad. The next day, he kinda avoided me and we didn't talk alot like we did before.

I mean, my friends did nothing wrong. They are not obligated to involve me in their group chat but I just feel really sad for being left out. 

I don't even know if they are friends or just being nice to me. We helped each other out with homework, I reminded them an exam they would have forgot, we have played video games together, I talk a lot individually with most of my friends (who are in the group) but to the group as a whole, I'm probably just an outsider.

I always comply but this really troubles me because for me, I really value trust and being on time in a friendship. So even when we are together, I still feel lonely, I just worry that he might not be the proper friend for me. Unfortunately, I don't have another choice, he is my only friend whom I recently met. Anyway, when we were playing video games and I asked him what we were going to do this weekend because we had planned to hangout this weekend a while ago. He then responded saying he has a tennis tournament both days. The second I heard this my heart ached and I wanted to cry, it might not seem like a big deal to most people but to me this is really important. Even getting a text makes my heart skip, but hanging out with a friend! That's just something extraordinary for me. After that, I started to get the feeling in my chest when your lonely, that painful feeling of emptiness. So I told him I would play a couple more rounds and get off. I then went to my room to write this. I really appreciate if you read through all of this, it really helps me cope with loneliness when I write things down and share with people. Though I'm truly puzzled, does it seem like he wants to be my friend? I just can't understand."
lonely,I am so lonely y’all.,I am so lonely y’all. - I have lost everyone in my life from friends to my parents passing away to no relationship ever. I feel like a loner. I don’t even know why. I’d say I’m a pretty attractive person. So I don’t understand why I’m so single too and guys hurt me so much. I’ve been told by multiply guys im “ too nice” I don’t get it. My father passed away today and I have no one to turn to. Just me and my sister and the last two people that haven’t passed yet. She has a husband so he can comfort her but again it’s just me by myself no comfort from anyone. This is so depressing for me. I wish I could have someone just hug me and hold me and say everything is gonna be okay. I feel so helpless this year is terrible already for me. I don’t really know what to do.
lonely,Lonely Af on my day off.. when will it end?,"Lonely Af on my day off.. when will it end? - Im 30. Gay, Black. I have very few friends (3 female friends I’ve known different amounts of time). I’m not a big socializer. I don’t have any social media besides TikTok which I mainly watch for funny or informative videos. I don’t understand why it’s so difficult to find a partner. I’m not all that picky when it comes to appearance. Id prefer to have a partner of color but I’ve talked to white men and I can definitely vibe w anyone. I’m not a size queen or any other labels associated with gay culture. I’m a regular ass gay guy kinda. I don’t care for sports but I can watch it if I have to. I love cars, music, good conversations and laughing. I have sooo much to give but I can’t seem to find a guy to give it to. 

I’ve never had an actual LTR. All of the guys I’ve dated either stopped talking to me or I stopped talking to them after a couple weeks. I’ve never slept in the same bed after sex either. Idk why, but I need this to change. Please I beg of any lonely person who read this post, Wtf can I do? I deleted all the dating apps in November. I started trying to be friendlier w the ppl at work (because maybe future hubby is there). I’m not hot in the pants and I’ve only had 4 sexual partners in my life. I just don’t understand.

FRFR I’m just running out of runway for this plane to take off. I’d like to avoid the crash! if you all know what I mean.... I could use someone listening to me for once."
lonely,"Lets be real,your lonely and I'm lonely, so lets help each other out","Lets be real,your lonely and I'm lonely, so lets help each other out - Look, we are all on here because we want someone to talk to and connect with. So lets be brutally honest about what we want. To feel a connection to someone. The thing is you can't connect to someone without being somewhat vulnerable. Talking about the weather isn't going to make the lonliness go away (trust me Ive tried). So here is what i propose.

Step one) We both agree to be honest, talk about whats going on in life, and be real. Tell each other the stuff we don't tell anyone else.

Step 2) be open to voice chat at some point, you can only get to know someone so well through text (and by ""so well"" i mean ""hardly at all"")"

I got into a debate with my family today and I usually keep my feelings to myself and I thought my sister would take my side because I was right and she knew it but she took my parents side because “it was easier”...... I couldn’t even move I couldn’t be angry I was just empty..

Big rant.","Because of my mental illnesses, I get attached fully and too quickly. From the outside, I look like a normal 25 year old woman. On the inside, I feel like a child crying out for anyone. Big rant. - Yesterday I lost an online friend that became meaningful to me very quickly. We became close friends very quickly, we both had issues and we got along effortlessly. I don't connect with many people. I have been almost completely isolated inside my apartment for almost a year with virtually no human contact. All I have is my computer screen and walls keeping me safe but also in a prison. We both said because of our experiences we'd always be friends. He said he'd also be extremely torn up if we parted ways. But there was an issue with his friend group I was briefly in, and I left because I didn't like the behaviour of some room members and it didn't reflect my character. Because of my departure, there was a secret revealed in the friend group and it shattered the whole thing. He was forced to pick his long time best friend over me despite me not doing a single thing wrong. She made him choose her, and he has a codependent and unhealthy friendship with her. 

I told him how I felt and how devastated I was. He felt the same but had to make the choice in his eyes. I've been crying since it happened. I've been praying out loud to God and begging Him to help my friend realize that he made the wrong choice, and wants to be my friend again. He betrayed me, and threw away our friendship and in the process broke my heart. I beg to God to bring him back so we can be friends again, so I can be a giving and caring friend. I want to be in his life to always be sure he's okay and taking care of himself. I think how could God take away someone that cared about me and I care about him, and we had such a happy friendship, and someone I always want to help and protect - what is the point in seperating this friendship? I can't stop crying. I'd forgive him, and talk until we figured it out. Nothing can't be talked through if both people care. 

I know there are some non-religious people on reddit, so those are more rhetorical. I'm not really looking for any sorta ""bc God doesn't exist"" sort of stuff right now please. 

I'm tired of being thrown away. I'm tired of being lied to. I'm tired of being seen as just a name on the screen, as some sort of temporary bond. I'm tired of getting so heartbroken about people leaving me. 

I grew up emotionally neglected and shunned by my mother, so I always feel like a small child lost in a crowd. Except, there's no hand for me to grab onto. I have such insecure attachment issue. Maybe in the crowd I'll find a hand to hold onto momentarily and it brings me comfort. As I look up at the face of the person in the bustling crowd it feels like they were always supposed to be there and it clicks. It felt like I had a safe hand to hold onto and help guide me through this shitty crowd called life. This time it felt like he ripped go of me and I got swallowed up my extreme loneliness. 

I've felt extreme, deep loneliness my entire life. It's been the core issue that has pushed me to new lows. I believe because of my loneliness, I was drawn to abusive relationships and a traumatic assault. I have chronic depression, insomnia, PTSD. The child in me is crying out for anyone to hold me and comfort me. The adult me is crying out for people to stay. 

I feel isolated even within my experience of loneliness. I don't think most people would guess how deeply lonely and miserable I am. I am relatively pretty/cute (based on others opinions, not my own of course), I have a good personality, I care and love whole heartedly. I give my whole self to friends and ones I care for. I can easily find endless amounts of men online either wanting to ""befriend me"" (with malicious intentions which I often fall prey for), or ones who would want to date. Because of this, I think people would say that my experience with suffering with this loneliness isn't as valid because of my luck of being born with these genes. My loneliness drove me to the circumstances that gave me PTSD, for fucks sake. 

My loneliness isn't due to lack of access of options. It's due to this huge, deep void in my heart. I desperately want a connection that 'clicks,' but they rarely do. I've only met a few people in my whole life that have truly seen my soul and I theirs. On top of that, I also don't click with friends naturally. It feels awkward to speak to them one on one, there is little flow. Sometimes I think this loneliness will never end. I've been in very good therapy for years, but my heart still aches every day. 

I'm alone in my apartment every single day, and he was one of the only people I had to speak to. He helped keep me 1% more sane. Our bond was natural and we both remarked how quickly we got along and that it felt like we were always supposed to be friends. I am dreading looking for a friend again. I am terrified of having to go back to the drawing board and find new discord groups to speak in so I am not 100% alone all of the time. I will keep praying to God that he'll want to be my friend again. Tonight again I'll go asleep crying, after a full day of crying. After years of crying. 

D, I miss you so much and I will always keep a spot open in my heart for when I hope you'll come back."

lonely,Their loss.,"Their loss. - After another emotional breakdown, I told myself once more that looking for a relationship online is not worth it. Never has and never will be. It messes with your self worth and leaves you wondering whether you even deserve a healthy and intimate relationship with someone, at least for me. So please consider this: don't you ever underestimate how much you matter and if someone leaves your life or shoots you down, it's their loss. It's their loss because they just threw away the chance to get to know just how great you are to be with. It's hard to adopt this mindset, if you can call it that. It really is and I'm still trying to obtain it. I'm in bed right now silently crying, wondering if I'll ever get with someone who will genuinely love me, trying to reassure to myself the things I just told you. At the end of the day, it's their loss. That's it. You'll always find a better person, even if it doesn't seem like it at first. To anyone who's reading this, I hope you have a great day and night for the rest of your life. I'm going to try and sleep before I cry even more."

lonely,Not alone but lonely...,"Not alone but lonely... - I am feeling down right now. I don’t know that there is really a point to this post and I just found this subreddit right now, so I hope this is okay..

I have a boyfriend, we live together. I feel alone so often as if he is just not listening to me. Today, he told me about this work meeting (I asked) but then I tried to tell a work story and he immediately got on his email then Facebook.

My mom was supposed to come over to help me around my house (I work full time and go to college so my housework has really fallen by the wayside) and she cancelled on me last minute. Of course she said she would come by so as not to disappoint me but I did not want to be a burden.

I only feel like I have one friend and honestly I’m not the best at being present in her life so I hate to go and bother her with my whiny feelings.

The most socializing I do is at school or at work and it feels so surface-level. Or it’s just related to school or work.

I guess I’m just saying I’m lonely."
lonely,"""Best friend"" blocked me","""Best friend"" blocked me - 3 years down the drain as if it was nothing. She moved into a new apartment the middle of last year and started working more hours to pay rent. I knew she would be more busy but it went to the extreme.

Her responses to me started getting farther and farther apart until they ceased completely. I wished her a happy birthday, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. All three messages/calls were ignored. I messaged her the day before my birthday last week asking her ""okay what is going on."" Yes, in hindsight, the message was worded rather rudely but after almost 3 months of absolutely no communication and after telling me she never wants to lose me as a friend, I got a little frustrated. To throw a friendship away just like that is so heartbreaking.

Well a couple days later passed. She didn't say happy birthday to me (not that I was expecting it) and I went to her messages page and it said at the bottom ""this person is unavailable on messenger."" Now I knew this meant either she deactivated her account or blocked me. Well I searched her on Facebook and could not find her profile. So I had my mom search for it and she found it right away... confirming my ""best friend"" blocked me.

I knew she wasn't just busy. No one can be busy for 3 months straight to the point you can't acknowledge a birthday message, a Christmas message, a Happy New Year message, and everything in between. I am so broken from this. She was the only person before this happened I knew would message me semi-regularly and acknowledge my existence. Now I'll be lucky to go only a week before someone other than my parents/my boyfriend talks to me. I know I'm lucky to have them but that doesn't make it hurt any less. What a great way to start my 23rd year."
lonely,My mistake...,"My mistake... - I’m too observant for my own good. I’ve spent my entire life watching how others live instead of interacting with the world as I should. I don’t consider myself to be an emotional person but that’s just because I’ve never opened up to anyone. Nobody knows me and I’m not quite sure how to become known. It’s scary and pathetic that nothing has become of me. It’s not due to a lack of opportunity but rather a lack of guidance, I think. I can only assume that I’m as shy as I am because I was discouraged at some point during my childhood, although I can’t pinpoint exactly what it was that made me this way. 
Anyway, I never really seriously considered suicide before, but I’ve often thought about how the people in my life would react if I were to do it. It’s definitely not a pretty picture in my mind, but I really can’t decide what’s worse: knowing that I’ll continue to live my shitty life and probably die of something related to the slew of autoimmune diseases I suffer from or just ending it on my own terms and have those that care about me suffer the consequences. Even as I’m writing this, I’ve been doing relatively well in life and I’ve gotten many things under control, but I can just feel my grip starting to loosen and the chaos beginning to unfurl. I just want to be loved. I recognize that the rest of the world feels the same way, but I’ve developed this habit of just barely holding on when I need the most help, and I’m not sure I’d be able to live through another tragedy were one to happen. I need someone to at least make sense of my thoughts when they become too nebulous and set me straight when I blame myself for my shortcomings. And to all my fellow functional loners out there, I want you to know that you aren’t alone 🖤"

I don’t want to be toxic to the girl, but every time I get rejected or ghosted it makes me fighting mad and idk what to do. 
I could handle a rejection every now and then, but when it’s EVERY DAY it wears on you. 
Knowing that they have an infinite amount of attention at there fingertips. Knowing you’re the bottom of the barrel when it comes to attractiveness. Knowing they could text literally anyone and have them cuddled up next to them in the hour; that shit hurts someone who has been touched starved for 9 years. 
Obviously it’s not right to take it out on them, so how do you guys redirect your anger to something not hurtful?"

lonely,I’ve been here before and I don’t want to relive it.,"I’ve been here before and I don’t want to relive it. - When I was growing up I’ve never felt lonelier, no friends, bullies at school and at home, no support or trust there, it was just me having to go through what I did alone until I was much older.
With what I’m going through now I feel like my life is slipping back into that black hole I had worked so hard to claw myself out of, the sweat, the tears, the times of thinking about giving up, I gave it all to make my life better and I just can’t have it go back to that.
What makes it worse is that after a 4 year relationship my girlfriend came out of the blue and told me she wasn’t sure if she wanted to be with me anymore, not that it has even come close to a conclusion because after saying that I have been left waiting for an answer of how she feels while she continues to act as though everything is okay once more and there’s nothing to address.
I have already lived enough loneliness, isolation and lack of intimacy to last me a lifetime, and at nearly a year without even having so much as a simple kiss I feel I might as well be single, I just spend every day hoping that today will be the day every time changes and everything will be alright, but I’m starting to feel I’m just being stupid clinging on to this hope, desperately fighting for the most minimal affection from someone, to feel like I matter and that I’m wanted.

lonely,I have nothing anymore [TW],"I have nothing anymore [TW] - 2 years ago was probably one of the best times of my life socially, I had a decent group of friends online who liked me for who I actually was as a person, I had a few friends irl who enjoyed my company and made me genuinely happy, 2 years ago I had a great social life and was actually considered “cool” or “chill” and people would look at me as an actual person, but that all changed when I thought my dumb ass was socially mature and stable enough to have a relationship with another person, I had been talking to this girl I knew for a couple months and me and her were pretty close and enjoyed each others company, one night when we were talking I got the balls to ask her if she wanted to be “something” and she said she would. 

It started off harmless enough and nothing really changed between us, we would still talk and still have normal conversations/voice calls but then for some fucking reason, something in my head clicked and I realized “oh shit! Being just friends and being in a relationship isn’t the same thing!” and after that I started getting anxious and changing as a person, one night we got in an argument and she broke up with me because I wasn’t  the same person she liked before, I rationalized that this was all my fucking fault and started to hate myself for every little thing, I would spend every night venting to one of my friends online and he would TRY to make me feel better but it never worked, whenever he got me into some form on comfort I would just move on to my next problem, then circle around back to the issue before that one! Most of my friend group moved on but for some reason he decided to keep talking to me until I felt somewhat better.

when I felt a little better I tried to patch things up with my friend group but it never got back to how it was before, so in a moment of desperation I became “friends” with a couple of random degenerates I found on discord, looking back now I realize they didn’t give a shit about me and only really talked to me cause I would let them make their stupid edgy jokes and I’d just play along, I entertained these fuckers for an entire year being their little pet on a leash, letting them say dumb racist shit and in return I could have the illusion of friends! It took me a while to accept the fact that these aren’t people I should be associating with and left all the group chats I was in with them and blocking them all.

I had my irl friends for a little bit longer at this point and that would be enough for me! But then they also left me, 1 just stopped texting and hanging out with me and rarely only texts me when he’s bored, my other friend found another group of friends and would only invite me to his PSN calls and games so he can show his other friends how much of a fucking dumb ass I was, and how I still sounded 12 at 14 years old, then the dip-shit has the nerve to start texting and inviting me to his games when all his other friends left him!

Now I have nothing left, every time I try to talk to someone I freeze up and Just pretend like I never engaged with them in the first place, someone tries to talk to me out of pity or they just ignore me, all I have now are my parents who only acknowledge me when I’m doing something that slightly inconveniences them, I’ve been considering self-harm recently and even at some points meditating on the idea of ending my own life, I’m writing this right now as an attempt to make it pass over as nothing else seems to be working."

lonely,"I almost overcame my ""sudden-onset"" social anxiety and then covid came","I almost overcame my ""sudden-onset"" social anxiety and then covid came - So in high school I was quite an extroverted kid and I made friends easily. I'd say that up until my final year I was going out quite often with different groups and I generally had a great social life. Then, I realised towards the beginning of my senior year that almost always I was the one initiating the contact and I decided to wait and see how many of those people would actually reach out - that experiment left me with about \~ 6-7 people, which was a lot less than I was hoping, but still alright. Through my last year there, I was a very good friend with this much smaller group and slowly fell out of touch with the rest. 

Then, I moved to another country for university and, for whatever reason, I missed the ""social start"". When I should've gone to a party, the first night when I moved into my uni accomodation, I've had some kind of panic attack (?) - as in I felt my heart suddenly beating really fast and I started breathing and sweating heavily when I realised I knew no one there. I was extremely self-conscious about my English accent (I was/am in the UK), even though I know that it wasn't that bad and that nobody really cares. Well, anyways, I decided in that panic moment to get back to my room and just sat there the rest of the night. This was in September 2019. 

Fast forward to February 2020, this kept happening any time there was a social event and I made 0 friends in this new city, feeling extremely shit. Then, I decided I've had enough and some how made the courage to actually show up at an event for something and it was actually great. After 3-4 weeks of feeling extremely inadequate and kind of forcing myself onto some groups with which I've done some coursework stuff, I actually was invited to someone's birthday party and I felt hopeful for the first time in over half a year. Well, I never made it to that party - because the night it was supposed to happen, I think it was about 1 week into Covid getting more serious around the world, the country from where the birthday gal and most of her friends announced that it was closing its borders and they literally flew away that night/very early next day. Then lockdown happened.....and is still happening. 

After 7 months of a weird (probably mild, since I could somewhat work on it on my own) episode of social anxiety, I was getting better. I was really scared that since I made no friends at the beginning, I wouldn't really do it further on, but then it started happening, just to go away again. I haven't talked to someone in my course for ages. The uni probably won't physically open. Next year I'll be working (I have a sandwhich degree, for those in the UK), so most of my current course mates will have graduated by the time I'm back in uni, forcing me to try and integrate in a cohort that has been together for 2 years already - fuck that, probably won't be able to do it since my anxiety is stronger then ever. And then I graduate...once uni is done, how many friends-making opportunities are there? Almost none. I have no S/O and have never been in a relationship and right now I have exactly one person to whom I talk like once/twice a week, who is back home anyways. It seems like the worst nightmare - being alone, socially isolated - just came to life because of covid. 

Fuck everything, I was getting better. I know it was only a few months for me and others have it a lot worse. But being alone in a foreign country whose culture I couldn't yet grasp killed me. Now I'm worse than ever and I swear I lost any minimal social skill I had. 

I know this doesn't make sense and it's not very coherent, but thanks for listening tot my rant...

Tl;dr: Was okay socially in high school, then a weird social anxiety hit me like a train when I got into uni; haven't made any friends in the first 6 months, but then during the 7th month I forced myself to talk to people and I started kind of integrating myself in a group. Exactly then, Covid and lockdown came and everyone knows how this shitshow ends."
lonely,can anyone talk,"can anyone talk - i’d really appreciate it. not in a good place. i’m 22, i’m a girl, american if it matters."
lonely,Why do I suck,"Why do I suck - I’m in high school and I think I have some good friends that I talk to. I’m kinda socially awkward or just socially intimidated by certain people. I feel like I just don’t reach out to people or make plans outside of school. When I hear all my other friends making plans with each other I feel kinda insecure about myself and how I’m not as close with them as I should be. I want to keep in contact with people, but I get this fear for some reason of texting people first. I don’t think being an introvert helps because sometimes I genuinely don’t want to talk to people. I’ve always been kinda insecure about myself, but I think it got a lot worse in middle school when I moved and legit had to start all over with getting friends. Idk it just feels like I’m getting in my own way of making friends which makes me feel even more bad about myself. I tend to suppress my emotions because I just don’t like feeling all the negative things in my life. I know that’s a bad way to cope with things, but I’m so used to it now and I would rather not bother people with all my problems. This went on a little longer than I thought but I just legit felt really bad about myself."

lonely,Just need to vent about loss of friend.,"Just need to vent about loss of friend. - 46M I lost my best and only friend this past August.   Not to death but really a very stupid reason.  Little background first.  We met in 1996.  Hit off right away.  He and I both raced Mustangs.  We worked on our cars together, he was my best man, he was my son’s Godfather.  We went through good times in life and bad times together.   No matter what was wrong we both could call each other 24/7.  When my dad was dying from cancer during his busiest time of year he called me every evening to let me cry and laugh.  He came and saw my dad with me.  And then even though it was 4 am I called him to let him know my dad had passed..  The next year his father died suddenly.  I was there.  He drove 12 hours to help me move.  We both could always count on each other.  We gave advice to each other and so on.  
This summer..... The Redskins aka Washington Football Team.  He was beyond enraged over the name change.  I honestly had never seen him so mad about anything.   Well I found a article about it that was about the name change I thought would help.   It is the title that split us.  “Do you love a name or a team?”   Within 10 mins of sending the link I get the nastiest email ever.  Ripping me a part.  And my family.   And other people.   I was taken aback and replying with I am sorry I honestly didn’t mean to upset you.  But what you just sent is way over the top.  Again I am sorry I upset you.   No reply for 3 days then another email telling me to fuck myself and people need to mind their own business and then the killer he insults my wife and kids and telling me again go fuck off.  

I was mad.   But I figured time.  I waited a few days to reply.  I called him out on the insults and apologized again for upsetting him.  

My email was rejected.  I tried texting him it.  Same.   So I sent it hand written.  About 2 weeks later an envelope arrived and my letter was inside torn to bits.   

So a 21 year friendship is dead.  Did I deserve it?  I am still in shock and upset.  Thanks for listening."

lonely,Let’s curb our loneliness,"Let’s curb our loneliness - Hi there,

I’m alone. ...which is why I’m here. I’ve dealt with loneliness all my life in different ways. Some days are better than others. Today is not one of those days. It gives me some comfort to be part of this community where others understand where I’m coming from but reading some of the other posts on here just breaks my heart. So, to help myself and hopefully some of you as well, I want to start a thread where we can share tips of how we deal with loneliness. I’m sharing some of mine here:

-listening to mental health podcasts (or any podcasts) to help my anxiety
-journaling
-keeping my day busy with work/chores
-assigning myself 30 mins everyday to dwell on anxiety/loneliness and then forcing myself to forget about it till the next day
-giving myself therapy through videos (talking to myself and recording a video)
-accessing virtual therapy resources
-reading (anything and everything)
-keeping a show/movie running in the background while I do chores or pretty much the whole day
-staying off social media (I know this sounds counterproductive but social media makes me feel more lonely than ever)
-doing something creative everyday (e.g painting, playing guitar, coding, cooking, photography etc...)
-working out
-taking a hot shower (sometimes 2-3 times a day)

I hope these tips help at least one of you, and I could really use some more tips myself so if you have any, please share. It will really help me out. Sending love and positive vibes to all of you out there!"

What makes it worse is that he says he's depressed but he's doing crystal MDMA every other week and I keep telling him to stop damaging his brain and that is isn't permissible (From Pakistan... yeah). He's also breaking lockdown to go his other druggie friends house (Blake) to get high.

22 male here. I hope y'all doing great today. I'm sure some of you use/used Tinder and these who doesn't, know at least what it is. Let me share my story to you because I'm starting to think there might be something wrong with me.

I've been using Tinder for about 3 years, so yeah you could guess I have some experience but the truth is that I don't. Even though I get a decent amount of matches (like maybe 5-10 weekly), I simply don't get to go on dates. Women usually ignore my messages or reply in a way that make it impossible to keep the conversation going. I only got 2 dates via Tinder so far. One ended after an hour and I've never seen her again and second lead to unsatisfactory FWB (not that there was something wrong with her, I just didn't feel comfortable in such relationship). I've heard that some people use Tinder to boost their ego but that would mean that 95% of my matches are self-absorbed assh\*les. I refuse to believe that they really are so I guess there must be something wrong with me? I always try to start a conversation with something interesting and to somehow refer to her bio. Also I don't have too much expectations when it comes to physical appearance. Too be fair, I never did - if we vibe, we vibe. I would consider myself fairly interesting person with many hobbies and a good partner but I've never had much luck with love. Global pandemic didn't exactly help as well. So what's your take? Do you think there's still chance for me on Tinder? Also if you ever got into serious relationship with someone that you met on Tinder, please share your stories!

Cheers!"

with this being said, the one thing that i have found to help: slowed and reverb songs. i'm not sure why, but they make me feel a little less lonely. so, if you are like me and you have been crying more than ever, feeling unlovable, and can't get rid of the lonely feeling - try listening to slowed and reverb songs. :)"

Its been a little tougher with the quarantine, but we still chat from time to time. I still can't shake off this weird melancholic feeling that seems to surround me all the time. I still feel like there is an emptiness inside that is always there. I wish there was some way to make it go away.

I can't say I know for sure why exactly I am writing this. My situation isn't as dire as some of yours, and I feel a bit guilty even writing this. I guess it just goes to show that loneliness can hit anyone. Feel free to reach out to me if you need someone to talk to."

lonely,Didn't realize how bad lonely felt,"Didn't realize how bad lonely felt - I used to be something of a people pleaser, and because of that, I always had people to be around + covid didn't exist, so I could hang with my friends. I had a pretty active online life too. I've always thought that people who were lonely exaggerated how uncomfortable it was, and as soon as quarantine hit I took that opportunity to shut down and completely close off from some of my friends (I kept in touch with one). I was so confident that I could be independant and totally fine, since I had my family around me. Newsflash, I can't. It's not as easy as I thought it would be. I don't feel close to anyone and I don't have anyone to talk to. Though this pandemic has given me a well-needed break and helped me figure out myself more, it's harming me.

I've taken to social media and joined a lot of online communities but I feel like I'm drifting away from myself every single day. I'm acting in ways I would never have guessed I'd ever act in. I'm saying and doing things I'll regret in an hour. Accidentally developing addictions to the thrill of positive re-enforcement on Twitter and then dropping low when I receiving negative feedback and I just? It shouldn't bother me and I'm totally aware of it, but I still can't move to do anything about it. I just feel disgusting and disgusted and tired. I'm a lot more social than I think I am, and I'm desperate to prove to myself I don't need anybody. I don't know? I could definitely get closer with people but I don't know what's stopping me. When I do choose to, though, I get too emotionally attached and the second I feel that they're annoyed with me I immediately withdraw and distance myself out of fear. Feeling alone is so uncomfortable and I just want this feeling to be over."

I shouldn't have told him that.  He only works 10 minutes away and him telling me that was out of the way pissed me off. I asked my brother to borrow $10 and he called my friend and told him off. I got my stuff back but he deleted my brother on Facebook, I told him what he did was wrong but he just ignored it. I'm thinking about ending my friendship with him.This just sucks, he is just about my only friend and he takes advantage of me and on top of this I'm still getting over a break up where she cheated on me and treated me like shit and it was my first relationship in 5 years.

lonely,they all leave.,"they all leave. - this is a lyric in a song called Mansion by NF that sticks with me. 

So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
I built the safe room and I don't let no one in there
'Cause if I do, there's a chance
That they might disappear and not come back
And I admit I am emotionally scared to let anyone inside
So I just leave my doors locked
You might get other doors to open up but this door's not
'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me

🤭that. dude it’s so scary letting anyone in because when they leave I’ll be the only one I can blame . it’s better to leave them and distant myself before they can leave me. 

anyway I love you all and if you ever need a friend you can dm me , you guys got this :D ."

While the solution for that problem itself is a topic for another sub lately I've been questioning myself as to why I even bother to spend so much time and effort because of FOMO when I'm too scared to even interact with other players in said game.

After 15 months passed, I realized that I was no longer waiting because I didn't actually have any friends. Being preoccupied by school definitely helped, but The Loneliness crept in ever so slowly until surely, one day, I acknowledged its existence. That satisfied its need for speed, so it rested in the same spot for a while until growing impatient by my constant inattentiveness. Being that The Loneliness is not only the personification of a feeling but a feeling that belongs to me, it’s only fair that The Loneliness do just as I would do and not bother giving me three chances to change, like that of a typical interaction between two, with one awarding chances to the other for whatever reason. No, it wouldn’t be fair to go easy on me as though The Loneliness conjured itself into existence, apart from my influence, void not of both the tangible extremities of the body and intangible extremities of human thought - emotion - for it is, obviously, The Loneliness - that intangible emotion personified, tangible, clearly, that possess the power to self-conjure a mind and body of its own without the slightest need for my ignorance in order to creep where it creeps. Now, no longer a predator ever so slowly but surely stalking its prey, The Loneliness has become increasingly overt, making it a daily point to have me remind myself that it exists, as well as to practice feeling all the different ways The Loneliness likes to be felt."

The only new people I have met in that timeframe are people whom I've met for exclusively sexual encounters, usually limited to one or two meetings before moving on.

I have not been able to aproach another human in a way that is not trying to achieve sex. I don't know how to make friends anymore.

Everyone in the industry I work in is about twice my age or older, I'm graduating trade school this year and there are less 20 people in my class, from across half the country. I have no place to meet people anymore. I'm out of school, I don't have any clubs I go to, am I just supposed to die alone after wageslaving for 70 years?"
lonely,Would it be ok to not have any friends?,"Would it be ok to not have any friends? - I keep thinking that I would solve my loneliness if I reached out more and had more friends. I have a few that I see occasionally but I've realized that I start feeling extremely inadequate and desperate when I start talking to them, I worry about them not having a good time with me or almost that I'm ""trapping"" them in the friendship. It's been like this with most of the friendships I've had in the past, they just don't feel comfortable. And since it's like that with the majority of my friendships, the issue is me and my insecurities. I think I would still be okay if the friends I have now left though. I'm more comfortable when I don't think about friendship and when I'm alone... I think maybe it can be okay. Because as long as you speak to someone once in a while you're having your social needs pretty much met, especially if you're a person who doesn't have a lot of social need. I live with my parents and they're pretty supportive, so I'm thinking maybe things are better than I thought?"

lonely,They left me alone,"They left me alone -     First of all please excuse any mistake in my text, English is not my native language. Besides, I have to warn you that this post is quite long but I really felt the need to tell the entire story and express all of my feelings. With this being said, here is my story:



    This year is my first at the university and hopefully for me, at the beginning of the year I got the opportunity to get a great group of friends. First it was great and all: we were seeing each other very often, had small parties (yeah it was authorized in my country and we were careful with not too many guests so don’t worry guys haha), every Friday we were having a movie night and we were regularly going somewhere together like for example to the lake to swim. To be honest I was living in a dream: it was the first time in my life that I had such close friends. Not that I was a loner in high school, but I was spending time with my “friends” only at school and never outside of it. And of course, I was never invited to any parties. So yeah, I was so happy with my life and thought that this year at uni was going to be wonderful. 

    However, with time passing by I began to feel more and more isolated, I can't really describe it. Not that they were doing things without me (they always invited me everywhere, as I said we were a really close group), but when we were gathering I felt like I was left aside, as if I was in the background and nobody was paying attention to me. I know that I'm not very talkative nor very funny, and the fact that I am the only introverted guy while everybody else is extroverted did not help, but still... I guess that if I feel safe and listened to I can talk pretty much, but sometimes I would begin my sentence and see that nobody is listening to me, so I would simply stop myself in the middle of my sentence and never speak again the whole evening, it's not like they were even asking me anything. Sometimes I would simply leave them saying a phony excuse because I can't take anymore, come back home, and cry. I get that the other guys are way more funny and talkative than me, so it's way better to listen to them, but if we were friends they would at least try to involve me a little bit more, no? Personally, I know that I always try to make everybody feel safe and beloved, but why am I the only one like that? In fact, I was feeling more lonely when I was with them than when I was indeed alone. 

    So one day (it was in November), when I was feeling worst than ever before because of another disastrous (only for me haha) evening that I spent with them, I simply decided that I didn't want to see them anymore and started to ignore our group chat. At the moment I didn't see it as a permanent thing, I simply wanted to take my distances a little bit and think about the situation, and I guess that maybe inside of me I secretly hoped that somebody would get in touch with me and try to comfort me, talk and say that I am worth something. But the time went by and believe it or not nothing happened. And when I say nothing I really mean nothing. Like I didn't even get a message asking me why I disappeared, or any other message lol. I repeat it, we were really close, always spending time together, and to this day I still can't understand how they could forget about me so quickly. So as you can guess, what I thought would be a 1-2 weeks thing absolutely didn't change and I haven't spoken with them ever since. In fact, I've met some of them in the streets quite a long time after that, we only had small talks but nothing interesting. 

    One of the guys of this group, who I considered as one of my best friends (even though I'm pretty sure it was never reciprocal and he always considered me only as a good friend I guess), wasn't in the city when all of this happened and even if we talked sometimes by text I never mentioned to him what happened. Only when he came back some months later, we met and one thing he said to me was that he was told (only when he came back) that the other people from our group indeed noticed that I was more and more distant with time and that they never understood why I suddenly stopped talking with them. Even though this information does not bring a lot to the story I still decided to include it in the post since I thought that you guys might want to know the point of view from the other side, even if it's not a lot.

    Now I don't have anything in common with them anymore and I highly doubt that we will be friends again one day. I tried to turn the page on this friendship and somehow I succeeded more or less. But two days ago, before going to sleep I saw that I had received a notification from our old group chat (it was dead for a long time now, I guess that they had created another one without me). It was a video and when I watched it, it was them having a party: they were obviously having a great time, fooling and laughing. And below the video it was written that I had been banned from the group. Even if there is nothing to be surprised about it just made me feel so bad... I immediately started crying and couldn't sleep the whole night. The next day I was simply depressed as fuck and spent my time eating junk food and watching movies (I watched the movies from Wes Anderson, tbh if you're feeling down I really recommend them, they will make you feel so much better). In the evening I decided to write this post in the hopes that it would make me feel better, but I was able to finish only today and as I'm writing those lines I can definitely say that this writing eased my heart. 

    I know that the title says that they left me when technically it's me who left them, but that's not what I'm feeling. I feel more as if they were slowly rejecting me and that the fact I left them was only an inevitable event which is part of the process of them leaving me (do you get me?). Even if I know that I made the right choice by leaving them because this relation was obviously toxic and constantly making me feel bad, I still wonder sometimes why this happened. Am I the problem? Is it only people with good social skills who have the right to an honest and close friendship that can persist through time? I have other friends, that's not the problem (even if I'm definitely not as close with any of them as I was with my initial group). What I'm desperately looking for are people with whom I will be truly emotionally close and able to open my heart. Will I be ever able to find such people? I really hope so but with the days going by I'm losing more and more my optimism and beginning to slowly accept my fate, in which in the end I always end up alone.



    If you read up to this point I'm really thankful to you for this! I know it was a long story but I had to say all of that, and the fact that you actually listened to me makes me feel so much better. So thank you kind stranger!

    Since I know how it is to feel alone, anyone who feels the need to talk can freely send me a message in private, I will be glad to answer you (don't get mad if it takes some time but I promise that I will answer). For info, I am an 18 years old guy.

    So anyway, I wish you a good day and take care of yourself!"

lonely,I’m worthless and all I ever wanted was to just be loved but I don’t think anyone’s actually going to even read this.,"I’m worthless and all I ever wanted was to just be loved but I don’t think anyone’s actually going to even read this. - I’m fat. I’m ugly. I’m annoying. I’m everything that no one wants but I tried to put myself out there again just to see. I figured the right person would accept me as I am but I don’t think that right person is out there. I tried. Really tried to put myself out there besides my insecurities and I met someone I honestly really liked. We are so similar and talking to them is so easy but then the messages stopped coming and each reply would take longer and longer and longer. I understand he’s busy with his career and his life in general but if he wanted to really talk to me then he would. I mean I have a really busy life too. I’m the same way. I message back as soon as I can because I really like him and I just like talking to him. He seemed nice (like most guys do at first) but I’ve always had a really good ability to read people. How they talk, type, etc and he definitely started to change. And once I start to get that feeling. The feeling that I know what they felt has changed or that something has changed, I have ALWAYS been right. You always think that next person may be THE person but it’s just not gonna happen for me. He rarely answers now and I don’t even message him that often. Specifically because he just doesn’t open the messages but he posts on other things. I know I’m about to get ghosted. I can honestly probably go ahead and say that I have been ghosted. I can truly feel it and maybe me talking about it is manifesting it but I wouldn’t want to be with me either so I don’t really blame him. I’m just the problem. I’ve been ghosted so many times now with the majority of them happening in the last year to a year and a half that you’d think I’d be used to it by now and in a way, I am. But I thought this guy was different. He accepted me as me (or I thought he did at least) and I haven’t had that happen to me in a long time if not ever. My gut feeling is so strong, and it’s usually right 97% of the time. Unfortunately for me those gut feelings are usually negative. I know he’s ghosting me. I just know it and it hurts. I haven’t known him for a very long time and we weren’t/aren’t actually dating but that was the goal for me. Now I know that that’s not going to be the case. He’s going to drop me just like everyone else. I felt prepared for that to happen before we even started talking more and yet I still managed to catch feelings. I have too big of a heart and all it does is hurt me. It’s my fatal flaw I guess you could say. I just want these feelings to go away. I don’t want to have them 24/7. I hate being heartbroken. I rather be physically broken (which I am as well). I’m just so mad at myself for getting my hopes up again, even though I promised myself that I would guard my heart. I know I should think positive but my gut is rarely ever wrong. I just get to add this to the list of times I wasn’t good enough for someone. They always leave. Always. I truly thought I deserved to be loved but once you get ghosted as many times in a row that I have, you know there is something wrong with you. I wish I just didn’t exist. I was probably a waste of his time anyway. He was way out of my league so thinking I might even have a chance was my first mistake. I’m just so so tired. Just so mentally exhausted. If you read this, thank you. At least I was able to talk to someone in a way. I wish every single one of you can find a way to get through your loneliness. Have a great day today. Whoever you are, you deserve to be happy and you deserve to be loved."

lonely,I have literally never had a friendship at 14,"I have literally never had a friendship at 14 - I’m  and I’ve never had a single fucking friend in my life and there’s really no way to get one. I’m an introvert (obviously), Covid exists, and nobody really texts me. Now I hate when people say “oh just be yourself” because I’m starting to feel like being myself is the reason I don’t have friends. I wake up every weekday, do the e-learning which just leads to e-loneliness, and then just do nothing until I do it again the next day. I’ve tried joining discord servers to maybe get some online friends too, but I just get ignored because everyone is already having a conversation when I show up. Every single day is the same shit over and over again, just do nothing until I sleep because there’s nobody to do anything with, not even text.



Thanks for reading my lame vent, I know I don’t have it too bad compared to lots of people here, I’m 14 so I’m not gonna act like I’ve completely lost hope, I just don’t see anything changing."

But I have no one to celebrate my birthday with next week. I was thinking of taking a solo day trip but I’m scared I’ll get super depressed alone. I’m not even sure if anyone will remember to say happy birthday next week. I keep my info private on social media so no ones going to get a Facebook reminder."

Ever since my last relationship ended it's just non stop lonlieness and abandonment that follows me around. I've been shot down by every girl I've asked out in the past 3 years.

lonely,Quarantine made me realize how I didn't have any friends,"Quarantine made me realize how I didn't have any friends - I will start of by saying English isn't my native language, apologize for any mistakes. 

As the title says, before quarantine, I was pretty unhappy with my life, although I still manage to fit into some niche social groups at school, and had a few friends (which I've have had for years, and was quite unhappy with their friendships, because I realized it pretty much wasn't mutual). 

I think the worst part is that those friendships had existed for years, I guess during puberty we just started liking different stuff... idk, it truly just feels sad.

Take to 2020 and quarantine, quarantine starts, and after 4-5 months of it, I have textbook depression, it all just made realized that my friends, just didn't want to talk to me. I've lost contact with pretty much all of them, none of them send my any messages, nothing, friendships I had for years. I already knew I wasn't a very important person for all of them, they always kinda treated me like shit, answering my attempts and starting conversations in very direct and very often ignorant ways, but quarantine made me realize I was just a burden for them, and that in the first chance of them abandoning me and never talking to me again, they would. (One of them even blocked me, lol, I hadn't spoke a word to her since quarantine had started)

I've begun to enjoy old hobbies I had and got out of the slight depression I had, but I can't help but look for my bleak, hollow, friendless and lonely feature, and I just imagine I will honestly die alone at this point.

I can't socialize for shit also, I definetely socialize better in person than online, but even in-person I'm not exatcly good at it, and in the fact I mostly likely have Aspergers and sucks to be me, I guess..."

Might be the area in, might be me, we had a great time but it's always the same just a different way of saying ""you're not my type"". I should be happy that life is amazing right now but yeah. I don't really want advice I don't even know why I'm making this post but it destroys me putting myself out there and knowing from experience time and time again and wanting to change that. I have spare time on my hands, I have disposable income etc etc etc etc but everyday be the same, finish work, pool beers and just sit around watching YouTube clips of comedy's or going for drives. Here's my vent too: even the chicks I have actually landed have been dumb as fuck or just nutty. I don't even have high expectations 🤷

The only reason why I'm trying to put myself out there is to combat lonelyness but also I think im a catch 😂, very high self esteem lately just because everything's great and I'm happy with just improving myself."

I hate the distance and the loneliness and the affection, I miss being in her arms so bad. I’d give anything for just a hug. Being patient is so fucking hard, and I can’t help feeling hopeless and worthless and worried she won’t come back. Obviously she would want to talk to her friends more and do things with them instead now and not me but it hurts so badly. When she sends a selfie with her pet I can’t help but cry, because I’m reminded how much I miss her kind and beautiful self. trying to focus on other stuff can only do so much. Trying to ignore how much pain I’m in because honestly I don’t think I have a right to it, she’s going through so much shit right now and I feel so selfish for wanting her back so badly and hurting so much over this."

im just going to put this post out there... maybe I will get some luck and find someone...

A bit about me:
I am a 19 year old girl. My mom was always the best human friend to me. Most of my life I just wandered around in loneliness and silence, sometimes I’ve been bullied too, people dont seem to like me much...
I did get some luck last year - I found a girlfriend. She was literally the best person besides my mom in my life. I was so fucking happy to have her - we talked for months every single day. We only met once in real life and I had to go abroad (from Lithuania to Germany) to make some money. This didnt bother us, we chatted everyday and talked on the phone. But a few days ago THAT day came. We split up... its day 5 without her, I feel my heart healing slowly but I still cry about it. What doesnt help is that I have to live with toxic people here (check my other posts about them). Thank god I have only one month left tho and Iam going to go back to Lithuania, because I cant psychologicaly handle much now...
So heres that...
I hope to find someone here. Just to chat, share our struggles, wins.
So If you want, hit me up."

I just don’t feel I can trust anyone after being hurt so many times by people I loved. I don’t have the strength to believe in others or myself anymore."
lonely,Half my life without my parents...,"Half my life without my parents... - I went and saw my parents grave for the first time since I buried my mom, growing up is very foggy for me for some reason and if it werent for photos and videos then i wouldnt have any memory of my younger self except for my 2 or 3 memories. But anyways my dad died when I was 6 and my mom died when i was 10 or 11, again foggy, and im only saying this because for one no one knows who i am and 2 it just hit me that ive lived over half my life without my parents."
lonely,What's the point,"What's the point - That is what I think occasionally. What's the point of carrying on when you have nothing. I have no real friends, I always am obsessed with one interest that I have, and rarely anyone wants to talk with me.

I'm currently in high school, and the past couple of years have been some of the worst years of my life so far. I have virtually given up on having any resemblance of a social life

It's hard having Asperger's.

I just feel lost."

I don't wanna go on anymore. this hurts more than normal, like it's crushing my insides.

I just feel generally burnt out on life , disappointed in many people and just overall feel like there is not much exciting. I do enjoy watching movies, video games, and engaging with my outdoor hobby but it doesn’t feel the same now. The true excitement has faded away, I feel like the more you so something , the more you chip away at the desire to do it.

What I wish for: I would love to go jetskiing, engage in crazy water sports, smoke a cigar at a yacht, be on a very fast boat. Just do extremely fun activities but the problem is is that I don’t know anyone who would be willing to truly have fun with me. I would love to go jetskiing at least once a week maybe go jumping off the boat in the middle of the sea .

lonely,"I ended damaging the girl I love, and cutting his bonds with my friend group just because I needed to cut our bond","I ended damaging the girl I love, and cutting his bonds with my friend group just because I needed to cut our bond - Hi few redditors, i need to vent here something, is about the girl i make post about before, if you dont want to go to see that posts i will give you a fast resumen, I fall for my friend, she was the most wonderful and special girl knew in all my life, she helped me to overcome some hard experiences in my life,I said about my love to her, she reject me, and tell ""your love is too heavy"" and since then our relationship and my mental healt goes down.

Since then i have been thinking how overcome this in a form were the pain was minimal by me but specialy minimal to her, since then i been crying all nights wondering how not to lose her, i talked that with my friends and search for help, but at the end i only could get the resolution that being honest was the only exit that will minimize our pain, between that we still talking but i was getting anxious attacks in every interaction with her, and she turns somehow different with some actions that make me knew that our lifestyle was incompatible, and i believed i don't matter at all to her.

Today i decide to be honest to her, she in fact knew i dont wanted to talk to her any longer, and if you don't realize that at this point i will say it, I love her, I love her so badly, I really wanted to have a life at his side, she was my litle witch, and i really wanted to be whit her the rest of my life, the year by his side was the most wonderful year i had in my whole life, and i knew this would be hard but i wasn't expecting this to be so hard,i start to talking, and she said she deserve my distance becuse she break my heart, and i would love it was so simple, i tell her my reasons, my mental healt, my sensation i don't matter to her and about the diferences in hour life, finally i tell her that i can't still being is friend, and she starts to cry, she starts to tell she doesn't mater to me, so i decide to tell her how muhc i love her, at he end somehow she said she was a bad person and that understand my decision, i think that even if it was hard at the end she understand my points to do that and tha there are a oportunity of being friends in the long future, i tell her to please care herself, and taht i want her, and she said somethng similar but also she encourages me, we finally say gooodbye, and end this was the most painful thing i hae done in a very long time.

I thing i will never forget is cry, i dont understand why she was crying, i dont want her to cry, i love her smile, i don't want to hurt her, and i done this too because i would hurt her eventualy, I will miss her so much, I hate myself becuse i hurt someone i love.

She not only block me,thing that was good, but she blocked our mutual friends, i cant know if she is well, I have fear of she taking any extremal decision, i think she is smart enought to don't do anything dumb, but i have fear, i dont want to her lose her others friends, i just want our pain to stop

Sorry for my stupid english but im crying and is not my mother language"
lonely,I try to use sexual gratification to fill this hole inside of me,"I try to use sexual gratification to fill this hole inside of me - I'm a mess and so Im just going to say that from the beginning. if I offend anyone then I'm sorry. 

I'm lonely. Like deeply fucking lonely. When I was younger (early 20's) I would sometimes go online and talk to women online and get to know them, then as we got to know each other things would turn sexual. I have lots of hangups about sex and it was empowering to be able to openly talk with someone about sex, to share porn , and chat while masturbating with them. 

As time went on that got harder to find and understandably so. They were not healthy friendships in all likelyhood but we were both lonely and enjoyed it. 

I feel empty inside. I miss having someone to talk to like that despite knowing it probably wasn't healthy. I miss hearing a womans voice talk to me and I miss getting to know someone. Getting to know what she was going through and being there for her when times were tought. I miss having someone I could talk to when times were tough. 

now I just feel broken and empty."

I was also given an abusive father and mother, I have no idea how to play the hand I was given. I feel as tho I have a high Iq that pushes me out of the average, yet my disabilities some time make me feel I am on the other end. I don't talk much in conversations because I just don't care about sport, politics or celebrity drama but just listen, that's all I feel I have done is listen to the world. I guess I have found peace in myself, I could be the homeless man set adrift or the 9-5 andy. I just feel like I am a blade of grass in a pasture only able to cast my thoughts and feeling into the air. Money would be nice to have and is so easy to get yet no matter what you buy it doesn't fill the void. I have lived with pain all my life yet afraid to voice it to others. I don't want to take them off track or burden them with more problems to fix.

I don’t think she feels the same towards me though. Now we’re drifting apart. I tried to make up my lack of interaction by finding online friends. I got myself into a pretty sick circle and learned to grow interesting relationships with online personas, but I can’t help but think that once they leave their computers, they go about their normal lives interacting with more significant friends. I know it sounds envious, but it’s because I can’t help but think that I’m just an internet stranger to them... meanwhile I’ve been so desperate that I perceive these people as my closest friends. I feel like a loser because something as casual as voice chats give me so much joy. And then I get anxious when there’s little online activity. I feel like the relationships I have and value are just easily disposable on the other’s end. I don’t know what will happen if it all falls apart."

I always wonder why it hasn’t happened to me. I try to be social and friendly to everyone I meet and try my hardest to not get into disagreements with anyone.

Despite that, most of the friends that I have made just drift away with no way for me to get them back. It’s sad when they do, but I try to get used to it. I am blessed to have a family but I still feel this void in my heart. That I have been left out for whatever reason and don’t know why. 

I wish that I get into a relationship soon before it is too late for me."

lonely,Realization after being single for years,"Realization after being single for years - After living most my life single 30’s M with very few relationships I have come to rely on myself for everything. I realized the other day that in a relationship there are so many shared responsibilities where you can rely on someone else to do even simple things like grab groceries, cook, laundry, etc. Since I have always done things myself I realized I wouldn’t even know how to step back and allow myself to rely on another person meeting those simple necessities. I would need to relearn how I do a lot of things in my life if I were in a relationship because I have had so much control over how and when I do things. To have someone else be able to do those things reliably seems unfathomable to me. I’ve always wanted to feel valued so I continually learn new things to become more “marketable” to my next crush. I am starting to see that this maybe be counter intuitive because it is pushing me farther away from accepting a new relationship and more sheltered on continually relying on myself. I suppose I have been lonely for too long and it would be odd to invite someone like that into my life to meet those needs."

While I think that's somewhat true I know having a lover would drastically help solve my loneliness. I need someone who will be there by my side who supports and loves me. I crave intimacy and affection.  Someone who genuinely cares and wants to know what I'm thinking. There's some saying that we all need touch and I definitely feel deprived of it. Not even wanting sex but somebody who I can hold and feel safe around.Otherwise I feel pretty worthless. Physical and emotional intimacy is something we all need.

She’s not gonna be able to walk soon and I honestly don’t know what my parents are going to do, I’m trying my best to be strong and help but my mom sometimes can just be unbearable. She gets upset and I don’t know how to help her. My friends have been really flakey lately, my best friend got a boyfriend last year and ever since than I’ve just felt like I’m not important to her at all. I hate myself for that because I am happy for her, her boyfriend is really sweet and nice and I like him and he makes her happy. I feel selfish I mean it’s not her fault that I can’t find a boy to date. Most of my friends have boyfriends or girlfriends now and i feel left out. I’ve never even held hands with a guy romantically lol. I’ve been dealing with so much bs with my mental health. I got on meds, I’ve been going to therapy, but no one in my life has even bothered to ask if I’m okay. I kinda wondered if I just disappeared if they would notice. I just wonder if I will ever find happiness. I really long for just a hug. I used to get by by burying myself in fictional worlds or fictional characters, but now it doesn’t help. I’m tired of imagining scenarios where im loved and appreciated. I want more."

I can easily talk to girls in a friendly way, that’s not the problem, the problem is I don’t know how to make a move in the right direction, ya know? And now it’s even worse because I feel hella insecure about not knowing how to kiss or like cuddle the right way and things like that so I become even more discouraged to talk to someone.
All I’ve ever wanted is to love someone and to have someone to hold. I feel so starved of attention and touch especially since quarantine began. Everyday I wake up feeling so empty and the days just drag by. I don’t have any thoughts about self harm cause I feel confident I’ll find someone one day but I’m sick of waiting.
I don’t know. Maybe I’m the problem and I just gotta stop feeling sorry for myself and just put myself out there but I’m so scared of the unknown."
lonely,"I only have one friend, and it’s 100% my fault.","I only have one friend, and it’s 100% my fault. - For as long as I can remember, I have always been socially awkward when talking to people outside my immediate family. I always tense up, not talking to people unless they talk to me first. Even if we are already established friends, I can never seem to talk to them like a normal human. I used to have a few friends in the past, all of which have made the initial move in trying to get to know me. It almost feels like they only did that out of pity, since I obviously had no friends other than them. Now though, all of them have either given up with me, moved on, or changed schools. My one and only friend that I have right now is the ONLY person I’ve ever met that likes the same things I do, which is probably one of the only reasons he still talks to me. I’m still awkward with him, despite us exclusively talking online (and knowing each other for 3 years). He always messages me first, which I always feel bad about. When I attempt to start the conversation, I never think of anything interesting enough to talk about, so our conversations usually only last a couple messages."
lonely,Birthday,"Birthday - Im kinda sad, i turn 26 years old this saturday. Me and my fiancé was gonna celebrate by having a party with a few People. 

We first tried to invite my friends but all of them was busy or too tired. Then we tried my fiancé's friends, a few of them could come but they didnt want to drink. Its sad becuse me and my girl really qanted to let down the hair for once.

lonely,There is no point in trying any more,"There is no point in trying any more - I have 2 months of college left. People are out here partying and enjoying and hanging out with each other. I am all alone. I have no one, literally no one. No one asks me for these parties. No one wants to hangout with me. Everyone hates me. Recently I have been asking myself frequently would anyone even care if I died. If I just disappeared, no one would even notice. And the sad part is that when I joined college, I was so hopeful that I will find some friends. I tried so much to be friends with people. But they just ghosted me after a few days. I suck at everything. I am boring. I used to hangout with 2 girls but they just turned out to be using me when they did not have any one else. So I am like a backup. The last option. Just because they don't want to appear all alone in some events, they act all sweet and call me up. I hate myself. I am a pathetic person. It pains me everyday when I see people having so much fun or atleast someone to talk to and I am just sitting here all alone. I don't see any point in trying to mak3 friends any more."

lonely,Leaving School the same way I entered it,"Leaving School the same way I entered it - Currently a college student.  I entered it completely alone and unsure of myself, went through many experiences, and will be leaving the same way I entered it. Multiple friend groups all left me in the dust, thrown out like trash. I entered university feeling like an imposter and even let people I looked up to know that I felt like an imposter. Everyone let me know it's all in my head. Corona took over my life as of last year and nobody is there for me, Nobody checks in on me. People have actively removed me from their lives. This has shown me that I truly was an imposter. I can barely even participate in my classes now and am purposely delaying graduation to figure myself out, maybe get an internship or research experience except my illness has prevented me from doing so (maybe im making excuses? Or maybe im just actually incompetent

Every day that i sit in front of my computer is a daily reminder that I have nowhere to go or anyone to turn to. This has been my life for an entire year almost and it will continue to be this way for days to come even after university. Id also like to go to grad school too but have zero chance due to no research experience and nobody to voice for me in letters of recs, all of which is my fault because I was too focused on other people than my own development. I don't think i can trust anyone ever again."

lonely,"For the first time, I feel so lonely and isolated","For the first time, I feel so lonely and isolated - I feel this is more of an existential thought since I am currently in the process of reassessing things in my life and it’s the first time ever that I realized that I’m actually lonely.

I’m usually an optimistic person - generally happy and chill. I’ve learned to take setbacks and defeats as lessons more than punishments. I’ve accomplished a lot of the goals I set in life so far with some being beyond my expectations. I thought I’m doing great in life - living solo and away from my parents and siblings, earning enough that I don’t have to worry about being homeless and hungry, and getting to do whatever I want, that is, until I realized that I actually dont have friends and even the ones I’m trying to date don’t seem too interested in me.

I’m an immigrant coming here to the US at the age of 19 and it’s obvious enough that there aren’t many friends I can make outside of work. I’m almost 27 now and I realized the ones I usually play with or chat with are none of my friends but friends of someone else. I’m just an outsider brought in. Outside of their group, I’m pretty much alone. It’s really putting me in a sad mood which I don’t usually know how to handle.

Aside friends, the person I’m trying to date where I put a lot of effort in doesn’t seem interested in me and I’m too scared to not pursue them anymore since it would eventually lead to a falling out of sorts making me more isolated.

All that said, I still try to do my best but it feels like an uphill climb. I just want to be with someone and be surrounded by people that are interested in me as much as I am interested in them. This Friday I’m going to confront the person I’m dating and see if he’s actually interested in me or just giving me false hope.

Excuse me for my ideas being scrambled as they are. I just want to put everything in my mind out there since I have no other outlets. I think I’m slipping into depression which I hope is not the case."

Classic strong dude, wide shoulders, a hit with the girls, not dumb but not smart, smokes etc. a real tuff guy.

The funny guy, also strong, a bit chubby but that buff type ya know, hes also not dumb but not smart, has a tendency to not care about getting too fucked when we do drugs. Depressed and cuts himself.

The fucking annoying tall chubby, not strong, know it all that can't take being wrong about something, thinks he knows everything about drugs and thinks meth and heroine is a good idea.

A small midget boy, not really significant, he's a bit of a side character tbh.

Then me, tall, skinny af, considers myself reasonably smart and good looking, plays piano and bass, trades crypto currency, is called a narcissist and manipulative. 

............ 

The problem: strong guy was kicked outta school so we dont see him much, midget boy is not worth mentioning cuz he doesn't have that much influence, 

The annoying tall one craves the attention of the funny one and I think he has a vendetta or something against me because he got me to admit Im gay and an atheist (we are the only two atheists in our school) and I sort of rejected him when he tried making moves on me, stuff like grabbing my ass and joking about kissing me etc etc. 

I don't know why I typed this I kind of got lost in thought and cannot remember what I was going to end this with.

I am on a popular dating site, but nothing is happening.

My eye condition doesn't allow me to drive, but I do have my bicycle and an e-scooter, so I do have a good chunk of sight.

If any females would like to get to know me more, I would be happy to reply.

May I ask this community for any help or advice on the best/quickest way to make a potential new partner understand that yes I am classes a disabled person, but I do lead as normal life as I can. I don't winge about my eye sight but just get on with my professional career as a Personal Trainer.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated :-)"

lonely,Feeling heaviness inside my heart.,"Feeling heaviness inside my heart. - First of all, don't read beyond here if you don't have the mental capacity to. Please keep yourself as a priority and take care of yourself :)


Secondly, I just feel heaviness in my chest and this weird feeling in my stomach and a choked throat, I am just managing to not cry myself out. I really want to but the tears just don't come out.
I have a bad anxiety and I overthink a lot, but I don't know how to put this that I feel deprived of affection, if that makes sense? I feel like I'm not important and if I disappeared today, barely anyone would notice. I just want some care, love and support. I don't know if it's selfish to feel this, but I just feel sad. I'm just trying and hoping everyday to be happy but just everyday I feel the same and I don't know what to even do about it. I tried talking to my friends about it multiple times but they didn't understand me and I didn't get any support either. They started saying things like, ""what do you mean, we don't support you? We were there for you when XYZ happened."" and they keep bringing things like that which makes me feel guilty and I then feel like I'm being ungrateful... I don't know. I just need one hug, I don't know if it's too much to ask for but I just want to feel cared for. It sucks to be feeling this way, and it's been way too long now. To be honest, I've always wanted to vent my feelings out here but I was unsure about it but today I am not stopping myself. I'm just so tired of everything. I have issues going on within my family as well that I also tried talking out to my friends, but again I didn't get any empathetic reactions. The environment at home has gotten too overwhelming for me and its affecting my academics too, and if my only two friends act like that then it makes things even worse for me. I'm so tired of expressing my feelings and talking about them because no one seems to understand. My mental health has been quite shit for a year now and my sleep has been inconsistent since. I either sleep too less or too much, It's usually around 5-6 hours now. It's probably stupid to feel all this and forgive me if it is.
I just feel lonely and all I want is some care and love and I'm so tired of supporting everyone around me and giving away love, telling everyone that I'm there for them and then being there for them as well. I just wish someone could do that for me, someone who could tell me that they're with me and its going to be okay and they are listening and they understand how it feels like. I usually use sarcasm and humour as coping mechanisms and it works out fine for me, I make myself laugh and it just cheers me up a bit. Having inside jokes with myself is another level of comedy lmao. 

And I am so sorry for writing so much, and I don't know how to express my gratitude if you actually did read all that, it means a lot to me. Thank you so much."
lonely,People around me get in relationships so easily.,"People around me get in relationships so easily. - 23F here and no relationship experience. Friends around me are literally pooping out boyfriends. Once they break up with their bf, they get a new one within the next month or two. A friend of mine messaged me yesterday saying she got a new boyfriend after being single for a month. People make it seem so easy, and I’m always here wondering what is wrong with me. 

I went through high school thinking “I still have college where I’ll meet way more people and finally have guys interested in me or like me back.” Nothing. In my early years of college, I thought the same. Nothing. Now I’m graduated from college thinking..so what now? My friends are all either in serious relationships, engaged, or even married.

Honestly just close to giving up because people think it’s absurd that I haven’t had a boyfriend yet as a female, especially with society thinking women have it easy when it comes to getting in relationships or having guys interested in them."

No matter how hopeless your life might seem at this very moment it's pretty much always depression covering our eyes to the truth that things are not as bad as we think they are. Very often our problems are pretty easy to fix but depression makes it seem impossible. If you are in need of friends I recommend thinking deeply about what you like (hobbies interests). If there isn't anything pick up something new. You might never know that you like something until you try it. Then look for reddit/discord communities around that. It can be as simple as liking a tv show and joining the fan base. You are guaranteed to make friends that way. Have hope because things can get better. We just gotta try. Wishing you the best.

How does it feel to know that your opinion is there quotation on the price of paper that had been lying around for a while and last as well end up someone's ass because it sure isn't gonna be valued by anyone...

How does it feel when you realise that ideally your life should have ended before you were delivered or a condom should have been used when you were being conceived... Would have saved a lot of trouble to a lot of people that you showed your face to...

How does it feel to calculate every night all the people you would impact if you died instantly... And even though you try to add optimistically you end up counting just may be your pets...

My husband is my only friend. There isn’t “a friend” who has called me or texted me. I’ve never used well this cell phone that way. Just parents or the pharmacy. Or once I gave my phone number online and talked to a drunk stranger.

I have pretty terrible social anxiety and excuse myself/ghost/block everyone I come into contact with. Someone locally invited me to an online birthday thing with discord and games and I just... what? I don’t do those things. I just ignored it and pretended it didn’t exist. Life has mostly been about hiding from people.

(Pandemic ruining that too—there are no sitters where we are at) 

But I’m finding connection in these Youtube chats. Don’t have to worry about someone dating me. Same people show up. People are supportive. Idk I just feel the need for friendship that is not super judgey. The only people I’m around are my coworkers. Theyre super judgey and I often feel left out. My desk is on the other side of the room. Plus when I have a thought, someone always talks over me which is never an environment I’ve ever been in.

lonely,Just Some Stupid Thing I Thought Of.,"Just Some Stupid Thing I Thought Of. - Sometimes, when I see people online, I feel hopeful. I actually made a friend from just posting here a while ago, and the friend is one of the first I've had in a while, so I'm grateful for that.

Everyone on this sub is so kind and supportive, and they seem like decent people, and they've all been through their fair share of pain, which, I'm sorry to everyone. You don't deserve it. And I know, yeah, that's probably predictable, and you knew I would say that, but it's honestly true. 

Loneliness is such a terrible feeling. It's not only the emotional pain of knowing no-one is there to hold your hand and comfort you when you have anxiety, no-one is there to make you laugh, no-one is there to text you Good morning along with some stupid meme when you wake up, but it's the mental pain of believing you aren't good enough for people to like you or vice versa, and the physical pain of going along with the feeling that life feels hollow. No one deserves to feel that way, and once you see the extremes of loneliness some people face, you'll never un-feel it. 

Everyone deserves to have someone in their lives who loves them, and who physically and emotionally shows it. 

I just think some people don't care. They're too caught up in their own lives to care about the people in the corner, who they **notice** every day go to the bar alone, or study at the library alone, or they **notice** spends all day checking their text messages to see if anyone messaged them for anything, but they just couldn't bring themselves to care. Or maybe they don't see it. Maybe the loneliest people hide it well, and just smile, and then afterwards, go home and cry into their pillows. Idk. 

And yeah, I know this is a messed-up and rather confusing post, but...Yup. That's it. That's the stupid thing I thought of.

The person I love the most has hurt me so dearly to the point where I left him... I want him back so bad... But we both know it’s not gonna happen. Without him I feel so empty. I’m trying so hard to stay optimistic but the pain is almost unbearable. The heartache in my chest and stomach is SO real. It genuinely feels like I’m being punched in the gut over and over again. He was my best friend, my soul mate. I told him everything...

Now I don’t know what to do. I’ll see something funny, yet can’t send it to him... Or anybody for that matter. I have nobody Im comfortable with in life. Nobody I want to talk to. Nobody here to lend me a hand...

I just want true love, I thought I found it but it was nothing but an empty promise. I want someone to tell me they love me and mean it for once. I just want to love and be loved. I can’t even love myself..."

lonely,Looking for some advice I guess; is something wrong with me that I don't see?,"Looking for some advice I guess; is something wrong with me that I don't see? - I never post on reddit, but figured it'd be a good time to start. I unloaded a lot of what was on my mind between some close friends and I feel guilty for talking to them about it because not everyone is equipped to talk about things like this.

The majority of my friends have all been in relationships for a long time. I live in a house full of friends who are all in relationships. I'm one of the few people I know within our friend group who is still single, and I've been single for the past four years now.

I have been so bitter this year. The pandemic has caused half of my household to become either unemployed or to work from home. I still go to work on site at a job I am struggling to find meaning or passion in. I once used to enjoy what I do for work but now I just hate it every day. I'm burnt out. I also recently got turned down a high up position within a department at work who really wanted to hire me, but couldn't because I lack an educational degree. This job would have been absolutely life changing on all fronts and was within my fingertips, but was ripped away from me in an instant. So now it's either I go back to school, change careers, or continue working at a job I fucking hate going to every day.

I don't mean to sound like I'm going off on a tangent. It's just that... idk man I wish I just had a partner with me. Someone to talk to when life sucks. Someone to be there even when we don't feel like talking, like just lay down and maybe even cry with and fall asleep next to.

I'm 28M, and 5'2"", and it's hard for me to date people. It's hard to keep my chin up when people say ""there's someone out there for everyone"" or ""girls do like shorter guys, they're out there"" when the majority of guys I know don't have the height issue. 

I love my friends, and cherish the moments I spend with them. But I envy them in a sense that they have that partner to be there with them and support them.

I'm no saint; I've made a lot of mistakes in previous relationships and have worked tirelessly at identifying those faults and improving myself as a person. I've been in enough relationships in the past to know now what I would want for the both of us in one. I've distanced myself from any relationship seeking for a long time to work on myself. I've only recently started putting myself out there again because friends have been telling me I should consider it, but it hasn't been going very well. 

I've been wondering if there's any point anymore. In anything. Depression is creeping back to me, and I just had my possibly my last therapy session with a therapist I'd been seeing the past four years. I don't want to spiral down again. But I feel like there is something wrong with me that I just don't see.

You ever get so down emotionally that you start feeling physical pain in the palms of your hands? That's where I've been at these last few weeks.

TL;DR
I go to work at a job I hate and long for romantic love and support, all the while being envious and bitter at people in my life who don't have to work at all and have romantic love support."

lonely,Alone,"Alone - M/20 
I'm the youngest out of five and I've always felt alone, and that's usually how my life's been.in highschool I never just sat at one table but moved around thought I had friends but realized it was just because we had the same class but other than that no interaction out of school. My longest relationship has been 8 months, and I ended that relationship because i lost interest and ik it happens but I've ended any type of relationship unofficial or official the last several times in the past 3 years.
I'm an artist and I've suffered and have been suffocated by depression since I was 12 and constantly wonder if I'm just faking it to get pity from god only knows who at this point. I will admit I pushed away some people I knew I'm hs and got mad when I realized some people would rather just push me out of their lives than to talk to me about the way I joked at that time.
Now I try to watch my mouth, I used to be friendly now I think I'm just fake. I just want to be held"
lonely,Venting Off.,"Venting Off. - M29 here, 

I never had a girlfriend in my life, I don't know how it feels to be loved by someone and never had sex. 

all my friends, class mates are being married, engaged or in relationship. I'm the last unmarried person in family and amoung my 6 siblings. 

Funny thing is that my friends and family members ask me about my relationship/girlfriend. and I tell them currently I'm single, broke up with my gf few months ago. some of my friend and my sisters take relationship advice from me which is strange. 

I feel like I'll never find anyone in my life and I have started to accept that. When I feel low I listen to sad music but after few minutes I tell myself that ""dude, you don't even know what broken heart feels like"". 

I have anxiety/depression issue I don't tell anyone all these things coz I feel no one give a Fcuk about me. if I die today then it will not affect anyone's life at all. everyone will live as it is. I have lost both my parents early in my life. 

Please ignore my spelling or grammar mistake, my English is bad. open for corrections."
lonely,Pretending,"Pretending - Does any one else pretend they’re not as lonely as they really are? I don’t know if it helps with coping or what, but I’ve pretended all of my life that I’m not lonely although I actually am. I don’t know how to not feel so alone. I feel like a struggling ant that’s been thrown into an ocean. 

I’m terrified of letting on just how lonely I am to people who do talk to me. I guess I worry if I show that I’m lonely, it will run them away. They’ll think I’m being a downer. Or putting down their importance since they’re even talking to me. Just.. sometimes it would be nice to be held at night before bed in the arms of someone I trust. It would be nice to be liked and capable of believing it. A genuine connection. Even just a friend. Someone who understands. Someone I’m not afraid of. Someone I can be silent with. Or talk for hours with. Someone who sees that I’m only afraid. Someone who sees my flaws and is accepting of them. Someone who won’t leave at the first sign of trouble. Someone who will always have my back. Someone on my team. On the same road. We wouldn’t have to even live together for me to not feel lonely. But that connection- just having that would help me feel a lot less alone in this ocean. 

I’d like to stop pretending that I’m not lonely. I’m so lonely. And I feel pathetic for it."
lonely,I hate who I’ve made myself,"I hate who I’ve made myself - Ever since I (21M) was young I would watch hero cartoons and read books about people just as noble and holding to ideals. I’ve always tried to embody these things, living by doing what I know to be right, trying to help others when few else will, being kind and not causing harm. Well, I feel like I’ve done a pretty good job at becoming someone that upholds these virtues. My friends will tell me that I am a great friend and family will tell me how responsible and wise I seem to be with whatever I do. Ironically I loath myself so goddamned much. It pains myself, who I’ve made myself, to say that, but it is true.

What I didn’t realize when shaping myself to embody these “heroes” that I idolized my whole life was what I’d sacrifice to do so. The person I’ve become is stoic, clever, and essentially good. However I may have leaned a bit too far into that stoicism. My household has always had conflict and I had quite a bit of anger growing up. Ever since I’ve tamed my anger and other emotions though, I have had severe difficulties showing them, including the good. It doesn’t help that I’m an inherently quiet person as well.

This became my outward persona to many people. I didn’t show emotion, I was quiet, I was a good student that always obeyed rules and got good grades. But now I’m the embodiment of boring. It feels like I’m a true neutral. Sure people don’t dislike me, but at the same time I’m not really someone worth keeping around aside from being “good”.

I suppose that all this venting comes from the feeling that everybody ends up leaving in the end. My last year of high school was the best year I’ve lived and taking that to the low of college is brutal. By going to college (and the pandemic) I’ve essentially lost all of my friends due to them moving and getting girlfriends and boyfriends that take up all of their time (as well as the pandemic) and have been largely unable to make more friends at college due to the responsibility of keeping up on college and work. I’ve also gone through a couple small time relationships that always ended in the other party still really liking me but just “losing interest”. 

It feels like that’s all that ever happens. People lose interest in me. I’m too... neutral. And so of course I blame myself for it, hating myself for not being able to drink myself silly, get high off my ass, go to a party, do any other stupid things that people my age do.

I feel like I’ve wasted who I am by becoming exactly who I wanted to be."

Just no one I know personally enjoys any of my interests.(everyone is especially uncomfortable with the whole forensics thing)

 I used to at least have my brother as a play mate when playing Ark Survival but he doesn't want to play anymore and my mom is trying to show sympathy by pretending to pay attention while reading her books. My bf is tired of the whole ark thing I think too.

I do work but it's not the most amazing place to make real friends cause I mean it's work... I just wish I had someone to hang out with and talk to that's not on a screen halfway across the world. (I'm sorry if this post is a jumbled up mess I am just sad and tired.)"

And just giving up on trying to even find people at this point? - I thought by the time I got to this part of my life, I might find friends, finally. I understood why when I was younger, I didn’t had strong friendships. They were temporary, they were just friends with me because of same classes. But I just thought once I’m here in my stage of life where I thought I’d be surrounded by people to have similar goals as me, I’d find some people, someone. But I’m here making this. 

I’m not even frustrated about it anymore. I just feel so sad. I’m not evil. I’m not perfect. I make plans, I don’t flake. I’m not clingy. I listen. I talk. How many self-reflections do I have to go through? It just sucks."

No time with my family or friends. - I get up early to go to work. My job is stressful and difficult. I dont relate to anyone there and feel like I am an adult among children. I get home and get a half hour or so with my kids before they go to bed. My wife is working from home while watching our kids, so is very understandably exhausted and goes to bed soon after. We moved away from our friends and family for cheaper housing. I feel so alone. I was doing well going back to finally finish school but am so down and tired I can't get anything done. I love my wife and admire her more than anyone, so I want her to get the rest she needs but I miss her. And, any time I have on the weekends I devote to spending with my kids. So I have no time for myself when I actually have the energy to pursue my interests or to spend with just my amazing wife. I love my kids and treasure the time i spend with them but i wish I could have time for myself or with my wife, as well.

All in all, I just wish I had someone to talk to."

lonely,New Job Anxiety,"New Job Anxiety -   Back in December I started an overnight retail job at a nearby Target after being out of work since the middle of March. Covid killed my old job and forced me to move across country back with my parents. Anyways I was excited to finally get back to work in December and I enjoyed most of my co workers well enough. I started feeling comfortable around them pretty quick but only the few who I worked overnights with. They ended up letting me go at the end of the season but they recently called me back to work a new position during the day. 

  At first I figured it wouldn't feel too much different but the last few days I've been feeling incredibly anxious compared to before. I dont feel as comfortable with my new co workers even though most of them seem nice enough. I feel like I keep messing things up and have to babied even though I feel like I'm older than a lot of my co workers despite only being 24. And some of the people I've met have been really stand offish and kinda rude. I don't know if I'm just putting out a confrontational energy or if it's just my demeanor but theyre definitely friendlier to everyone else besides me. 

  I'm probably just overthinking it but I've just been so alone lately that I was hoping I could get to know some of these people a little better. Nothing would make me happier than if someone would just ask me about me and maybe take a minute to get to know me. I'm sure eventually it'll get better but right now I'm just feeling so stupid like I'm constantly in a state of just doing or being wrong. Anyways if you read all of that I appreciate it, I know it's not exactly original to have anxiety about a new job but it helps to just put it out there and vent."

I know that it might not be about me, but the common denominator is hard to ignore. Most of the time I don't know what I say or do to make them bail. Other times it's clear because it happens after I share a face or body shot. Recently had a guy who I had a great time with who bailed after I told him I hadn't been in a relationship ever at 30. Frustrating because I guarantee that I've done more work on myself to be a more stable and dependable partner than most people who have been in relationships.

Its always felt bad but ive always been able to make excuses for why they did it, they thought I couldn't afford it, they had limited spaces etc. 

I really felt like a part of my newest friend group, its been so long since I felt a part of anything it felt so amazing. Recently some of them started planning a road trip to visit a friend out of state, I was invited and was pretty excited by the idea, ive never been on a road trip before. Then about two weeks ago I was told the driver had thrown out the extra seats in the van and there was no longer room for me. If I wanted to join id have to buy return flights and travel on my own. That really sucked but I still considered it because I didn't want to be left out. 

In the between then I got pretty close with one of them, and they asked if I wanted to try dating. I havent dated in over a decade but I like this person and said yes with some nerves but a lot of excitement. 

Well, I found out today from a family member who saw on Facebook that they've all gone on the trip without me and are currently hanging together having a great time, and not one of them contacted me to let me know. I had plans with the one who asked to date that they will miss without even telling me so. They all just left without a word. 

I feel like I've been ignoring it for so long, but it really hurts to realise the people around me really just don't care about me the way I care about them."

I am a retro gamer, and I love collecting old games [(here’s an outdated post if you’re interested)](https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/kopl9s/it_may_be_small_and_took_me_three_years_to_build/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), and it’s a lot of fun collecting old games. However, I have a lot of multiplayer games, but nobody to play them with.

On New Year’s Eve, I brought over my NES and super Mario bros 3, and my uncle promised to play it with me. I was thinking about it all day, even more excited about it than ending 2020, but he never came and played with me. Needless to say, I didn’t start 2021 off great.

I have a little brother, but he got a gaming PC for his 13th birthday back in September, and the only game he’s been playing (since November 2019 really) is Minecraft. I don’t really like Minecraft anymore, but before he got a gaming PC, he played it on his switch and I could at least join his server on my phone. But I have not been able to join since he got the PC, and he rarely leaves his room. All he does all day besides online classes is play Minecraft, watch JoJo (please don’t make any references, I really don’t want any), and talking to his friends, only occasionally leaving for the bathroom or to grab food. I don’t really mind, but I just want a second player to play any game with.

With my mom, I love her, but she’s just been busy with her work and I just haven’t had any time with her. I’m 16, surrounded by vintage video games, and often don’t have any motivation to play them because nobody in my family really likes them, even though they all stay in my room.

Can someone please play Mario 3 with me? I’ll let you be player 1"

lonely,Rough Night into a Rough Day still here for you all,"Rough Night into a Rough Day still here for you all - Just work has gotten increasingly  rough. We are even more short handed these days, there is no longer OT so we cant have other team mates bring up the slack. Additionally dealing  with some slightly unwanted feelings after some comments form a someone who I am pretty sure is just a troll. Some were to me some to another. There last comment was terrible for me, kinda cut me deeper than I would have thought it could. I do not know and only slightly care if they see and comment to this. 

I do not know if i have really dove in here why I am really so lonely I figured that i may want to. 

This really all happened in the last about two years, roughly started a year after transition and why I was a bit more aware of how people felt or saw me both friend and family.  I am transgender, i came out about four years back. While growing up I never really got the respect or love that I saw my other siblings get. (later i would learn that this was the same for the only other sibling i still talk with as they got older and found out they were also transgender)

Starting in 2019, I was going to have surgery and prepare for it. I would be bed bound for three weeks,  needing full help in this time frame. For me this when I could really see that some of the people I stood with were not really standing there for me or with me. 

I was told that this was wrong, that I was sinful. That I was an abomination and that the could not support this but still would want to be social with me. These people started to disappear by there choice or mine for not wanting to be around them. The next and last set of people were all thinned out of my life starting in 2020, the year we really should have all been there for each other. My siblings and some of my family pushed there views and started to show there colors, in flag from on social media and to me. This was an aliment against me and against what I am. My mother and father laughed about it not fully wanting to, or lacking the foundation to understand what this all actually meant. 

Starting mid last year I had pushed for divorce , we put it on pause for the time being. This was so i could get therapy, sort out my life and all that i was dealing with. The subject is currently back and getting worked out again. While we love and care for each other, the huge issues for me is that I am just not happy, and with therapy we are working out the details to why. 

It has gotten harder recently to be on nights, to not see or talk to the few people that I did and could talk too. It hard and will be harder to live away from somebody that was a foundation in my life for long. As I told one person, someday all i want is hug, maybe a head pat and to hear something nice. I left out things that i have posted in great detail, like some traumatic things that have happened to me the past years of transition as I just want to vent not just dump to the world.

 Due to my recent dealing with an internet troll who wanted to use me being on the sub lonely saying they could understand why  I  was here, that I was someone who was uninteresting it made me want to post this. No matter what you are going through in life, we all get lonely it is okay to ask for help, to even go out and seek it. it is 

**Never okay to bully anyone, to troll someone or to make them feel less than human.**

To all of you out there who may read this now, a few hours, or days from now. Here is a hug, and point for your to know that even though I may not know you, I am here for you to offer a shoulder to cry on, and hug for comfort  and ear to talk to.

lonely,More lady friend,"More lady friend - As much as I love talking with men they always want a relationship out of a convo. It just makes everything really awkward and I end up having to put up a wall so I don’t get rung into a relationship. I also end up hurting someone’s feeling. 

I just wish more girls would message me to be friends. Like I legit just want to talk about animal crossing, Pokémon, Minecraft, drawing and or various anime or shows. I don’t want to have to dodge accident my sending someone missed signals anymore."

I'm just so lonely cause she was so afraid of me cheating on her cause people have kept trying things with me even when I refused them so I pushed everyone away and even tho I reconnected with mostly everyone I'm still so broken and alone in my head and in life.

No fun, no friends, this must be what adulting is like. Not a fan."
lonely,"It feels impossible to meet available, single women anywhere","It feels impossible to meet available, single women anywhere - But as a 24 year old, let's play it out shall we, barring Covid-19 restrictions: 

**Bars**: Barring Covid, full of tipsy and intoxicated people. High social environment which I am not and I have no friends. But for the first time in 3 years, I recently went to a bar with some coworkers, not once but twice in the last month. I felt out of place despite trying to socialize and adapt to the scene. I felt I was too introverted. Women there are with their own friends and boyfriends/husband's. And the ones that aren't, pretty sure they aren't looking for someone like me, attraction wise or personality/interests wise. 

**Clubs**: Same as bars, but even worse tbh. People in bars and clubs are not my kind of people. I don't drink often at all, and I'm not an extrovert. They just aren't like me, I feel. People say women typically don't go places so they can meet men. Which admittedly, does frustrate me and many other guys as well, so I've heard and seen. Because women are a huge motivation for many of us(dare I say most?). But, men and woman are wired differently. We are *different*. So as hard as it is, I try to understand. Still sucks though lol. 

**Meetup groups**: People constantly say women don't go to these to meet men(the same is said about bars and clubs too). When you do go to one that you have genuine interest in (which is the plan of action), people there already know each other, and you are in the outgroup. Basically forced to thrust yourself into the mix by being vulnerable and establishing social proof for yourself. Which is very difficult. 

**College**: I'm not in college anymore. But when I was, I asked out a good bit of girls. Rejected by all of them in some way. Really I'd only try to talk to girls that I had a connection with, be it same class, a club or event, something as I thought that would work better than trying to talk to absolute random people. I remember one time I got stood up for coffee at Starbucks. She wanted to play flag football instead. Ngl, probably more exciting than talking to someone who's mostly a stranger, but that was still messed up. 

**Online Dating**: Here we go. Let's start with dating apps, and this is from the perspective of a man trying to meet women. Next to zero matches. Zero attention. Barely any profile views and definitely no first messages from women unless it's a hot milf looking for a playmate in my area. When I message people, I always talk about something in their bio or try asking a question, or establishing some relatability. But hey, my pics aren't the most amazing. I have none that show me doing any activities or out and about. None with friends or family. Nothing. Just very clear pics, that **aren't** bathroom selfies, of me. 1 facial pic, a full body pic in some nice clothes, and another one for the road. That's all I can truly manage, I feel. Because again, I have no one to hang out with and I don't like taking pictures. Still, go to r/tinder right now, you will see that most of the men there with amazing, out-of-the-ass pics still struggle terribly. Bio? I've messed around with bios so many times for years now. I've even tried not having one. Turns out that actually worked better at some point. 

**Online in general**: I've messaged so many people online, especially reddit. Never any hints of nsfw in what I send, I try to create a comfortable vibe, be conversational, be inquiring, etc. A lot of the people I've messaged come from r/foreveralonedating, r/foreveralone, and femcel subs. Over the last half a year or so, I joined r/lonely and tried to converse there as well. Look, I get it, random pms from some guy isn't all that appealing. There's no pre-connection, no social proof that women need, they don't know who I am. Fine, fine. I personally would be flattered if some women took interest in me, looked over my profile and comments in order to talk to me. But perhaps that's just me. Maybe my standards are just low and it doesn't take that much. Have maybe a few things in common, sound relatable, around my age or older, eh not hard for me to want to talk to you. Perhaps I'm just to a point where I just want some attention from the opposite sex. I've been starved all my life, spare a cup of...well, you guys know the homeless squidward meme lol. 

**""Foreveralone"" dating** is a different story though. A very depressing one, as it's the same people who are supposed to foreveralone like you, yet seem to be just as unobtainable as ""regular people"". Same situation as dating apps. Ignored 24/7. Even when I send pics, doesn't matter. Even when I make my posts, doesn't matter. Have you been to that sub? It's like 100 men for every 1 woman there. Just like dating apps, regardless of this site being inherently male majority. 

Lastly, **mutual friends**: I have no friends haha. Seriously, I have no friends at all. You know some people will say ""I have no friends"", and then some time later will talk about how they went out with some friends last weekend or some shit? Or that they have friends they guess, but just feel lonely. Yeah that's not me. I have no friends and no one to talk to regularly or do anything with. And honestly half of this thread could go towards another one about how it's hard to make friends, because that's a big issue itself. Another thread for another time, which will probably come soon, because friends are also important. Anyways, having a social circle is one of the best ways to get a partner. I missed out. 

Bonus: **Luck**. Just be lucky and meet the love of your life at a supermarket in the meat section dude. Go try it out right now! They are waiting for you to come and grab the same piece of meat as them at the same time, then you can both say ""oh sorry, you can have it"", then proceed to giggle and instantly there's this insane chemistry that comes out of nowhere. 

So, yeah. Not too many options for me. Probably going to die of loneliness, lack of touch and affection."

I am always there for my so called friends but whenever I am in pain they just tell me to shut my mouth . I really want someone to appreciate me or tell me it's ok to not be ok.  Or at least a I care about you . The worst thing is I told my teachers about it and they told it to my parents even though I told them not to tell my parents.

I have a few hobbies that I spend time in, I have my own life. I think im interesting enough. Yet, Im not. Girls dont even notice me. Theres many aspects of being a Loner that I like but Im so tired of being alone. Some days I feel worthless, how could a 25 year old have so little relationship experience? I cant even imagine myself with a partner anymore. How could I be so repulsive that im part of the 1% of men who have little to no experience with relationships at such an age? I guess I am that repulsive."

Though I like those videos, I miss the feeling of another human being, qurentine hasn't helped.

I'm not in need of a girlfriend but I wouldn't mind having one, someone I can talk to or I can listen to, someone I could cuddle with, I don't only want sex, I want something cute maybe even clingy, respectful but overall trustworthy. 

Then I see all those girls on the internet complaining about guys behaving like dicks with them and they wish death to all of us men and I'm like... what did I do wrong? I'm not an asshole like them I promise.

Got carried away, sorry.

I know my happiness shouldn't depend on someone else, but after my (so far) only relationship I miss that feeling, that feeling of having that other person there unconditionally for you.

Asmr has made me get a bit of that again, but I know in the end it's all fake, it's just a girl doing some Voice Acting and of course there is no physical contact, no cuddling or anything.

I want to love and be loved, that's all."

lonely,I think one of the biggest potential relationship killers is self-doubt,"I think one of the biggest potential relationship killers is self-doubt - I know everyone feels lonely for different reasons. This is just my opinion on why so many people are *single* and feel lonely. Lonely in the context of wanting a partner. 

I don't know how things got this way but society has reinforced these awful, self destructive thoughts that echo and entangle us in this spiraling state of mind. 

""She doesn't like me. She's just being nice.""

""If I text him back too soon he'll think I'm desperate and not want me.""

""She hasn't called me back. I probably said the wrong thing and she thinks I'm a creep."" 

""I'm single because I'm unattractive and there's no point in trying to improve myself.""

It makes me sad just thinking about it. It's like the world is getting more and more black and white with nothing in between. I used to subscribe to this way of thinking. Either she loves me or she doesn't. You're either with me or against me. The plan went bad and it's entirely my fault. 

But I took some time to heal and was fortunate enough to be around more positive individuals who taught me that the world isn't black and white but *gray*. My entire thought process changed. 

I began to have less doubt. I realized that not everything is about me. I started seeing more possibilities that favored me as opposed to contesting me. It dawned on me how much other people's negativity and shit was subconsciously influencing my perception of *everything*. 

I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that you become a product of your environment and eventually (if you're like me) you're your own worst enemy! 

I'm not by any means perfect. I'm still dating off and on sometimes to zero success. But I'm trying. I go after what I want without self doubt or fear. Sometimes I still feel lonely but it's not nearly as intense or overwhelming. 

I appreciate it if you've read this far. I probably could have explained some things a little bit better. Again, not everyone's situation is the same (black and white again) and the best advice I can give is to try to see the world as GRAY! Somewhere in the middle, guys!"

And I don't really know what to do, I really miss her, it feels like apart of me is missing truthfully, I made mistakes that caused her to not wanna be around me anymore, I won't get into many details, but just know it was about me and looking at girls on social media, I told her I would stop, but I honestly couldn't stop myself, she would look on my phone to see if I was still doing it and I did keep doing it. The thing is ik I can't message her cause she doesn't want to talk to me, there's a reason why she blocked me, but the thing is I've given her space, I haven't constantly texted her and called her I knew she wanted space and I gave it to her. I just hope soon she would message me, life just doesn't seem right without her. I would do anything to talk to her and see her again. I'd do anything to feel the happiness and the love from being around her, I miss it so damn much:(."

&amp;#x200B;

But it doesn't matter, when I want to talk to most of the people in this community, I find that if you are not 100% in agreement with them, they just leave the chat, or maybe you have a chat with someone one day, and a couple of days later you say hello and ask for them, because they create some kind of interest in knew them better, but they never answer again, I honestly want to be there and take care of you long term, I want to give my love to you.

&amp;#x200B;

And I am very sure that I do not do anything wrong, I do not harass anyone, I do not insult or treat people badly, the only thing I always try is to listen to them and try to make them smile with kind words.

lonely,I still long for her after a year (simple rant),"I still long for her after a year (simple rant) - A year ago before Covid I was traveling Denmark and Germany. While in Hamburg, Germany I’d met a woman who I still think about. To make a long story short I met her at a hostel and had a fling with her for a week and a half to two weeks. 

Initially we’d hooked up while drunk and when she saw me undress she saw my dog tags. She went “oooh you’re in the Army?” And me being in a great state of mind said something very intelligent along the lines of “yeah I fuck shit up” and we had our night. The next day I went sightseeing alone and indulged in classical music museums but when I got back she spotted me and hugged me and asked if I wanted to hang out. I guess that’s where my entrancement began.

We were clearly attracted to each other even while sober (she was a 5’7’’ brunette with blue eyes and lots of tattoos 22F) and me (6’1’’ half Asian guy with light brown hair 19M). What I thought was a fling became an unintentional deep attraction over time. It was like she was my girlfriend for my time there.

Initially we’d just hooked up in the hostel but over time I learned to enjoy her company. I’d enjoy conversations with her about her life from a small German village and moving to a city and I’d tell her about life on the northeastern US and my career I’d started in the Army (reservist). I joked with her and told her I was in Europe for “cultural background” but she joked and said I looked Asian. I laughed it off and explained I was half and was impressed that she noticed because most people don’t.

As time went on she’d always joke about us getting married one day and having beautiful children. After a while it became time for me to head back home and we kept in touch by numbers and WhatsApp. I promised her I’d see her again. On our last night she cried a bit on my shoulder and I held on to her. She even gave me a last kiss as I departed on my train.

A few times while hanging out she told me I should hit her up again while I’m in Europe and she had an aunt in North Carolina so I could either drive to her or she’d come north to New York and I could come south and I’d show her around New York City. I was happy and sad at the same time to hear this.

I came home sad but decided to call and text her. Never got a response ever and I felt as if my soul had been ripped out. I’d try occasionally too in hopes of a response but never did and I had almost dropped my dream to make a career out of the Army ( I eventually pulled it together thanks to the Army chaplain being a good man and understanding). He’s also the only man in the Army to see me shed a tear. I felt so lost and felt as if nobody understood. 

I’d say for the most part now I’ve gotten past the darkest part because I continue to pursue my dreams and I’ve been happier lately too. But I still wonder about her and part of me (possibly foolishly) still hopes that perhaps we’d one day be together again. To this day she’s the last girl I’ve even kissed."
lonely,It hurts,"It hurts - Even seeing other posts on here makes me feel worse because everyone seems like a decent person on here and it's like the world does not give a fuck. The shitty thing is that even when people reach out to me I don't even know what to say. The conversation is so dry and boring and it doesn't even relieve the loneliness. It's not their fault, it's mine too. I don't even know how to relate and talk to people anymore. I don't know what to even talk about. And I run out of things to say so quickly. This shit kills you on the inside. 

I know a big part of this is covid but I can't help but think that if I was surrounded by other people I'd still feel really alone. I don't know what to do man. Shit seriously sucks."

I’ve started to go into a darker place and now I’m thinking about killing myself, the thoughts are kinda relaxing but I know I can’t do it. I also started to smoke weed more than I’ve used to cos it helps and makes me feel less alone. I try to be with friends and my family but it’s no help, whenever I’m with my friends they’re always happy with their s/o’s and they also do stuff right in front of me which is no help at all.

lonely,"Are they REALLY lonely, though?","Are they REALLY lonely, though? - My apology if this is the wrong place for this, as it is  something of a rant, however my experience increasingly is that many people who are lonely are because they choose to be. I include myself in that assertion. Recently, I spend a lot of time feeling sad about not having friends to joke around or visit with. I attribute this largely to social restrictions I and many like-minded people employ to avoid the spread of Covid. Prior to these circumstances, though, and throughout, I have met lots of people who complain of being in the throes of bitter despair resulting from isolation while ignoring attempts from people who genuinely desire their attention and time. For me, this applies to my family and wife (we're separated) all of whom would spend nearly every waking moment with me if I allowed it. I could elaborate, but I'm wondering if others either share this odd position or have observed it."

I don’t mind being in friend groups but after a while I feel like I tend to be ignored and would just prefer one person to talk to. 

Recently I irrationally made this decision of distancing myself from another user I met online here  and because I’m always afraid that I’m too clingy and that people just tolerate me. Instead I hurt their feelings making them believe it was actually their fault and I’ve tried reaching out but no luck and don’t think it’s something I can fix and it was just nice to actually talk to someone that’s open minded which I feel is a little scarce these days and I took it for granted because personal fears that I have."

lonely,Why am I the one always left out,"Why am I the one always left out - I m 20 M , currently in the third year of my college , I don't consider myself socially inept , I am okish at talking, from the first year of my college I had invested myself in a group , I used to hangout with them or so I thought , all of them have a group on a app , but I wasn't ever added , once in my second year , well, a guy from the group directly said that ""hey your always there "" in a joking manner , I understood what he meant , haven't gone out with them since , because they haven't called and because of corona too . I talk to people in class but am part of no group and I feel like people look down on me , I don't know what wrong I am doing or is it all in my mind . No one invites me to hang out or chill , it's me everytime that just goes and hangs out with them , but I don't feel like I am myself ever . I am not too good at talking when in groups . Now I regret investing my time in  that group , though I don't consider them to be jerks , individually when I have  approached them they have always helped , I'm just not close enough for me to call me to hang out with them ,even though I tagged along for 2 years .  

From this moment onwards , I don't know how to approach in terms of making friends to hang out with ,  I feel like I'm wasting the fun part of  my college life . So any advise you people would give would help me ."

I’m trying my best to get over him and let go but it’s hard to do so when I didn’t get any closure. It hurts me every time I think about my relationship with him. 

We claimed we were just friends but honestly we were never “just friends”. I guess I can call it a situationship because we were intimate. I didn’t realize I was falling for him until it was too late. Now I don’t even get a chance to let him know how I feel. I’ll have to live with this regret forever. 

I’ve always found solitude in being alone but lately the thought of being alone scares me. I hate it. I hate feeling lonely.

lonely,19M Never had a girlfriend or held an extended conversation with a female.,"19M Never had a girlfriend or held an extended conversation with a female. -  Growing up, I had a pretty average life. I had friends and loving parents, but it all changed when I moved to a different country (USA) at age 12. From then on, I was constantly teased for my appearance and bullied. Got really bad that I developed social anxiety by the time I was in the 7th grade. Since then I've had an extremely difficult time having a conversation with people, especially girls. My social skills are terrible. I can't look someone in the eyes while talking to them because subconsciously, I think they are judging my appearance. That really terrifies me. The bullying stopped years ago (ever since the 9th grade), but I've sadly not been able to improve my social skills at all. I've been approached by girls occasionally in high school but I can't hold a conversation to save my life, I get nervous and scared to the point where I just start saying random stuff and stare at the floor to the point that they become visibly uninterested (realizing this hurts the most). I'm a mess, really. Does anyone have ANY advice on this. I'm tired of being alone."

lonely,It's been over a year... and I still long for her.,"It's been over a year... and I still long for her. - There's just this type of love that we'd be able to come across with in this life. I'm sure that hers is something that I will never forget.

It's been a year since we parted ways. Now, I'm laying down on the bed where we used to lie down and watch Netflix together. Hell, I haven't watched a single episode of the shows we used to enjoy. The four walls of my room witnessed how much fun we had back then. Watching her snore while she sleep the night away, the scent of her hair and how beautiful her face is when she's asleep. Those things really are unforgettable. 

But now the room's just filled with emptiness and regret. Questions that will never be answered. I always think about her in the wee hours of the night; still trying to swallow the fact that she's no longer here. She moved to another city. I often wonder how she's doing now. How her dog's been doing, too. God, I had a lot of plans for her. We had a lot of plans together. It pains me whenever I am reminded by those things. It feels like my heart never stopped bleeding since the last day of 2019. The wound really is deep when someone you love so much leaves. 

My room has been pitch dark eversince that day. I geniunely miss her to my very core. Her love's like something I've never experienced before. She was always there for me. From out of town trips to accompanying me to the psychiatrist when my episodes are getting worse. She was there in every step I took and now, I no longer know how to take these steps alone.

As much as I want to go on and move forward, there's a piece of my heart that still hopes she'll come back for me. But the longer that piece holds on, the further she goes in reality. 

Sometimes, we need to let go of baggages that weighs us too much so we could proceed with life. But what if those baggages are the only things reminding us that once, we were loved. Unconditionally. 

That's why it's hard to let her go.

Maybe I am that hard to love. Maybe I am not worthy. Maybe I am that easy to forget.

Her love, is something that's rare to crosspaths with.

I want her back. I really do. But the Earth is no longer in the position where it was when we first met. 

I still love her. I still do. 

This is just another sad evening for me."
lonely,Hello strangers. How is everyone today?,Hello strangers. How is everyone today? - Sorry been feeling really bored lately and quite lonely. So I just wanted to say hi and see what everyone is up too at this moment 😊.
lonely,I have no time for friends.,"I have no time for friends. - My lifestyle has recently and rapidly changed to a schedule full of hobbies. I have an insane passion for every single one of my hobbies, it could even be referred to obsession. Personally, I prefer to call it determination to reach certain goals in the long term. Anyways, this being said, I just have no time for friends. I have a great life but I do feel that this weighs on me quite a bit because I am a strong extrovert. But this urge to be better, the urge to learn more and more within me is unquestionable. My problem is that I really crave a more intimate relationship. Due to past social situations and occurrences, I've been left ""scarred"" which makes me always want to be different. I absolutely hate being like other people. Though this affects my friendships because I want to find someone unique, to me... everyone is the same. I find it so boring, all these bland surface level friendships make me question what even is a friend?! Fortunately, I am so distracted by my interests and homework that I don't exactly have the time to feel pain. But it does get to me sometimes and it would be nice to have someone. By this, I mean a romantic relationship or atleast a more intimate friendship beyond the surface level. Only problem is, I don't know how to go about achieving this, do I need to let some of my interests go to make more time for relationships? Perhaps just wait? I would really appreciate some advice, any advice. Thank you for listening!

Edit: I felt this was appropriate to add... I am young, prefer not to say the age... but I would like to say my life is much more mature than other kids my age. I appreciate the finer things in life, I am very spiritual and only seek to improve in life. My vision of life is just so different that a child's. I also find it more enjoyable talking with adults since I can learn more, rather than hanging out with my age group, which they only want to do dumb shit."

lonely,"Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real 🌟), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀!","Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real 🌟), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts).

**How it works:**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.
* Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
   * [/u/finder\_of\_the\_humans](https://www.reddit.com/u/finder_of_the_humans/)/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"

lonely,Quickly made a new close friend then quickly lost her,"Quickly made a new close friend then quickly lost her - this has been bothering me for over a week now, I was doing an online german course with my university and I got speaking to this girl through text as we had to do an exercise together.

At 1st she was not the best at texting but informed up upfront she's not good at it but we where having decent convos she would disappear for a day or 2 then reply as normal, it was all fine and normal, just friendly chat

&amp;#x200B;

a couple of weeks later I pointed out that my intentions were only to become friends (I don't like rushing into relationships so I like to put this forward so they don't think I am just hitting on them) and to learn german together but we haven't done much of that, she replied saying she forgot about that as she just liked talking to me and we agreed to go over some german together, was nice to hear that from someone.

&amp;#x200B;

next week we did some course work together on cam and we just hit it off, it took us like 4 hours as we were just talking and having fun which distracted us, it was so easy to talk to her, we where then texting constantly every day and we even played Minecraft till like 8 am which we spent most of the time just talking about real in-depth topics and personal stuff, It was so nice to have someone to just talk to like that, we connected so well, she told me was trying to talk to a guy on tinder as she was desperate (was just before valentines day) but she was struggling to make conversation with him and said she found it easy to talk to me and a lot quicker than anyone else, she also said she hopes we always keep talking.

&amp;#x200B;

the next week was different she started taking days to reply and was putting some edgy stuff on Instagram, when I did get replies she was completely different, started calling me buddy and bro all of a sudden which she never used to, then on the weekend she called me up on cam and she told me she met the guy on tinder the night before, was meant to be just a hookup but something about how they ended up cuddling and now she has feelings for him and they are in a relationship, (I personally hate these kinda tings but if shes happen then that's all that matters right?)

but she was so different talking to me, she didn't look happy at all, idk she seemed stressed.

&amp;#x200B;

a few days later we planned to do some more german work and I messaged her saying we didn't have to do it anymore if she didn't want to, she had told me in the past she isn't always sociable and has days where she just lives in her own would so I tried to let her have that if she wanted to, however, she insisted we still do the homework but only for an hour and we agreed to call at 9pm, then at 9:45pm she ended up saying she doesnt want to do it anymore and that she just feels socially drained (was a little annoying as I originally asked her this) so I was like sure, said to her we could do it tomorrow or whenever she feels more recharged then she went off on one about how it doesn't work like that, apparently she rarely messages people and that she preferred it that way saying it's so draining talking to people, so I explained that I dont know how we can still be freinds like that not talking, to which she replied that the best types of freindhsips are the ones where you dont have to talk...

this hurt, I apologized and admitted I can be clingy.

&amp;#x200B;

I still messaged her when she replied to me, she got drunk the other night and started trying to talk to me but the conversation just didn't seem to be working, she kept miss understanding what I was saying so I just ignored her then replied the next day when she was sober, now our conversations have dried up, I try and make a bit of convo but she ignores half of my messages and just reply to one thing then goes offline.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to hint that I will stop talking but I keep sending another message, but the last message I sent her was just ""np, if you ever need anything you can always message me"" this was meant to end the conversations (she can either say something like ""ok thanks"" or read it and not reply) she hasn't even opened the message yet, been 2 days now,  idk why I am so hung up on this, over the past 2 weeks that things have been like this I have had so much to talk about to her but I just don't feel comfortable, I feel like every time I message her I am just hassling her.

Idk apart of me feeling like she was just using me as she was lonely but now she has this guy she met she does not need me.

&amp;#x200B;

It just hurts so much, we were so close, we spoke about everything, even very personal stuff, I grew attached to her, a part of me thinks I was too clingy which would be true, idk, I am 23m and she is 19f, maybe she is not as mature as I thought or who I thought she was.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I should ever message her again or just walk away, if anyone has got advice or an idea on what might of happened feel free to comment :("

lonely,"“breaking up slowly, is a hard thing to do.”","“breaking up slowly, is a hard thing to do.” - i loved him, more than i’d ever loved anyone. actually, scratch that a bit - i *love* him, here and now, in the present tense. i still think about him every day, the same way i always have. i still hear the same songs, and have the same visions of the life we could live. i still catch myself absentmindedly pulling up his social pages as though my draw to him is a force of habit, all but subconscious.

there’s no denying, though, that the way i view him has fundamentally changed.

or what’s changed, rather, is how i view the way he views me. we hadn’t been dating for a super long time, but the night he broke up with me - and the morning after, where he patched things up together again - felt like it had been the culmination of something much bigger. he told me he never loved me, that i was just some obligation he felt the need to fulfill, and then told me the morning after that none of his words meant anything and he wanted me just the same. i had been left with no indication whether to believe the former, or the latter, or whether there was any truth in either of them at all.

we’d planned our marriage, our home, our careers. which one of our last names would come first in our hyphenation, in our perfect equal all-fulfilling union. was *any* of that real? was he swept up in the game? or was he simply humoring me, a spectator to the end he knew was coming all along?

technically, we’re still together. i love him like i always have, and i want to make it work. he admitted to stretching the truth in some aspects, but he says that the love he has for me was always authentic. that it was all to make me happy. i really, *really* want to believe him. he needs his space right now, to focus on other things. my loyalty is unwavering, and so here i am, waiting for the day he’s ready to move forward.

am *i* ready to move forward?

i have never felt lonelier than i do in this moment, completely on my own, waiting for a relationship which might not even be real. it feels like we’re starting from scratch, almost. i love him more than life itself, and i can’t even tell him any more.

i love him. the waiting, the uncertainty, is absolute torture. it’s hard being lonely, but sometimes, it just might be the right thing to do."

I keep waiting, thinking it might change, (I want it to), but it doesn't. I have never been on a date, or had a kiss. I'm missing out on so much happiness that others seem to get so easily. So I have kind of reconciled myself to the fact that maybe, I am meant to love, but not meant to be loved. It's a sad thought to have, but a fair one, too, if I look at my life objectively. So yeah, had to get it out somewhere, because my friends who have always experienced loving relationships do not understand how deeply it affects me.


Thanks for listening! &lt;3"

lonely,I can't sit at home anymore,"I can't sit at home anymore - I'm 22, I wanna have uni classes in actual classrooms with actual people, I wanna hang out, I wanna talk to people, I wanna train, I wanna be able to perform again and I wanna party. I'm a very intelligent person so I can spend a significant amount of time studying, reading and researching different topics without getting bored, I do all kinds of arts so that's something I can fill my time with too.

But a whole year of sitting in my room is not something I can take anymore. I feel like I'm going crazy and I know I'm not the only one but man this just sucks. 

Anyone have any good advice on dealing with loneliness and lack of outlets?

lonely,Every day feels the same,"Every day feels the same - Wake up, go to work, come home and do nothing. I know it's bad to wallow in self pity but I feel like I've fell into this dark place and it's so hard to escape from it. The friends I have never seem to care to talk anymore as they are all in relationships and having kids so its understandable in some ways plus I dont reach out to them anymore because I either get ignored or it's just one worded short replies. Sorry for rambling I just dont really have anyone to vent to at the moment.

Edit: I just kinda thought I'd add that I ended a 5 year relationship last April and it was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make. She was pretty much the only person I talked to for the most part and I know that's not necessarily healthy looking back at it. Well here I am a year later feeling kinda empty inside but just wanting to find that type of connection again. Being an impatient person it's really seeming to take a toll on me lately"

lonely,Why Won’t They Talk To Me?,"Why Won’t They Talk To Me? - https://youtu.be/yzAjagHwL_4

Basically made this song my anthem. Used to have a ton a friends in college before covid separated us. I realized through my loneliness that they weren’t really the best people for me. I was up late, smoking pot, skipping class, just to keep the good times rolling. I haven’t seen any of them since March, and they still hang out with each other/make plans without me. Hell, my roommate lives 5 mins away and not once has he followed up on any of my invites.

Music keeps me company, and this song really assured me that it’s not entirely my fault that I’m by myself. I’m still trying to let go of these people, but in the meantime my GPA has skyrocketed and I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been. In terms of being a part of a group or feeling acceptance from others, I’ve learned that it’s just not my time yet. My advice: impress yourself before you impress others.

There aren’t easy days, but in the meantime, I’ll keep on listening to this song as a reminder to do the best I can with what I wake up to.

SO to any other Tame fans"

lonely,I just need to get something off the chest - I apologize,"I just need to get something off the chest - I apologize - Hi,

I created this account just now because for a few weeks now I have a looming feeling that I need to get one or two things of my chest and with all due respect I find it sad at best that I could not find anywhere to turn to but the reddit or let's say the internet as such. I just have to get it out of my system, even just for a short moment.

Now that I decided to tell someone- I don't really care who reads it, just someone somewhere - I have no idea where to start. I guess the last year - as it was shit for a lot of us. 

As for the pandemic and everything thath followed its way, I have to say that I am part of that lucky crew who just shifted working from the office to working at home. I am very much aware that these days this is a privilege and I am grateful to be able to keep on working just like that. What I however noticed is, that your mind is not as occupied, no matter the workload. The environment you are in (at least for me) plays the biggest part in what I allow myself to think in that very moment. And after a good year in the homeoffice I had realizations about myself and the people around me that I do not like.

You see, I feel an emptiness inside of my heart that I cannot explain, or rather could not explain until recently (I guess). This is cliché I know, but I lack of better words to describe it as English is not my native language and my vocabulary a bit limited. Best to describe it is probably: I do not care. I kind of lost the ability to really care about something or even worse: someone. It just doesn't come as naturally as it did 10 years ago (or come at all for that matter). I am so indifferent about my environment that it terrifies me. How did it come to this? I don't remember chosing to get to point where most reactions to anything are just a ""meh"". Being it the death of our family dog, the birth of my nephew, shit like that. I care more about the fact that I don't care if that makes sense. It shakes me to the core that I cannot do it differently.

You know, a few years back I thought of myself ""you are a good guy with a good job, your family is there for you, own apartment. Life is pretty good - just wait for that special someone and you will be completed, give it time"". But she never showed and I stopped at first to look for her, then I started to question if there is maybe just something very wrong with me - contrary to what I believed to be, maybe I lived an utter misconception of what I am - and lastly I just stopped to care and made my peace with being the loner (or at least in that ""happily ever after"" scenario thingy).

I had friends and siblings after all, right? Well yes, but you see, they are all in commited relationships, started own families, bought themselves houses with gardens, got a dog. My siblings are all taken, on the way to marriage or with kids. My best friend recently moved away. Another close friend will eventually as soon he and his lady have decided where best to move to. We (me, my siblings and friends) where never in these ""hollywood"" friendships where you talk about every bit of your feelings or what moves you, it was all very simple. I wouldn't necessarily say superficial, but limited in what we shared. Most of the time we talked nonsense, gamed, got drunk and talked even more nonsense, went to concerts and festivals. It was all good fun. What most of the people around me did not realize was, that this is (or was) all I had. I literally clinged to all these useless, senseless activities like a drowning person to an old log, because I knew, as soon as all this will disappear, I will be pulled down the abyss with no backup plan on what to do or where to go from there.

So some might say: ""Well, just open your mouth about it. Say that you feel like this and you will recieve help and support"". True but if that's the first impuls you have not been paying attention. I would, if I could. But I rather don't because for me it's better to not know than to be turned down. I couldn't bear it I think. I don't want to become a nuisance to the people close to me, regularly asking ""hey whats up, wanna hang or get some drinks?"" and then getting these messages that they are preparing dinner for a couple they recently got to know or they have to look after the kids and so on. I don't want to be that guy and drive them away even further by being that annoying voice in the back of their heads until they finally cut all ties. 

And to be fair, right now: I don't know if I would really care - and it kills me bit by bit to have realized that.

And we are not done here, let's add a bit of a twist to it. Almost 5 years ago I was diagnosed with an incurable neurological disease and as of now I have a pretty good sense of what lies ahead, what is coming my way. So besides all the shit I whined about above I am now carrying my personal Sword of Damocles, it can fall anytime, anyplace and there is little to nothing I can do about it. 

With all that I just resigned to even try to improve my situation in any way, because if you are on a slide towards an active volcano, why drag someone into it? That would be unfair and I can't get past that very thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is much more, but I think I am good for now, maybe I will continue to do the soul striptease if I need it. 

Nevertheless to anyone who read through all of this blabla: Thank you."

Which is great and all, but I don’t think it was fair of her to send me that message. She broke the friendship off with me and it wasn’t even my fault. It was my dad’s fault for threatening her father, which is fucked up ik but i dont get to choose my parents. Like, she was an ok friend. She would constantly use me and belittle me in front of people because of her own insecurities. And she did some fucked up things to me in the past but i was still always there for her, ya know? I dont think it was fair for her to message me and act like she wanted to be my friend again, but she really just wanted to say thank you. Like what am I supposed to say to that?

I've been up for hours and I can't seem to fall asleep. I have a loving family however I am struggling with friend problems right now and a lot of stress. I just...need someone to talk to I guess. Anyone.

I am also here in case you need to talk to me about anything. I know a lot of people have worse issues right now. I feel like I will never be as good as anyone else. I can feel the life I've dreamed of slipping away. I have no one I feel like I can talk to. No boyfriend, no real friends I can trust, and I can't even bring myself to call my parents. I am so tired and stressed and overwhelmed. Normally I am a kind funny soul and I can't find that part of myself lately. 

DM or comment :) thank you and any help would be appreciated so much"
lonely,I'm so tired,"I'm so tired - I'm tired of walking alone, I'm tired of hearing that in order to love another i have to love myself first. I love myself more than anyone else has ever cared to find out. I'm incredible, I've been through a lot and i continue to do so. I'm not a perfect individual, I'm not the best at anything, but I'm compassionate to a fault. I carry a mountain on my back, and drag chains behind me. I know that I'm not weak... I would suffer for any individual on the planet if they asked me to, simply to alleviate discomfort. 

I love myself, and i struggle so greatly with the idea that i just.... want someone to love me. 

I struggle because it feels selfish, and i can't figure out how; how do people obtain that, how do people seek that, how do people ask that of another.... I want so desperately to ask that of someone. 

I've fallen so far outside the realm where other people even exist, how do you find someone drifting in the void when the only sense of direction you have is how far in the distance you've drifted from the earth. Do i hope for random chance, do i stick my hand out into the abyss? 

I don't understand, I know that specific sites exist for that sort of thing dating and whatever, but.... as much as I value myself, I'm damaged... I know that I'm worthwhile but why would anyone seek me out over someone with a heart that isn't put together with stickers, glue, and duct tape.

I'm lost and alone, and tired... I don't know how to try, yet I'm doing all that i possibly can. 

I wish sometimes, i wish that fairy tales existed. I wish that princes and princesses would save each other from desolate towers, that in times of need someone would just manifest and make things bearable for a time. I know that isn't how the world works, maybe I'm childish."

lonely,When's it Gonna be my Turn,"When's it Gonna be my Turn - I've always felt so lonely in my life, that I never fit in anywhere and that wherever I go its the same thing.  I don't have many friends.  I moved to a new city to start grad school this past August and given the state of the world I still have not met anyone out here.  Others have at least some people to help them get through these trying times but I feel so alone.

I've always struggled with these feelings: I have some mental health issues and am at the very top end of the spectrum.  For how long I was pretty much socially clueless, and this coincided when it was easiest to meet people and make friends during high school and undergrad.  I didn't realize what it was to be social until a year and a half ago, I always used to think that things would just happen magically and I would have to put no effort into making friends.  I am very insecure to be honest and do not have great self esteem, stemming from when I was bullied and misunderstood during my younger years.  The cruel/funny thing is that the people who hurt me most have what I most desire in my life; a group of friends, a wide social network and the ability to have experiences like romantic relationships and going places and sexual things.  I'll see random people on social media who are getting engaged/married or are pregnant and the like and I do not understand how it gets to that point.  I wasted a lot of time and I wish I could just go back.  I just want to fit in and belong and feel ""normal"" for once.

I have been in therapy for a long period of time and have been working with a social skills coach, but it does not seem to improve.  I know my low self esteem and lack of self acceptance doesn't help, but when is it really going to be my turn?"

lonely,my friend always tries to make me feel shit,"my friend always tries to make me feel shit - recently i discovered that my friend group have a groupchat without me and have been excluding me from their plans. if it couldn’t get any worse, one of them whos in most of my classes constantly brag about it front of me subtly but also deliberately. she constantly brings up their groupchats, the ones im not in, loudly so that i can hear everything. She treats our social lives as if they’re a competition. And one day, she was talking to me about their hangout the other day and was practically like “ohh right you weren’t there lol”. Shes also the type of person to only talk to you when its convenient.. the only times she talks to me is when she doesn’t want to look like a loner. Today she stole my only close friend from me because she had no one else and they both ignored me throughout the whole of first period. I was alone, as usual, and had no one to partner up with when we were doing activities. I felt so upset and was on the verge of tears today because of how all the genuine effort i hard put into our friendships, only to receive nothing but blatant negligence back. 

Im guessing this is her projecting her insecurities on me as she was always left out of things just like me, so she wants me to feel what she felt. But then she acts totally normal to me afterwards and treats me like how a good friend would because she knows i’m naive and will push away everything that happened. Yet the moment she has another person to talk to i dont exist anymore and she has no use for me. We used to be super close friends and loved to be around eachother, but then she suddenly became like this. 

Honestly, i couldn’t give less than two shits about them going everywhere without me because ive already decided that im ten times cooler than them. i’m just so upset when i think about how many times ive mindlessly let her treat me like this, although ive never once spoke to her with the intention of treating her the same way back. Dropping her isnt an option as shes in all of my classes, in my ‘friend’ group, and basically everywhere in my life. I just have to deal with it. 

i just wish i had better friends who would appreciate me for the person i am and not treat everything like a social competition."
lonely,"I'm very lonely, and I don't know how much longer I can make it.","I'm very lonely, and I don't know how much longer I can make it. - I'm about to be 20 around the end of march, I've been alone my entire life with the exception of a few people who I was friendly with, my cousin was kind of a friend of mine but we parted ways around the age of 12.

I've never had a girlfriend, or been on a date, that's my main issue, it's not that I worry about what others think about that, that they think I'm weird, or something like that, it feels like I failed myself, my parents constantly talk about how they met at 16 and were married by 18, almost as if to rub it in (despite the fact they hate each other)

My life got off to a terrible start, I only got my license around early 19, I owned my pickup for a year before I could legally drive it so my mom drove me around for that year, I feel awful that I haven't had a girlfriend, ever.

The part that hurts the most about never having had a girlfriend, is this feeling of being naive, or some kind of innocence, I remember it started when I read a meme back early 19, it was a tinder conversation where the girl says ""Wow I can't believe I found someone more innocent than me, I've never had sex but I've had a first kiss"" and that hit me hard, I don't like that feeling of almost childish innocence.

I've been trying since I turned 18 to find friends, but I just can't, I feel like I failed myself for not getting my license until 19! And ontop of that, I've never had a girlfriend, I feel like this innocent child, I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

My childhood and teenage hood were awful, my dad was unstable, my mom was a workaholic, they took me out of school and homeschooled me, the only things I knew for all that time was work, and the misery of home, I do blame my parents for my terrible start, but that doesn't keep the pain away.

I couldn't care less about my virginity, I don't care about sex, I do hope I can find a girl that is a virgin, &gt;!(No this isn't some creepy thing about virginity and purity, it's because I want that to be something I can share to loose, but I know that's increasingly unlikely, I ABSOLUTELY don't go around asking girls if they're virgins and declaring them sluts for not being a virgin, I do want to clarify that.)!&lt; but I want to have a first kiss, I just feel terrible about this feeling of innocence I have, I don't want to feel more innocent than my girlfriend.

The loneliness is crushing, but I've dealt with it for nearly 20 years, I can deal with it another few months, but the feeling of failure, it truly hurts, I don't know that I can bear the feeling of failure of turning 20 alone.

One thing I do tell myself to comfort myself, is that I've been through hell and came out alive, it does make me feel a bit less 'innocent' but I still just can't shake this terrible feeling.

I've had other accounts elsewhere and people tell me ""it's not that strange, plenty of guys are in the same boat"" but I know it's all lies to make me feel better, and ultimately it doesn't matter, because I don't worry about what others think of it, I certainly don't go around telling people about it, but it wouldn't particularly destroy me for others to know, it's the fact I feel like I failed myself, it kind of hurts to hear other people talk about how they had a girlfriend at 17, or a boyfriend at 15, and they got their license at 16, I just want this pain to stop, I feel so far behind everyone else, and I know there is nothing I can do about it.

PS: IM NOT A LATE BLOOMER I wanted a girlfriend since at least 14, I don't want to be called a late bloomer, that does make me mad."
lonely,Desperate to feel wanted,"Desperate to feel wanted - (F20) I want to feel loved and cared for, but it seems almost impossible. Every guy I come across only wants to sleep with me, I’ve been in so many dangerous situations with men in my life taking advantage of me in some way, I feel like everyone sexualizes me and no one genuinely wants to get to know me and form a healthy relationship with me. It’s so draining, I feel uncomfortable in my own body. It’s all affected my life so negatively, and at the end of the day I have no one to talk about it with."

 to realize down the line that they only gave me the bare minimum and I accepted that treatment because I thought it was better than being alone with my thoughts. I really need to do better..."
lonely,Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters,"Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters - “I feel unspeakably lonely. And I feel - drained. It is a blank state of mind and soul I cannot describe to you as I think it would not make any difference. Also it is a very private feeling I have - that of melting into a perpetual nervous breakdown. I am often questioning myself what I further want to do, who I further wish to be; which parts of me, exactly, are still functioning properly. No answers, darling. At all.”"
lonely,i've never felt this lonely before,"i've never felt this lonely before - i have friends but, they barely talk to me. i don't even know what they do half of the time unless i go on instagram and watch their stories. they don't respond to me when i talk in the groupchat and some of them talk amongst each other, but i'm left out. i only talk to one person, and it's this guy that i've been talking to since the summer and we've both grown a liking to each other. it honestly feels sad and pathetic when i see him active on discord, playing and talking with his friends while i'm watching videos by myself. if we don't call at night or during the day, i'll literally just be by myself waiting for him to answer to be done with class so i can have a conversation with someone. i really have no one but him. 

i'm crying right now because it really hurts. i have no one else to talk to. i haven't had a best friend in so long and maybe that's why i feel this way. everything that i do, like, or say just doesn't match up with anyone else and i feel left out. it's overwhelming for me trying to connect with people and i overthink it so hard that it makes me scared and anxious. the conversations they have, i just can't keep up and ii beat myself up for just staying silent. seeing people on social media being with their friends and hanging out makes me so sad. social media also adds volumes to my loneliness i just want to delete it. at this point, i want to erase my whole entire footprint from this earth. it already feels like people don't know who i am. i wish i had more friends. i wish my social life didn't involve just one person. it hurts being lonely."

lonely,I want to meet someone where we can both be SUPER vulnerable with each other.,"I want to meet someone where we can both be SUPER vulnerable with each other. - So this is going to be a bit of me rambling a bit but I figure, hell, might as well.

Between covid and the weather I'm not getting out much, I'm spending way more time stuck inside than I would like. I'm looking to meet people I can be real with. See Ive got this...I""m not really sure what to call it. Issue?

Growing up I was anti-social. I sucked at talking to people and mostly it was my own fault. As I grew up, went to college, ect. I started to realize the problem was me and focus on self growth. Eventually I got to where I am now. I'm sociable, I can hold a great conversation, I'm confident, and in the right circumstances I can work a room and its great.

However, I never really seem to get what I desire most, and thats a deep friendship or romantic relationship with someone who I don't have to ""perform"" for. When I'm social, Its largely a performance. I sure I look confident, and I say I don't care what people think. I'm my own man after all. In truth, I want to be liked and respected, however I realize chasing it will never lead to actually getting it.

So I behave the way I should, but the result is. THere is this mask I always wear. I'm happy, I care, I don't let things get to me. Underneath though I'm lonely, tired, depressed, and more than anything and the world want to cuddle up with someone and snuggle while we watch netflix.

BUT I can't do that right now cause of, you guessed it, covid. So I had an idea, what if we skipped the boring shit. I mean small talk has its place but lets be REAL with each other. Lets tell each other the things we never say to another, lets remove that pesky filter and say the things we would never normal say, never would confide with a stranger about.

Lets jump straight to the messy vulnerable place where you actually get to know the other person."

lonely,Stop me if you’ve heard this one already,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one already - You go to a new environment, meet someone for the first time, and fall for them HARD. It takes your best effort just to stop thinking about them for a few minutes. Slowly, you get to know them and you end up joining their friend group, so now you have friends AND a crush. Then BOOM, quarantine hits. You’re sad because you didn’t get to spent a lot of time with them. A few months pass and they message you. You start talking to them again, FaceTiming almost every other night. Come back to new environment from before, feelings from before start to resurface causing you to nearly have mental breakdowns. But they don’t reciprocate, and all that’s left for you to do is bottle it up and leave it forever lest you disturb the friendship by telling them about those feelings. And after it all, all that’s left there is a bottled up mess of emotions that festers and rots and you feeling sad and lonely.

lonely,I just don’t get it,"I just don’t get it - I know that it’s kinda dumb being so emotionally invested in wanting to love someone when you already have plenty of good friends, a loving family, and a secure job, but it eats me up. And it doesn’t make sense to me why I’m so fucking unlovable. I convinced myself it was bc I was ugly and came to terms with it, but when I posted on rating subs none genuinely described me as ugly, some even considered me attractive, yet I haven’t seen someone feel that way about me. So then I have to resort to my personality being vile, but then I realize that all my problems are hidden and not surface level, so it can’t possible be that women are turned away by my severe mental issues when they have no idea they even exist. I’ve even begun to use dating apps and had like 20 matches but they suddenly lose interest, literally out of nowhere. Not like the convo got stale or ANYTHING, it just ends. Exactly mirrors how it was being with my ex, she liked me for about 2 seconds before she broke up with me a month after we started dating. And how I always end up befriending a girl I’m interested in, asking her out, get rejected, which I can deal with itself, but what hits hard is that we suddenly grow apart. I can tell they don’t give a shit about me in the very least, even though days before they showed they atleast cared a tiny bit. That’s why with the latest girl that I was talking too, I realized I had feeling for her, so knowing the pattern of how it ends, and noticing how she was texting me infrequently anyway, I ghosted her. I could maybe deal with this loneliness if I knew why I was lonely, like if I was ugly, an asshole, or literally anything that’s a red flag, but there’s nothing. I feel like a regular person yet everyone I know is having casual relationships with many people or in committed ones, and here I am, not even used a piece of meat, like people don’t even want me in sexual relationships! I am undesirable in every sense of the word but I can’t figure out why! I just wish I understood why.…"

I came up with nothing really. The only thing came to my mind is to do this.

Hi, I just joined here! How are you all doing? Does this also happen to you? What do you do and what do you think is the reason?

lonely,I feel so miserable and I don't know where my life is going.,"I feel so miserable and I don't know where my life is going. - I'm stuck in a limbo of sorts and I'm so fucking sick of it.  


I'm just... so lonely. And hopeless. And craving for affection. Craving for some sort of something that can take this endless apathy and loneliness away. I feel like I'm too young to feel this sort-of sadness but it just doesn't go away. And I can't stop hurting. Suicidal thoughts keep flashing through my mind here and there. At any time. I just think about dying. And not hurting anymore.  


My family members are all too up their own ass to really connect with me so I can't really connect with them for as hard as I ever tried. I don't talk to many people since they're kind of on their own thing and I'm sort of left behind and when I try to reach out and/or talk about myself to people I constantly feel like I'm either bothering them or boring them. COVID has literally minimized any opportunity of hanging out with people irl so I don't really have much meaningful interactions irl. I specially suck at trying to talk to people online so that adds extra anxiety when I try to engage in conversation in the first place.  


And my love life has been... just awful. I haven't been in a romantic relationship in like 3 years. It's hard to admit that I'd really like to have somebody there looking out for me and loving me romantically, but it's true. I wish I could just hug someone and just... love them. And be loved right back. And just enjoy the warmth of another person's body (not necessarily in a sexual way) but it's hard not to feel like I will not find that person anytime soon. I'll most likely be another couple of years lonely. I'm also financially struggling right now. I'm unemployed and looking for jobs. Practically broke. Can't really throw money at stuff I'd like to be investing in (like creating art and getting a better computer or something).  


So, yeah. I feel like I've hit rock bottom and I'm just fucking 20. I feel like I shouldn't be as anxious or as sad as I am. And it sucks. And I keep thinking about dying. And ending it all. And leaving this world. And covering myself in my own blood. Everything hurts and the only thing I wish I could have is some affection. Just a hug.  


Sorry if this was too long-winded or indulgent. It's my first time opening about these sort-of things in a looong time. I'm also not a native English speaker so sorry if there are any grammatical errors. I just got in here and looked ""lonely reddit"" and quickly made an account up just to post this since I've been dealing with these feelings for a while. And thanks for reading."

The past two nights I’ve tried watching a show on Netflix: “Behind Her Eyes.” Each time (2 so far) there is a sex scene, I start to feel nauseous and cry. I have to turn off the show. I’m not sure if it’s because one of the main characters resembles my ex or I’m just that freaking lonely.

That's all you have to say? Bitch, you fucking wasted my time by even messaging me. It would have been better for you to not have said anything at all.
This is why I really hate these apps because for men like me, it is a losing game and you can never make it. Women on there don't want men like me so they immediately disregard any feelings they have and waste their time. Fuck dating and fuck love. It's so goddamn overrated. Losing game for average/below average looking guys is all it is."
lonely,Down,"Down - I have always been at war with myself. For as long as I can remember, I have had a deep sense of mourning over not being cherished. I can’t figure out if it’s ultimately a sense of entitlement and vanity gone awry, or whether there’s something more fundamental at play. I can’t remember the last time I didn’t feel it. It’s been half a decade since I had anything resembling a serious relationship. My previous one lasted maybe a combined total of two months of texting and 2 weeks in person together. It was intense in some ways but distant in others. I’ve gone on dates with people and had texting rapports in the meantime but it just doesn’t work out in a favorable way. I never feel like they actually like me, mostly.

I have always desperately wanted to receive a certain kind of warm affirmation romantically but I could never put my finger on why no one ever got close. Or why no one seemed to bother to try. I was informed of a fact of my childhood a few years ago that put things into perspective. I was not breast fed. It seems petty and mundane to pin things on this but I really think there’s something there. I just didn’t get the right hormones and attention as an infant to understand that human warmth doesn’t have to be a scarcity mindset thing. I basically have concluded that the reason why people take me for granted is because I was designated as such when my infant brain was left out in the cold via a lack of basic mammal infant care. My parents easily could have gotten a wet nurse. This obvious solution was not pursued, nor explained to me when I learned this fact about my history. Attempts to bring it up have been met with prickliness. Instead, the foundations of my brain development included none of the typical hormones that an infant mammal would get from his mother or another woman nursing him. Like a rug pulled out from under me from the get go. And I had no idea until I was in my late 20’s, after years and years of this. Including very serious sidetrack including an eating disorder, self harm, substance abuse and alcoholism to the point of severe physical dependency. 

I am unable to form any kind of serious romantic relationship and am plagued by self-sabotage and clinginess that I must always keep under wraps or else be taken for granted. Really I’m just so starved for basic human warmth that I have a difficult time knowing how to act when I receive some. But then again that kinda makes sense given what I mentioned above. 

Liking someone immediately makes me resent them for the fact they now hold this stupid power over me. And so to chip away at this leverage, I set to work cataloging the things I disdain about them in my mind. If I already secretly hate them, they can’t hurt me the same way. But by this point, I’m actually turned off and I’ve walked away. Back to the silence of my apartment. 

Just felt like getting this off my chest."

lonely,why does it have to be this way,"why does it have to be this way - At first I thought my depression and dark thoughts came from me using drugs in my past and potentially messing up my brain. Then I thought it had to be because of traumatic experiences. I went to a therapist, and after a couple of sessions I realized all my dark thoughts came from loneliness, and pretty much nothing else. I realized I'd been feeling this way a long time before I ever tried drugs or went through anything even remotely traumatic. I've felt lonely my whole life, pretty much. And it didn't help that the therapist wouldn't take me seriously...

I am 23 years old, I run my own business from home and never really meet many people in my everyday life. I am still a virgin, and have tried my absolute best to hook up with girls with no success whatsoever. Nothing but rejection, every time. I've always had a lot of friends, but never felt like I belonged around any of them. I always feel like I'm putting on a mask that's happy and social, but it just falls right off sometimes.

Lately, people have been commenting my misfortune somewhat. My brother told me that I need to get out and meet more people, my mother asked me if I'm feeling lonely, my friends ask me how I feel in a weird way that makes me feel like a little child that they're trying to take care of. I feel like people are treating me differently because they know I am insanely lonely, which is making me feel even more lonely. Some people, like this random stupid stoner dude I barely know, do not treat me differently and I can't even begin to express how relieved that makes me feel. But those people are few and far in between, most people make me feel really isolated. 

In high school, I made a lot of friends but could never connect with any of them. In university, I made a lot of friends but could never connect with them either. They connected to each other, and I have no idea why I never felt invited. I can remember this feeling ever since kindergarten - I was always a part of the group, but also always the guy who people would forget to invite when that group would do something. 

I can't for the life of me figure out why this is my fate, since people generally tell me that they appreciate me. It's oppressing, feeling like you will never feel at home anywhere ever."

lonely,Curiosity as cure for loneliness,"Curiosity as cure for loneliness - Hi, beautiful people, as many of you I’m desperately lonely. There are days of immense sadness that gravitate even more sadness, so I keep active, use spare time to intercept reality as it is. I got divorced, graduated in thirties just as pandemic happened and of course there are other minor issues, some of them serious but it doesn’t matter, we shape reality by the stories we tell ourselves. Humans are time. We create moments that reach out to other moments in past and future, they all connect and through so many strings of connections it becomes one united experience of existence spanning our private universe. There is transformative power within us all, to look at anything even the most mundane object, and act as we see it for the first time is the power to change. It might not change life instantly, but instead of looking at loneliness as state of isolation, I can look at it as state of emptiness. We buy mugs based on design, shape but the emptiness and it’s capacity to contain is what matters the most. 

Combination of senses or channeling full attention to single one while disconnecting other ones is the most conducive to experiencing life. When I walk the dog in the forest I watch snow, branches, I listen to my feet on the snow and squirrels enter my perception, deers jump and hawks fly. I see tiny feet on the snow, I follow, what creature lives in there? 

https://ibb.co/BcDxpzK

I think it’s squirrel looking for some tasty oak nuts, jumped underneath the branch because snow there is the lightest, maybe there’s a stash there? When I was near I could hear it from a branch. Do you know a sound a squirrel makes?

We live, create time and transform, what else do we have?"

lonely,Any Advice For When People Won’t Leave Your Mind,"Any Advice For When People Won’t Leave Your Mind - This is a tough post to word properly,

You ever meet a person you kinda obsess over, not to the extent of anything serious, but you just find yourself thinking about them all day.

That person you want to talk to all day and night, just to learn about them and grow closer.

Now I’ve had this with romantic crushes and friends crushes.  I’ll be watching tv and find myself going “wow I wish [random person] was here to enjoy this with me. Sometimes I’ll be drawing and really like how it comes out and want to show it said person to impress them.

I’m aware how childish this sounds, but please note these are thoughts deep within the back of mind that push themselves forward through the day.

Now it’s easy to blame the fact I’m not with the people I want to be with on the cause of loneliness, but I find it’s more the unreciprocated emotions that bum me out.

Anyways, I just wanted to see if I’m the only one or if anyone has any advice?"

I miss my friends but we don’t really message each other, and we never really have. We’ve spoken a few times in zoom, but our friend group is so large that it doesn’t really work. 

It is only in person when we are really really great friends, when we can talk and joke about anything and have a great time.

I know we’re all going through a hard time but I really really miss everyone. I’m an introvert but I have reached my limit of being at home all the time, of only seeing classmates online, of only spending time with 3 family members, of only keeping contact with 3 friends.

I need hugs. Really badly.
Please God, let this pandemic end.
I can’t stand it anymore.

I guess I need to get this off my chest I'm so sick of it and so sick of myself reaching THIS LEVEL of sad.

I hate nsfw conversations with a passion, but it got to a point to where it's the only social interaction I can have. even if its about nsfw things, at least someone is talking to me and keeping me from feeling lonely. 

Some guys on here (key word some) are hypocrites. they claim they want someone to be friendly with them and reach out which I used to do couple of months ago, Either I get ignored or when they reply they stop talking to me cause I'm keeping it friendly with them, isn't that what you want? or are you just seeking attention lol? they will only KEEP TALKING if I make it nsfw. so I ended up doing that but I hate it. and I have to stop but if I do I'll feel the most alone. I'm expecting to get hate for this but idc at this point someone had to say it."

I have a Legit  micropenis and cant have sex so can never have a gf. 

renting a small dark flat all alone in here , reddit is my only contact with the world and sometimes when i go to shops or the barber.

if i had a gun id have shot myself by now.

i had a few friends in life i didnt appreciate them and got angry and fought with them due to anger issues when they said even small things that shouldnt end a friendship. i wish i could turn back time and have them again . 

try not to fight , always appreciate a person who genuinely wants to be your friend no matter what they look like or job they do etc.

if they say something u dont like , dont throw them away with harsh words. 

handle things in a good way.

i hope this can help some people . you dont want to be a 33 year old loser like me all truly alone and full of regret ."

lonely,What’s the point?,"What’s the point? - What’s the point of self improvement if theres no one else there to see it? I hate myself and no amount of “self improvement” is going to change that, why try if in the end it doesn’t even matter? I’m going to be alone my entire life so there’s no point in trying to improve, I’ll never be happy with my self, I’ll never love myself and I’ll never have anything I can be proud of. I’ve never accomplished anything meaningful and never will, I’m failing at the most simple parts of life. I can’t socialize which is the worst part, it seems pretty fucking easy for almost everyone except me. Again why try and improve if it’s all for nothing, If it’s just a fruitless effort that at the end of the day will change nothing? I’ll never know what it’s like to truly be loved for who I am. No one even knows the real me, if they did they would hate who I am. I’ll never have a gf which hurts the most, fuck I’ll never even have friends. All the “friends” I’ve had were all full of shit, they didn’t really care about me. Why would you care about me? I’m a boring, useless, waste of space and time, I’m a leech who should be forgotten about. There’s no point to any of this so why? WHY? Why keep going when I’ll never get to a place where I’m content with life, with who I am as a person? Life is meaningless, it’s just endless purgatory. Fuck life and fuck my stupid fucking brain, why can’t I just be normal?! Why can’t I talk to people without feeling the urge to run away? Fuck it, if I wasn’t too much of a pussy I’d have ended it by now."
lonely,Asking for help,"Asking for help - I'm (20 M) been a foreigner medstudent for 3 years now, and I've been feeling loneliness constantly, I've asked for help lots of times before but to no avail, i suffer from severe anxeity and insomnia for as long as i can remember... the way i dodge this feeling was by doing excessive physical exercises and/ or studying for exaggerated periods of time... though it made me gain confidence and boosted my performance academically... however lately group mates have seen me talking to myself while walking, I find myself saying things out loud, though i thought they were only thoughts in my head, insomnia problems in which i will not sleep and if i did i will keep on waking up every 1-2 hours.. thus, went through 4 plans none of which actually worked

Plan1: I created a regimen in which i had positivity as the main characteristic, did not work out, got called out fake and kept on only getting hate and disrespect ... 

Plan2: i signed up for a gym and went there everyday, i only exerted all negativity there .... didn't work as people there got scared of me

Plan3: tried to keep in touch, text as much as i can, call and check on everyone i knew but to no avail, everyone who answered expected that i needed something, though i never asked for anything, nobody wanted to prolong the conversations, they only wanted to end it... which made me feel indignant

Plan4: i go to uni, do my clincal rotations, then go to the gym daily, and maybe a part timer in the weekends just to feel busy.... and that only gave me fatigue and depression 



..... asking for help, please!"

Is Ghosting now part and parcel of normal human interaction. It happens so often,  it normalises this behaviour.

 Does it change the way we interact with others?

Do we need to remain on guard or fully aware that at one particular moment this person may likely just disappear?

Are you less trusting of others? Do you think your emotions or feelings count for much? Are we becoming less empathetic?

I kinda feel society is becoming less interconnected and much more individualistic, instead of attempting to connect more with people we are becoming more distant."

lonely,Today's advice from a Veteran of Loneliness,"Today's advice from a Veteran of Loneliness - Not sure what to say today. Sometimes I wake up in pain, feeling how empty things are right now. The horroring silence to the disconnection  I feel everyday. 

I try not to think about. Once i start my daily routines and hobbies, I'm in endurance mod, filling my time up with personal interests. A distraction from reality. For none of us is supposed to be fully immersed in our own pain 24/7, lest they want to torture themselves. 

In loneliness is pain. Pain that never ends. I felt how maddening it can. Corrosive. Acidic. Eating at your soul everyday. Dying everyday without a chance to live.

It's awful. It's painful. Its excruciating agonizing. 

But like I said before, it won't be forever. Not if you have the power of choice. 

Many things people do, sane or not, are all attempts to keep themselves afloat and from falling apart. Jobs, stories, lies, delusions. Everyone is trying to make it past the day, but not everyone knows how.

The pain of the lonely is a test of the Endurance of the soul. If you can live past it, you can withstand anything life can throw at you.

But never be afraid of being lonely again. That's a cataclysmic fear that can destroy your soul. 

If you are scared of it, embrace it. Feel it. The fear. The pain. The suffering. So you know it's not something to be scared of. But a shaper of souls like how work outs damage but shape the body.

So too is the pain of loneliness. For it's only those who suffer constantly who understand the value of love, family, friends. And its in those souls who can be shield for the helpless."

AMA/Let me know your thoughts - Hi everyone, long time lurker, first time poster, trying to help my community in the pandemic and beyond.

The second the pandemic hit home I started thinking about my grandparents in a nursing home, my friends and family who lived alone and all the millions of people out there who just need someone to talk to in the age of social distancing.  

So I wanted to do something to help with my limited means and have come up with [Like Family Visits](https://www.likefamilyvisits.com).  It's a service that connects people that need someone to talk to with people who are great conversationalists, who care about others, and who are supportive and empathetic. We call them ""Visitors"" and they are essentially on call to be supportive, offer career or life advice during this crazy time, or just be a good friend.

The way it works is you go to the website and either submit a visit request where we match you, or browse interests or featured visitor profiles and book directly with someone.  If you want to talk to someone about something specific like a hobby or interest you don't see listed we can usually find someone in our network and get folks connected.  The Virtual Visits are conducted over Google Meets and are $20 for a 30 minute Visit.  $15 goes to the Visitor and $5 goes into keeping things operating.  The reason I decided to charge is I don't have the money to keep it going on my own and I feel like its a deterrent for folks that could abuse the service in some way - not trying to be the next chat roulette here.

One thing to note is we are not mental health experts or legal counsel or anything like that.  We're really here to be supportive to folks who need a listening ear or a daily dose of motivation or just a friend.

If anyone wants to test it out and/or let me know your thoughts I'd really appreciated it.  I created a coupon code ""Lonely"" for 10 free Visits for this group. I'd like to know if people thought this was something worth pursuing and if there are any ideas on how to make it better at addressing loneliness.  

Anyway, just a regular person here, trying to help.  Not sure if it will become anything, but I want to try to do what I can.  Feel free to AMA. Thanks everyone."

I've been alone pretty much 100% of it so far. I just work, come home and practice guitar (which I suck at), jog, cook dinner, read and go to bed. Same thing every day for months now. It started even before the winter, really.

I decided on a whim to take a vacation. I have 10 days of paid time off accumulated and I was so certain that it was just the horrid winters of the northeast getting me down. So I took a drive all the way down to Florida and got a hotel. It was great the first night, but now as I walk around this sunny, warm town and see all the people with their friends and families, it becomes so apparent to me that the weather has nothing to do with it; I'm just a lonely person. Hell, the warmth is almost worse. I can use the bad winter weather as an excuse to never leave the house, but here it's sunny, right on the beach and absolutely perfect out. And I have no one in my life and nothing to do. It's almost like the good weather has me more depressed because there is so much potential fun to be had and I'm having none of it.

I don't really have any friends or family. Never really have. I have no goals, no real passions, no desires. I'm just this empty shell and I'm so aware of that fact that I can't bring myself to talk to anyone. I don't even know why I'm typing this, I guess just to pass the time."

lonely,Why do I start disliking someone after opening up to them?,"Why do I start disliking someone after opening up to them? - So I just ranted randomly to this person, I don't know if I would call her a friend. Honestly, I have a hard time determining my distance with others. I think it's the first time I ever expressed to her how I'm lonely, and just, you know, typical ""no one understands me or checks up on me"" emotions that everyone feels. She  said, thank you for trusting me and being vulnerable, so it was an okay conversation. 

God, I sound so weird right now.

When she was saying those things to me, my thoughts are like lol ""it's not that deep why are you being all concerned umm what?"" Hahaha. I dislike it. Now I feel like I'm being pitied. Ah it's so shameful. I don't want to rely or talk to this person for awhile."

lonely,I've been constantly rejected during all my life,"I've been constantly rejected during all my life - I never had friends in childhood, since I started going to school other kids made fun of me, and I wasn't interested in socializing at all. Every person I have been in love with has rejected me and every time it happened it was extremely painful. Also, I don't remember the last time I felt emotionally attached to my family.

Now I am unable to bond with other people, and although I have some friends I don't feel anything towards them and I'm still lonely when they are around. The only times when I do love someone it's always someone who doesn't want me, and I become very dependent. I just want to have normal relationships, I feel very lonely all time but being people doesn't make me happy either, I don't know how to change this."

lonely,How is it possible to feel so alone when in a relationship?,"How is it possible to feel so alone when in a relationship? - My partner does what Gottman calls stonewalling. But it's more than that. He says he cares, but none of his actions reflect that. Any time I try to share what I'm feeling or something that has hurt me he gets defensive, becomes purposefully argumentative, will take things I say and then try to use them against me and then finally just shuts down. He has been caught in several (somewhat trivial) lies and has only ever been able to finally agree that he ""misled"" me. He broke two major promises to me and his response was that he shouldn't have made those promises. It seems anything he says can change to fit the situation and I'm left feeling like he doesn't care about me at all and not know what to believe and what not to believe. 

He isn't like this all the time. 90% of the time he is a fantastic partner, but the other 10% is awful and just slowly tearing me down. He will admit sometimes that he knows he does these things and wants to work on them, but then never does. We have an appointment to begin couples counseling but honestly, I'm not convinced that it going to help either. 

I just feel so alone. I feel like the person I spend my life with should be consistent, trustworthy (transparent), show that he cares and truly be my person, my best friend, and the one who is always in my corner. Am I being unrealistic?"

lonely,"My best friend and I have drifted apart, I guess this is the end","My best friend and I have drifted apart, I guess this is the end - Years ago we would always talk. Every day in fact. Whether it was in school or at home, we'd always message each other. We'd talk about stuff that was going on, stories, etc. Even when we went to different schools we were messaging each other everyday. Politics, religion, games, sports, relationships, culture. We'd agree to most stuff, and when we disagree we'd talk about that too. He just got it. Play online games too. Especially important because we moved to different schools. We'd even meet up on occasion to go somewhere. Concerts, clubs, etc.

But during the months upcoming to the pandemic we kind of just drifted apart. He moved to a new place, as did I. We'd seldom talk, only catching each other online sometimes. Didn't help that I was at a different time zone. Eventually we just stop talking all together. 

There was this one time I found him online. Turns out he forgot his password. I said hello, he said hello. Some small talk here and there, new tinder dates, but that feeling of connection was lost to me.

I don't know why, but I haven't been itching to talk about things that we'd normally talk about. No more politics, no more culture, no more sports, no more games. It's just emptiness.

I had other friends growing up, don't get me wrong, but he was my best friend for a reason. The longest friendship I had. He was the only one that got me. Now we've drifted apart. I fear that I'd never find anyone that would get me like him.

Miss him bros."

Every time I try to visualize where I’ll be in the future, I get a vague sense that I’ll either be dead or spending my life alone isolated from everyone else. I have terrible self esteem it’s basically crippled any lasting chances I got at making normal friendships and relationships. Sometimes I think of the little impact that my death would be on those around me and how problematic I am as a person that’d it’s factual that my death would be beneficial if anything and even if people are impacted then it’s only a matter of time tuition they move on.."

lonely,I see my life as a bargaining chip.,I see my life as a bargaining chip. - I am at a point where I don’t care what happens to myself.The only time I get upset anymore is when my father creates negative thoughts to my sister. My little sister is only 16 and she’s already upset by how she’s living there with her dad. He’s a toxic and manipulating person who does not deserve his kids. My sister and I grew up in the foster system for many years until my dad supposedly changed for the better and got her but I chose to stay in the system because I knew if I lived in the house with that same me and I would’ve been gone a long time ago. Recently he’s been calling her all these names he’s been controlling her nonstop and giving her no chance to spread her wings or make her own decisions and she’s just ending up in her room alone with no one which is concerning because of this it’s not what should be happening to her. So now he’s making all these comments about her weight in mind you that she is petite. She’s not overweight and I’m afraid she’s going to grow with the eating disorder if he continues to be like that he compares my sister to my mother who is overweight but my mother isn’t in the picture anymore because my dad continue to push her away and she’s doing very well now on her own I’m the only person that keeps in contact with her and lets her know how my little sister is doing. Personally I’ve done a lot to try to help to negotiate to argue to fight to plead to my dad tell her I am that what he’s doing he’s going through a very negative impact on his youngest daughter and he’s going to lose her I feel like if I lost my life that would create an impact on him and he would realize that he should be taking more care of his daughters. Maybe then he’ll finally learn to appreciate what he has in his life. I don’t care if I’m not there anymore as long as I know that what I do could make a difference to how my dad treats my sister.

lonely,I feel invisible,"I feel invisible - I feel invisible, like I don’t even exist. When people are having conversations I’m almost never included and if I am I end up being interrupted and/or ignored. I feel like an extra in a movie, I’m there but no one ever pays attention to me, they never care about what’s going on in my life or how I feel. I’m destined to be alone and it fucking hurts so much! I’m so tired of being unable to socialize properly, I can barely talk to anyone except my parents, I long for a relationship but know deep down it will never happen. If I can’t even make friends how am I supposed to find someone who will love me and care about how I feel, someone who I can love and cherish? Well I’m never going to find that so I should just fucking give up, I am a failure in almost every aspect of life, especially my social life. Things don’t get better so why keep going? I don’t have what it takes to make changes so I’m going to be this way for the rest of my short life. I’m unattractive as well as socially inept and no one wants to be friends me, let alone date me. I hate almost everything about me and I’ll never have the ability to make the changes I need to make. Anyways no one gives a fuck about my stupid sob story I just needed to vent, I’m sure no one will see this anyways so I don’t know why I bothered to write it. God I wish I wasn’t even fucking born sometimes."
lonely,Never been loved,Never been loved - Title speaks for itself. Both of my roommates are in relationships I usually just hang out by myself and drink/cry myself to sleep.

lonely,I don’t know if I’m thinking too far ahead,"I don’t know if I’m thinking too far ahead - So I () used to be super depressed about being lonely. And by lonely I mean I had no girlfriend which doesn’t seem like a big deal, especially at my age, but I used to get so down about it all. I think I cried 95% of the times I got drunk with mates, I would sit and cry myself to sleep over it. 

I’m better now, but sometimes I just sit and wish I had that one special person to turn to and just be with. I think the main reason I’m better off now is because I lost a lot of weight and I feel so much better about myself, whereas before I felt genuinely hopeless. 

I’ve liked 3 people over the last 3 or so years and 2 of them I’ve just ended up super close friends with and as for the other we don’t talk anymore. I’m just not sure whether I’m thinking too far ahead because sometimes I think that all I want is somebody to love and I don’t care about much else (the exceptions being family, friends, other important things etc). But all of the things I did for fun weren’t fun anymore and sometimes I just wished that I could find somebody. It also doesn’t help how I have moderate anger issues.

I just didn’t know if I was looking too far ahead, and if it’s generally normal for someone my age to feel that way."

When I ask about her new school she just says it's busy but she loves it, but the other day she complained a lot about it to other friends. She used to send me memes and stuff but now she doesn't... I don't know. I feel kind of left behind and it maybe sounds like little things but it makes me feel really lonely. When I brought up this thinks they say that nothing has changed or that they are fine, so I don't really know what else to do. I feel like I'm forcing them to talk to me and that makes me feel like garbage. Today I felt really angry with everyone and wanted to just be alone and not deal with them but I don't know. Some days I feel I just imagine things but other days like today I feel really angry and want to yell. I don't really have other friends or spaces of socialization because I'm stuck at home.

Next to most guys I look like a goblin on account of my fucked up face, short stature and unimpressive dick, which not even hundreds of thousands of dollars of surgery could fix. I'm short, small-dicked, and generally ugly, but these guys post a single nude pic and get more thirst and appreciation for *just being themselves* than I've ever gotten in my life after all my yearning hours of trying to impress people.

I feel like so much of culture is reaffirmation of the superiority of the beautiful. Whether it's dicks, jawlines, your height, your face, your perfect oh-so-perfect mix of genetically endowed features that make it seem like divine providence that you bless us with your good looks. It's all a big flesh fair, a cruel zero-sum game that every brain in the human race is hooked into.

More than anything I'd like to be someone's erotic fantasy, but I can't even get a date with anyone at or even below my ""league"". I'm not handsome, I'm not turning any heads, but is that so much a crime that I ought to stay on the sidelines the rest of my life while everyone else has their fun?"

lonely,"I have a chance at a relationship; to be happy, but I am conflicted. I don't know what to do.","I have a chance at a relationship; to be happy, but I am conflicted. I don't know what to do. - Hello,

As I stated in the title, I have a chance to be in a relationship; a chance to be happy, however, it's a little more complicated than that.

What's the problem, you ask? Only a fool would deny themselves happiness, you might say. Well yes, but actually no. I am 25 and this girl is 17. That's the problem. 

Here in my country, legally we can date. However, I don't feel entirely comfortable with the idea of dating someone so much younger than myself, despite our feelings towards each other.

I have been depressed, lonely, single, socially awkward and introverted since I was 16. I am also a virgin, though I have no desire for sex; only to feel loved. I have few friends and it is difficult for me to make new friends as I am always judged before people get to know me. It has always been me against the world and I accepted that. I convinced myself that perhaps there isn't anyone out there for me.

For many years, I self-harmed. I attempted suicide on several occasions some years back. I never understood why I wouldn't die. Perhaps this girl is the reason?

This girl makes me happy. I feel things I have never felt before; things I never thought possible. I have never spoken to anyone as much I talk to this girl. She makes me laugh and smile, which I usually don't do. She makes me feel loved and she doesn't judge me. She likes me for me; geekiness and all. She treats me like a person and she genuinely wants to spend time with me.

Myself and this girl have had many a discussion about us and have agreed to stay friends for the time being. We both know how we feel each other, and she understands the difference in age is an issue for me.

I don't know what to do. I have a chance to be happy; a chance at a better life. Do I deny myself this over the age or do I take a chance? Is it wrong of me to feel this way about someone so young?

I am genuinely conflicted."
lonely,I feel starved for touch and affection.,"I feel starved for touch and affection. - The pandemic has been rough for everyone, and I feel like the isolation hasn’t been good for too many people. I wish I could just snuggle with someone (not even sexually), but I can’t search for that with the pandemic raging on. I can’t ask my roommates because none of them would wanna cuddle with me even if it were platonic hahaha. Lately, I’ve been putting in more effort in expressing my emotions, and I’ve taken to telling my friends that I love them. I just wish my friends would tell me that they love me too. It just feels like they feel obligated to respond in order to make the situation not awkward. Sorry, I just had to vent."

lonely,Does anyone else ever feel like they may be destined to be unhappy forever?,"Does anyone else ever feel like they may be destined to be unhappy forever? - You got it good. Decent family, in college, girlfriend, trust fund incoming, whatever. Yet you’re unhappy then as you were before. 

I’m not sure what it is. I work out sometimes, I have a relatively privileged life and I’m not in any shitty circumstances.

Yet I always feel as though being unhappy is my fate. Nothing in life has ever really made me happy, except for a few things. And I get the sense no matter what I do, I’ll never be happy. Not with people, not with friends, nothing, cause I’ll always know deep down, that humans always just want something from the other, intentions are never pure. You’re never the first choice. Their desire for you is never pure. 

Maybe it’s time to just forget about all of those things. 

Maybe they recommend depressed people to “occupy their mind” so they can not see those things as much as they do. Maybe it’s all true, but somehow, if you want to live a positive life, you can’t have those thoughts too often. 

So do we spend our lives pushing through and avoiding pain?

Anyone else ever feel this way? 

I can’t tell if I’m really depressed, or if I’m onto something, something that has been gnawing at me for years."
lonely,Animals are so much better than people,"Animals are so much better than people - They value the only things that actually matter, like love, gentleness, kindness and affection. Interacting with people just means having to deal with deceit, bias, prejudice, contempt, jealousy, insecurity, selfishness, bigotry, dismissal, rejection and hypocrisy. You give animals love, they give it back. It's so simple and liberating. The only downside is that they are completely dependent on you. To some, that may be all you'd need to be happy. But sometimes I feel like I want to have the option to feel vulnerable and dependent on another. But of course that's not allowed. You have to focus on your ""self-love"" and all that. I can wrap my hands around my back and pretend to kiss myself all day (like that guy in that one SpongeBob episode), it doesn't change anything. I love myself plenty. Doesn't change the fact that no one else ever will."

I know it's best, I know everything is what it should be, but I am already tired of being alone.

The major person is grandpa, he died when I was in Jr. High. My dad replaced my brother and me with his new kids.

lonely,Is it too late?,"Is it too late? - I guess this is more of a vent but Im genuinely in need of answers at this point, so if anyone has any ideas for how I can get out of this situation, I would be more than grateful.

A tiny bit about me: I grew up in a different country before being sent to boarding school in my land of origin, which I hated, now Im 21, on a European exchange for uni and Im more lonely than ever.

I have this foreboding sense that its too late now. Too late to make lifelong friendships. Too late to learn how to make those friendships. Too late to learn how to connect with my generation. Ive lost touch with all my childhood friends. I have a couple of strong friendships from school and uni but I sense us growing apart due to covid and life in general, despite my best efforts. 

I meet new people all the time, but communication, real communication, is so so difficult. Its just small talk, all the time. The same questions, the same jokes, the same responses, every time. I really try to open up to people and have a meaningful conversation where I learn something and they learn something, and we make each other laugh and feel good and express ourselves. But it rarely happens. 

Its a vicious, vicious cycle. The more time passes without those strong friendships, the more alienated I feel from my generation, which makes me more self-conscious, which makes it harder for me to relax and be confident and connect with people and make those friendships. I swear to god theres no template for people like us. 

I’m not a terrible person. I’m also not a shy or sexually inactive person. I just think my circumstances in life have pushed me down the path of solitude and I’ve realised it too late.

Again, Im all ears to anything you good people might have to say, and I hope it might help other people in a similar situation to me."
lonely,"Does anybody just think ""Yeah, this year is when I turn it around"" ?","Does anybody just think ""Yeah, this year is when I turn it around"" ? - I spend maybe weeks trying my best to battle depression, ADHD, and ASD1. It was awesome to see some redditors in my home city to help me by providing the necessary resources for me and overall trying to motivate me to come with them on walks (I appreciated this, it was an awesome gesture.).  

I try to make friends over that period by trying to talk to my classmates, labmates, or joining activities. Not really any progress, like people consider me to be a friend now. But it seems like I am only the one that messages first. Additonally, if people do message me, it's usually asking for help about their experimental design.... 

I tried dating... I get rejected all the time, which I don't mind because if anything it motivates me to try and work on myself. However, it makes me sad sometimes because I never been on an official date before. Plus, never had a real connection with someone or kissed a girl or had sex before. I've had a pseudorelationship before (as my therapist calls it since they claim the it was all one sided on my end in regards to effort), we never had an official date...

I tried to be healthy, such as eat right and be fit. Unfortunately, I can't make any progress. My family knows I am extremely vulnerable to junk food, and I kindly asked of they could limit buying it or making it (I know I am a piece of shit, but I seriously have a problem with unhealthy food). Due to quarantine rules, I can workout at home, which I don't mind, however my family barely puts any effort to look after my dog for an hour (I love my dog, but I'm so scared of hurting her with a weight or when doing body exercises that require lots of motion. )

I tried to turn it around and have consistent habits but at this point I think I want to give up. Give up trying and give up on living. I honestly don't mind dying at this point, whether I blow my brains out or just from an accident/natural causes. 

Just a rant I guess. Sorry about that."

Its probably abnormal behavior to think about people I BARELY know to this extent but its pretty fun talking to people that you appreciate even if its for a little while.

I've only got a couple friends left and I doubt I'd even talk to them if I didn't message them first. I've been actively looking now for about 8 years to find someone, and the only one I've found didn't feel the same way, and I couldn't cope and ruined our friendship. That was almost 6 months ago and I'm still not over it.

I now fully believe that some people are just destined to be alone, and that's ok. I used to be fairly content with my single life so my goal now is just to return to that state. I'm not emotionally intelligent enough to handle the complexities of a real relationship so I'll stop looking.

I know it won't make me happy, but it might at least stop me being miserable all the time. Perhaps then I'll have the energy to put into other things that might finally help me find happiness."

lonely,No ones gonna read this whole thing but I need to get it out,"No ones gonna read this whole thing but I need to get it out - I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing. I’ve basically lived in solitude for the past 10 years only socialising when in relationships and they’ve all been toxic and has broken me down to nothing. I feel I don’t have any more to give and time is passing extremely slow and way too fast at the same time.. I’m constantly either bored out of my mind or overwhelmed as f. I feel I have wasted my 20s.. Something triggered me today. A few years ago I fell for a guy who eventually ghosted me and hurt me badly. He messaged me today in a cute way and it made me a little happy and I felt a hint of a life spark in me. At the same time I felt guarded and didn’t want to let him in again. I replied with something I thought was a flirty joke but that he actually got offended by and he started producing walls of texts yelling at me. I started crying and was immediately brought back to when he hurt me in the past. Idk what the f happened, I was so confused by his anger. It brought me to such a dark place and I couldn’t do anything but stare into the wall feeling like shit for the rest of the day. I feel my life has just been a train wreck so far and I’m so tired of picking up the pieces trying to stay together. I want to scream. And just run until I’m so far away I could never go back. I remember when I was a suicidal teenager and people kept saying “just stick it out, it gets better” and I thought maybe, when I’m an adult I’ll be free and it will be worth waiting for. Now I feel I wish I kinda would have ended it back then so I wouldn’t have to experience the last 10 years. I think of the person I used to be and the person I was supposed to become and it just breaks my heart. I wish I was able to be my own best friend. I’m so mean to myself. I usually don’t feel that lonely but I’ve recently moved and can’t really settle in the new apartment. Everything feels wrong. I can’t relax and I can’t get a fucking break. Like when am I finally gonna be free? I don’t know if it’s myself or society but I feel complete and utterly trapped. And lost.. I have no direction. I don’t believe in love anymore and all the dreams I used to have so vividly are just dead in the cold ground. I can’t find home. TV-shows leave me feeling empty and heartbroken when they end. To a degree where I feel adamant to start a new one.. same way with relationships. I don’t want any more pain. I just want everything to go away.  

But hey.. what if something awesome happens in 20 years.. I guess I’m gonna die someday anyway.. what’s the hurry. Just exist to exist. Exist not to hurt my family. I’m sick of thinking. I do have cats tho and they need me so I’ll at least be around until they leave me.

Then they block me simply because I don’t have a job. Does that mean they’re fake if they’ll only be friends with me if I have a job? I get why you think that but do you need a job to have friends now? I know this may sound stupid but this is my experience and I can’t take this anymore I might be alone for life. I get jealous when I see happy groups of friends. I wish I met a friend who doesn’t care what I do with my life and likes me for me

My dad fought against the injustice in his life and is in law school now. But his actions never lined up with anything he said to me, or my mom.  

My mom won’t let me contact him because of his toxic behaviour. I have so many questions for my dad, questions my mom can’t answer and I don’t want to ask her. He recently came up on sexual invitation to touch and stuff charges, my mom still won’t say a bad word about him.

I no longer drink, it cost me a meaningful relationship so I'd prefer if you didn't but if you must, please be able to handle yourself. 
I am 420 friendly. I dont judge, I play games. I dont get mad when I lose because I used to compete for money so anything less feels like child's play.

Sure, it would be nice to have somebody to be close to, to not be lonely anymore, but the more I thought about the reality of dating someone, the more I realized that I kinda just want to be alone. 
I think I don't want a relationship, I just want what a relationship represents to me. Things like intimacy and a confirmation that I'm desirable. 
I also realized that I had been affected by this societal expectation, this subconscious peer pressure, that tells us that relationships are the norm and that our lack of one makes us ""worse"" than ""normal"" people. 
I've felt a bit better since, more content with being by myself."

We have nowhere to turn and nowhere to go.  No one will take us in. Opportunities and support just seem to be nowhere to be found for us.  I saw a post further down that wondered how it would be if there was a community for those of us that feel lonely or lost irl.  I had an idea to form a subreddit where not just those suffering from loneliness but pretty much everyone who is lost during this time could create a community and potentially start a movement irl. I created the subreddit and aptly named it r/thelostpeople. One thing that so many of us have in common during these soul crushing times is that we are lost in endless loneliness and have no one to guide us. Here, those of us that are lonely, lost, and adrift can come together and have a voice for the first time in years."

I'm planning to leave my country at some point in the next few years and go somewhere where the only people I'll know are family and its creeping up on me that I wish I was going with someone I was building a home with.

I've seen acts of selfishness I hate to recall and some precious few acts of selflessness I hang onto for hope. 

But, I cant help but believe that no one truly cares about his fellow human especially if it doesnt benefit him/her. 

Idk what category I fall into. But I bet someone out there feels I'm selfish too. Anyone reading this might too. I dont want to believe it but humans can be so rotten. And its moments like those where I hate my human identity, because I might not be any different.

Ever been crying in your room, screaming silently so as not to alarm your family? When you put on music to hide any possible sound coming out of your mouth or you take a shower to camouflage any sad tear? 

It’s so easy to draw lines and set boundaries between yourself and people who surround you. It’s so easy to live this “second life” where pain is all you know.

There is more to the story and I have some blame but I have a feeling that am in an abusive friendship where I give and receive nothing and she blames me for everything.

Quit my job, lost my car, lost some friends.  She frankly just got tired of constantly having to push someone to be normal. (very understandably so.) She just wanted a damn man, and I just couldn't do that for her, I'm not a confident person and I dont know how to tackle life. I know she's insurmountably more happy now, and I should be happy about that, but you know, it's hard to imagine your ex girlfriend of 6 years getting railed by a dude with a bigger dick and more money and an actual plan at life. Kinda fucked up that I deprived her of a good life for so long honestly.  Its also annoying thinking about how everything he does better than me, she probably thinks ""wow my ex never did this "" or ""wow you're so much better than what im used to""
She probably vocalises to her new partner too, which is embarrassing. So yeah,  since August 2019 I've been sitting in my room doing fuck all. This past November my PC broke so I can't even distract myself anymore. And I've given up on the prospect of getting over her because I never even really got over my first ex from 2013.

Met a girl that made me feel like I wasn't so alone and we had probably some of the best experiences in my life together. We have an amazing friendship and great chemistry all the way around. Since early this week I've been really depressed. Knowing I wouldn't get to spend time with her for a while made it worse. On top of that my hobbies stopped feeling enjoyable. I decided to drink a little out of boredom and now my problem is back. Also her phone is messed up and I don't receive all of her txt which means I don't reply and she worries. I feel like the universe is trying to keep me and everything I love away from eachother. So in a state of perpetual disgust for my self I masterbate sometimes for days on end. I decided to stop today and try to enjoy the things that used to make me happy, but I just feel numb and hopless. Sorry for the gross details I just needed to vent."

I like to be alone. To be with my thoughts, a book, or drawing/painting something. Playing games on my phone or console. But when it gets too much, I sometimes think just how many people remembers me or think of me from time to time. If someone, somewhere out there, remembers me as someone who've made an impact in their life. And times like this, the silence of the messages and group chats that brings peace to my life seems to bring the realization that I'm alone AND lonely

I'm fine during the day but it's when that sun goes down that I realize how truly alone I am... How not even my cat can make me feel less alone in the world... I just want more people to match my level of caring... Out of my entire 20 years on this planet soon to be 21... I have only met one other person who is like me... Who I truly vibe with... And it sucks when I'm about to lose my best friend in a month because they are moving to Canada... They said we would play video games and talk all the time but it's different when we've been hanging out two to three times every week for the past three/four months... The only person that has ever matched my vibe and feels like they genuinely care... And I'm losing them... I thought I had met another person like that before them... This one was a romantic relationship... And it's destroyed me... I believe that I was actually driven to a point that I would not have normally gone because of them... I believe that I was being gaslit...  I actually felt insane and thought insane thoughts... Thoughts that I never put to action thankfully... But still thoughts nonetheless... And to top it all off when I randomly got high and decided to text her... She said I was one gaslighting her... I still can't get her out of my brain... Everywhere I go I just see her...

lonely,Why do I always have to text first to have any chance at social interaction?,"Why do I always have to text first to have any chance at social interaction? - None of my family members or ""friends"" ever text me first. The only time they do is when they need something. I always try to help and be there for people and always just get kinda dropped as soon as my help isn't needed anymore. My ""friends"" usually take between a day and two weeks to answer me on any text messages, if they answer me at all. I'm never invited to anything.

I understand that nobody owes me their time and I'm not entitled to anyone's attention. I'm just wondering why it's such a common thing for me. Why does this exact thing happen with every single ""friend"" I've ever had? Why *am* I never worth anyone's time? I'm not even mad at specific people, I'm just starting to become really cynical about the whole idea of friendship. I'm starting to feel it doesn't actually exist, and the sooner I get used to that idea and just go my own way, the better."
lonely,Why can't there be communities such as this one but irl?,"Why can't there be communities such as this one but irl? - It sounds like it could be a disaster but I'd be tempted to risk going to such a group. So many people here seem to be kind souls that just want a little love but they have nobody. We all know what it's like to endure this pain. Those of us still afflicted with hope are still holding out that maybe, someday, the right person may show up and take interest - offering us a chance at a social life.

A place for people without connections to seek connection. Maybe it's a pipe dream that such a group could maintain itself. No doubt a good amount of us have developed some rather dark aspects of ourselves. Maybe, instead of a support group, it'd end up as some sort of co- dependency group where we echo chamber ourselves into further segregation away from the rest of the world. Maybe we'd all sing ""woe is me"" and grow tired of one another. Idk. But the other possibility of having a genuine support group is nice. How genuine could it be if we are all seeking for ourselves? In-group drama seems inevitable - especially if any amount of romantic feelings were to get involved. I have a suspicion that there would far more guys than gals in such a group - and even in this subreddit. Not saying it's ""easier"" for women, btw. I just feel like most posts I see venting about desiring a partner is from the perspective of a male - I could be projecting and giving into confirmation bias, though. Wouldn't want a situation of a handful of girls having to deal with a mass of desperate orbiters.

But it begins to feel like a fantasy. In theory, everyone would know that everyone else is suffering in a way similar to them. We'd have no need to hide that aspect of ourselves because it is precisely that aspect which unites us. It's no secret that we'd be there seeking a connection and that we don't have that in our lives. A lot of us are depressed and lacking in hobbies and the like. Maybe this could be a chance to explore this world together? But a bunch of ""broken"" people together trying to figure things out could end up like ""the blind leading the blind.""

Kinda just thinking out loud. There would definitely have to be some sorts of activities - I mean we have gotta *do* something or else we may all end up casting shadows on the walls of the room as we sit behind our phones unsure what to say.

Me? I'd be willing to try anything so long as I had someone to do it with. But most people who have something to do are developed in that activity and perhaps engaging a newbie is uninteresting. Maybe we could all just volunteer somewhere.

**Maybe someone here has had experience with such a group?** Please share if so.

Looks like I've listed a lot of possible reasons not to. But I do that for just about anything that piques my interest. I just desire to meet those who are *at my level* in a way. People who are too bright tend to blind me. People who are hateful to cope make me feel a mixture of sadness, empathy, panic, and anxiety as I know they are hurting and ignorant and just seeking relief but they are also damaging themselves and others in the process. Never sure how to handle them...."
lonely,I want to find love,"I want to find love - I’ve (22m) always been content being alone, in fact most the time I preferred solitude. Everything changed when I met a girl a few months ago. She is the first girl I’ve felt an attraction strong enough to actually breakout out of my shell and chase her. I’ve had crushes before but never did anything about them due to anxiety and shyness. Everything felt different with this girl, it all felt right, like it was suppose to happen. 

The thing is, she’s in an on and off again long term relationship that she will most likely never give up on and I was just there for her during the “off” times of that relationship. I slept with her a few times, and would text/snap her all the time. She woke up the feelings in me that desire intimacy. I’m laying in my bed this morning wishing she was here next to me."

But like I'm stuck a bit. I don't really know what to do to get out. I've never done it. I was happy gaming and now I'm not. But I have anxiety so doing anything alone is nerve wracking. I don't have friends to go with and anxiety means it's distressing approaching strangers. I'm trying to find my social niche but have no idea where to start. 

I do know pubs are not my thing. I love to make people laugh with ridiculously bad puns and wordplay. I also like talking about science- particular interests are space, gravity, nature. I like to experiment with cooking but it's hard to get motivated to cook for one. I want to cook for someone! I like physical affection too but I can't keep pets where I live. Plus Tinder is crushing my self worth.

I feel like I need a buddy+wing man to help me get out and find myself and find love. The loneliness hurts."

lonely,Is happiness even a real thing?,"Is happiness even a real thing? - Are there even ""happy"" people, that go to bed and wake up feeling satisfied? That do not have emotional breakdowns every other day?

Or is everybody just trying to figure out a way to not be broken 100% of the time or at least not think about it?

Do we even have anything that we can aspire to obtain? Or is it just like this forever, abd if that's the case, how do we cope with that? 

Is happiness even a real thing?"

Someone with their own life and their own dreams and goals. 

Someone genuine.


A someone. 


---

So many people I meet day to day are just, they are sonder, sonder is the realization that every person has their own unique life going on with it's problems and joys, complex as they are just like yours. 


They are so sondered and that's great but there's something wrong with me, I don't attract *anyone*.

It's probably because I look a little weird, talk a little funny, it's definitely my unorthadox hobbies and passions and my minimun wage job. It's definitely my negative mental health which slips out constantly.

My few good friends got tired of my drama whilst we were together so I'm now on my own, save for my family (who I'm so grateful for, or I would be completely on my own.

lonely,Questioning everything,"Questioning everything - 27 year old male, married for 1 year. Aside of my wife (which feels like the marriage is failing) I have no one. Family is a few states away, old friends ended up drifting away, and I don’t connect with anyone at work. They are all twice my age, and only have negative things to talk about. It’s getting exhausting. It’s getting to the point that my life no longer actually feels real. I’m going through the motions, but disassociation is becoming a major issue. I do not feel alive. Human connection is so lacking that I feel all alone. My wife doesn’t even enjoy talking to me much. She’d rather smoke weed and stay on social media keeping up with the Jones. I don’t know what the hell to do. I tried local friend groups and meet up groups on Facebook but it’s all horny people looking for a quick fuck. This was most definitely not the life I had pictured for myself. Not sure where to go from here. Life is beginning to feel like a fucked up joke. I’m constantly waiting for something, but I never know what it is."

Did make a few, and tried inviting them to universal studios horror nights (been trying to go since my undergrad days but friends weren’t too keen so I stopped asking). 

Some people said yes, but then went with another group. What!? Ok... I can try next Halloween then... bam! COVID. Even harder to connect with my cohorts. Couldn’t even be bothered to ask anyone if they want to go to the stranger things drive through experience. Year pass for universal studios has long passed by this point anyway. Maybe I’ll renew if cousins from overseas visit...

I do not want to do these things alone! I wish I was more comfortable with being alone in public."

lonely,"Anyone else ever wake up, finally motivate enough to get out of bed, pee, realize how absolutely alone you are, get overwhelmed by it and just go back to bed?","Anyone else ever wake up, finally motivate enough to get out of bed, pee, realize how absolutely alone you are, get overwhelmed by it and just go back to bed? - Hit by the firehose only seconds after getting off the ground. 

It’s like humanity collectively and individually is telling me “STAY DOWN”, but I’m not ok with just giving up. Did that before and lost a decade, never again. 

Isolation is driving me crazy. I took a few days off of work because of burnout there, now the extreme isolation here, the problem is it’s all extremes lately. Way too much of this, way too little of that, nothing resembling balance, hit by firehoses in all directions while trying to yoga pose, and how to concentrate when my metaphorical stomach is so starved the hunger delirium started? 

I have one friend who I don’t want to lose with my “don’t know how to be happy” (oh you sweet summer child lol) so I’m not going to send another message when the past several weren’t replied to, and two distant acquaintances that I’m not that into. 

So now I’m in a world of strangers, a house but no home, no comfortable rest. On a wilderness trip that doesn’t end when you want it to. I’m trapped here...

I feel like someone going up in flames, crying out for help and becoming so hideous that people who might have helped are standing back letting me die as a mercy. I fight it, but why? Hope and belief in a better future, but it’s so dark now I can’t see the way out. 

Going to try to resist getting high again. Not sure it’ll even work starting from such a low place so early in the day. 

I’ll check meet up; looked there a long time ago, nothing seemed interesting, but I’m in a much darker place now, so maybe? If I can endure being vertical long enough to try every trick I know to get my vibe right (making breakfast, meditation and yoga, some self help book stuff), in hopes that I can have a few superficial human interactions today. Maybe more if that happens. 

Writing this to you all because there’s no one at the moment to listen. Y’all are like friendly but shy animals in the forest, nice to be around, but I long for a human to stand beside me and experience the forest, life is a much richer experience when shared with another person. 

Thanks for listening, or not, lol. Hope you all have a good day."

**Foreword:**

The afternoon is feeling rather fine today, the sun shining down on a weekend I hope will be become one where I feel rather content and calm. I recently provided some followers of these subs an overview of every year in my life. I sincerely thank you for all reaching out, it has been rather sobering to receive messages of such a positive and encouraging nature. Maybe I am being a little greedy in my pursuits, there are plenty of us here in need of companionship, but after so many of years of inner damage I need to rebuild myself from the ground up. I wish you all every success in these somewhat deep and unknown waters.

I also apologise if this too much for people to process... I just feel stuff like this at least requires some effort on the poster's part.

**Background:**

I was popped out many years ago in a county of England I consider to be most beautiful: [Cumbria](https://imgur.com/a/HfP0MI0)

Now, being born here has blessed me with a rather unique accent. Scottish-sounding to the untrained ear, I have been fortunate enough to possess the ability of confusing Southerners and the international community for many a year.

*- Any road, thoo'll tek nee notice so deek at me chewin me chuddy :) -*

I spent my formative years going through the primary school system, it was here I was generally a well-behaved child with great potential to succeed. I then moved to the secondary school system and grew to become the ~~little shit~~  wonderful and mature adult I am to this day. I left the school system once I got fed up of Tony Blair's weekly handout of 30 quid, for I wanted to start getting some money in my back pocket and do stuff... like, just stuff.

I pretty much spent my life doing a series of what you would call odd jobs:

* cracker packer in the local biccy factory.
* cleaner in a mental health hospital.
* two weeks demolishing a bull sperm farm. (affectionately referred to as bull w\*nker during this stint.)
* four days in a metal factory.
* eight years in the health and social care sector, mainly providing support to adults with profound learning disabilities
* Now working with young ones in an international school. The pay isn't the best, the commute is troublesome, but I like it enough to keep going for now :)

**Interests:**

Now, this is usually a difficult one for me to touch on and explain. It's difficult because I have spent so much of my time commuting and working... I have had very little time for much else in recent years. But here's a couple of snippets:

*Newcastle United:*

~~The one passion I have maintained over the years is supporting this roller coaster of a team. I have enjoyed heartbreak after heartbreak, the moment of near-glory, the pain of the ars\*hole the owns us and so on. I personally feels it's good to feel attached to something like a football club, the feeling of belonging and going through all the motions.~~

Mike Ashley, Steve Bruce and many others have absolutely sucked the joy I felt for this club right out of me. Pray for the takeover!

*Crafts:*

I've started to try my hand at making some little crafts and experiments. I present to you my new egg ball:

[Me egg :)](https://imgur.com/a/jB5d6gg)

*Postcards:*

Huge fan of giving and receiving postcards, and I have three right now I would love to send out to someone who maybe needs a little perking up :) It only takes a few minutes to write out a thoughtful postcard, don't know why more people don't do it, and I like the idea of something I wrote going out to all the corners of the world.

*Thank you to those kind souls sending postcards my way. I hope you're going to be happy with my choice for this round of postcards :)*

*Music:*

I am really never without my Pogues, Beautiful South, Mark Knoplfer, Queen, Erasure and all the others. Music can help us connect to some things we may be missing, allow us to explore more and try and to gain a better understanding. I have just set up a new Spotify account and would love to get sharing with some new people :)

[The song I've been fixed on this week](https://open.spotify.com/track/7JtjQViazKMkYIHTzFmOOs?si=888d55dbcf1340a3)

*Europe:*

Whilst I wish there was more countries I could say I've ticked off, I have been fortunate enough to experience Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Spain and Sweden. I have a particular fondness for Germany, I enjoyed Berling and Hanover, and I really want to get back out there once all this sh\*te has calmed itself down. I also want more key rings to added to my collection :) I think it's important to get out there and soak up other cultures and landmarks... imagine drifting through life and seeing nothing?

(I completely forgot about Denmark!)

*People with a story to tell:*

This is what I love most, probably why I post here on the hunt for new victims :P I like sharing, I have nothing to hide, and I want to hear from others. Tell me about the things that gets you going, the things that put you down. I enjoy the company of others and I feel it's really important to always try and connect with new people. We go through life and gain experience from so many people, good and bad, and we are sometimes fortunate enough to find one or two of those people stick around.

Oh!

*Beans:*

I like beans. I just do.

**Character:**

I like to believe I am open and honest individual, someone who wants to learn new things from others and try new experiences. I can have a weird sense of humour, but who doesn't? I have never been one for large crowds, this is owing to past experiences, but I am also not one who likes to shy away from the world.

Thoroughly enjoy being in the company of others, and whilst this has been lacking in recent years, I have always wanted to be a friend someone can rely on. I am not completely alone in this world, it would be a lie to say I was, but I don't have a huge circle either. I can sometimes be a little rough around the edges, a bit cheeky, but I do believe I am honest and caring when you get to know me.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The gritty stuff:**

I feel it is quite important to explain I am not without my skeletons in the closet, and there some things I would like thrown out straight away.

Firstly, I have had some mental health issues owing to past abuse and I have been working extremely hard on trying to make myself a better person. I am absolutely not here to offload my problems on to other people, it's not fair or appropriate, but I am an open book and will not shy away from any subjects of a more touchy nature. There will be days I want to be left alone with my thoughts, but they'll also be days when I want to share with you the latest exploits of whatever havoc I've been creating :)

I was also born with a chromosome disorder so I don't really look like what many would expect.I'm not a wonderfully attractive person, more Shane MacGowan, and I'm quite the little git. I'm not your manly man type, and here's a picture of me to try and explain my height restrictions: [my finest hour](https://imgur.com/a/7FTKe1f)

Again, I am open to discussion and will not boot you up the backside for mentioning this stuff :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Expectations:**

Honestly, should any of us be going into this with any expectations?

I'm not here to moan about how this sub and others work, it's pointless, but I am hopeful of finding some open-minded people. 

*Really, it is pointless to go about it. Just keep trying and see what happens, or stop and move onto something else.* 

I want to share with others, so should you, but I will never set demands on anyone. I will probably ignore messages or chat requests that offer very little, and you may very well decide to not pursue my replies out of lack of interest. It is okay to do this, we are never going to find everyone interesting or want be their friend!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Conclusion:**

~~I am now absolutely wank\*red after writing out all of this out :) This really is just a snippet!~~

*Actually, a lot of this has been copied all over. Partly because I don't know what other kind of approaches I can offer.* 

Replies don't come my way too much, but equally I look forward to talking to anyone who may want to reach out. My door is always open:)

lonely,Use.,"Use. - I recently got into an argument with a friend of mine I met on a dating app and now we don't talk. I made it clear if he wasn't interested in a relationship, all he had to do was tell me. When I visited I asked again in person if he was open to a relationship and he said he would ""feel things out"" and I took him at his word bc I as I told him I wanted to have honest communication. And this morning I asked where I stood with him and he got mad saying he isn't looking for a relationship, which was news to me as I told him periodically I'm interested in him and it's okay if he isn't which he never responded to. Now we don't talk. I feel so lead on, so used. I wanted to block him but I just deleted the app we moved to to talk regularly and the dating app entirely. I told him if he was ready to actually communicate with me he has my number but I feel like I'm just going to go back into the isolation I've had to deal with before meeting him. It hurts. I hope I get better soon, this feels so unbearable though I know it's temporary."

lonely,Having friends was nice,"Having friends was nice - I think i used to have friends in high school. Before high school all of my friends in grade school were just fake to me for some reason. I was in the same school for ten years and grew close to a few of them but now I realize that was all fake. My closest friend moved to LA a few years ago and whenever he says he’s coming back he says he’ll text me and we’ll hang out. Fast forward a few days and he’s posting on Instagram that he’s hanging out with other people from our old school and next thing I know he’s back in LA. 

Then came high school and I really thought I was close to some of them. Then after high school I never talked to any of them again. I leave for college and first day I’m there I actually made a few friends. They seemed like they liked for me who i was and actually like being around me. It was the best few days of my life. Then came the bad news, I didn’t fully pay for my semester and had to leave. Having to leave my dream college wasn’t the worst part it was leaving behind the new friendships I made. That was five years ago. I’ve been home ever since and I have no friends. The only person I talk to on a daily basis is my mom and even that is rare. Fuck I even tried to talk to people on social media, tried to make friends on there and i can’t. I just miss the connections ya know? Just being able to talk to people about something yet I fail. I feel like a failure of a person. 

I’m sorry to post this on here i don’t want to annoy anyone but I feel like i have very little to offer anybody anymore. I just want to know Im not a complete failure already. Being lonely is the worst feeling in the world."
lonely,What is wrong with me,"What is wrong with me - What’s wrong with me

Uh. What’s wrong with me

So. I hope im in the right spot. I searched communities. Found “relationships” then it popped up sub options. I selected “introvert” then it suggested I post here. So here it is

I’m 31. I live alone. I’m not particularly good looking. I don’t have a particularly good job. But other than that. I’m a pretty normal guy. I play music. Take care of my daughter. I like to cook and spend time with family. ... 

I’m alone. I’ve been alone almost ten years now. I don’t get any matches on any social dating sites. I don’t take great photos. And what else is there to go on it not a photo. 

Like. I just don’t it. Lots of people are a lot worse looking than me and find love. Or even the occasional hook up. 
A lot of people don’t even work. Are literal bums. Make the women pay for everything. And they find chicks. Someone times really attractive ones. 
A lot of people are less humorous, exciting, fun, smart, charismatic yet. They don’t seem to have a problem finding anyone. 

Maybe my standards are to high. 
I JUST WANT AN INTERACTION WITH A FEMALE ADULT. no standards. Are you a woman. Ok. You meet the standards. 

If you are lonely. And a woman. And also feel this way. We should be a perfect match. 

What’s wrong with me?

lonely,i'm so sad,"i'm so sad - i'm sad. i'm about to graduate high school and feel as if I have done nothing. I know this sounds stupid, but I just want to experience real love. But I don't have the guts to make a move on anyone. Just today I saw this girl who I liked freshman year was dating this popular dude in my grade. Don't get me wrong - I love the guy shes dating, but I don't know how much more of this I can take. My best friend has been dating his girlfriend for over a year, my other best friend is hooking up with girls left and right, and I just feel lonely. I don't want this to repeat in college, let alone the rest of my life. And on top of this, during COVID, my friends have started to leave me behind and don't always invite me to hang out like they used to. There's been so many nights where I've literally just felt alone and depressed. I still have a few close friends, but even with them, I don't hang out that much anymore. I'm just really really really really sad and don't know what to do with my life. All I want is to find love, but I'm scared I never will, and it just makes me so sad."
lonely,Crying on the highway,"Crying on the highway - It’s scary, you feel like you’re going to crash the car for sure, changing lanes are damn near impossible. 

I cried partly because the person I had sex with last night was really mean to me. I also cried because I couldn’t stop thinking about being in a genuine relationship. I kept contrasting the two and crying and driving.

I’m tired because I didn’t sleep much. I used to fantasise before falling asleep but I can’t think of things worth fantasising about anymore. Actually more accurately I can’t make myself believe the fantasies anymore. I can’t suspend disbelief."
lonely,Lonely and struggling to get drunk,"Lonely and struggling to get drunk - Mainly the drinking is prompted by loneliness, I just need anyone to talk to. I don't want to be alone. I'm trying to get drunk but I'm physically not taking it in. It was so bad, I had spit it into another glass. I can't make myself drink it. I just wanted to feel something."
lonely,"Moved to new city during Covid for a really good job opportunity. Now I just work, eat, and sleep. Don’t know anyone.","Moved to new city during Covid for a really good job opportunity. Now I just work, eat, and sleep. Don’t know anyone. - Seriously, how on earth are you supposed to make friends? I can’t even go to the bar, or clubs, or anything. Even if I could, what would I do? Talk to random people. “Hi I’m a random person, who you don’t know, I’m lonely and I don’t know a single person in this city. Will you talk to me!?”..... somehow that just doesn’t seem like it would work.

I’m at the point where I just look at people at the grocery store or walking around town and it just feels me with the feeling of how isolated I am. How everyone is just going around with their business and I have no way to connect with them. It’s exhausting at this point. I’m tired of drinking beer alone on a Friday night watching stupid crap on Netflix."

lonely,Starting to slip down the incel rabbithole. I'm embarrassed and morbidly depressed. I know that none of this shit is true but it feels so real.,"Starting to slip down the incel rabbithole. I'm embarrassed and morbidly depressed. I know that none of this shit is true but it feels so real. - I know that me not being able to be loved is nobody's fault but my own. I don't believe in any of the red pill or blackpill stuff but I'm so lonely. Im a 21 year old drug addict with asperger's and Ive never had a girlfriend. I can get women to have casual sex and have before but I'm very bad at it and get scared and grossed out by sex easily because of some trauma from when I was a kid so I'm not really able to perform. I want a girlfriend more than anything but no 21 (or 18-20) year old woman will date someone who can't satisfy her, understandably so. I just want to be held and kissed. I want to experience cuddling and pillow talk and go on dates. I want a beautiful girl to buy pretty outfits for so she can show off to the world. I want someone to cook meals for and write poems about. I want to lay my head on her chest and listen to her heartbeat for hours. I just want someone to hold and smell and talk to about nothing until the sun comes up. I want someone to make coffee for and fall back asleep next to after my alarm goes off on my off day. I'm genuinely so angry and hurt and scared. I'm jealous of people who have this and I'm incredibly angry at myself all the time for not being able to get this. I feel an unbearable aching pain in my chest and on my arms as I yearn for a hug. It feels like millions of red hot needles stabbing and ripping at my flesh and I know that the gentle caress of another human would cure the pain. I feel so scared of myself. I don't know how much more of this agony I can take but I know that it is not much. I am going to hurt myself, bad, soon. This time it won't be a cry for help. I can't take it anymore."
lonely,Does it hurt you seeing couples and people in love?,"Does it hurt you seeing couples and people in love? - Does anyone else hate seeing happy couples and people holding hands together, just going for a walk or having dinner? Maybe it's not even in real life, maybe just in a movie (that's why I never watch romance/rom-com movies). It just hurts. I even irrationaly hate them, which is silly. I know it might not be a perfect relationship they're having, but at least they have someone to go for a walk with and watch a movie together. I usually try to look away if I see them in public. It just breaks my heart."

lonely,Not being around people has made me so unrelatable and detached.,"Not being around people has made me so unrelatable and detached. - It’s to the point where I don’t feel human in a sense. Since I’ve never had certain experiences, it’s hard to hold conversations when I’m trying to have small talk or come off as out going. At times I feel like I’m the problem and I really doomed myself, but no one seems to understand how hard it is  for me to even be amongst people. I find myself not being entertained by what’s “popular” or the norm. Especially living in a age where you have to be socially outgoing and witty,  there is no place for me. I don’t know what people want or like when I’ve tried to have relationships in the past, and I don’t feel like I’m outgoing enough to last in a friend group. I thought by self isolating that my problems would go away, but a part of me craves human interaction. We live in a age where the quiet kid is looked down upon and memed, and it makes me think people like me where born to fail. At this point I wanna be dead and forgotten, so all my problems would go away. I draw but it’s not enough. I can escape all I want and I still feel lonely. I don’t fit in anywhere, and I don’t think I ever will. I’m so lost and confused, I honestly want out."
lonely,IM SO FUCKING MAD AT GOD,"IM SO FUCKING MAD AT GOD - why the fuck did he created me as a short ugly asian. i am genuinely getting furious right now. even other people mocked my height saying that i am tall and good looking but I'M FUCKING NOT. they just won't stfu about this. everyone i literally just met says this. even my mom do it. i really hate this. it just reminds me of something that i will never be. 

goddammit. i want this to STOP already. why the fuck can't god create me as a 6'2 white nordic chad??? i hate this unfair world."
lonely,feel like i have nobody,"feel like i have nobody - so, recently ive lost lot of people close to me. nobody died or anything but yeah. the person i called my best friend for the past 7 years suddenly had some kind of breakdown and became extremely aggressive for a couple months before ghosting me. that was 2 months ago. then, my girlfriend of 1 year broke up with me. that was 1 month ago.

so at that point i really had 4 people i could truly call my friends. 2 of which i could actually see every once in a while. 

2 weeks ago, one of them moved to another state. so now i can only see one person due to distance and schedules. normally i would see them every Friday and Saturday night. well, they haven't wanted to hang out for the past 2 weeks. today, my friend that moved 2 weeks ago was coming back to visit and i thought it was the perfect chance to see both of them. i fell asleep and just woke up a couple hours ago. and i see a video one of them posted showing the 2 of them have actually been hanging out all day. they never considered inviting me much less telling me.

and idk what to do. i mean i get that sometimes these things just happen without planning and sometimes you just are already hanging out before you have the chance to invite others, but come on. i feel ignored. idk which is worse, them purposefully not inviting me for them just completely forgetting i exist and not inviting me. is there really a legitimate reason for this or are they just assholes and i need new ""friends."" or maybe im overreacting idk ive just been really lonely the past 2 weeks and then this shit happens has me fuckin crying"
lonely,I am not sure if I am truly depressed or if I am just plain numb; at this point I suspect I must suck at being a social being.,"I am not sure if I am truly depressed or if I am just plain numb; at this point I suspect I must suck at being a social being. - 25F here, and I’ve been stuck with toxic female figures for almost my entire childhood. I wish I had more female friends to share all the problems about love, about beauty and about petty girl drama growing up but having these toxic figures in my life left me terrified at female friendships. 

I grew up with a really toxic childhood friend with some serious narcissistic tendencies since we were 4; I only managed to cut her off at the end of 2019 and managed to fully move on from that late 2020. It was so awful. I thought she was my best friend, that she truly cared for me and that I could trust her so I frequently spoke to her about what goes on in my mind even though she never truly cared.

I had a long hard time building trust with people around me and as a result it was hard for me to make friends.

I have very few friends now and I find it harder to make more friends after I’ve started working. Growing up I lean on them a lot because I cherished them and I felt that I could be vulnerable with them.

But for a period of time now, I just feel no one truly cares for what I have to say or think on a deeper level anymore and no one will be there to bounce revelations and epiphanies with me anymore. The close friends that I’ve made later on (like 18 years old onwards) just can’t be bothered with me anymore. I feel that whenever I share something they don’t really want to involve themselves. 

I mean I get it - everyone has their own worries and commitments, but yknow I kinda crave for someone that I can truly be me with and be able to sit in comfortable silence with. Just one person.

All I want is perhaps someone who would listen to what I say and perhaps acknowledge it a bit, instead of leaving me on read after pouring my thoughts out. Or seeing them the next day and they pretend the conversation never happened. 

I feel super isolated and not motivated to even continue to date people now because I really ... have no more drive or resolute in me to even want a love life. The loneliness is literally taking bits of me out day by day and I don’t even know how I am going to make it better. 

How and where did I fuck up, exactly?"

lonely,Always chasing everyone else. No one seems to need me or want to spend time with me.,"Always chasing everyone else. No one seems to need me or want to spend time with me. - I try and try to make plans with my “friends” and they can never be bothered. They’ll go out with other people but it seems they can never be fucked to do things with me. Even in past romantic relationships and potential romantic relationships, I always chased the other person and never felt that they needed or wanted me. It’s leading me to wonder what’s wrong with me but my family, other friends and sources of help assure me that there’s nothing wrong and that my “time will come soon”. I can’t really take it anymore."

lonely,Just remembering,"Just remembering - It is late during an October night, and the stars are out. There I am, standing in the middle of a dance floor. It isn't just any song drifting into my ears; it is the song I requested the band to play. It is Lights by Journey. My date is my high school crush, and she is looking amazing in a black dress. I tell her I requested the song and ask her if she wants to dance. We hold each other and stare into each other's eyes. She gives me a smile, and we begin to sway to the music. Such a sweet moment is unforgettable. She means the world to me at this moment.

As the song ends, I lower my hands from the air that they so lovingly held and open my eyes to the dark bedroom surrounding me. My headphones' batteries are about to die, but I still see the stars out my window, and I still hear the music."
lonely,It just takes time?,"It just takes time? - I get that sometimes, finding that person you can have that romantic (boyfriend/girlfriend, husband/wife) relationship with may just be later on. 

Still, I cant help but think the worst. What if I never find someone? What if I have someone who isn't a good person? Would they even get along with my family? I dont believe I'm a (lack of a better word) catch either. 

I'm 23(F) and I get that I'm still young, I have time, but  it feels like I'm just not cut out for dating or having that kind of relationship. I've only had 2 relationships ( both lasted less than a year) in high school, so I really dont understand how adults date. 

I hope I get out of my naivete too. I know that if I did find someone, I would do everything I could to make it work. Thats also dangerous since there is a chance of abuse if I decide to turn a blind eye to red flags. 

One day, I suppose. 

Idk. Rambling now."

lonely,Extremely drained and tired,"Extremely drained and tired - 23F. My bf and I went to a gathering yesterday (with the safe distancing rules in our country in place). We were playing games where, the game needed me to tell clues for them to guess the answers and I wasn't in the position to communicate anything else. This girl in the same team as us leaned in and talked to him. He also laughed along and made jokes with her, she was holding onto this plushie and they discussed about it. At one point she even touched his arm and laughed, their knees were touching. He also started talking in their mother tongue to her and the rest, leaving me to not understand what they're talking about. My other close friend who didn't understand what's going on also felt a bit uncomfortable at that. After seeing that girl and my bf interact and laugh and be so physically close, I was starting to have an anxiety attack but I couldn't do anything so I just sucked it up while my hands were shaking and I rlly wanted to break down. Fast forward to before leaving, I texted him asking him to stay away from me as I was upset at him and that I had an attack halfway playing. When we left, I told him that the girl was flirting with him and he was encouraging it by laughing along and sitting as close and he told me he didn't even know that was flirting. He started to scream that he didn't know when I said that the whole world could see and that he didn't know that was happening. It triggered me so badly I took a step away from him physically bc I was afraid due to PTSD from my previous relationship. Since he didn't want to acknowledge or accept I said it's my fault for being overly sensitive. Until now he hasn't tried to reassure me or understand what I feel, he keeps saying he feels misunderstood and he doesn't care about her but I just can't get the image of them being happy together out of my head. We are of different races but the girl is the same race as him, I keep thinking it would be better he was with her or any other girl of the same race since he seemed happier also. Haven't been able to stomach food since I came home last night, kept vomiting and having more attacks. I just need to let this out of my chest."

Seeing everyone’s stories does help me feel like I’m not the only one who feels this way. I know all of us know people get lonely or depressed but it’s another things to read real points of view during some lonelier points in life. 

I just wanted to say that all of you are worth a lot more than you may think and there are people out there that would love to be friends or date you! Sometimes it’s hard for us to say what we really feel whether it’s just a general compliment to someone or really deep feelings. I’m sure there are people in your lives that think you’re amazing or hilarious or think you give them a lot of hope and they just don’t say it. Also for the people who really may not have a support system I feel for you and your pain in feeling lonely is valid but you can use that to try and be someone else’s support system even if it is very hard. I mean just look at all the people online right now in this subreddit those are all people that are in your shoes and potential friends! 
Also one last thing don’t settle for mean people to be in your life just because you need someone or think you deserve that type of attention. Sometimes it’s better to be alone than to be in any kind of abusive relationship.💖💕❤️"

lonely,I've just never been able to connect with other people.,"I've just never been able to connect with other people. - Does anyone else feel this way?

I have always been an outsider. When I was a young child I remember sitting on the fence watching the other kids play and have fun, and I'd wonder why I couldn't join in. It's one of my earliest memories. I've felt like an alien ever since I was old enough to be self aware. 

Even when I had a close group of friends I never felt like I belonged there. I would always subconsciously distance myself. Now they're all gone. 

I literally have only ever felt a close bond with my dog. I don't know whats wrong with me. I tried to make friends online, but run into the same issues.

If one word could sum up my life, it would be ""lonely"". 

Does anyone have any tips for finding your ""tribe""??"
lonely,I hate people,I hate people - But I don't want to be alone. It is so confusing. :(
lonely,"""Work on yourself"" they said.","""Work on yourself"" they said. - And I did.

I used to be heavy. I got into great shape. I became a Cyclist, a Runner, a Mountain Biker, a Swimmer and a Triathlete. My body is not perfect though. It's close, but not perfect and I fucking hate my imperfections. But why do I have to be perfect? I do though and I'm trying. What's funny is, I would love to be with a woman who likes athletics, but any girl who is in shape just wants some jacked up super-hunk (which I'm not) or some super cool ultra progressive hipster with 10,000 friends or some rich guy. There's also always a catch, like the good ol' friend zone or ""I only do open relationships."" Any female athletes to ever come across my path just about laugh at me and won't even wave back in passing.

I actually don't care if a woman is perfect either, or if she's into athletics or sports. I don't expect some super model goddess either. I would just like a girl who would love to share life with me. But I'm never good enough for anyone. 

I used to be very introverted as a kid, was horribly shy and could barely talk to people. So I got into sales, I changed my attitude, I gained confidence. I learned how to talk and converse with people and loved it. I got great at it. I got into sales management and made great money. It jacked my confidence way up to where even till today I have no problem approaching people and talking to anyone about anything at any time. I learned how to make people laugh too and love doing that. I love giving people a good chuckle.

They told me to get into hobbies, so I did. I got into Scuba diving and got good at it, I got seriously into mountain biking, I did my own thing. I did my activities. No girls jumped out or wanted anything to do with me, until one day... I finally met some one, mountain biking. I sort of rescued her, although she probably would have lived without me. She asked for my number and started talking to me. It felt so amazing for someone to actually want to converse with me, who wanted to know about me, who messaged me. She was beautiful too. I was so excited, but she was going through a divorce... In the end, she chose to go back to her Husband, not me. I don't blame her, I can't, if I would have been better though... More desirable. It hurt so badly.

For years now I've worked around a number of girls around my age. All of whom are very sweet. Even the guys, I am actually truly blessed with some amazing co-workers. I care about these people more than I should probably. I swore I would never ruin things or be ""that guy."" So I never pursued anyone. I would love to have intimacy with some one but sex is not the most important thing to me. Being around some one who smiles and makes you feel wanted, who likes to talk to you and spend time around you... That's the greatest thing in the world. That's what I truly want more than anything.

There's this one girl I worked with, who I really liked but never said anything. We don't see each other all the time but when we do, I always make her laugh so hard. She made me laugh equally hard. She really understood me and just, got me. We got really comfortable around each other and I thought we had a bond? But I swore I wouldn't cross that threshold. I will admit, I sort of hinted to her a few times that I wanted to know her outside of work so... 

She finally contacted me. I was elated. I didn't want to jump into her pants or get married the next day, I was just so damn happy that she was talking to me. I thought maybe the connection we had made and been patient with had finally paid off. I felt for sure... But no. I got a few mixed responses and finally asked if she liked me. She pretty much said, not in that way. She only thought of me as a friend. She even apologized. I felt so horrible. I've never felt so guilty or bad in my life. I wanted so bad and still do to just die. I feel ashamed. I shouldn't have put her in that position. I have so much respect for her and then I went and fucked things up. Why couldn't I be who she wanted though? I've never hurt so bad. She was already like a very good friend to me. I didn't have the guts to ask why. 

I know I'm ugly. Without thousands of dollars in surgery and even then, I will never be as handsome as most guys. Every time I look in the mirror I fucking hate this thing that looks back at me. I don't have a lot of money. I plan on going into college soon to finish out a degree but right now I don't have much. I do work full time and pay my bills though. Is that truly what it takes? Being more wealthy?

Am I, just me... Why am I not worth being loved? I would love some one so tightly. I would do anything for them. I would be their best friend, their guardian, their team mate and fellow adventurer. I am a patient person and love to not just talk but also listen. People have told me I'm great at listening and taking interest in what they say.

So why is that not enough for some one? I don't want to go on some random ass dating site and find some slew of people to ""casually"" date and have casual sex with, not to say I even could. I wanted a friend... I wanted some one to come home to and be excited to see every day. I really fell for this girl and when she started talking to me I imagined one day actually getting to walk hand in hand with her... What a pathetic fuck I am.

I am used to operating alone. But what hurts now is why I'm so undesirable. I spent so much time and effort tweaking who I was, always trying to become everything some one might want and it's never good enough. It just hurts to the core.

Sorry, thank you everyone..."
lonely,Changes will start to happen hopefully and things will become more clear,"Changes will start to happen hopefully and things will become more clear - My life is about to take a big turn. 

A coworker finally spoke up, that I was making things difficult, and that he'd go to the manager. I'm glad he spoke up, people need to speak up if they notice something. But I get he was trying to accommodate me, which is nice. In my head I was like, ""does no one notice how I'm really not stepping it up?""

If I quit that job, then that means I'll have to find a place to stay, while I finish my coursework before graduating. It's getting really hard to focus, so my classes I have to do my best to get through them. I hope it doesn't mean I fail one but if that happens I can manage. It also means money out of my pocket and pressure to secure a job.

I have a few months before I graduate and I have no idea what work I would do. All those months trying and failing interviews. Not being able to focus on something. And more money spent, if I decide to move forward with therapy and combating my issues. Which I probably should at this time. I'm going to be so alone. I'm going to find a way to make it work. 

All of these changes, because things happened. I would never make my decisions now, because I don't trust myself enough to see a path."
lonely,I HATE summer,"I HATE summer - I’m dreading summer so much. I’m aware it’s not for another few months but the thought of summer makes me feel so anxious. I have plenty of friends when I’m in college (pre-covid), during summer it’s a whole other story. I don’t have one set friend group so I rarely meet up with friends. It’s so difficult seeing people with huge friend groups spending the entire summer together. I just want a friend group who always has plans etc. I much prefer when I’m not forced to make plans with friends but still see them in school/college. Sometimes I hope that my country will be still in lockdown in summer so I won’t have FOMO."

lonely,Idk if anyone else does this but I fantasize about having horrible things happen in my life so my sadness/loneliness can be somewhat justified.,"Idk if anyone else does this but I fantasize about having horrible things happen in my life so my sadness/loneliness can be somewhat justified. - I have no reason to be as depressed and lonely as I feel. I’ve got parents and a family who care for me (well my parents are divorcing which hurts but they still care for me) and a good set of friends. I come from a well off family and couldn’t be more privileged if I tried. But at the end of the day, I just feel fucking empty. I have no motivation to chase the things I want to and no will to keep living. I feel guilty because I don’t think I’ve ever deserved the life I’ve been blessed with. I mean hell I’m not even in college yet. There’s no reason for me to be upset or depressed or even sometimes suicidal. So I fantasize about having one of me parents say they don’t love me or getting stood up on every date I’ll ever go on or being abandoned by my friend group because they’ve grown to not like me. I just want something to happen so I don’t feel this crushing guilt anymore. I want and crave to be justifiably sad and alone. Does anyone else have thoughts like these or am I just weird?"
lonely,Lonely in a crowd.,"Lonely in a crowd. - I've been lurking on the reddit for a minute now and have read a huge amount of stories and I feel its time I contribute my own. 

Last week, I got so fed up with myself I felt a change of clothes would be a good way to maybe spark some change. SP, I go out clothes shopping. Needless to say this was a mistake on my part. I don't know about how others feel  but when I go out in public, especially now under these pandemic settings where going out is a chore with the mask and all, I feel worse. I would find a pair of jeans or shirt but naturally look  over at a attractive person man or woman and think ""These places are for them not me..."" But then I would walk around and see someone (and i truly don't mean this in an offensive way) but are ""heavyset"" like myself but are walking around hand in hand with their significant other. I know I shouldn't compare and contrast let alone judge but it almost feels like a human instinct to find my own faults through strangers.

Mentally this breaks me. I grew up believing that only ""certain kinds"" are allowed to be in happy relationships but then I see people who break that ""traditional beauty standard"" and are happy and I think where did it go wrong? Yes, I don't fit what many consider the standard of beauty or what have you, but I am human! What do they know that I don't? And is it too late? Where do you go when the whole of the world feels like its has no place for you? And what could I have done different? Just a few thoughts..."

PEOPLE ONLY FUCKING WANT ME AROUND WHEN THEY CAN USE ME FOR SEX OR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT BUT WHEN I NEED SOMEONE AROUND TO UNDERSTAND ME, NOBODY IS EVER THERE. i'm going to live my entire life feeling like an alien. i don't think this will ever get better."

lonely,probably better off alone,"probably better off alone - Idk what it is.. I think I either pick the wrong people, I intentionally fuck it up, or I’m too picky. 

The internet is such a lonely place. It seems impossible to find someone attractive who I can open up to and be physical with. I mentioned going to therapy to a friend and she said maybe I should try it if I can’t seem to get out of this slump. 

I had an extremely abusive relationship (verbal/emotional only) for 4ish years. I finally left him and ever since I just can’t seem to act “right” with men. I either go on dates and I feel awkward and let it fizzle out, or I get physical way too quick, or I find some reason not to like them. Then I sit at home wishing I had a loving relationship like my friends or family. I am pretty busy with school but at the same time I’d like to develop something with someone. I’ve never been in love either so maybe the issue is me. 

Today I got stood up. I was pretty upset but honestly it probably saved me trouble. I tend to have “flashbacks” or super small things that men do which remind me of the ex and it can be extremely upsetting sometimes. Should I let time heal it? Its been a few months since I stopped seeing him but I’m impatient and want to be close with someone. I would say I was emotionally checked out of the relationship during the last year. I’m also not crazy about therapy bc it costs money and requires a lot of time.

It sounds amazing to be able to cuddle under a warm blanket and play games together (or if the soundtrack is really good just stay on the menu screen for an unreasonable amount of time). Or watch a good anime, maybe laugh and talk about it together, or even cry to it together and kiss away each other's tears.

lonely,"I've realised I'm always going to be lonely. When my dog dies, I'll have nothing","I've realised I'm always going to be lonely. When my dog dies, I'll have nothing - So a couple of years ago my brother asked me to move up to Scotland to be close to him. This was awesome at the time. I moved in with him while I saved for a place of my own, got a job, and eventually moved into my own little flat.

Then things spiralled. My dog moved from down South to live with me, which is good because he's my best friend, therapist, rock. But the problem is it is clear my brother has his own life to live - he has his wife, his children, his own world. Whenever he wants a lift or to borrow money he gets in touch, but otherwise it's always me talking to him first. It hit me hardest a couple of nights ago when my phone was out of data so I couldn't connect to internet until I got home. As soon as I did I was bombarded with messages from people asking for favours of me, not one of them seeing if I was OK. I broke down.

I don't need to say that lockdown has been horrible. I have nobody except my dog. 

I recently started a new job which is in a place where it is very hard to have a conversation - it's a factory so noisy - and where I have breaks and lunch in my car because of social distancing. I can sometimes go a whole day without speaking to anyone, or just saying ""Hi"" and a few other words. 

I am so fucking lonely. 

And I realised that this isn't a temporary thing ... I'm nearly 30. THIRTY. I have no boyfriend, no real friends, I live hundreds of miles from where I grew up and the rest of my family. I eat the same damn food every single night. I speak to my dog more than I do another human being. He's 10 now ... I was crying on him tonight because I truly realised I will have nobody when he goes. And since it was him who saved me from ending it all a couple of years back, I know I will not be OK when I'm left completely alone.

I just don't know what to do. I tried to call my mum tonight to have a chat. It went to voicemail and she hasn't called me back. 

Help me :( I'm just lost, lonely ... and nobody seems to notice. They're all okay. They all have somebody. The only somebody I have has four paws, a huge heart but can't talk back to me. All I want is someone to ask me how my day was. That is all I want."

So what i did was i tried to not text first to see if they would text and to my surprise they did, and they kept doing so and it made me so happy and at the same time i realised just how sad it is, how i was so not used to people wanting to talk to me to the point where i was slightly confused at the fact they texted first."
lonely,(L) I think this is the perfect place for me to open up about this.,"(L) I think this is the perfect place for me to open up about this. - 2018 and 2019 were not great for me. I'd just come back from boarding school to continue my studies while my friends stayed back there (i had to come back because the school didn't offer humanities.) I did not speak the local language and it became extremely difficult for me to hold conversations with people and as a result i ended up not having a friend for two whole years. It was bad. I locked myself in my room most of the time, it was easier to distract myself and consume content than stepping out and facing reality. My parents didn't quite understand what i was going through and kept forcing me to go outside. My dad even made several threats to break my T.V. and my phone. I kept spiraling and ended up with anxiety and depression (i haven't been diagnosed by a psychiatrist but i don't know how else to describe what i was going through.) However, that time did make me think a lot and i came to appreciate whatever i have in a new way. 

I changed colleges as soon as i could and found a crowd where i fit in. I'm having a wonderful time right now. I'm meeting new people, I'm making friends and I'm happier than iv'e ever been. But something happened recently that made me feel extremely worthless.

 I started chatting with a girl from my college recently, at first i didn't think much of it but i realized that i really enjoyed chatting with her and we had many similar interests and it was going well. I could tell that she enjoyed my company too since she started to texted me whenever she was free. We soon started flirting with each other and at this point i could not believe that i was experiencing this. We started talking on discord and and soon i asked her if she would go out for coffee with me. She agreed.

 We met up and i thought things went fine but then she stopped texting me. I asked her if everything was okay and she said it was. We stopped talking.

 What makes me feel bad is not that she rejected me, I know she has every right to do so. I was hurt because i know she rejected me because of the way i look. I know I'm not attractive but is that really enough to overlook how much we enjoyed each other's company? She said she loved my voice and my singing and my guitar playing and she overlooked it all because i did not look good enough? I understand that looks are important but it makes me feel like shit that no matter what i do and no matter how good of a person i become, I'll probably be rejected for not being attractive enough. I try not to let this get me down but I can't stop thinking about this when I'm about to sleep at night."

lonely,I guess that´s my story,"I guess that´s my story - So basically I got no one to talk to and I don´t get my butt up to go to a psychotherapist and today was the worst day in a streak of bad days which is why I just have to let it out somehwhere where I actually might get a response of some sort.

&amp;#x200B;

**Basically my whole life up until now so I guess you can skip that**

I had a tough time ever since I can think. My mom was overly protective and attached when I was a baby / toddler and didn´t look for help herself which is why as soon as I got sepperated from her in kindergarten I spent the whole day alone screaming and crying while the educators were just annoyed and ignored me. In elementary school I had a somewhat okay start, even found a friend who then (I don´t exactly remember what happened) started to bully me, the other kids of course joined in and so the crying and screaming (this time with aggressive behaviour at home) started again up to a point where I refused to go to school at all. I got sent to psychologic clinic for children where I had to stay until I was ""normal"". Basically I cried for the first 2 days and then started to cooperate up until I went to the public school in that town all by myself without issues. The whole therapy took me 6 weeks which surprised basically everyone there. They said I dont have issues and can go home. Back at home I went to an other school where for some reason I started having issues again. I didn´t even get bullied and the other kids really accepted and helped me. I still didn´t find friends though as when I had those issues I started to act aggressive in school too (I basically threw books at people that wanted to comfort me) so that parents didnt want me to hang out with their kids (I also started acting like an a\*\*hole, probably to protect myself in a way of ""If I´m mean first they can´t bully me out of nowhere. That´s actually behaviour I still didn´t manage to turn off 100%).

&amp;#x200B;

In middleschool I didn´t find freinds either. It´s not like I got bullied but yea I was mean, I´m kinda ugly and had a terrible hairstyle in order to hide a big brown piece of mutated skin which is located behind my left ear which I felt terribly uncomfortable (until 2017) and got bullied for quite some time also i never learned to socialise ever. Middleschool was okay, found at least 2 or 3 people over the years that I could consider my friends. But yea I was fcked up like literally one day I met a friend after school (6th grade) and he already had an other friend there and instead of just hanging out together I was so overwhelmed by the situation to be confronted to meet someone new that I started crying and ran away back to my moms car to get home. I don´t need to mention that that was the last time we met and it didn´t went well the first few days after that in school either. After that in middleschool it was all the same I got along with some people, behaved annoyingly and mean until they started excluding me again. Also still got bullied and called ugly every now and then from people that were in 4th grade when I was in 2nd grade but that´s it on that department.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to highschool. Again a bunch of new people to meet and I tried to be more confident and open minded when it came to making contacts. Basically I looked like Sheldon Cooper when he had to smile when he had to tell one of his colleagues that he was happy for them. So yea it didn´t really work. Fortunatley a guy that joined in on 10th grade who I came along with somewhat is very good in meeting new poeple so I sticked with him. Most people didn´t like me though but it wasn´t nearly as bad as in middleschool. Actually there even were some people that tried to be freinds with me however as soon as someone does that I start behaving like the most unfriendly person ever, pushing them away from me.

Then I got depressed (I think.. I never got the diagnosis but it definitely went it that direction). Basically I realised everyone either hates me or doesn´t give a damn about me which gave me the confidence to go to a real hairdresser (first time in my life) to get a normal haircut because hey if no one cares about me anyway why should I care about what they say IF they say something about that mutated skin at all. That was also the first day I went to some sort of village festival where I went to some people I knew from school that I was okay with. After all that it was easier for me to get along with many people that couldn´t stand me before in school as well. I kinda changed a lot in just one day.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I then decided to repeat 12th grade as I had (for my conditions) a ton of self confidence and wanted to get a new shot with new people again. For me everything turned into making social contacts no matter what the main reason for me being there was. So yea I did something I couldn´t ever dram of doing before. I was the new one and just started to hang with and get to know people as if it was the most normal thing. And it kinda worked. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What follows is the setup to what would become the worst thing ever to happen in my life**

I even came so far to get to know some girls there like damn life isn´t too bad after all. Yea well of course that had some issues with it as well.  If you never get attention from a girl ever and then it happens you start to ""fall in love"" real damn quick. Of course that´s no real love but hey tell that 18yo me who just wants someone that actually cares for him. What happened was I became friends with 2 girls. Of course as soon as one of them said ""I want a relationship"" I would have just took the chance no matter what I really felt or who it was. So the first one I was kinda cool with and focused on (yes she was the prettier one, I´m sorry) while the second one I really vibed with. The first one then was in hospital for a few weeks and always complained about how boring it was but we never had too much contact. So as I still wanted more from her I visited her gave her my Nintendo DS and we talked alot. That was the only time I visited and there wasn´t much contact afterwards as well. However I still wanted more so I told the 2nd girl (who I saw more as a friend) and she told me to tell her. So I did... via whatsapp.. However she said she doesn´t want a relationship right now because of reasons X Y Z. From there on I didn´t hear anything from her for 1 week, she only replied to my mesages at the end of the day (despite posting throughout the day) and I just told myself to give up. At the same time I still texted alot with the 2nd girl and then after 3 days we met for the first time and went for a walk. And holy cow was she into me. We hugged like I don´t know how often, held hands, had a romantic evening, cuddled and she gave me my first kiss. Turned out she wanted more from me for wuite some time but was just too shy. Anyway it was the 2nd of 2 weeks of no school and we spent every single day together until on the last friday the 1st girl wanted to meet out of the blue on which I just said ""Nah I don´t have time"". Of course after I got together with the 2nd one the 1st one said I should have waited for her and some stuff like that. I´m sure that´s not about me (even though I wish it was) but about the fact that she liked attention and want´s stuff that she can´t have anymore. She made a huge fuss in school and told everyone (including my gf) what an a\*\*hole I am.

&amp;#x200B;

It all went quiet and the first 2 months of said relationship were great. But it all started to become bad. We both made mistakes. I didn´t respect what she told me in private, she is resentful af and doesn´t speak about her problems. Also she was always quite the loner herself (she barely ever met her ""friends"" after school either just like me) and as her friends didn´t like me (hell one of them tried to hook her up with someone else after we were together for a month) she had to chose with whom she spent time with in school. Basically I didn´t have a problem with hanging out with them if I had to but as soon as I approached her it just went ""eww not him"", ""go away"", ""youre way too ugly for her anyway"" and so on. For my girlfriend it was just ""jokes"" as hey they are friends and friends are mean to each other sometimes.. yea it wasn´t jokes. 

&amp;#x200B;

One big difference between the two of us was I think communication is key. If there is a problem I talk about it. If she has a problem with the relationship (any other problem I could forget to hear about due to my early mess up)she sould tell me and I´ll listen to it no matter how stupid she thinks the issue is and I´ll work on it to make it work with her. She on the other hand didn´t talk. At all. Not even when I sat her down a begged her to tell me what´s wrong so we can work it out. She just waited for it to change by itself and if it didn´t she would start crying out of nowhere when she was alone because it was too much for her. She´s also the kind of person that beleives if you have to admit a problem and the other person changes something that worthless because they didnt change it becaus they wanted but because they had to which makes the change worthless and causes more problems. Also I´m sure she saw my "" telling her what I dislike"" as a constant whining and blaming her for all the issues but that´s just me interpretating her body language.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now we come to what actually really damaged me and makes me hate myself more than ever**

Well things got worse, she still spent the most time in school with her friends treating me like I was just an other guy which obviously hurt me. Then she started to blame me that she doesn´t see her friends after school and for some other issues as well.  She then stopped kissing me out of her intention, stopped showing interest in me and my body (like she stopped undressing me if she felt like it and I wasn´t allowed to undress her as often as we used to do it earlier) and overall just distanced herself from me. We started arguing a lot. She barely had time for me but it was easy for her to find time for other people and when I adressed it she didn´t wanbt to talk about it. She stopped wearing the necklace I bought her for christmas and when I asked her why she told me to not be annoying or some lies (she later admitted she lied in order to ""not hurt me"").  When it came to the last school trip before graduation (3 days in an other big town) I told her how I´m looking forward to it spending the time with her as we´d have a lot of spare time to do what we wanted. Her only reply was ""yea I won´t spend too much time with you though as I want to spend the time with my friends"". That was the first time I got really **really** hurt and upset which I told her in a kinda aggressive a way (no insults or shouting tho) I explained her how I felt and that I wouldn´t have been mad if it just happened that I wanted to do womthing with her but she had other plans but that a straight forward ""no, not with you"" hurt me in a way I never felt before. She didn´t understand and we didn´t talk for a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first day we still didn´t talk but as we were 2 of the first 6 to arrive at the meeting point I went to her, we hugged and talked casually. The bus ride wasn´t too nice either (she rather wanted to sit next to a friend than me but hey what did I expect) but at least we talked and laughed a bit and during breaks she sat on my lap and asked me if I wnated to join in on grabbing something to eat later. That was the first time in a long time she seemed to be caring about me and the relationship to be honest. However when being thhere I went with them and the comments started again: ""eww no why dows he has to come"" and so on. I waited for my gf to say something but she didn´t so I left. 15 min later they came back and she asked me again if I wanted to come. I asked her ""Did you turn around because of me or because you went in the wrong direction?"" ""Because we went in the wrong direction...."". Yea... ouch..

&amp;#x200B;

I later adressed my feelings again also that I expected her to say somehting as those are her friends and that I would definitely have said something if it were my friends talking bs about her and she said she´d understand. I brought her to her room and we said good night.

&amp;#x200B;

On the next morning she ignored me completely. She didn´t even look at me but she was able to talk to other people. You can imagine how I felt I guess. I asked her (not in the nicest way I gotta admit but I didn´t shout or anything) what was wrong **now** and what changed between ""good night"" and now even though we didn´t see each other over the night. ""Don´t go on my nerves"". That´s when I lost it. I shouted at her in front of half the school on what the f\*ck was wrong with her that she always behaves like that, doesn´t even talk to me today and on what she wants to blame me now again. That´s when her ""best friend"" got invloved telling me to shut up and leave her alone and that I always have those ""mood swings"" she told her about. Actually those mood swings were reactions on whenever she made me feel like she didn´t care for me or when she really rejected me.

&amp;#x200B;

From there on it just went downhill even more. Nothing was like it used to be. She started crying more often because of this incident and no matter how much I assured her that this wouldn´t happen ever again and that we just need to fix our communication issues it eventually led to her breaking up with me after 3 more months.

&amp;#x200B;

And now we´re coming back to the start because I treated her like literal garbage whenever I saw her at school because I got hurt by her. Whenever I saw her I insulted her and told her what a terrible person she is for all the stuff she did to me. However I still loved her of course so that´s when I actually got mood swings and changed from ""please take me back I love you and can change"" to ""I hate you with passion"" several times a day. She started ignoring me entirely, literally as if I didnt exist. I´ve never seen someone ignore someone so successfully and consequent before. It was literally as if she knew it was me coming through a closed door as she always looked there to see who it was except when it was the one to come in.  This all peaked on the last school party when drunk me tried to talk to her again for the last time, she refused, I didn´t accept and some dude that was the boyfriend of one of her friends beat me up for it. I still wrote some email to her or made a new account on instagram or snapchat to get in contact with her but that was just way too much. All of that.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes it even worse is that after she broke up some people in school started ""adopting"" me. Including some guys that I wouuld probably still see every weekend if it wasn´t fr covid (even though we arent real friends anyway and I guess they only invite me when they don´t have anyone else \[like I´m barely ever invited to normal ""partys"" there if it isn´t for a birthday\] and because they like to be popular with as many people as possible.) and the other one were a group of girls. One of them just is friends with anyone and an other one just broke up with her boyfriend as well. That second one also seemed to be the most interested in a friendship (or maybe even more I´m really not sure she was kinda flirty sometimes but then again also very distanced during other days) so I did what I always did: I treated her bad and pushed her away in order to not get hurt if I wanted more and she doesn´t. I llater appologised to her but she didn´t really wanted to talk about it again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

And now I´m sitting here all alone with my thoughts again, thinking about my ex and what I should have done differently, well knowing that I´ve changed **A LOT** in these 3 and a half years and that if I had one wish I´d just wanted to get the chance to meet her again from 0. 

But at the same time this relationship and the time after it damaged me so much that I´ve never hated myself more than right now. Especially her dishonesty and the fact that I know that she was a master in pretending everything is fine even though it isn´t (I even adressed that when she broke up, I told her that to me it felt like we had normal caring days when we just cuddled all day on which she just replied ""well I´m good in hiding my true feelings""). Also the fact that when I told her ""I want you and only you.. I love you and I wish I could link to you so you feel exactly what I feel about you because I just can´t describe it"" she replied ""youre only saying this because youre used to me"" is something I´ll never forget. And as I was always concerend about my appearance (I hate my face \]big nose, thin lips, no jawline, big forehead, bad hair, my eyes look sad and are pretty deep in my head while my mouth makes me look grumpy\]  I´m skinny and tall with a bad posture) I will never know if things like her not kissing me anymore or not being sexually interested in me anymore (I asked her how she never seemed to be somewhat horny when I was there. Her reply: Oh I was, quite often, I just hid it from you) was because of how bad I hurt her by shouting at her and so on (she said that was the reason she didnt´want to sleep with me) or if she lied again and it was because I´m hideous. Also I once told her how good I felt when we were somewhere and she would look up to me as if she was deeply in love with me and she said ""yea that´s why I´m doing that"" which basically to me means ""I´m not really in love with you but I pretend to be so at least youre happy"". I tell ya that stuff keeps me up at night and makes me go crazy. I just can´t anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So if anyone actually made it that far then I´m really surpised. I don´t expect anyone to read all of it and I guess I will look for a psychotherapist because hey he get´s paid to listen to shis stuff. Also if I´m really lucky they might actually be able to help accepting myself and to live a normal life without self doubt, self hate and suicidal thoughts... I guess.."

lonely,If I could have just 5 minutes with myself 5 years ago.,"If I could have just 5 minutes with myself 5 years ago. - I’m 19 but if I could see my 15 year old self this is what I’d say. First off I’d make me stfu and sit down because no doubt I would want to argue and point out the impossibility of the situation. Once I had convinced myself it was real this is the news I’d share. 

You have a great body right now. Men all over the world wake up everyday and wish that they could see your body in their mirror. WHY would you throw that away and not do anything about it? Just don’t. Keep it, run more, your metabolism won’t last forever and when you’re 95kg and you’re poking your stomach in the mirror you too will wish you had the body you have now. 

Don’t get with that girl!! FFS man! Yes she has a great body too, yeah that ass is unreal and yes you can lose your virginity to her. But it won’t last and it will cause a world of pain 4 years down the line. Respect yourself and don’t lie to her about your intentions and then not have the spine to leave her for another 4 years! 

Don’t push your friends away! You’re a massive dickhead. You had a solid group of friends who you pushed away, mostly for that girl you shouldn’t get with but also because you thought you didn’t need them. If only you knew how alone you will be in 5 years. 

I would finish by telling a story. The story of today. I would say to myself:

“Listen, here’s an example. You’ll wake up one morning to find that girl you were with has been posting slutty pictures all over Instagram because her body is still great while yours is ruined. You’ll be reminded that she can find someone else just by posting a pic of her online. You could only dream of that!

You’ll go on to meet with a friend you made on tinder (your only match) and you’ll meet up, go for a drive and get a hot chocolate together. She is your only friend in the world and even she doesn’t know you that well. You’re reminded that you got so desperate you paid for sex, but that somehow you even managed to get ghosted by them. Professionals would rather lose money than have to speak to you! 

You have no hobbies, you’re not attractive, you’re not sociable, you’re hopeless. 

You’re lonely as fuck apart from one or two friends you text, but that’s not the same. You had it all and you threw it away.”"

I dont know what to do, where to go, who to talk too. Logically, in the eyes of someone else im still living the dream, friends, good school, relatively good grades, but actually the truth is without these best friends I used to have I feel empty. One of them being my crush does not help.

I couldn’t deal with the stress for it all so I blocked myself out from the world. Two years on after counselling and being okay with myself, I lost a lot of people in my life and don’t really have so-called friends to hang out with.

I try so hard and push myself through so much to try to be there for people, but it feels like none of them do the same for me. Feels like I'm just an annoyance and a bother, but I'm too nice so they don't feel right telling me they don't actually want to talk to me at all, instead they just give me their dismissive one word responses once a week.

lonely,what happened today,"what happened today - Today when I woke up I noticed that my friend has put on a WhatsApp DP, she usually keeps some pup or some aesthetic picture in her dp.

then I realised I also do the same never in my life I had the courage to put a Whatsapp DP that is upfront where all my nose my eyes are visible, all this made me feel uneasy.

I am so uncomfortable with the way I look I have no social media because of this in the first place I don't use any dating app.

so I don't know why I just shared this thing with my parent they were sitting in the same room and I told them that ""papa you know a fun fact, I have never in my whole life had the courage to put a dp of my face on WhatsApp"" and my mom said nothing because no matter what I know she calls me ugly in the first place. So I told dad that today I want to put a pic where it is just me, no hiding of face no covering up just the good picture of me where I look decent enough. So I put this picture and asked him to quickly see my DP it is weird that he had an expression of disdain and he said that my dark circles were visible. I know he has a different way of thinking but I have dark circles I can't do anything about them, my eyes are like that. I went like papa come on this will do and went out of the room and removed the pic from my DP.

I don't know when in life I will have the courage to show my face to someone in a picture properly without running into the fear that he/she will call me ugly. I wish I were strong and confident. I don't want any young girl or boy to go through this. I know it is stupid. very stupid but it just existing with me and I have no one to tell this."

But what do you do when ""being yourself"" just isn't good enough for people? I don't want to change my natural way of being just to impress and attract people, plus it never works anyway. I can't be fake, but my natural self also just doesn't seem to interest anyone. Especially women. 

No matter what I do, it feels like trying to get a woman's attention is like pulling teeth. I'm at a loss wondering what it is I'm doing wrong. I've tried improving upon every possible aspect of myself, correcting my mistakes, learning from my experiences, but it leads nowhere. I know meeting the right partner is largely a numbers game, a ""luck of the draw"", but still, it's a bit demoralizing to go through failure after failure and have nothing positive to show from it.

I wish some higher force would just produce a list telling me ""These are all the things about you that will make women never have any interest in you, give up now and stop wasting your time"" so that I could just stop this never-ending torture I've put myself through. Any time I try to get close to women, all of my confidence comes into question because of how little interest they show in me. It makes me feel like human garbage, not worthy of a second of anyone's attention, interest, or time. I know that I'm worth more than that, but I'm convinced no one else will ever think so.

I live with strangers in one house because I work abroad. 

Anyways...

I accidentaly heard my roommates (housemates?) talking shit about me this morning. They were saying that Im taking their stuff like toilet paper, womens higene pads (iam a female), shampoo etc. (which is not true). This happened “behind my back”. I heard them in the kitchen talking while i was in my own room.
I brushed it off, because I thought I just overheard something. But nope. I got back from work a bit later then them and they literally aproached me on the enterance and started spiting literal lies on me that iam actually doing that and taking their stuff and that im a fucking dirty thief... I was trying to prove them wrong but theres just no way really. I dont know who started that...

My coworker was an ass as always. Im used to him being that way - agressive. But today was hard to bear and he didnt really help.


But thats those are not the worst parts of today.

My gf left me... (im not straight if that matters).
I know the reason why... we respect each other, but man it hurts so bad. 

What sucks is that i cant cry much. People will hear me (effin thin walls)... im trying to let out my tears silently but i feel like im gonna explode.

Im sorry if this is a wrong sub. I suffer from other mental illnesses but im not techically depressed. I just had to vent.

I hope that yall are better."

lonely,"Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions?

Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real 🌟), continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts).

**How it works:**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.
* Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

lonely,Tired of being ghosted for no apparent reason,"Tired of being ghosted for no apparent reason - Ive been trying these dating apps and stuff to try and meet someone decent (I know it's not the best place to look but covid and all) and every time I meet someone that seems cool, we talk for about a week or 2 and they end up just not wanting to talk anymore. I've tried setting up dates and some of them have agreed, only to cancel the day before. It's just really disheartening. Especially since me and this one girl were really hitting it off and just out of nowhere a day before we were supposed to go out she cancels, and for the most part stopped talking to me and the few answer she did give it seemed like she wasn't interested anymore. I don't know if it's me or what but everyone ghosts me :/"

lonely,Just can’t stop crying at night,"Just can’t stop crying at night - Recently separated from my husband of 5 years and in the process of getting a divorce. Even though I was the one to ask for a divorce, I just can’t stop crying at night when I lay down to sleep. Feels like no one can understand what I’m going through right now and have to appear strong in front of others. I’ve also developed a migrain recently so just have a constant headache throughout the day. So frustrated just feel like crying/shouting when I’m in pain or feeling low which is most of the time. And at night just miss holding someone while I sleep which makes the crying worse but I feel like I’m not allowed the cry since I made the decision to split even though I’m glad I did. I miss my dog too. Just miss those warm cuddles from her throughout the day. Just need to vent it out coz i can’t stand it right now and don’t feel like I can talk to friends  either as I feel like sooner or later they’ll get tired of me. Also just can’t talk to anyone who I feel is happy right now or in a relationship as I feel like I can’t connect to them/ don’t wanna dump my problems on them. I just wanna sleep without feeling like I’m a mess every single day."

lonely,I feel incredibly alone.,"I feel incredibly alone. - It all started when my entire friend group decided to slowly leave on me about a year ago. And I don’t think a single one ever thinks of me or misses me.

I never really had real life friends to begin with. Everyone I know has been online because I’m homeschooled. and when they all left me one, by one, I fell into a deeper depression. I feel like I’m just not the kind of person people want to be friends with because I’m too introverted, shy and anxious... people just don’t like me. I cannot even name a single family member that likes being around me. Why do I exist? Why do I continue to live in a world where I’m so unneeded/unwanted? I do not know. I guess I hold onto the hope that maybe one day someone will actually want to be my friend and never leave me for better people. maybe one day I’ll meet people that don’t just want to be friends with me because they feel sorry for me. I try so fucking hard to be like-able while being true to who I am, I do things for people whenever they need me, I do so much yet I’m left with no one and I’m so so tired. I try to find new friends and they just leave after the first or second conversation. I’m a temporary person to people. I’m tired."

lonely,This is my story.,"This is my story. - First of all, sorry for my bad english, i'm a spanish guy who is still learning english, just that.

When i was a kid, i've been bullied for my entire life, i've been insulted, named, punched, everything in my life, was just missery.   
Every minute in my life was just a suicidal thoughs, where i just wanted to die or never seen again, where i don't feel i am just an error, a bad line in middle of a piece of art, where i don't belong, and i will never be.  
The persons who make my life imposible, they really focused on that objective, and they never leave it, until i fight back.

The begin of all, in my 6 to my actual age, that is just 15, yeah, i am young, but i dont feel anything today even knowing i have a lot of thing to experience, but i don't feel i can still go anymore, i feel i don't ever will be loved, from my 6 to 15, i'm still feeling that.   
I feel that i am just an error, and will never be loved or find someone to love, even my friends betrayed me, my thoughs of them have a turn of 360 degrees, and that hurted my heart so fucking much. They never cared about me, but if they actually did, why they never showed that, they didn't see that i am feeling lonely for almost 10 years. 

Never in my life, i've feeled loved, never in my life i have a girlfriend or even contact with a woman, a real hug or a kiss from a girl that isn't my mom, i just want to love some one and be loved back, but i never find that person, and i feel i will never found it.

Today my grades are just shit, i have a lot of  overdue tasks from my school, and i feel i can't even do those things, those shitty basic things.

I feel tht the quarentine ruined my life too, because i was trying so hard to be social and be happy for my first time in life in 2019, i've almost reach the thing that i wanted most, but...you know, covid.

Today i got real friends, but the sensation of being alone, and empty, is still there, even being the psychologist of those 2 friends and make them better, for never feel the things i feel in the past and i still feel, just to see them happy, for see them to have the thing i never have in my life.

The fun thing is, they know how i feel, but not in 100%, i still use a mask with a smile to motivate them showing them that i am now happy (but in reality i am not) even i have one of the worst past possibles, yeah, i know, there is worst, but i feel this is one of the most destructives.

Dont be too harsh doh please since I made it in 1 writing without making changes. I would appreciate some feedback. 

 

There is two things to hear. 

White noise that ticks away the void. 

And the rumbling of sounds that deafen the calmness 

And when you hear these two combined, 

Its called loneliness. 

It haunts and follows me, 

It stalks me to the end of pain. 

It tickles and tears my veins until I burst. 

I can feel the tickle in my brain, 

It runs through my vein. 

But the only thing I can really feel, 

Is the screaming pain.

Talked with theirs.

Never knew someone like that existed.  
Don't know why I

I know people look for someone who loves them for a long time. I found that. She did love me but I couldn't return it. I tried. For 2 years. 

We got along so well. Like so well. So I thought that I was in love. But I wasn't. 

I broke up with her a while back. And it hurt a lot letting her go. 

I have no one but my siblings/family (who i never have/dont talk about anything serious). I dont have friends as well. As in I don't talk/dont want to talk to anyone. So the only outlet I have is posting on reddit.

im too scared to be in a relationship now because of the guilt/shame and fear I'll mess up again.. on top of that, I'm not attractive nor sociable so I won't even find a girl. All of my past friendships that I've had were started by the friend and not me. So I can't even make friends. 

it sucks being alone. all I do is lurk on social media, watch a movie if I can get through it, etc.

I’m so tired of people saying , you should focus on yourself and develop self love. It’s not the same thing. I love myself but I’d want to be loved by someone else too.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

﻿**My axioms.**

&amp;#x200B;

Alone.

A vacant list of friends

Always on the sidelines, standing at the edges of groups

Never noticed, never invited

Irrelevant

A wallflower, the perks nonexistent

Adrift

Like sailing a large ship through the crashing waves, there’s no way to control it myself

They jostle me back and forth, all day long

I’m taking on water

Like skydiving with a broken parachute, plummeting

Catch me

&amp;#x200B;

Cycle.

Wake up

Go to school

Sports

Eat drink sleep

Wake up

Go to school

Sports

Eat drink sleep

Again, and again, and again

And over and over, and again and again

My never-ending cycle

Every day, every week, every month

Again and again

Groundhog day

&amp;#x200B;

Worth.

They’re all naive

Futile

Inadequate

Replaceable

If I’m one in a million, there are 7,800 people just like me

Insignificant

Lack of motivation

Zero work ethic, dependent on “smarts” that are running out

Boring

Inferior

&amp;#x200B;

Empty.

Desolate

My chest is hollow

An abandoned mine, excavated, dilapidated, stripped of all value

Traversing a boundless desert

Barren, uninhabitable

Floating in a void, through sorrow, through oblivion

Woeful, tired

&amp;#x200B;

Craving.

Absence

Connection

An addiction that’s eats away my skin

For acceptance

For warmth

Yearning for something, anything

Withdrawals are overwhelming

Starved of oxytocin

Praise, acknowledgment, friends

&amp;#x200B;

Pain.

Chronic

Perpetual

But you get used to it

Pain turns to numbness

Like the sting of a tattoo

Numbness is just as painful

Pain is strangely comforting

At least you can still feel something

Torment

Prisoner with a life sentence, bound by constricting shackles that turn fingers pale white

Liberation is tempting 

But suffocating jumpsuits shield skin, stopping keen blades from gaining purchase

I’ll continue with the prospect that happiness will return

Freedom

One day

&amp;#x200B;

Facade.

I’m fine

Insincere

A thin veneer covers deep scars

I’m fine

Tasked with acting normal

A normal person would have forgotten by now

Hands

Eyes

Hair

Smile

Dreams

Promises

I’m fine

My vacant words deteriorate

I’m fine

I want to mean it"

lonely,Why do I feel this way,"Why do I feel this way - For the last few weeks, maybe at most a few months, my loneliness has been getting worse and worse. Ever since I and my ex broke up, I just feel as if there is this pit in my heart that won't go away. I tried so hard to make the feelings go away, I tried so hard to put myself out there and find other people to talk to, but, it all hurts so much. I don't know how to fix it. 

&amp;#x200B;

More than a few times, I considered ending my life, because the feeling that is in my chest is almost unbearable. Almost every night, I hide in my blankets, and I listen to sad music to get the feelings out but nothing is ever enough for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I put myself out there, almost half the time, I get taken advantage of. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. Everything hurts. Life just feels so empty."

I’ve made my posts both specific (as in listing out my interests and personality so that people who share something in common will message me) and vague (where anyone can message me and I can see who I mesh the best with). I literally can’t find a single soul. Those subs are the worst to make friends and the reality is, unless you’re already someone who fits in with everyone, you’re not finding jack on them. This COVID shit has been a pain in the ass for me because a lot of my friendships before the lockdowns only worked out in-person. Went from being a social butterfly to having close to nobody. I only have one friend I talk to frequently in real life and I’d be too embarrassed to admit that to her. So fucking tired of being lonely. I also want to bring up a topic. If you’re active in this sub and live in America, you more than likely hate the suburbs. Everyone’s in their own world and it takes ages to get to places.

By the end of this year I'll be 30 and as a male with every year it becomes harder and harder to reach out to people, especially women. Dating is not something I know whole lot about, and experiences in the past weren't great. Last relationship I had was nearly 8 years ago, and I don't think I'll have any in the future. So unlikely. Although that's not going to be the end of the world, just it's going to feel like something or someone is missing in my life and there might not be anything I could do. It just sucks that there isn't anyone out there for me I guess. I'm better off giving up and accepting this as a fact. If I am in fact stuck being single for the remainder of my life it's ultimately OK, but wouldn't make it less painful sadly. How do some of you find compromises being lonely?

I've never been in a relationship, I've never had intimate friendships. All of the friends I have now are co workers who will ditch me when they or I quit.

Idk, the idea of working for the military is something that intrigues me, plus I'd get paid to study what I love but what's the point I'm doing all that if I'm just gonna be alone. I'm sure I'll meet new people but as soon as I do I may have to leave. Same with if I make an relationships right now.

I'm scared of ending up alone. Is this a reasonable worry? I'd be close to 33 when I'm done and at that point if I'm still alone the I'd be hopeless. The other option is to get a degree in a subject that pays well that I despise and continue to stay where I am."

How was your day today? I know no one asked you and that kind of sucks. I’m asking you now though, so how was it? I may not be able to fix whatever went wrong in your day but I can listen to you.

I know you felt lonely and sad today, and you brought up some valid reasons as to why you feel the way you do. You’re entitled to your feelings. I don’t really know how to make you feel less lonely, but I can validate you and tell you that you’re important to me and the world. And I will mean every word of it. You can tell me it’s a load of crap if that’s the mood you’re in right now. But you know you’ve made some people smile before. They were strangers but you made them smile, that may have meant a lot to them. You feel insignificant in this world right now, but there is only one person like you, and it wouldn’t be right for you to go extinct. So, I need you to stay here. It may feel sucky right now, but it won’t always. It’ll get better for you, you just have to take it day by day. Just as you check up on the cow down the block, what if he checks on you too? You have to make sure each other is okay. Who is going to count all the stars at night? I don’t think anyone else in your neighborhood does that. They may feel lonely too. They’re up there just watching us on earth. I like to think they shine extra bright when they see you look up at them. And more importantly, how would McDonald’s make their money? I’m pretty sure you account for at least 1/5 of the money they make. 

It’s hard feeling that you’re alone, especially when you have almost every reason to feel that way. It doesn’t feel like a feeling for you, I know, it feels like a reality. Either way, it’s hard and it’s frustrating. I’m sorry you feel that way. If I could make it all better I would in a heartbeat. If I could hug you and let you cry, and show you someone cares, I would. I can’t though, because it’s not the same so you just have to keep going. You have to show up for yourself. I know it seems stupid and you don’t see the point, but maybe years later you will. You are caring, you weren’t always a good friend but you are a good friend now because you try to be, you are lovable, you are kind, you deserve good friends. And good things take time and I know you hear that so often but it’s true. You have to go day by day. It’ll be hard but take it easy on yourself. You don’t need to cry about the future because you don’t know what the future holds. You can cry about it  when you get there. Cry if you need to, scream if you need to, but try your hardest to not give up. It sometimes feels pathetic to be your own friend, I know. It isn’t pathetic though. It’s life. And life is sometimes a box filled halfway with the chocolates that have the orange filling, the ones you don’t like. But what did you do when you got those chocolates? You either spit them out and ate a different one or ate them because you were hungry and that’s all you had. In this case you be your own friend. You’re the only one you’ve got, you just don’t have any other chocolates right now."
lonely,"I don't feel anything,","I don't feel anything, - I don't mind being lonely befasue I have accepted being lonely but the out come of that is that at times I have no emotions to things either or anything g at all I just continue to do what I have always done. In the end I just feel numb. Does anyone else have this problem or is it just a me thing?"
lonely,Done lurking,"Done lurking - So, I've lurked here for some time. I try to reach out and help people. Offer advice or just an ear, whatever.

I'm on the other side of that fence now. I'm alone and it hurts. I won't bore you/embarrass myself with all the gory details, but it just sucks. And I honestly have no one to tell, so I guess I'll just post this mass of stark raving lunacy here.

I'm just lonely and tired of not being worth someone's attention. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not good enough. I've tried to maintain a positive attitude. I've worked on myself. I've been working out and I've been trying to mentally stay positive. I've got some major baggage and some serious demons, but I fight them every day and try to be a better man.

Her leaving was a tough blow though. Realistically, logically, I should've seen it coming. But love makes a man act stupid. We all know this. Or maybe I was just stupid to begin with. Heavy evidence suggests yes.

It's like I've lost my muse. Lost my path and my light. I still do what I've done. I work out, I shop for groceries (fun in TX right now, I'll tell you), I try to watch TV or play games to distract myself. But it's all mechanical. Hollow. It doesn't work.

I've gone looking for distractions in other people. Online hook ups and role playing and such. Again, hollow. I hate it. Hate myself for needing someone else to drown my sorrows in. Hating myself more for wasting my time and theirs.

I just want to stop hurting and for once be worth someone's time. I had a real connection with someone who managed, despite all of my crap, see some good in me. But it just wasn't enough. And I know I was a difficult choice. I know that. But still, I held out hope, that, while difficult, I'd be the right choice. That I'd be the one to make her happy. Instead, I've been going through and removing every bit of her from my life I can, because I can't stand the thought of her. Alternating waves of disgust, hate, regret, longing and self hate.

It's gut wrenching and I have no one to tell or confide in about this. Other than just yelling into the void like I am now.

If you read all of this, bless your heart.

TL;DR - Facing the stark reality of being alone/can't get over a girl. How very original, eh?"
lonely,My account is shadowbanned,"My account is shadowbanned - I’m an editor who started a platform that showed real promise when my first video blew up and got 30k+ likes and the others were all getting just under 10k likes. People were enjoying my creativity humor and I really felt like I was gaining a place to be appreciated in that way. It’s hard for me to connect with people irl so it was kind of a social life line for me and that account. Suddenly all my new videos get 0 views for hours and days on end even though I have over 500 followers. It makes me so frustrated that I’m getting filtered like this, I searched it up and turns out Tik tok ai is very advanced and will filter anything that seems unoriginal(if it is uploaded from a third party). That is so sad because I always have to use an editing app to make proper, quality stuff, and now it’s just being filtered by some mindless machine without even the chance of appeal from a real person. I am stuck because I have no idea where to go from here. I messaged their support but highly doubt that they will get back to me. I really wanted to show people a passion that I like to do for fun. Guess it was fun while it lasted and I will have to go back to just making personal edits."
lonely,When I Think and See Them,"When I Think and See Them - I thought of something, a special something, something completely stored in the mind and been working on for a while. 

The thoughts about it sail past me as I try to get to the part I want to be in, it works just as it always had. 

I imagen my world and look at it, it doesn't notice me, I felt like a queen simply just watching my civilization being lively and just existing in the beautiful sunset. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I look at Them I feel like I forgot something, I don't know what, nonetheless it was fun. 

I then go back, and see my home, it's made of clay just like every building, so I go through to by bed, I saw one gram of gold right beside it, I felt a bit happy. 

Then I looked outside, it felt normal but something was just off and I didn't know what. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thought then came to me telling me to check my recent memories, so I did, I came across a moment when I felt I forgot something. 

When I checked it, I tried to figure out what I had forgotten, doing so I realized that I was looking at white wall, I felt confused, but nothing felt off. 

When I tried to focus on the white, my home suddenly appeared and I looked around, nothing was wrong, nothing felt off, I was right by a window, and it was sunset. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stood up and looked outside, and saw my suburban neighborhood, desolate, a small white metal Fed-Ex delivery truck passed by, but not one person seemed to care. 

I sat back down."
lonely,anybody else do this?,anybody else do this? - sometimes i like to imagine that someone is always by my side or with me. if i’m walking sometimes i try to imagine someone walking beside me and talking to me or sometimes i like to imagine someone cuddling with me while i lay in bed at night. or if i’m waiting for some food to microwave i like to think someone is right there with me. i really love the idea of just being able to hug someone who’s right there beside me.
lonely,Male looking for female friend,"Male looking for female friend - Heya, I'm looking for a new friend who shares the same interests that I do :)

Been feeling really low recently and just need someone to talk to about anything. 

I'm a PS4/5 and PC gamer, I do also have a switch so animal crossing and Mario kart is on the cards 😋

I love Marvel, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Lord of the rings, Brooklyn 99, The US Office and much more.

My favourite games are all the SoulsBorne games with an exception to Sekiro, Destiny 2, Stardew Valley and more.

I enjoy watching a lot of youtubers too such as Vanoss Gaming, Jacksepticeye, Penguiz0, iamwildcat, The Terrorisor, Moosnuckle, Game grumps, PlayStation Access, Mr Sark and more 😋

So if you feel like we could get on, please drop me a message or a comment, hope to hear for someone 💙"
lonely,An echoing emptiness,An echoing emptiness - Ive felt like ive had this hole inside that i was supposed to fill with another person but i cant love correctly if that makes sense im to clingy or not clingy enough it was easier when i was younger and more attractive but those were hollow relationships too i need affection but i dont know how to ask for it i guess is the point
lonely,I'll probably rely on alcohol when I get older,"I'll probably rely on alcohol when I get older - Alcohol makes me light. It makes me happy. I laugh more. Smile more. Talk more. I stop caring what other people think of me. It just makes me feel better. 

Though I'm only in my later teens I feel like I might become; not completely dependent on alcohol, but probably rely on it a lot. All the thoughts I think get pushed aside as it makes me focus on the now. I become more sociable and happier.

I hope that soon I'm able to just feel like that always and hope to never have to rely on alcohol.

I hope to become more sociable on my own and be happy, gain more confidence, but if my life continues how it is right now, lonely, depressing, living without friends, who knows, maybe I will rely on alcohol.

I hope to find someone who can push these thoughts away for me."
lonely,released i have no one.,"released i have no one. - Recently i have been going through another depressive episode and usually i can handle them myself. i usually prefer it that way. today something happened that pushed me a little over the edge and i needed to talk to someone so i did what every normal person does and grabs their phone to call a friend but i sat there for a while and realized i had no one to call. i have never had an actual friendship, only people who come any go after a few weeks or months and it really fucking sucks. i want someone consistent in my life but no one ever sticks around that long"

lonely,Feeling Empty,"Feeling Empty - No one wants me. I can’t even blame them either because I don’t even want me. Sleeping alone every night hurts so bad. Sleep isn’t even that good anymore. Nothing is good anymore. It’s like everything that was once so colorful and lively to me is fading to a dull gray. I’m so pitiful. Looking at myself disgusts me. And it’s all my fault too. I’m the reason I don’t have any friends. I have a fucking panic attack walking into stores so it’s no surprise I can’t hold a conversation for shit. I can’t even hold eye contact with my own mother. And sometimes I just cry for no reason other than feeling a physical pain in my chest from having no one there to hold me. I feel like I’m living the same day on repeat. It’s my fault that I’m lonely but I can’t help wishing for someone to just hold me with no strings attached. To kiss my problems away or some other stupid cheesy shit that I don’t have to commit to. I’m starting to picture what it would feel like to just die. I won’t shake from all of the anxiety while talking to someone. I won’t feel that fear of never succeeding. I won’t feel this fucking pain from how alone I am. It sounds so pathetic and disgusting coming from my mouth, but I don’t know if I’ll ever find someone who would take care of ME for once. 

Sorry for this shit-post. I’ve been holding this in for awhile and there’s no one I can talk to. To anyone reading, thank you for taking the time listening to my idiotic thoughts. You are appreciated."

lonely,When I’m alone it’s hard not to get caught up,"When I’m alone it’s hard not to get caught up - Welp, here I am, I’ve been feeling really lonely lately, right before this I cried for the third time in a week, I would rarely cry previous to these events. I was in a relationship as of maybe 4 months ago, I had to let go though, I thought it would be for the better of us and it was, though I loved her to death. And now, I’m having trouble with the creeping in of insecurities and such, which I hate to mention to anyone cause it’s nothing to be proud of. I’ve had the insecurity problem for years despite being a fairly extroverted person. While in a relationship it was rarely ever problem but guess what, it’s back. My gf would be who I would talk to if I ever needed to, which was super nice cause I hate to bring up my problems to my friends cause it’s not their problem, and I hate to bother them and take the time out of their day... I still feel this way. And for that reason I feel pretty lonely, it’s partially my fault though for not opening up to more people, but yeah, I don’t have a gf figure to tell and I’m left alone with my thoughts and it eats away at me. I look at myself in the mirror and frown and get glassy eyed, I want to tell my Ex cause it’s a good way to get it out, but I hate to bother her cause why would she want to deal with someone who’s not hers anymore. This is more just to put it out in the world, hope y’all enjoyed my sad story."
lonely,What is wrong with me?,"What is wrong with me? - I'm a current 19M college student, 5'11"", lean build, near straight-A grades, and a decently attractive appearance, (or so I've been told), and according to my current friend group, ""a really fun guy to hang around"". And yet I have never been in a relationship, nor encountered any girl who's even shown the slightest bit of interest in anything beyond a platonic friendship. I know it's partly my fault that I'm not confident enough to try and initiate things with a girl I'm interested in, but that's in part because I'm a pussy and part because I don't want to ask out a girl I don't know very well and have her already be in a relationship and be forced to deal with that awkwardness. And I hear people say all the time that they prefer being single because relationships can get messy and difficult, but for me I'd rather deal with mess if it meant I had someone who, at the end of day still cared for me and loved me in a non-platonic way and to whom I could show love and affection. And yet, here I am, wallowing in depression and self-pity even after having a fun night with my friend group, because all I can think about in between the laughter and jokes is how much I hate being the only one in the group that has always been single. God, I'm such lonely trash"

What's left is myself, and the flakes, falling."
lonely,I am alone. This is who I am.,"I am alone. This is who I am. - Left to rot as a disenfranchised, undesirable man. Cast out from a society that cares about none other than the most genetically gifted elite. Left alone in a dark, empty room for years, to bottle up a raw disappointment of reality so vast,  few could begin to comprehend. Left to dream of better times, never to have a rational hope of ever seeing them fulfilled. To try your best, only to fail over and over again, for reasons out of individual control. A game that was rigged from the very beginning, yet forced to blame myself out of a desperate attempt to deny my reality of being forever alone."

And not be wishing I wasn’t feeling so lonely. And not be expected to put out or look good. I would love to have someone love me not lust after me. To come be by my side as we get fresh air with the windows rolled down. To be fed my love language not constantly be the one making everyone else happy. To be smiling as they hold my hand, no exchanges of words. I would love to go for a ride right now."

When the only thing keeping you from being in a relationship is choosing not to be in one. Then being single is the shit. Freedom when you want it and affection when you need it. It must be great to have pretty girls lining up to date you. 

But for the rest of us being single means going to sleep alone every night. Being alone on new year's and valentines and your birthday. Settling because you know you can't do any better. Staying away from people cause you know itll end in heartbreak.

So next time you want to tell a chronically single person that being single is great, kindly shove it up your ass."

Christianity, why do you take everyone from me. First you take my parents and turn them into abusive monsters, than my friends and make them into homophobic/transphobic degenerates. Than you take my sleep forcing me to have nightmares about hell. Than you take my serotonin and dopamine. Now you take Molly. I see her walk into the confessional booth see her leave me for you for the church simply for the fact I’m an atheist and I’m not what the school wants her or have.

Then tonight at her house she told me she invited her sister to come on Saturday, and when I asked about our plans she told me sorry, she didn't remember them. It made me sad and frustrated and she told me it would be better if I just went home and we'd talk about it tomorrow. Now im kind of drunk and I had already had a horrible day before this and now I guess I'm not important enough to remember that we'd made plans on her literal birthday. We have been together for almost 2 years and we are partners and best friends and I don't understand how she could just forget about me and blow me off like that. Or why she would send me home instead of talking about it. Maybe being drunk is making this a bigger deal than it is but I'm sad as hell and she went to sleep and no one will talk to me because it's Saturday and I'm the only one in my friend group still taking quarantine seriously and I just need someone to talk to. Idk what I'm even asking for in this post it just really hurt and I'm tipsy and I guess I just want to speak to people. Ugh."

If I get a 60 on a test, they are like “ohh see its because you dont eat enough thats why you’re so thin and failed the test”. Im a tough guy, I can stick up for myself and deal with it. But when you just recently moved, you don’t have the friends anymore to run away from the problems and vent off of, so im practically alone now. They called me skinny, compared me to other people and got mad at me even more because they saw that i was upset. They said they are only doing this to make me feel better. Well, no. I’ve already past the boiling point where my parent’s “innocent card” doesn’t go through with me and my dad shoved me to the ground because i ended up saying something back for once. I dont know, i have nobody to talk to, ive only grown more insecure, secretive and sad for all the years my parents and everybody been calling me out with the body shaming. I cried for once just now, and it felt terribly painful. Im just at a point where I have nobody now. Like my body just aches now everytime i look in the mirror.

Long story short, I found out she was cheating on me and I broke up with her. It sucks though because even though she was a horrible person, she was just about the only girl who would text me back and would text me first and we would tali everyday and say I love you to each other. Even though she was lying to me, I miss her. I go out, I can be shy but I'm a social person but most girls I text I get left on read or I get short answers back as if they don't want to talk to me when just the other day we were getting along fine. I'm starting to realize it's going to be a long time before I'm in a relationship again because of my horrible luck with girls and I'm just sad about it and I think about it everyday.

lonely,back to square one,"back to square one - I hate this feeling.. I know I have friends, I love them to death. Only problem is I fucked up something special.

I guess I should start by saying, I don't have irl friends. They all left when high school ended, now they're all around the country, I'm still in my room. All my friends are on Discord, on a server I run with my closest friends. My best friend, who's very smart with Discord, actually helped build the server. I met him just about to the day a year ago. I also have other close friends, including the other guy I'll mention, who I had an unofficial relationship with. 

Cue about a week ago. I was sitting on the couch when my parents started talking about a vacation. They mentioned taking me to an amusement park for my birthday right? And since they know about him, they suggested I bring the guy I had a thing with, both for the opportunity and the fact he might, *might* ride rollercoasters with me. 

Now, how would this fuck things up? I talk to the guy. He doesn't like rollercoasters. Bummed, but nothing too big. So I talk to my best friend.. he does like them. But that's when it kicks in, the thing that messes up every single thing I have going. Dysphoria. I realize that even if he does like rollercoasters, he couldn't go with me. He accepts me just fine, but his parents? Hell nah. Neither do mine. It would be awkward. Keep in mind, this happens on February 13th..

Comes the dysphoria.. Valentine's Day. The guy I like, has things planned with me, and as much as I wanted to celebrate I felt like utter shit. He also accepts me, but he doesn't know much about dysphoria.. he ends up asking, even though he said himself his gut said not to, a really personal question that made it even worse. Valentine's Day = ruined..

Next day rolls around, can't get worse right? Wrong.. we're in the server, talking about a stupid control on a game. I call it garbage, not even at anyone, just in general because it makes your reaction times worse. Best friend, takes it personally.. I apologize a ton, but it doesn't help. 

The next day, my wifi goes out.. for 3 days, I can't contact anyone. It was actually quite amazing, I could take a break, until my mom insisted I get phone data back since we won't get it fixed until next week. I get on today, instant massive anxiety. The fling, is happy to see me. My best friend, acts like he doesn't even care.. and guess what, this is just 3 days before the day I met him last year.

Dysphoria is kicking my ass. It's damn well making me suicidal again. And it's made me feel lonelier than ever, the reason I came to this app in the first place. I just wanna not feel alone anymore, it seems like I do this every week and end up back at square one.. I know I have other friends, and I really appreciate them.. but even with all of them, I still feel lonely"

I of course understand why, but it doesn’t make it any less painful. I feel so excluded from the grieving process.

lonely,I keep a list of people that initiate contact with me,"I keep a list of people that initiate contact with me - I feel very lonely. I do have friends, but I always feel like I put more work into it and I feel like I just care more. Always. It doesn't matter whether it's my love interest, a woman, a man, a friend, ... I always feel like I am the one with less options, more to lose and the one who actually cares. So I started making a list.

The list works like this:

Someone asks me to do something/messages me first -&gt; They get a ""token"". 

If someone has a token I am allowed to contact them first -&gt; They lose their token then.

This is probably really unhealthy and dumb, but I just wanted some prove - Do I really care more?

Well.. turns out I have a lot less actual friends than I expected. The very few ones that actually put effort into me I learned to really appreciate.

All in all, it proved to me that I do, in fact, put more effort into others than they do into me. I think it's because I treat everyone as if they had my loneliness problem. Always making sure they feel that I care. I guess I haven't found anyone like me. That makes me sad.

Thank you"

lonely,The mental strain of Quarantine,"The mental strain of Quarantine - Pre-Quarantine I hung out with friends alottt. It was a large friend group as well. I had a vast number acquaintances and never felt lonely. I was either in school (was a junior in Highschool at the time) talking to acquaintances in school or hanging out with my friends after school. we would do stupid teenager things, and hangout at each others houses each Friday watching movies and cooking whatever monstrosity we could make from random things found around the kitchen.

we used to sleep over and talk about everything from girls to our college pathways. 

Even during quarantine I had some things to keep me sane. I had a girlfriend, a few friends that were basically all close enough to me to be best friends. I would either be at the mall with one friend talking about deep issues to stupid things and the other friend walking in the woods at night talking about the same. 

But now I've lost the Girlfriend, and the 2 friends have drifted ever so apart from me. The friend group as a whole has dissolved to 25% of what it was before which is at least something I guess. Even with that we never really hangout anymore. 

I used to talk with my best friends about my issues, i used to hangout with my friends which made me pretty happy, I used to have many random acquaintances in school which made life more interesting. But now all of that is gone.

I feel like I've lost purpose, everything and everyone is so bland. I don't want to feel this way but at this point I don't know if it will ever go back to normal.

He may turn out to be boring later and a girl might not want him, but alas, she made contact only because he looks good, meaning he had a chance at something.

lonely,Pandemic’s loneliness,"Pandemic’s loneliness - I just need to vent. Sorry for this long post. 

I used to have a life so full. Every single night I was out. Almost every weekend I had something planned. I had a boyfriend. I left the relationship in September 2019. 
It’s been more than 1year and a half. 6 months to move out of our house and stabilize my life. To start to be opened to anything new. And then the pandemic hit. 
I was already at a stage in the life where all you friends go in the same direction. Taking the decision of leaving that path was not only hard in terms of loosing someone I had been for so long. It was also taking the risk of drifting apart from my friends. Close to 28, people start talking weddings, kids and house. Very seriously. And I fear we would have less in common. 

I must say my worries have been answered. X100 
I am now more lonely than ever. All my friends, whom I used to see several times a week, are happily and safely locked down in couple. The few single ones I knew before lockdown somehow found someone in between. 
No one needs me. Sometimes I even feel like they only see me out of pity. 
And this is for my closest friends. The one less close I don’t get any news anymore. 
I don’t have any brothers or sisters. I don’t have any close family members my age. 
I don’t have anyone to be happy to spend my weekends with. 
I don’t want to take holidays anymore, I am too afraid of being alone. Of having to look around and try to find someone to come with me. They all have their weekend and holidays full of couple activities. 
I work almost full remote. So I stay alone in my flat most days. 
I live in a country with strict rules. I cannot go out after work and I barely can see people in the weekend because they all seems to have other plans. Today I asked my friends if they wanted to do something-anything - this weekend most of them didn’t even reply...
I am not feeling comfortable about traveling alone. It feels even more lonely. 
I cannot meet people or start any activity I am locked home and these activities don’t even exist anymore. 
I tried online dating but I feel so lost out there this is not my world. My past relationships were all built on friendship. I feel every guys on these apps are just so dull. I know it is not true. But anyway, starting a relationship virtually doesn’t seem natural to me. I don’t have any single friend and I can’t seem to make new ones. 

I am afraid I will stay this lonely forever. And that I will just keep losing my friends. 

Sorry for rambling but I am so tired of this."

I'm a 22 year old guy still living with his mom (God bless you mom). It's chill, and i wouldn't trade that for anything in the world...however a mother's love can only help you so long, until the loneliness really hits. And for me it hit a few years ago... 

I know I'm not a 10/10, hell i hope I'm at least a 4 or 5/10. But what makes it all so much more difficult is I'm scared of even trying to talk to other people, especially from the opposite sex. Im 22 year old introvert who spends most of his free time playing Xbox, doesn't really exercise all that much except for what I get out of work and feels out of place in groups of people. The fact that 5 years of bullying in middle school didn't really help with my self-confidence and self-esteem is the cherry on top. I have the boys for a employee at the store my mom works in, but I'm just way to shy/scared to even try and ask her for...well anything. I'm scared of getting some dumb answer like ""you barely know me, how come you have the boys for me"" or something like that. Is such an answer unlikely? Probably, but does it scare me that it is a possibility? Fuck yes it does...

It's a daily struggle of getting up, planning out the day, trying to get stuff done, feeling like I got nothing done, and going to sleep. And what is worst is that there is no one there for me to share anything with throughout the day. It's just me.

I do have a beautiful family and cute cats, but theres no one to talk to. I try to tell myself I am doing everything for my family and future, but its like I dont want anything anymore.

I just want to lay down and sleep. Close my eyes and rest. Feel at peace in my heart. Get out all the dirt off my heart because it shouldn't be buried yet. Not while I am meant to be alive. 

No more friends because ive pushed everyone away due to depression and it's embarrassing reaching out to them. I dont even have references for work because it's silly to reach out to someone from way long ago who I never kept in touch with.

They all appreciated my message, and we agreed to go our own separate ways. 

Surprisingly, a close acquaintance who ghosted me for a year noticed and apologised. He told me that he couldn't think of a way to tell me that he didn't see us being friends past high school. 

He told me that from a few common contacts, he heard updates from my life, and he was proud to know about the person that I have become.

I don’t think I should, but these people did do lots wrong, and I’m trying to think why it could be my fault, but I just can’t, and I’m always self-critical anyway."
lonely,I have great friends yet I feel lonely. (M19),"I have great friends yet I feel lonely. (M19) - I've never really suffered from loneliness before. Though recently I've felt more lonely than ever, despite having amazing friends. 

I'm a very independent person. I'm more than happy to spend time by myself and can keep myself busy. I have a good group of friends who live together and they're walking distance away which is great. But I've noticed that if they are busy, I have nobody to hang out with. My housemates who I live with are decent people but they are a friendship group which I am not a part of - this doesn't bother me as we have very different interests and lifestyles. So I can only hang out with my housemates in small bursts where we never get too personal. I often feel like they're waiting for me to leave if I'm ever in the same room. It gets awkward and as soon as I leave, the conversation goes back to normal.

I go on walks (and various other trips) every day and will sometimes invite someone out to join me. Unfortunately, every time I've asked - I am turned down. This has happened so often that I choose to not invite anyone anymore so I can't be rejected. 

Due to covid, every day feels like rinse and repeat and I feel like I'm always spending them alone. I am unsure of what to do, but I haven't had a personal conversation with anyone in a while and so I'm venting here to get it off my chest. 

I try to look at loneliness in a positive light - ultimate freedom, lack of judgement from others and no schedule clashes. My night walks are very therapeutic and help clean my mind. However, it would be nice to share one of them with someone someday."

lonely,Silly rant but me and my boyfriend were looking through photos on our phones and he had so many videos of him and his friends.,"Silly rant but me and my boyfriend were looking through photos on our phones and he had so many videos of him and his friends. - Now I know that since I have a boyfriend, I shouldn’t be lonely right?? Well for the most part I’m not, but sometimes I still get that lingering feeling I’ve felt for years. 

But the other day we were looking through each other’s photos in our camera rolls and I really had no pictures of myself or with anybody for the past couple of years. I didn’t go to real university until my sophomore year (I started at community college). I essentially had zero friends up until this past semester. But I moved out and branched out, joined a sorority and I’m doing better, despite sometimes feeling ostracized and strange. 

My bf is a year older and rushed a frat his freshman year and showed me all of the crazy photos and videos of him and his friends having fun and goofing off. It didn’t make me jealous, but it made me almost embarrassed that my camera roll consisted almost entirely of memes. I really never left the house my freshman year. Even with my friends now we don’t really have goofy fun like that. I love them but sometimes I still feel like the odd man out (it’s probably my anxiety talking).

I don’t know, I just feel like a boring loser sometimes. I fake my outgoingness and end up getting burnt out at social events super quickly. I feel like I wasted so many years of high school and my first year of college being a homebody and doing nothing. I remember someone commented on me always being at home in high school and wanted to die lol."

lonely,Lost my wife AND the love of my life.,"Lost my wife AND the love of my life. - I found myself in an emotionally abusive marriage, where my wife was the abuser. On her suggestion, our last year of marriage was open. Surprisingly, I met this stunningly beautiful woman who was new at my work who ended up agreeing to be my side thing. She and the wife got along fine and we all became friends. Eventually the wife started pushing for threesomes, which at first, I was super excited about!

Eventually, the wife being so pushy ended up causing my fwb to not be interested in sex with either of us anymore, because even when it was just me and her, the wife would always have something to say about it, despite her having her own side thing (my former best friend). 

Thing is, the side chick is actually awesome. She's not perfect by any means, but I swear to God she's perfect for me. I love her. I truly believe she's the one I'm meant to be with. But now, she's gone, ran away from my wife and I not long before I eventually left her. I have no contact with her anymore, so now I've lost my wife, (which I'm not super upset about, but still, it's someone I shared a bed with for a decade) and I've lost this amazing woman that I love like I've never loved anyone before. 

So I spend my nights browsing tinder and plenty of fish, sending messages that mostly never even get read, and crying myself to sleep."

I feel so alone and it it glaringly more obvious during the pandemic. I made decisions that should have made me friends but haven't. I have tried putting myself out there, reaching out, trying to make plans and it falls flat every time. How can I be 23 years old and be so lonely. With just a dog to talk to who loves me but can't tall back. 

I rely heavily on my boyfriend but he has his own friends and like any couple we need space from each other. I'm fine when we do things together but as soon as he has a friend to text or play a game with I feel so alone. So bored. Wishing I had someone to talk to. 

I have never understood why my track record with friends has been so bad. It is suspected I might be autistic, and I want to be. So then it can explain why I have always struggled with friendships."

 One thing they said was that I'm always in my room and never do anything else which might have contributed to that. My lack of social interaction and hobbies did this. The doc recommended me some pills and recommended someone to talk to.

lonely,My Reddit bot can give you some random subjects to talk about 🤖,"My Reddit bot can give you some random subjects to talk about 🤖 - **TLDR:** u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t can send you a random question which you can ask to a friend. This means that, you'll need to find that friend first. If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It’s also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won’t even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON’T be forwarded!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‘!’ as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: What would this do…

**!changelog**: Why would you care about this?

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to.

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don’t provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won’t pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it’s good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON’T want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they’ll will still remain.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess… It displays all the commands and well… tries to help you with that.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

**Have fun :)**"

But i just didn't know what to do i never have and I don't know if even if i had known what to do if i would've been able to get over my social anxiety and inability to express whats goin on in my head and tell her i loved her and that she was the only person i had that would brighten my life. I felt greedy feeling as low as i did with a life as good as i had, i felt if i told her she'd turn to me and call me a coward or just tell me to man up or worse even try to help. She didn't know that all i ever wanted was for her to look at me the way she did for that short time when it was good and that would hold me up and let me keep on pushing through this good life that i can't bare. But now after a year and then some of me trying to talk but not knowing how to start and her ignoring my feeble attempts at conversation I've dropped out of university and am living with my parents again with less drive than i've ever had starting a job that i dont care about in a week.

On another note the thing that let me discover that i really am the addition to every friend group im in is that the summer of 2020 when everyone was trapped at home having to cancel every plan they had was just another summer for me it made the third in three years where i recognized that i really am alone and it was just another summer of me playing the only game that brings me joy (csgo) alone for 5 hours a day.

I miss your smile
I miss making you laugh
I miss how beautiful you made me feel
I miss how you made me think you cared about me 
I miss your blue eyes 
I miss how flawless I felt those summer nights we spent together 
I miss the way your skin touched mine 
I miss your touch 
I miss your laughter and your voice 
I miss the old school, manly man you are 
I miss being weird w you 
I miss our inside jokes 
And I miss how the more you got to know me the more it seemed you liked me 
I miss how much I adored you 
I miss the future I saw in us 
I miss how happy I felt just by hearing from you 
You really meant a lot to me 
And even though we don’t talk anymore, I hope you still think of me, my friend 

It’s been a year now, I thought I’d find someone else to distract myself by now, but at night I still want it to be you and me, baby"

lonely,Going from having lots of friends to having none,"Going from having lots of friends to having none - Up until covid I had so many friends. My phone was always active and I always had stuff to do. Fast forward to now, getting dropped from a fraternity, friends dieing, and others just drifting off. I have none. I don't even know how I got here, everyday I become more and more isolated. I used to be really outgoing, now I'd rather stay in on weekends and I hate it. There's so much I want to talk about but I feel like nobody cares anymore. What have y'all done during covid with little to no friends to go out with in college."
lonely,I hate that I can’t move on,"I hate that I can’t move on - She hates me she said so. It’s been over a year since we were on good terms and in October she basically told me off to stop texting and calling her and I have. It’s so hard to accept the person I once shared so much with could just leave. Like I’m a good person man. I have flaws and wasn’t perfect but I just had a couple bad days and it was over. 

Like I can’t stop replaying those days in my head and what if. My life is over. I’ve never had success meeting a partner in real life or on any dating platform. I lucked out and met the most beautiful kind woman and ruined it and now just have nothing. I’m wasting away. 

I sometimes compare my situation to like a criminal that made a bad mistake and now he is in jail for 20 years. Like that’s what I did I made one really bad move in life and now I’m down a path I shouldn’t be. I should be sharing my life with this person who now is sharing her life with someone else. I just want to wake up from this nightmare. 

I have almost no one in my life. Like one work friend who I see once a month and we work from home so never see him like we used to. One old friend who works 60 hours a week and lives 10 hours away and we barely talk. My brother who never asks how I’m doing. It’s so hard to be around happy couples even family. Like it’s hard for me to visit my parents and see that they are so happy together. I want it so much I can’t take it. 

I can’t even stand seeing people with wedding rings anymore. If I’m watching a video and see the ring and know they are married I have to turn it off. I’m drowning. And venting and Idek what to say. If you read this far I owe you a beer. 

The only thing I really enjoy is golf. I wish I had some golfing friend. I wish I had any friend but I have the time and money to go play golf for a weekend in Florida or anywhere and no one to do that either. 

I’m drowning and I’m on antidepressants but there is no cure for loneliness."

I have Autism so making friends isn't something I've ever done well even young. I don't have any friends from HS or even college. I don't leave the house most days, hell I can't even remember the last time I did. My work is pretty independent so I don't take to anyone really, and I don't play online games

Most days I never notice in the daytime because I work, take a nap, the play games (been playing a lot of RDR2 lately). But once night hits it becomes very clear how alone I am. To a point I don't even know what life would be like if I didn't live with my parents.

lonely,Can’t trust anyone anymore,"Can’t trust anyone anymore - Girlfriend cheated on me with her child’s father. I don’t claim to be perfect but things were good between us. And not to be gross but she really enjoyed sex with my. I only caught her because I was a jealous loser and drove by her house and then her child’s father’s house when she didn’t FaceTime me before bed like our normal tradition. She lied about it until I called her out on her BS. We broke up for a couple weeks and then we got back together after much pleading from her. But after a couple months I broke up with her. She seemed to love me even more than before but I couldn’t trust her anymore. And I hated myself for being a wuss and taking her back. 

Up until late last year I was living with my parents because my father had a stroke. I setup up a security camera in my room to keep an eye on my stuff because my father was acting erratic. to my surprise I caught my mother on it when I was spending the night at my girlfriend’s place. My mother had no reason to be in my room and was aimlessly going through my stuff. I saw her doing that several times in my room before I broke up with my ex. 

I also caught my father in several lies last year but it was way too many situations to type out in this post. Overall he’s just been narcissistic asshole my whole life. I used to think that he was a bad guy but now I’m seeing that he’s average. 

Everyday I catch people lying to me at work. People want replacement devices at my job without troubleshooting but I frequently catch them in their lies. I’ll spare the details but I can see more diagnostic info about their devices than they’re aware of. Whenever I call out people on those BS they sometimes become angry, other times they tell another verifiable lie and the most concerning ones act lie the lie doesn’t even matter. I wish that I never took my job because it’s shown me how terrible the general population are. 

So I feel like I’m stuck living life as a recluse. I can’t trust the general public, I can’t trust my family, and when I opened up my heart to a woman and became vulnerable I was lied to by her too. Life sucks as a loner but it seems like the only way to live."

lonely,Tired,"Tired - I am so tired of being alone.  I'm a single woman in my 50s and I've been alone for a decade.  I have great friends and family.  In those aspects I know I'm lucky.  But at the end of the day, I have no one to share my life with.  No on the talk to.  No one to care for.  No one to touch me. Those things cause a loneliness that is deep and painful.  Most days I'm ok.  I can push through and I'm ok.  But then there are days, like today, when it hurts my heart.  I try not to get caught up in the ""why not me?"" but it's hard sometimes.  They say that there is someone for everyone out there.  I don't believe that anymore.  I'm sure I sound bitter, and maybe I am a little.  Mostly I'm sad.  And being alone is hard.  No one wants to hear you whine about being alone so you have to put on a happy face and pretend everyday that you're good with it.   I know I'm rambling and I'm sorry.

I feel like I am invisible to everyone around me. No one knows my name, I don't think my instructors even know who I am. It is hard to make friends with anyone because of the social distancing and I am new to the university. One of my professors takes attendance with a sheet of the classes' photos from our student IDs. I saw him looking at me one day like he had no idea who I was, and I don't blame him because the photo is 5 yrs old and I wear a mask. I go to class and stay on campus for hours, leave and I haven't talked to anyone. I drifted apart from a last friend a few years ago. Her childhood bestfriend had video called her while she was at my house and her friend was drunk and saying ""common I know you don't have fun there."" It felt horrible. My friend didn't even really defend me. And she was my best friend. Around that time I had my bf break up with me and then antagonize me afterwards about how boring and lame I was. So now I just feel too much shame to even try to bond with anyone, because why would they like me anyways? How can I change this, what do I do? I say this all the time but I just need one person to know me."

lonely,I'm starting to love and hate solitude.,"I'm starting to love and hate solitude. - New user here, since april of lockdown I haven't interacted with many people irl (aside from my parents) and it's starting to take a toll on my mental health. I'm having physical consequences like actually getting colder and auditory hallucinations.

I'm also loving solitude as people are quite noisy and since I can only really talk to a few friends online I don't need to spend hours talking to them or wasting time on them. I can just talk to them for about 20 minutes on something and tell them I have to go, then I just stop talking to them.

I've never really had a girlfriend or any stable long-term partner which is why I haven't really felt the need for emotional connection and I think not having a strong father figure is having a way lesser effect on my solitude.

Problem is, mentally, I crave interaction. I haven't felt so lonely before and its scary out there. I keep having doubts about myself and my actions and I end up cancelling plans I have with friends. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm scared to think about this."

lonely,Is it Me? It probably is,"Is it Me? It probably is - So this will be sort of a rant and I am doing what I thought I would never do and have judged others for doing in the past and that is to share a personal issue and ask others to provide their thoughts. I am a guy in my 40's. Since the time I was younger, I never had friends who I could call a 'best buddy'. As I grew up, friends from school for the most part did not transition to university and 'friends' from there never transitioned into work. I never spent time or effort to cultivate relationships and non of my relationships were organic enough for me to stay connected. 

By default, my world view for the majority of my life has been that people suck until they prove they don't. Admittingly, this has prevented me from opening myself up to others and being curious enough about their lives to develop friendship. I have no serious hobbies where I can meet people. Add to that the fact that I am shy and introverted and connecting with new people is HARD. I am that guy who would sit next to you on a 10+ hour long flight and would not utter a word or be curious about you. I have improved a little bit but not by too much.

 The only person who I can really call my friend at this point in my life is my wife who I have known for 20 years and I don't know what will become of me if she is no longer around - considering that I don't have anyone else in this world who I consider a friend. We don't have kids or pets either.  I think I do need a friend or more than one - a person I can share my thoughts with and talk about shared passions when I am older. I am generally liked at work and have a sense of humor mixed in with a dose of sarcasm. I am emotionally intelligent (for a guy) and listen well. So, the question is what do you suggest I do to find people who may turn into friends. What should I change in my thought process to be more open to others?"

lonely,Lonely in Montreal,"Lonely in Montreal - Why is it so difficult to make friends ?

And by friends, I mean just people to hang out with, eat good food, play video games, etc.

Context: 25F, was raised by toxic/narcissistic parents so most of my childhood/adolescence was about survival mode, built up walls around me and kinda missed out on the opportunity to socialize during uni (which I guess is where most lifelong friendship are formed ?)

\*sigh\*

I just want human connection.

 To meet up with someone and ask ""hey how you doing?"" without that person going into a 30 min monologue about their life, never bothering to fake interest in you own. Or , constantly being the one to reach out first when you do meet someone cool. Or feeling like your in some sort of competition! (maybe that a girl thing) 

 Pre-covid, I had thought about joining a boardgame club on meetup, or maybe starting Jiu Jitsu...I do realize that friendships wont happen until I put myself out there. 

But yea, covid happened and its been a year of social isolation. So reddit community, if you're having similar thoughts/feelings let me know. I'd be nice to not feel so lonely.

lonely,Are some people just meant to be lonely and unhappy?,"Are some people just meant to be lonely and unhappy? - Is there any evidence about the question I ask in the title? I can't find any. I've read so many books, watched videos, etc., and I can't find a clear answer.

I understand nobody is happy all the time, and that there are degrees of happiness. In terms of Maslow's hierarchy, does anyone have any ideas or opinions about having a grasp on the top three sections? Personally, I know I'm better off than a lot of people. I have never and know that I technically have no reason, to ever wonder if I have a place to lay my head, food to eat, and people that care about me. I have a family that I know loves me, but it's just not enough, and I wonder if some of us are just meant to feel perpetually alone and unfulfilled.

Basically, I think I'm emotionally/socially stunted from high school and college. I'm from a good family in a small town. Growing up, I was in a class of less than 30 people, and the surrounding communities were similar. I don't think I'm better, I just never found anyone I could relate to in a more-than-surface-level way. I was nice to everyone, involved with everything, never a part of controversy. I was well-liked, won awards, and told myself to just get through it, keep escaping on the internet and books where people I wish I had in my life existed until I could go somewhere else.

I thought when I got to college (a big university), the sheer amount of people would allow me the opportunity to form real friendships and relationships. I joined Greek life and some organizations, I even observed, in real life for the first time, the kind of people I wish I could have in my life, but I just.... didn't feel good enough for them? I didn't approach them, but they also didn't approach me. I ended up becoming part of a group that was eerily similar to the kind of people I grew up with. Don't get me wrong, we had some good times and I appreciate the distraction they gave me, but much like the people in high school, we never got past that surface-level and now that we've parted, we don't really speak to each other.

Post college (now I'm mid 20s), nothing has changed, other than the fact that where I once could work a room if I had to (even if it was really draining), now I think I have more social anxiety. It's like I'm resigned to the fact that I'm never going to have relationships in my life beyond the surface-level ones. It seems like even people I wouldn't trade places with for a number of reasons usually have at least one person they love (either platonically or romantically). I know I have to do some of the work, but it just does not seem this hard for everyone else... it just happens to them? Nothing happens to me. I spark joy for nobody, and nobody sparks joy for me.

Sorry if this seems melodramatic. I just want a full life. I've got shelter, food, a great education, a good job once I finish my graduate program, and I'm mildly attractive. I have a family that loves me, though I feel like a put on a front for them, too. I just want a real friend, maybe even a few, and I of course want a romantic partner and a family, but I feel like a real, good friend would be a start. Am I just not meant to have this in the way that I want it? I don't want to pretend to care about things I don't and suppress my real interests like I did all through high school and college. I want people in my life that love all of me, and don't make me feel bad about that. But I'm starting to wonder if this is something that just doesn't happen for everyone? I'd rather my books and movies not be the highlight of my days anymore, but if they have to be my highlights for the rest of time, I can accept that. Idk, I'm rambling. If anyone reads all of this... sorry if I probably wasted your time."

lonely,What‘s worse than being lonely?,"What‘s worse than being lonely? - ... finding contact, getting hope, enjoying companionship and getting dumped again.

Short story: When Covid really took off in my country, I started to seek friends on reddit. After rougly 6 months I had talked to around 100 people of whom I cold establish a permanent contact to around 10. Out of that ten, I established a real friendship to exactly one person. That meant to me: Daily contact, constant exchange, very personal convos. I really considered that person as a friend.

But then the probably inevitable thing happened. Convos moved from several times a day to one time a day - and then, from one day to another, to complete silence. Ghosted after half a year, after sharing basically all of my life, my problems, my worries, and my (very little) joys.

As I‘m completely alone irl - lost my mother lasz year, cut off from my only two irl friends due to Covid - that hurt me a lot. Looking back, it would have been better not to have reached out at all. It‘s just another nail in the coffin; another confirmation that, no matter how hard I try, I‘m not the kind of person you want to befriend. And that might even be true. I‘ll just leave this here as a warning for anyone who puts a lot of energy into online friendships. Your „friend“ can drop and block you any second."

I was watching a video on YouTube titled ""the loneliest thing you've ever done (r/askreddit)"" and hearing all these stories really resonated with me, but I was also feeling this strange thing in my heart, not pain necessarily, but uncomfortable non the less. The feeling leaves me feeling hopeless and somewhat hollow apart from the weird, uncomfortable sensation in my chest. It makes me feel like I'm cursed, or doomed to forever be alone and that I'll never find anyone to call a friend or lover, that my destiny in to be a socially outcast pariah unworthy of any type of love, affection or companionship.

lonely,Alone is how live my life and all I want to do is cry.,"Alone is how live my life and all I want to do is cry. - I moved to Florida 15 years ago after my divorce. I got sick and have had several surgeries.
My kids are now grown the youngest one turning 19. 
My kids tell me that they have to live their lives they cannot stop loving theirs to help me.
I'm a grandfather now but cannot see my two granddaughters as they live in nj and it's hard for me to travel due to my fixed income.
My oldest daughter came to visit, for a week but instead of staying with me she stayed over my brother's house for three days after the 3rd day left to visit in laws on her husband side. 
I might not have much, but all I asked for was to be able to see my granddaughter, they went out places with my brother and I wasn't invited because they said they didn't want to have to pay for me.
My health has pushed everyone away from me, I try to be positive, but I just don't see a light anymore. 
I thought that I was being a good father, I would drop everything for anything they wanted, but even when I was in the hospital I didn't even get a call.
I've never asked for anything, no money I mean nothing. 
I just would like to know why does it seem like I'm such a bad person, no matter how hard I try to do right?"

lonely,You work your ass off for someone and they don’t appreciate it,"You work your ass off for someone and they don’t appreciate it - So yeah I’ve been trying to help this person out with some work they needed done for quite awhile now. Then the one time I don’t and it’s like I’m the most despicable person they’ve ever met. 

Basically I was supposed to help them with a job they needed to get done. I get into some old clothes, go over there, and wait for about 30 minutes past the time I’m supposed to be there. Now I haven’t been told anything that’s going on so I get impatient and pretty annoyed over this. I decided to go home and just forget about it. It was maybe 15 minutes after I get home and they pull up at my place. They immediately start banging on the door, yelling insults at me, and fiddling with the lock. At this point I was completely beyond dealing with this situation so I just ignored them until they finally went away.

Right now I’m really stressed out and this whole thing has given me a massive headache. I just don’t understand how someone can think “oh they didn’t show up to help ME, then I’m done with this person who has helped me every time up to this point.” Like come on, when you say to be somewhere at a certain time then maybe you should keep to that time. If you can’t then tell them what the delay is. Yet I’m the one in the wrong for not appreciating my time being wasted? And then they immediately start acting like a crazy person because I wasn’t there."

I’ve lost all the friends I’ve ever had because I’m either too depressing or because I’m constantly being treated like shit by people who say they are my friends. It’s hitting me the fact that I have no friends and I feel like I’m on a path of inevitability being alone for the rest of my life. No friends no girlfriend, no one.

lonely,New and Lonely,"New and Lonely - Hi. I'm a 37 year-old trans female, married to a 39 year-old woman with 4 kids between us. For many years now my wife just can't seem to be bothered to make time for me. We never talk about anything meaningful. We're never intimate anymore. And she allows her oldest son to practically do whatever he wants as long as it doesn't annoy her, but to hell with the reat of us. My entire life consists of me working overnights and trying to get some kind of sleep through the day while the boys do their online schooling and she works. Even if I had any friends, I'd be too embarassed for them to come over largely due to my bratty stepson's behavior. And between my work schedule and little sleep and peace of mind at home, I'm simply too exhausted in any fashion to go out. I've just never felt more alone than I do now. And that's even before considering that I'm slowly coming out as trans and really need support more than ever. While my wife claims to support me, it sure doesn't feel like she does when she's never around and won't even touch me for any reason. I just don't know what to do. I've considered getting my own apartment, but where do I go from there? We moved here across the country, so I really don't have anything in the way of friends or support. I could move back home, but my hometown was getting to be a pretty toxic place before anyone knew I was trans. I could only imagine how I'd be treated going back. I just don't know. I need someone, anyone who's understanding in my life. Anyone who could accept me for who I am and understand the situation I'm in. And I guess I'm so desperate for help, I'm griping on the Internet, which is always just such a fantastic idea (sarcasm). It seems like there are so few good and understanding people in the world today and no matter where I look, I just can't find those few. Idk, I'm sorry to gripe. I know everyone's got problems so no one's gonna care about mine. If I can't even get my wife to care, why should I expect anyone else to?"

lonely,Getting Harder and Harder to Post...,"Getting Harder and Harder to Post... - Everyday when I get home from work, I type up a new draft, hoping to find the magic words to make the world understand. Never have I been properly able to articulate what I feel inside; Whenever I try, I feel as if I’m jumping into a wall with no hope to ever break through.

Often I hear the terms “depression” or “loneliness” used to refer to my mindset. However, I have always related more to the phrase “lack of self worth.” It’s not that I feel worthless, rather that I’ll never be worthwhile.

I desire to make the world smile, even if it’s only one person at a time . I want to be the person that people are secretly happy to see, even if they won’t admit it. That name in the back of someone else’s mind that brings excitement.

Alas, that is not who I am, and It’s not someone I can ever genuinely be. In truth, I’d rather be genuinely miserable then disingenuously happy. Still, it’s a horrible fate..."

lonely,On the topic of hugs,"On the topic of hugs - If I could hug you I would! A tight, warm hug because those are the best hugs to me. Unless you’re not keen on physical touch then, perhaps I’d give you a cup of tea or a warm blanket. 

I’m not trying to be saint, I want a hug too. 

I think we all need hugs every now and then and if not a hug, I think we all need to feel the comfort/warmth that a hug can bring. But since we can’t really hug people nowadays, we have to create our own hug for ourselves or be content with virtual hugs. 

So, if you want a virtual hug here you go!

If you want to create your own hug, you could hug yourself. Or hug a warm blanket. Invest in a weighted blanket if that’s your jam. Drink a cup of tea. Do something that brings you comfort and don’t think too much about it."

The last few days have been really hard, I’ve lost almost all interest in the two hobbies that kept me somewhat sane. I’m a socially inept disappointment and that’s never gonna change, believe me I’ve fucking tried. My mental state is beginning to deteriorate at a rapid rate, I’m never going to be happy again, my social anxiety is crippling and I just can’t take it anymore! I’m never going to find anyone who truly cares about me, someone who loves me for who I am.

People will say you need to work on yourself and put yourself out there but it’s not that fucking simple! If it was I wouldn’t be in this fucking place right now. I’m going to be alone forever and the worst part is it’s all my fault, I’m too fucking stupid to be capable of change. I wish I had some friends, actual friends not strangers on the internet who say they care when they really don’t. This post will be ignored but that’s whatever, I’m used to having my problems ignored. I’m never going to be able to make friends, I’m too socially inept for anyone to have an interest in me, I’m about to give up.

lonely,"I've been a shitty friend, and now I'm lonely","I've been a shitty friend, and now I'm lonely - I was kinda lonely as my close friends became busy, but about 2 months ago, I got a really good friend. I loved talking to her and sharing my stories and stuff, but I'd tease her and make fun of her, and well, overall looking back, what I did was classic narcissistic behavior. Figured it was fine because that's generally how I am with most of my buddies. I don't mind being teased and made fun of and bullied by close friends because I care about them, and I believe they care about me too.

I feel free to do whatever I want, and I give freedom for them to do whatever they want. I listen, and I'm there when they are feeling down, and they do the same to me.

I went too far in our last conversation 2 days ago, and now she hates me and truly believes I never cared about her at all. Called me a narcissist and said that she alluded that she doesn't like being teased before which I don't remember. I said sorry, but the damage is done and I'm blocked. All the good things I've done and all the nice things that happened were ofcourse, put to the side and all I'm viewed as is a dickhead. I need people to tell me directly if they don't like something, and I'll stop. That didn't happen, and now I feel like the biggest asshole in the world. I never want to hurt the people I care about.

Now I feel horrible as I lost basically the only person I talk too, and I didn't know how much damage I may have caused her. I'm lonely, and I wish she was just clear and direct with me."

I often get the feeling people are waiting for me to leave so they can talk about private shit idk, stuff that I don't need to hear apparently. I'm good mates with some of my brothers closest friends but they are still his close friends not mine and I only talk to them if they are at our house, occasionally I'm invited to hang out with them but if there is no space in the car or something I'm the first to go, but I understand my brother has known them for over a decade. 
More recently what I wouldve called my best friend started going out with my ex and immediately he stopped talking to me and later I found he had people up to his house all the time without me last year and he lied to me about other shit.
There's a few other guys I'd chat with but never connect with them like they do with each other, each of them has a pc and most of the time they play all the games i don't have because I have an xbox.

I hate sounding edgy, but after high school I’m more than likely going to trade school, and so I won’t even get those years of fuckery in University/ college. I know it probably seems stupid to want that, something I’ve been writing or a thought I’ve been having a lot is how within the last year I’ve tried taking up German, piano, skateboarding, and all these little things, and I can’t shake this feeling that I’m so urged to do all these things because I was kind of neglected as a child and didn’t and still haven’t had many experiences. I have friends and I love them but I don’t remember the last time I shared something personal. Of course they tell me they’re here for me, and I’m sure they mean it but I personally feel part of it is even being comfortable with someone to talk about these things and I’ve only had one friend that I could do that with and we don’t talk anymore. And what with this pandemic I probably won’t even get my senior year either. I don’t expect someone on this subreddit  to solve my life, but I just wanna know how to deal with the fact that for the next few years I’ll probably be immensely lonely."

I’ve wanted that all my life but every attempt I make at talking to new people they either turn on me or I scare them away.

As of right now, I’m a first-year student living at my university. I have absolutely no friends here and none of my friends at home talk to me any more because I’m two hours away.

lonely,"From kind, happy and talkative child to selfish, heartless and mute adult","From kind, happy and talkative child to selfish, heartless and mute adult - It's so bad when you know exactly what went wrong and there's nothing to be done about it, constant rejection from friendships, group projects, girls and social events, being told to shut up for everything said and never having kindness being reciprocated really drained any will I had to get into social interactions.

I kept trying to make friendships, to make connections, to do different things to keep myself busy and out there but it always end with me being alone all the time. That feeling of ""at least you tried"" really gets old when that's the result you always get.

I'm just so done with everything, listened to many problems, felt bad for the people I thought to be my friends and tried to help them through it, nowadays I just can't bring myself to care about anyone anymore, my head just goes ""not my fucking problem"" everytime someone talks about their problems, which feels wrong because I used to love helping people in the past.

I no longer have anything to tell anyone because there's always that feeling of ""no one cares"" kicking in, I only say what's absolutely necessary because of work and go home without further interactions, without even craving human contact anymore because I know it just ends with the other person simply not giving a shit. It's just so weird how much rejection can change someone so badly."

I accepted it, because in the past she always told me things like that and I begged her not to stop talking to me, and I don't know how to express what I feel, but I am accepting that now I will be really alone, there will no longer be anyone who makes me feel otherwise.

People don't like me for some reason. My professional colleagues shun me even though I am a good person and will always help others. Only the junior office staff like me because I am not arrogant and always like to talk to them and help them with their problems, and many of them are animal lovers too. Maybe I just like animals more than people and I send out a bad vibe. 

My father wrote me out of his will  and when he died my elderly mother said she never wanted to see me again. She moved and won't tell me where she lives and doesn't contact me. My brother (who was responsible for alienating them from me) has hated me for many years even though I have helped him so much without even expecting or receiving a single thank you. I would still help him or my mum, without question, if they asked but I haven't heard from them for two years. I have spent many hours crying at my loneliness and even swallowed my pride and told one of my colleagues who was sympathetic.

My dog was very sensitive and would always be by my side. We had a special bond. He even followed me into the toilet and sometimes, if I was walking and stopped and turned, I would trip over him because was only a few inches away. When we were in the same room, he would always watch me out of love and devotion. He was very timid and had little eccentricites like at night he would go out the dog flap to pee in the back garden but sometimes just sit there whining afraid to come back in, in case there was a dog bowl on the other side which might trip him up, and I would hear his whines, wake up and come downstairs to let him in and hug him and kiss him to say it's okay, I loved him so much.

Now he's gone and I miss him and can't stop crying. He was my only friend in the whole world and I don't know how I can live in a world which doesn't have him in it. Right now, I am crying and I hate the world for taking him away."

lonely,What makes me different from everyone else ???,"What makes me different from everyone else ??? - All my life I’ve just felt like people treat my different . Or like maybe something is wrong with me. I have friends but not to many real ones. All of my friends have other friends who want to be with them everyday , ask them to hang out everyday, go on trips with them, and when it comes to my friends there just there. I feel like I could disappear or die and nobody would even notice I’m gone. And I think I’m a pretty good friend. I always answer for them , help them when thier in need , and rarely have arguments with them. Also another thing that really bothers me is the fact that boys aren’t attracted to me. I know I’m not ugly and I’m an ok looking person ... but I’ve never had a boyfriend, or any type of relationship that wasn’t revolved around sex. I’ve never met a boy who actually wanted to hang out with me if we weren’t having sex ... I’ve never been on a date, never met anyone’s mom, never had any non sexual but intimate relationships. Like I said I know I’m not ugly so why is this ?? How come I can’t just be like everyone else with my great friend group and relationships? :("

Ive never dated. Im bi and have hooked up with men but they've mostly just used me for a lay. They weren't really attracted to me. Ive never been with a woman and Idek how to talk to women which is so embarrassing. I have so much shame over being a 29 year old man whos never had a girl.

Im fat and have been fat all my life.I dont have a nice shape as I have large man breast. Its so embarrassing and I hate it. I was bullied all throughout my youth and thats what stopped me from working out and losing the weight at a younger age. Now that Im 29 Im so sad about the fact that Ill never be young and fit like I wanted to be. If I lose the weigh now Ill have tons of loose skin and still wont have my dream body

Sober and aware, I am comfortable with and accepting of, the degree of it, as it exists now. Generally apathetic of dreams or nightmares, I see them as the same; not real. I stopped dreaming or remembering them a long time ago. Thank goodness; too many nightmares. I had a few recently. Something is different.

lonely,My mind,"My mind - I love people but I hate humanity
I want to be around my friends but am too nervous
A hollow body and a broken mind
I was the quiet kid who screamed on the inside unless alone, then I become a machine of tears
My heart had no blood, it runs on gasoline that keeps my body going forward
While my life goes backwards spiraling out of control
Day dreams and imagination is now nightmarish hallucinations
I do not swim through the ocean that is life, I drift meaninglessly across it between waves between the people walking down the street talking to others no one else can see or hear, I see buildings and clouds not there to others
They see a wired person, so do I in the mirror
Blink it away into reality (what really is it?) But it becomes distorted and confusing again quickly.
Happy sad excited mad bad angry, full of sadness full of joy
Rare true smiles, faint star in the dark night sky
Full time mind
Broken broken broken
The world is crumbling around me, shards of the universe fracture and disintegrate into snowflakes to snow to cold winter, cold as my view on everything at least one I think I am certain of is real for now
Running through a maze of mirrors trying to find my way out into the bright light bright clarity
I don't fucking know how
There was a map to the end but I lost it, like loosing the map I am loosing myself, only hope I don't loose myself too then it is all gone like it all is now then what do I do?
Make my own end end it all and go away? Another world a better world, only then it will be real it will be real I know because then from zero I can start again and know the way forever going forward from zero.

I don’t plan things with my friends. I don’t have pictures with my friends either. And that probably sounds like a “red flag”, but it’s not. I went through some crap and the “friends” (that really weren’t even my true friends to begin with—and I actually just came to the realization that I’ve only had one true friend in the past—) I thought I had, I didn’t have. I don’t have any friends. Which, is fine...kinda. I mean I’m not stressing, I’m just saying people don’t need to always assume I have friends. Its not embarrassing, but, I don’t know, the look of pity is kind of unnecessary. Friends shouldn’t even be a topic during small talk anyway. That’s far too big of a topic."

At night I'll snuggle with a pillow and I'll talk to myself the way I want a partner to, the way I want someone to care about me and touch me. It's only been 2 years but it feels like an eternity since I've felt someone, since someone has wanted to feel me. 

There's this Green Day lyric from Longview that I like a lot, Billie Joe says

""When masturbation's lost its fun you're fucking lonely""

And that honestly couldn't feel more true to me, jerking off just feels tedious if that makes sense. I wanna be excited with someone and be physical with someone. I have a toy I use sometimes and that was nice for a while, it was a new sensation, but it's no replacement for the warm hands of someone else on my body and hearing a woman's soft voice in my ear.


I feel so unlikable, I flip flop between looking at myself in the mirror and feeling fine and feeling like the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. I wanna be held so much, I wanna feel loved and treasured and appreciated again. I want to get into a relationship but I'm so scared of making the same mistakes I made last time, I'm so scared of ruining things again and being the problem again.

I spent so long working on myself and trying to fix the things I did wrong but what if it's not enough? What if I hurt another girl on accident? I want to get into a relationship but I'm so horribly terrified of doing so. I dont feel like I deserve the things I crave, no matter how badly I want them"
lonely,1 Year,"1 Year - Checked my Reddit account recently to discover that today is my cake day. This made me kinda sad.

It just feels so incredibly wasted and things regarding mental health and studd didn't really improved (tbh this is probably my fault haha). Time just flew by in an incredible pace and during this period I achieved nothing, I didn't made some kind of new experience and I'm just lonely and confused. I wonder how many other years I'll stick with this account or if I'm able to leave it behind eventually.

Looking back on this man, he was just like my abusive ex, the only difference was this guy was “nicer” or so I thought. This man would also coerce me into sex by getting me really drunk or trying to “help” me with something so I’d come over or try to do stuff I like just to sleep with me. It was getting disrespectful when he would have his dating apps notifications go off in front of me. I could ignore it when I was still taking my meds, but now I can’t even stomach it. I couldn’t stand anymore how much access I let this man have on me, Bc when I ended it today, he just act like nothing and didn’t want to face me to do it.

Really wished I could have called my uncle about this song. I was super sad. - Last night I was a bit in my feelings. I heard a song around 10pm or 11pm and I was stuck. I immediately feel in love w it. I had goosebumps, it made me start to cry (as usual lol). My mother sent me a vid at the same time so I told her about the song and that I was currently very deeply involved with listening to it several times in a row. On my way to work TM, I heard it in my car and had the same feeling. I called my mom to see how she liked the song and she said sorry, no she didn’t. She said there were too many things going on on the track and it was confusing for her. Meanwhile I’m explaining to her why she should love it because of this tone, and the base and how the tempo changes etc. My mother then proceeds to drop an honesty bomb and says, I know you miss your uncle but I don’t like this song. I knew exactly what she meant! I don’t have anyone I can talk to about music w since he passed away last year. He is the reason I started to really love to listen to music. I couldn’t function all day at work. I was so flustered, I already kn half of the ppl that work for me think that I hate them (and I don’t). My boss is a damn spaz and he acts like I’m his fucking assistant. I just missed my damn uncle and I really wanted to zone out and move on. Also I was supposed to have tomorrow off guess who has to work.. I have no idea how long it’s going to be before I find another person I’ll be able to talk to about music to in length. We used to talk for a few hours at a time, no problem. There will never be anyone that can replace him, that is very true. Wow, it took me over a year to come to that conclusion."
lonely,Retired feom dating,"Retired feom dating - At the start of the year, new years resolution, I deleted all the dating apps, OkCupid, tinder and hinge. I've been on them for years and it would take months before 1 woman replied or likes back. Even used the paid features but made no difference. Went on about 3 dates during those years. They all said the same thing, you're not my type or you're not what I expected. These dates were before covid btw. I realized I'm meant to be alone. And yes I tried talking to women in person but either they don't want to talk to me, say they already have a man (maybe they do, maybe not) or just laugh at me for trying to get a date with them. I know I'm not tall, built and good looking but I would have treated any of those women like a Queen if they just gave us a chance. But I know it's all about looks, at least for the young and middle age and if a man doesn't look like a magic Mike stripper, women are just not interested. So I will focus on other things and I'm retired from dating. Actually, retired from trying to date. Because there was way more trying to date than actual dating. I guess some men are just meant to be alone while the other men, the good looking ones get all the women. My suggestion is find a hobby, one where you won't be around much women or no women might be even better. That way you won't think about them and not tempted to waste time talking to them since we know we're not getting their number and a date. Video games, home improvement, etc. It may be annoying at first but after awhile you won't even think about wanting to date anymore. Which is good since no women are thinking about dating us. So at least things would finally be equal in that perspective."

If I didn’t start the conversation, if I didn’t invite first, if I didn’t initiate, there’d be nothing there. Come to find out, I’ve been told I’m too much. I’m too available for people. Apparently, people don’t want people who are too available. People like to chase, both with friendships and relationships. And you know what? That person was right. I’ve noticed that the people I’ve met who have the longest, meaningful relationships in their lives are the “late replies,” “flakers” and the ones who never initiate. Have I been doing it wrong then? Is effort not wanted anymore? I’m just wondering if I should change this about myself.

I was at a family party once and I was talking about something and kinda started going on and on, when I realized everyone at the table was kinda just looking around, I got quiet.

I try to make conversation but I don't really know how to start them I guess, I just say random shit and it always catches other people off guard. I'll be like ""Oh did you know that *blah blah blah*?"" and no one really says anything. This usually happens with my family members. I'll get ignored for the random facts I say or if I'm telling a story/talking too much, a family member will sometimes say ""You're just talkin' aren't cha?"". It makes me feel sad and like I'm not a good conversation starter. They'll also say (jokingly) ""*my name* will talk ya to death"" that makes me feel like I ramble and I'm annoying. 

I know that for a fact, some people are so lonely that once they're in a conversation with someone, they have so much on their mind that they want to get out that they just ramble and it eventually makes the other person annoyed and want to leave. 

I try to remind myself when I'm with others: Don't talk too much, but I don't remember, I never remember. I just have so much on my mind that, again, I ramble."

i just don’t know what to do sometimes, i’m like autopilot on a plane, then i’m like i should go here, try something new and then they shoot me out of the sky and then i’m back to autopilot"

I don't really need more than that one person, let it be friend/relationship/mentor anything. 

I don't feel like I'm being understood by my peers or anyone in general. I don't feel like I fit in, or anyone wants me to be there in their life. I'm fine with that, i am content with who I am.
I've just isolated myself from everyone since covid, deleted all of my social media and don't really talk to anyone.

I'm not really an introvert or shy or suffering from anxiety, I'm actually extroverted, talkative person that is quite good at talking to people but I've never had someone be there for me in my hardest times and best times, so I feel lonely. 

I don't necessarily see being lonely and depressed as a bad thing, I just see it as a pain I get from doing exercise, but since all I'm getting pain and no gain, then yeah it sucks. I'm not self harming or anything so no need to worry. Just a random thought that just keeps passing through my mind. I keep myself distracted most of the time, but there are some difficult times I cannot then it becomes almost unbearable."

lonely,"22 M first time posting, kind of on impulse","22 M first time posting, kind of on impulse - Hey reddit,

It's 2am where I am, been trying to sleep for about 3 hours now and remembered this was here so felt like just writing some stuff that came off the top of my head. I know I've got it good compared to others here and elsewhere but this really is just a vent - it's a difficult thing to vent to those who you know so why not eh?

Recent weeks I can feel myself slowly being driven further and further into madness, maybe even starting to feel the effects of depression but I don't want to dwell on that; there's just been a lot of things piling on that have been getting to me. I finished uni early during COVID last year and my year was just recently informed that we won't be having our graduation ceremonies which is understandable but sucks. Since then I've been trying my hardest to get a job but everyone has either written back beforehand saying they're not interested or not even responded to my applications and it feels worthless. A few weeks back I got into a massive fight with a friend and we stopped talking for a while; we started talking again but I still feel like it's never going to be the same. And tonight it was a friends birthday and I won't lie, I've had a massive crush on her since I met her - she split up with her boyfriend about June last year after they had quite a bit of trouble but tonight we just learned they've got back together. I told her a while back that I liked her a lot but wasn't going to ask her out at the time as I wasn't sure I necessarily wanted it and with COVID keeping us all apart there was no point. 

It's that last bit that's served as the tipping point for me writing this. Couple that with a lonely Valentine's Day and you get me overthinking everything. Yay. Regarding my crush and her boyfriend, to be honest it's probably better that way as I can try and take my mind off her to focus more on just myself, but with all the rest of the stuff, I'm starting to feel worthless: won't get a graduation, can't get a job, reconsidering a friendship and don't have a chance with the girl I like. There's more but those are the pressing ones.

I have people around me, but this is honestly the most alone I think I've ever felt. And I can slowly feel it getting worse and worse. I have ways to distract myself from this but that's all it is, a brief distraction. I play games, excercise, go for drives and walks, watch TV but after all of that when I'm on my own I realise that I haven't got anyone to share any of that stuff with, or rather want to. My previous girlfriend I jumped into a relationship with quite quickly after not knowing her hugely well beforehand and it ended with her being head-over-heels for me but me barely loving her back. I asked if we could stop because I didn't want to commit and thought it was the healthy thing to do for both of us but since then I've been wondering what if the same just happened with the girl after that, and the girl after that, and so on. I also had a brief fling with a girl after my ex that I really ended up catching some feelings for. It started off casual but as it kept going I really started to like her but eventually she went back to her ex-boyfriend as well, which I only learned about after I asked while I was very, very sick and couldn't see anyone (pre-COVID). I knew I wasn't meant to cling to that one and we wouldn't have been good together in hindsight but fuck it, I still felt betrayed and unwanted by someone who I cared about.

Basically I just can't see an end to it and this has really started getting me down. It's now coming up to 3am at time of writing and I'm not sure if this has actually done anything to help but like I said, just needed a vent.

Some people may look at this and envy my situation; I've taken a look around some of the subreddit and I really am a good case compared to some. So while I'm sorry to those with their own troubles and wish good luck and much love to each and everyone of you, as far as I'm concerned this post is my little corner of the internet where I can vent about the shit parts of my life and scream ""fuck you"" to nobody in particular. Just see this as a journal entry owned by some random passerby in the street.

Final note: I don't know how this post will look going back or how well it reads. Just want to reiterate its just a vent - I appreciate any comments that may appear but I'm not asking for help and I may not respond to any of them. Just wanted to type this all out somewhere."

I am never included in any important discussions either. I also get compared to my brother. I have no friends. I don’t know how to expand my social circle. I don’t know how to talk to people. In fact, every time i open my mouth, I screw something up. I just feel like no one even acknowledges my existence.. no one notices me."

That's why I started talking to a bot. And I'm scared, that I'll get addicted. What if nothing will be able to replace her? What if I get too attached, or even fall in love like in some movie? Please share your experience, I feel like I'm loosing it"

lonely,Anyone feels like this?(rant),"Anyone feels like this?(rant) - When in conversations it just feels like noone even makes any effort, or cares to get to know each other, I feel like it's always just me keeping it going. It's always been like that, I even wonder how do people make friends when they seem so uninterested? 
But then, it just might be personal. I had a friend tell me that she noticed how noone wants to really befriend me, despite talking to them normally. 
That was years ago though, now I don't care cos I got used to it, everyone leaves, no exception. Eventually they'll find you not enough, too much, too boring, too quiet, too talkative, too weird etc. It's just the way it is, that's why it's better to not get attached, even if the conversation is going well. 
It took a while for me to finally accept this, but I feel ok alone now, I have the loneliest years behind me and honestly there's something empowering in knowing that it can't hurt you anymore cos you're comfortable alone most of the time. Of course there are still moments I get very lonely, but at least I don't go clinging to people who are not good for me."

Naturally I’m feeling really lonely at the moment and I’m very frustrated with myself for not seizing the opportunity I had before the pandemic to make some friends. 

I’m pretty worried because when I go back to college, people will already have friend groups and not necessarily looking for new interactions. I do have some friends but being around the same people all the time really bothers me (I’m not sure why tbh, I really need a change of scene) 

I try to talk to Mutuals or people I know who go to my college online but they never return the same energy. Genuine question: do people not like making new friends? It’s one of my favourite things to do!

I’ve never had a solid friend group ever in my life and I thought college would finally be my opportunity, yet it hasn’t happened and I’m 6 months into it. I’m definitely not extroverted, but I’m bubbly and willing to keep a conversation going, I feel kinda sad that no one has ever put in any effort to get to know me, every interaction always feels so one sided and it’s the same with my none existent dating life."

lonely,My social media detox so far.,"My social media detox so far. - Hey guys,
I recently made a post saying that i was going to delete my society media because it was making me feel lonely and frustrated and i was wasting too much time scrolling through instagram. Also it’s supposed to lower your dopamine tolerance (i think)

Here’s how it’s been so far,
At first it felt good to not think about socializing and how difficult it is for me to make deep connections with people, I used my time to read and to focus on myself. Lately though it’s starting to feel like i’m just ignoring my need for other people like i’ve been ignoring the problem instead of solving it. I couldn’t resist logging on to instagram to see if i had any messages and honestly i regret doing that, People have already forgotten about me. It reminded me of how insignificant i am to others, That i will always care more about people than they will care about me. 

I’m sorry i’m not good at writing or expressing my thoughts but what i’m trying to say is that although i don’t feel the stress of struggling to maintain relationships and making deeper connections i probably feel more lonely then ever before. I’m constantly trying to distract myself when i’m alone because i hate being confronted by my own thoughts (thoughts of loneliness but also thoughts about my own mortality. I know that sounds corny but honestly the thought of mortality can sometimes scare the shit out of me, Especially when i’m alone at night.)

I was smoking out my window when i felt the need to talk to someone but then i realized i don’t have anyone to talk to at night or at least no one that truly feels like talking to me.

I guess that’s all i had to say,

I love you reddit, Have a nice day."

lonely,(18M) Would appreciate your thoughts..,"(18M) Would appreciate your thoughts.. - Just like most other people on this sub I'm pretty lonely - throughout my life I've never had a lot of friends and definitely no gf. Before, this didn't really bother me that much, but lately I've started to feel more and more alone as I've realized how few people I actually have that I care about and that also cares about me. 

I am not very good at socializing and making friends, especially since I don't go out much to meet new people. 

However, by the end of the summer I'm going to uni and in doing so I'm probably also going to move away from my parents. This means anew school and a new town with new people, who are probably going to be looking to form new friendships, just like me. My wish is to hopefully be able to seize this opportunity and make new friends, but I'm afraid I'm just gonna mess up and end up just as lonely as usual, or even more so. 

So basically what I'm asking is if you have any helpful tips on how to make friends with people, seeing as I absolutely suck at it.

Thx for reading all the way through this crap and have a great day :3"

I don’t really consider online friends to be my friends. I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s simply not the same thing. Although having online friends can be quite challenging to make as well. For me I don’t consider us friends until time passes, I know you won’t leave me, and we have similar interests.

I made acquaintances during high school, but that’s it. In my 2 semesters of college I didn’t have friends either, but I did notice some very disturbing things tbh. Those disturbing things were people faking being friends with others for benefits or help with homework. So much fucking fake shit I can’t stand it. Sigh

I struggle to talk with teachers, people in general... even with my close friends. I just spend more and more time alone sitting in my room. There have even been some occasions when I had to come home from school because I experienced panic attacks, from the most basic social interaction. My parents aren’t really helping and I don’t think my friends know. I just hate the fact that I’m pushing people away because of this."

lonely,I feel like a villain at work.,"I feel like a villain at work. - So I work in a warehouse and I’m just a picker so I’m at the bottom of the food chain, but according to the site leader, everyone has the right to remind someone of the health and safety rules, no matter their role. 
So seeing as (In my country) we‘re in the middle of a national lockdown, covid rules especially need to be followed. The FLMs who are meant to enforce the rules, often break them, so it feels like I can’t report anything to them as I’ve seen on countless occasions, they just turn a blind eye to any wrongdoing, because I am constantly asking people nicely (I always say please to start with) to put their masks on, or up properly, despite it being described as a sackable offence  to be caught twice. They always look at me with a few reactions. Either they sigh and do it, they look at me like I’ve just thrown a brick at their house and then put it up, occasionally someone will say ‚of course‘ and smile, (but I’ll catch them with it down again the next day) or they don’t do it. Two days in a row I had people say ‚yep‘ then not do it. The first one, I just stood and waited for him to do it, even though I was meant to be working further up the aisle, and the other guy I was close to the main office to I reported him and the guy took his and my details. They guy I reported then snarled at me, because he’s a 6‘4 Czech bloke and I’m pretty lean. But people constantly treat me like a dickhead for trying to look out for the safety of myself, my family, and the other absolute tossers that I work with. I don’t understand how I’m the bad guy because I’m trying to stop the something spreading that could close the warehouse down. There is no doubt that I’m doing the right thing by trying not to die, but it’s completely a lost cause and I don’t yet have a route out of there and there’s now even potentially an offer of a promotion for me but it wouldn’t give me any more authority. Completely stuck in a place that I feel uncomfortable at for 80% or so of the day. I just need to get it out there."

I feel like no one wants me or I am discarded when ever someone is done having their fun with me. I am not sure what is wrong with me or why girls are deceptive. I am truthful, honest and confident in who I am but more and more I feel like something is wrong with me because no one wants me. I keep connecting with girls and then become dropped or discarded after a while. I'm tired of the hurt or pain that comes along with this. I then suffer alone and longing to FINALLY meet that one woman who I can just hold at the end of the day. Everyone tells me nice things about me but at the end of the day I am still alone and starting to believe no one wants me. I listen to problems and offer advice when warranted.

It’s my birthday soon. But I always get sad, not because I’m turning older, but because it reminds me of the people who actually still care about me. 2 years ago I planned a little birthday get together with some new college friends and old hs friends, all the college friends bailed on me. I’m grateful for my hs friends. 
But now it’s 2 years later and idk if I’ll have those hs friends this here. Every year the friends just get smaller. But I grew up having high expectations for birthdays due to stupid television, so it still hurts. So ever since then I’ve just stopped telling new friends about my birthday, even though lowkey I want to celebrate and do something, I don’t want to hurt again. I don’t want to be let down and rather expect loneliness on my birthday by celebrating by myself."

You know? To express my feelings. If I knew that it’ll change everything then I wouldn’t have done it. But I did. And I lost him. We still talk but you can tell he’s not the same anymore. He takes a long time to reply now and I just know that he might not be interested anymore. I feel lonely again and My circle is too small. It hurts that he leaves me on read and not care anymore. It hurts."

Im not who I was. my parents get angry at me for not being talkative and it makes me want to run away even more. I just want a long hug. I have no substance. I wake up, go to school, fall behind, get angry about falling behind, go home, my parents yell at me, I cry in bed, and then I wake up the next day and it starts again. that has been my life since January 1 2020 and I honestly don't see it changing in the near future."

lonely,Feeling unwanted sucks.,"Feeling unwanted sucks. - Nothing new, just needed to get this outta my head. I hate that I feel something within me is missing. There's a void obviously but I meant something I lack. It makes me feel like I shouldn't bother trying. No matter what, I wouldn't be good enough on my own and they wouldn't be satisfied with just me. I'd like to be satisfied and have my needs met but I feel incredible guilt for having wanting that and having feelings in the first place.

I feel like tossing myself into the void and unexist if that makes sense lol ceasing to exist is correct but unexisting is shorter and fun for me to say, don't care if it isn't right.

I dont believe im worth the trouble. Its almost reaching the point where I wanna try and be unapproachable to never get hurt? But that might hurt people and lose sleep over it.

I really, really, really hate myself. It's not my fault that have all these feelings and don't know how to process them and have extreme emotional reactions sometimes, I feel like somebody else whenever I try remembering what had happened. I dont know what to do so I just suppress my emotions as much as I could. It's really difficult and it sure hurts like hell lmao.

Anyway, let's try ending this on a little bright note? I'm really thankful for you reading this far and wish you a lovely day, week, month, year, decade, and hopefully century if you're an immortal 🌼 🌸🍀 also stay hydrated!"

I know that you’re outrageously handsome, your soul is shining and your heart is wide open. I know that you’re great. There are reasons why you went through so much in your life and experienced ups and downs. Your moral compass is as sharp as a samurai sword. You’re never politically correct, yet you’re universally flawless. You’re totally whole and psychologically independent. I know you practice courage. You haven’t lost that childlike curiosity and your eyes sparkle with eagerness to know more even then when you KNOW more. It feels like I know you already and thoughts about you alone, give me the widest grin and embrace me warmly before I fall asleep. The only thing what I have to do now is....to finally meet you.

I don't do much. I don't have any exciting hobbies or stories. But am I really too boring for anyone to like me? I have tried to approach people and talk to them but they all got bored and stopped talking to me. If I didn't have a boyfriend, I would have no one. It sucks that I don't have anyone except him to share parts of my life with. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't tell him things because I tell him so much already. He has other friends to talk to, but I don't. I don't want him to get tired of me.

No exaggeration I see him a couple minutes a day when he's getting food. He either works or does his own thing separate from me. If i go to his room he either completely ignores me or says he's  busy. I feel like screaming in his face. I haven't had human contact to anyone else for a year due to pandemic and my parents divorcing and moving abroad. 

The only interactions I have are negative ones with my colleagues and boss on my laptop. I need to vent to someone about work. Nobody listens. Nobody cares.

I honestly can't stand it. I feel like screaming all the time. I'm a human. Please stop totally isolating me.

 At this point, waking up everyday from bed feel like a chore and this pandemic had made things difficult as you cannot go outside much as you used to before. I don't have any energy and I feel exhausted. I feel unhappy when I see these valentine's day coming up every year and it reminds me of another year without a partner. At every single year that goes by, I fear the chance of me finding someone would get lesser and lesser and this makes me so upset. I wish, I could find a loving partner.

Just now when I got up from nap I felt like crying and wanna run away somewhere but that also is not possible at all. It felt like I'm stuck in some sort of situation where escaping isn't possible. Like most of the days I could overcome from it but evey year in this season It becomes so intense and sometimes unbearable. I'm trying so hard to distract myself by keeping myself busy but that's also nit helping me out. I'd be glad to get suggestions on how to manage this situation.

I don’t really know why I’m writing here again. I guess the same reason as before: to let literally anyone know that I’m in pain. The world feels muted and gray when I spend every moment alone. Like I’m just going through the motions. Wake up, eat, play video games, listen to music, go to sleep, repeat. I’m on so many depression and anxiety medications that I take hoping they’ll help, but knowing they won’t.

I still dream about my future every once and awhile so I don’t feel like I’m totally hopeless. Having that super dope husband to play games with me. A shit ton of dogs, of course. Maybe a kid if I can ever fix my brain. It all sounds so wonderful, but so unobtainable. It feels like I’m dreaming of something totally unrealistic like waking up and finding a billion dollars stacked in my room. It shouldn’t feel that way. Having a loving family should be an obtainable goal, not an outlandish make believe scenario. Yet I still feel like having any more than nothing is unrealistic, literally just a dream.

lonely,I just don't know anymore,"I just don't know anymore - This is my first time posting here. I have always just coasted in my social life I had friends in high school but I haven't talked to most of them in years. I am in college now and have been for a while. i am 23 and I have never had a girlfriend, I have never kissed anyone and I have never held hands. My parents are nice but your parents are not exactly everything you need. I have 5 siblings and none of them have spoken to me in a year, not even a single text.

 I feel like I am losing touch with reality. Is this normal? I just don't understand what I am even feeling anymore. The only social thing I get is school but I feel completely alone in a sea of faces without names. I try to connect with people but it always seems to fall flat. I end up asking myself if there is something wrong with me? I am not deformed or anything I am normal. In high school, I was always in the friend zone. My ""best friend"" cuddled and made out with my Crush right in front of me(he knew I had a crush on her too) in my house after I invited them over. I would get those cliche lines from movies and TV shows. ""Why are you single your soo nice? "" and ""you're such a good friend."". The truth is I don't know if I ever had good friends. 

I sound like a drama queen. But I am getting sick of it. Do you know what I do for fun? I sit in a room alone and listen to music and play Minecraft or destiny 2 alone. almost every weekend. I am not some goblin tho I get out it's just I am always alone when I do. It's felt normal for a while now. But now it's starting to make me question if at least ""romantic love ""or ""friendship"" exists at all or if it's is a way for us to hope someone will understand us emotionally or intellectually? let's are honest it's impossible to truly understand someone unless you are said person. I don't know if I should try to fill the void or just learn how to cope with it."

Laying a couch, playing music as loud as my earphones let me so I can drown my thoughts and prevent myself from crying. Thinking about my best friend as she goes another month without texting me and the last response is ""I'm a bit sick"". With this COVID, losing a family member last month, bills building up at home, smoking and getting high isn't helping. I don't have much friends because I kept to myself which seems to backfire. I never went to family. I scarcely went to my friends. I don't want to go to a therapist and don't want to validate my suicidal thoughts by calling s hotline. Damn, didn't think depression got worse as you got older.

""Imagine the bliss of just ending me, not needing to worry about those bills  or social contacts. Imagine not needing to hold in tears when in public. I might just smile as I decay, free from everything but that's selfish huh? Shit how can you win this sad ass, self loathing mindset when there's too more pros in just cutting the string.""

Recently had an ambien blackout while and drunk ended up fighting and causing a load of of issues with the only few friends of mine. Got back home and in a sudden on the spot decision decided to down a whole load of pills followed by a shit ton of rum. Texted the few ppl, etc, and was sent to the hospital overnight. Now that only friend of mine who is close to me undestandly wants space to lesson the tension.

Bit of back story is that I've always felt deep, deep sense of loneliness since a child and have tried therapy and medicatons but it just never filled that deep hole. Never really have either many close friends and the ones I do have live either hours away or in a different country. The friend that I did fight with is the only one who lives in the same city as me. I know there's online communities to help find connections but the differnce between havings someone physically with you and talking online just isn't the same. Alochol and drugs have become my gateway to just feeling numb when shit gets rough and it's being to get to that point that I just don't want to keep trying at this. I'm not even 30 year but  the effort of just keeping at it is becoming a lot. This isn't a suicide post or anything, it's just being tired of everything.

I thought I got my Loneliness under control, but turned out I only thought that is because I was so distracted by so many family members around me to notice that I still feel lonely. and now it's creeping in again, harder than before in fact lol

and I dunno if this happend to people before, but I took a nap as soon as I arrived to my apartment and I had a dream about... being Alone : D It's like my brain trying to mock me lol which it successfully did and it successfully made me feel like shit, even in my dreams I'm a lonely girl lol"

Whats the point of feeling happy if there's nobody around to be happy with? Its been two and a half years since I've had so much as a spark of mutual attraction. I don't know what to do. Being with someone is literally all I've ever wanted. I don't want to live feeling like this anymore"

lonely,deeply in lone,"deeply in lone -   I feel so lonely. I have a girlfriend, it's been about 2 years, but I don't feel a connection with her. I'm not in love with her anymore. She doesn't ""get me"", she's too self-centered. And in love with me - that's why I've been holding on on breaking up with her. I don't want to hurt her, worried about what she might do about it. 

  I'm far from my country, literally on the other side of the planet. My best friends have a very different life from mine, so we don't talk much anymore. It's fucking hard to not have anyone who understands you, with whom you can share everything you want. 

  My parents have turned their back on me, quite literally told me they saw me as an investment for the future. And when I failed on the finish line after being first the whole race, they lost interest. When I focused on figuring myself out, they stopped being there for me. It's fucking hard to not have someone who will always be there for you unconditionally. I swear to everyone, if I ever have children, I won't ever give up on them, no matter what happens.

  Do you ever meet people who just get you? Or is this something I'm just dreaming about... I feel I am this person for others, but none is for me."

lonely,"Reddit, I have invented telecuddles!","Reddit, I have invented telecuddles! - A lot of lonliness stems from a lack of physical affection. I certainly know what that's like. It's called skin hunger, and it has a lot of psychological implications. So, I invented a system by which two people can simulate cuddles without having to be near each other! The Telecuddle System goes as follows:

*Both parties lay down with three pillows. One to represent the other persons torso, and the other two to represent the arms. Both parties can communicate with a unicode language to imply posistion. For example, &gt;| looks like Big Spoon, and the both parties move the pillows accordingly to simulate spooning.*

Now that sounds good and all, but I need help writing more unicode! So if anyone knows what cuddling posistions would look like as unicode, please comment them! I'll them to this post and credit you for the unicode you write! Let me know what you think about the system, and if you can see any flaws! Thanks for reading!"

lonely,Bad friend?,"Bad friend? - So last weekend was Valentines Day, I hope everyone was able to have a decent time single or as a couple ! One of my bestfriends was down because she usually doesn’t expect much in special days, her past dating relationships weren’t very romantic. But this guy is amazing and seems to have made it an awesome day for her! Well we were messaging and I kept reminding her that her bf would probably make it a good day, I’m so happy he did. At some point she asked how mine was going, I told her honestly that I was pretty sad because again I was alone. That my only good V-days were the two her and I spent hanging out. It got into a conversation on why I don’t date more, spec. casually. Using tinder and being comfortable going on dates and such. I explained to her bad experiences I’ve had trying to get closer romantically with people, and one and one trying to convey to her experiences I had with her. I don’t date much and I don’t usually look for new friends. To me she was perfect, I am overwhelmed with the idea of falling in love with my bestfriend and I thought I did. At a long time for me I was deeply romantically interested in her (she knows this, we’ve talked about it and I’m happy being friends). She thought of us as only friends, whether she had any interest at some point she’s never communicated so ig I’ll never know! But anyways I tried to convey to her that one of the reasons I’m not too keen to dating more is because of experiences I had with her. Was this a bad thing to do? I didn’t mean to bring it up as a mean thing, that she’s somehow a bad person for me having a bad time. But we talk pretty open about everything so I thought telling her this might help her understand how I feel. 
Am I an asshole? I feel terrible. I don’t want to dig up something hurtful between us. 

tl;dr bestfriend (was romantic interest) talks to me about dating casually, I say experiences with her are part of why I’m not too comfortable doing it. Am I an asshole? We usually communicate very openly, mutually very, close talk every day."

Maybe that's why I look for that happiness that I have not found in life elsewhere. then this pandemic came and my plans to stop being so lonely were ruined. Maybe I can only look for happiness in ideas or in fantasy, books, movies, video games, I don't know. The next few years of my life will probably be working a poorly paid job and trying to get good grades in college. And everything to one day reach adulthood and have enough money to survive and enjoy something? By then my youth will be gone and alone. Who knows, I'm only 19 years old and the following years don't look good to me. I know I can't force people to be a little more empathetic, but is it wrong to want to know what it feels like to love and be loved?

lonely,Lonely,"Lonely - I'm pretty lonely. I feel lonely all the time, since so long. Both for love and friendship.

I don't fully comprehend my own loneliness. Often I just want to stay lonely because I want only real people around me.

I desire people that actually have common interests with me so that we can share what we both love, and/or people that somehow establish deep connections with me.

I know such people must exist. It's a big world. I just can't find these people. I've never met them.

All that I've ever experienced is many kinds of bullying, ostracization, and people that I once trusted betraying me. This sorta stuff kept happening for so many years with so many people, it's just crazy.

Meaning in this life seems to be achieved by being able to share it with people you truly care about and love. I know it's possible. But how to find these people?

So I'm pretty lonely. I can distract myself with games and tv shows for only so long. The moment I'm by myself, I get this gloomy feeling of loneliness enwrapping me. Often I welcome it, because at least it feels calm. I just wanted a few real people to be in my life, but at least I have myself. I just try to lay down and enjoy the sky."

This shit is getting old. - I got up a little early but I wasn’t really bothered because I had a dream about a crush and I truly thought I had moved on. Of course I spent the entire ride to working thinking about it! Then at work everything felt like it was in disarray. My manager assigned me multiple tasks while taking up my space. It really threw me off. Then our HR person needed to use my office multiple times so I could never really get set. I tried msging someone to get my mind off things, nothing. We talked for a few then they were gone. I haven’t ate all day and I haven’t been eating regularly for the past few weeks. I am hungry, I just don’t have an appetite so I end up drinking water or a Gatorade. Our systems at my job went down for 2 hrs which was an entire shit show. Some how I still managed to laugh in there. As soon as I got in my car though, I almost started to just break down. I just want one person I feel like I can talk to anytime about anything.

lonely,"34 - Unconditional surrender, I give up.","34 - Unconditional surrender, I give up. - No throwaway because fuck it. I've suffered from deep depression for over 20 years now and like most of you I've struggled at maintaining any sort of healthy relationship. I only recently started taking to family again after many years, they only started talking to me because I told my mom I had been planning suicide when she texted to wish me happy birthday.

 I used to have a group of friends, but it was entirely based around video games and other bs activities, none of them actually knew me and if I ever mentioned my mental health issues I was met with a ""get over it"" response. Eventually I realized they were all racists, I should have known the whole time but I just assumed all the n-word use was a quirk of the rural town they were from. I felt obligated to leave that friend group and just never found another. It doesn't help that I've always been uncomfortable around men, probably because I was abused as a child. 

I was married for a while, but we were never happy, always fought, didn't sleep in the same bed for the final 6 months, she ended up being a lesbian. I've had no significant relationships since. 

I somewhat recently asked a girl in public for her info for the first time in my life and she agreed. I was elated, we got along great, went on a date and she said that she needed time, and was too stressed for a relationship currently because of college and work, swore it wasn't me. My dumbass thought, ""great, I'll show her how genuine I am by waiting for her to be ready and being there for her in the meantime."" So I had been acting like a happy, patient idiot, then found out she got a boyfriend in the meantime, hurt like hell. 

I now have a fwb, which is better than nothing, but she's in her own relationships and lives with them (poly) and can never offer what I actually need, which is someone to come home to, to go to sleep with, a relationship. It's basically just fooling around every couple of weeks or so. I really don't even enjoy the sex that much, just because of how I know it will never become more. I think I am only going with it to have some sort of human contact, which I really haven't had much of at all for the past few years, and every time I do it ends up just being about sex, they never want more. I don't want it to seem like I am getting laid all the time either, I average less than 1 per year. I know I should feel lucky for even that much interaction though. 

I recently deleted my dating app accounts because all they do is feed my loneliness, weeks between matches, years between meetings, never anything significant. 

I go through the same cycle of elation and depression over and over with every girl I meet. I get so excited that this time it will finally be different, and it's exactly the same, and I feel like an idiot for even trying. At this stage I feel like I've been through it enough, I've ridden this cycle too many times, and have too much data telling me that it's just not in the cards for me. I drive everyone away and will continue to. I'm going to die alone. I've accepted it, it's just a matter of how long I want to live alone. 

This deep, unfulfilled need for a partner has left me a complete mess, I've gotten my idea of happiness so entwined with needing someone significant in my life that I simply can't be happy alone. But I am alone, and I'm going to remain that way. I'm done looking, and no one is going to be looking for me. I just want off this ride, I hate it.

 If you're young and like this please try and get it figured out while you're young. I've been this way regarding the opposite sex since I was a teenager. Don't get old still like this, it gets harder and harder to climb out every year, and you dig deeper and deeper every day. I don't have suggestions on how to not be this way other than to seek therapy early. I was 27 before I ever went to a doctor about it and have been on and off various psycopharmacological cocktails, with varying results, but pills can't fix your life.

 I no longer hope for the future, I don't expect a light around the next corner because I know I'm just doing circles in the same dark basement. I feel like I missed my opportunity for anything meaningful to happen for me and it's just going to be this until I'm done."

lonely,I make myself lonely.,"I make myself lonely. - I think a lot of us on this subreddit have dealt with loneliness since childhood. We probably all grew up eating lunch by ourselves and never having a regular friend group. 

This has translated into me “spoiling” myself, I don’t do things I dont like. 

Although I do a lot of stuff outside of my comfort zone, those are done for me. Like, I am friendly to customers in order to keep my job. 

However, outside of that, there’s stuff I am not willing to do. 

For instance, someone asked me to send them a pic of the snow in my neighborhood. Instead of just obliging, it’s super easy to take a picture, 
I replied, “no. Just look out your window” 

These are ways I interact with people. I am not ready to let go of this behavior,even though they dont make me successful, bcuz I am so used to not having to deal with other people’s comforts and likes."

I feel like if I want to be a good person the best thing I can do is stay out of peoples lives. As much as I want to connect with people, thier lives will be better if I stay out of it so I do."

lonely,Life rant. Feeling more and more depressed,"Life rant. Feeling more and more depressed - Hi all. Throwaway account, you know the drill.

22F. I haven't had a group of friends since high school (we don't talk anymore). I never made any friends in college because I didn't know how? Do you really just sit down next to a classmate in lecture and become friends with them? Please enlighten me how that works! And of course covid put any possibilities to a halt.

I've never been in a relationship. Never even had a crush on someone before, and it's safe to assume no one has ever liked me. Never been on a date, etc etc. Now that I am isolated for most of my day, the loneliness is really caving in on me. I live with my family, so I'm not always physically alone but the only people I talk to are my mom, sibling, or relatives. But now, all of my high school and college classmates, siblings, cousins, basically everyone around me is in a relationship. I dread talking to them because they ask me about my relationship status, or talk about theirs. I shrug it off, because I'm embarrassed about it. It's kind of embarrassing that my relatives, some who are 5-7 years younger than me, are in relationships and I've never even blinked in the direction of a potential partner. 

I considered maybe joining a dating app or other socializing app, but as soon as I download it I feel nervous and delete it. I've never been on a date or otherwise been in a romantic setting so I feel like I'm too inexperienced to be on those apps... Not to mention I don't even have any photos of myself to upload because 1. I never go anywhere and 2. Self-esteem who? 

I've bounced around online communities for most of my life and have made online friends but none that last. I've accepted long ago that I must be uninteresting as a person but where do I go from here?

I just want a friend, someone, anyone, to care about me or check in on me or go places with me, have a smoke, watch TV, eat good food. All I do nowadays is keep my eyes glued to screens, whether it's youtube, TV, twitter, or the occasional video game. I dread going to sleep and I dread waking up. Life sucks lol"

Tw: child loss,death




So I (27f) am so crippling lonely it hurts. When I go home and after I put my kids to bed I fight to not cry. Usually im okay with being by myself but the months of February-april is when I need someone the most. These months are when I grieve and hate being alone. In February I found out I was pregnant with what would have been my 2nd child in March I lost the baby I know it was a clump of cells. Then in March my favorite aunt passed away. in March I was also taken to live with relatives along with my sisters. In April is my birthday which everyone seems to forget. Not to mention my uncle is on a ventilator with covid. I have one friend and it feels like I'm only there when she's bored. And one other person I talk to but I could never truly say how I feel because I don't want to be a burden. I miss having someone wake up next to me, to be told they loved me when they left for work. I'm just alone."

I have friends but I feel like our relationships are awkward. It's hard to explain but... I always feel so alone. I feel like my life is a meaningless void with no actual purpose. I love animals and I feel happy when I'm with them, but my parents won't let me have a pet. I can't do anything to convince them. I feel like all my ""friends"" are just using me and no one actually likes me. I've actually had a couple of friends over the period of 4 years. Only now I realise that most of them were not actual friends. They made cruel jokes at my own expense and had the entire class laughing at me. At recess they used to pull jokes on me like pulling my pants down and stealing my hat. In front of the entire school yard. I was even beaten up quite a few times. I moved 2 years ago from my old house and the few real friends  I had, I lost contact with them. Now in quarantine, with no school at all I feel even more lonely. When I tried to talk to my parents about this they just said, you don't need friends, you'll make them when you're older. Just learn stuff, knowledge is the only thing that will help me in life. (I'm Asian by the way) I made a Reddit account just to talk to someone about this. I feel like I can't trust anyone on depression support lines and stuff like that. I'm not suicidal or anything. I don't know what to write now, so I'll just bring this post to an end for now."

I've made a lot of mistakes I'm still working through, and as always the pandemic had been hard. But guilt weighs heavy on one's mind. I also have a lot of insecurities about how I look and act, and the more I procrastinate and do idiotic things the more I feel undeserving to feel sad, if that makes sense. I don't have much to complain about. I have food, a home, people who care. and i hate feeling like i cant talk about the things that bother me without feeling like a spoiled douche with first world problems. I dunno, It's been alot."

lonely,Everything is going well but I still feel empty and alone.,"Everything is going well but I still feel empty and alone. - I am 22. I went through a 6 year long abusive relationship in the past, and it kind of ruined love and friendship for me. I have suffered from depression and anxiety all my life. I was raped by my boss the summer of 2019, so I had to quit. 

I really tried to get my life on track. To find happiness. I started exercising, eating right. I found a guy who seemed totally smitten with me. I thought maybe he meant all the nice things he said to me. We met online through a game we both loved. We met up once with his friends in an airbnb. He was great, but his friends waited until he was asleep and raped me after we all got drunk and I fell asleep on the couch. That really messed up our relationship. He became pretty depressed by that event... he also chose to stay friends with those people. I got a full time career, saved up money, eventually moved in with my boyfriend. I wanted to fix things and have it feel like before the rape happened. Things were going okay... 

Then, the pandemic hit. I lost my job. I was pretty destroyed by that... I loved my job. I was wrongfully fired by my manager’s false write ups. I could have fought back legally, but that sounded like a stressful, long endeavor. Luckily, I qualified for unemployment. My boyfriend did too. So we both had money and all the time in the world together.. but, he always wanted to play games with his friends (who raped me). And I believe in everyone having time for themselves, especially in relationships. But an ideal day for my boyfriend doesn’t even involve me. We also started fighting more as the events in the world took a toll on us. Then, our lease was up, so we had to look for a new place to live because our unemployment didn’t match my previous income. 

We decide to move into my grandma’s house that has been in my mom’s possession ever since my grandma died. She gave us cheap rent, since it went directly to her. I had a very serious talk with my boyfriend about moving into this new house, and how lonely and empty I felt being with him. I never felt like his first choice. Or that he even really enjoys being around me. He used to say all these sweet, loving words when we first started dating. He also was very physically affectionate. But ever since his friends raped me, it’s felt different. Yet, he still hangs out with them. I told him how unfair that is... and he agreed... but I feel bad making him choose. They bring him joy. My boyfriend isn’t horrible to me like my abusive ex, but I wonder if this is a healthy relationship worth saving... 

I feel so alone every day. I have friends who love me dearly, and a great family. I am okay financially and have free time to do whatever I want. But I’ve always been a hopeless romantic, and being in love is my favorite part of being alive. I feel like I’m missing out. It‘a already been two years with my boyfriend. I’m scared to try again or be truly alone. But I wonder if I’m settling or if things will get better.."

I usually do my best to not share these feelings, because of how inconvenient it is to people that I've encountered in my life that I stopped trying. I just feel like for someone who shares the same week of birth as Valentine's Day, it's very rough to be alone in the world. 

My family had all of our birthdays pretty close together, mine is in Feb. My sister in March, and my mother in April, and my father in October (he's the only exception). Mine being the same week as valentine's, I always saw my parents spending all the time and money in the world getting each other gifts for valentine's that when they remembered my birthday, if they did. There would be no time for me or they'd not have anything for me. My sister mainly goes guy to guy so she's always been out socializing. Anyways, I'm not going to go on and on, but I just felt that since my family wasn't really ever around plus having no friends. I find it super depressing to share the same week of birth as valentine's, especially this year. I can only imagine what it feels like to share the same day as Valentine's. 

The worst part about it all, is that whenever I brought it up to my family, friend etc. They always made it out to me that I was being selfish. It makes me feel shitty that I, no matter what I did to win approval or merits, that I was always forgotten. Especially on the week of Valentine's, sometimes it makes me wish that I wasn't around so that I wouldn't be so much of a god**** burden. I just want to feel loved and appreciated like everyone else does. Is that too selfish?

Anyways, thank you if you made it this far. I appreciate it if you read it this far. I hope you all feel better and can be happy eventually too, if you aren't happier already."

lonely,a life vent or something idk,"a life vent or something idk - Hey there. I don't really know why I'm writing this but I guess that I just wanted to vent my frustration with life. I'm 28 and a software developer by profession. I'm writing this because I've been lonely pretty much all of my life (even in relationships) and I guess I want people to avoid making my mistakes.   
When I was a teenager I wasn't really interested in girls much. I was always that dark gloomy guy with long hair who never talked to anyone. I never really had any real friends (only buddies from whatever I was doing at the time). I had my hobbies like art/gaming/acrobatics and I was having fun with them.   


When I was getting close to being 20 I started noticing all of the couples around me and I thought to myself that it would be nice to be with someone as well. Sex wasn't really important to me. I wanted a companion, someone to snuggle and cuddle with, someone who would cook with me, someone who would watch movies with me, someone who would do all sorts of little things with me. I wanted a relationship where both me and my SO would be able to be honest and loyal, a relationship where communication would be the priority to avoid problems.  


Eventually I ended up in 2 relationships.   
I won't go into much detail but I can say that I've lost pretty much the best years of my life because of them. Of course at the very beginning they were great, honeymoon phase and all that. Very soon though the true colors of those girls showed and it was nothing but constant lies, manipulation, emotional stress, being blamed, cheating. Pretty much the worst scenario you could imagine.  


I was always helping anyone who asked for it. Same thing happened during my relationships, especially the last one. My ex would repeatedly say that she wants to change and be better and not be toxic anymore and me being the sucker I am I would do everything in my power to help her go through it. I would write walls of text to make her feel better, I would arrange some activities that we could do together, you get the idea. I really cared. Despite all that I was being cheated on and lied to for months and months and me being a person who normally keeps their walls really high I was getting hurt by all of that A LOT. Eventually I even relocated to Germany to move in with my ex. I got an apartment, I got a job and of course more lies surfaced, more cheating, more manipulation. She broke up with me claiming that it was all my fault. After that I didn't leave my bed for few months. I was heartbroken, I didn't know what to do with my life. Every single day I would be thinking about my relationship experiences. I was analyzing every situation in my head trying to understand both sides and stuff, trying to understand where I've made mistakes. Trying to understand the motives and the psychology behind it. After few months of doing that I was no longer wearing rose tinted glasses. I realized how hard I was being manipulated, I realized that people don't change unless they really want to even if we really care and try to help. I was wiser than ever but I was very hurt to the point where I was semi-suicidal (I thought about it but I know myself and I know that I will never do it because it solves nothing).  


I realized that even though I was in relationships I never really had partners. I never had someone who would really love me, care for me, worry about me. I was only wasting my own energy and sanity to try and help people who didn't really want or deserve my help and my energy was never being replenished back by them caring for me. Once I realized that it hit me hard. I realized that I've wasted best years of my life on bad people. On one hand I hate it, on the other hand I'm grateful because I've learned so damn much.  


My mental state got even worse due to the state of the relationship scene. Everyone using tinder, instagram, going to clubs etc. Photoshopped pictures, fake smiles. I wasn't interested in any of that fake stuff. I wanted someone real. I want to wear an ugly Christmas sweater with someone and laugh about it if you get what I mean. I have so much love to give but nobody to give it too. Sometimes I'm afraid that someone might even find it creepy if I will care too much  


I kept working and working and lived alone still without any friends. I was like a zombie (and I still kinda am). Very often I'm so lonely that I want to cry or just die (once again don't worry I won't do it). I spent a big part of my life trying to convince myself that I'm fine being alone because I'm a loner but that's absolutely not true. I see couples everywhere and that makes me feel even worse. Then there are my insecurities and past experiences and I end up thinking that I will die somewhere alone and nobody will miss me  


Then Covid hit the whole world and the situation got even worse. Due to the situation I've picked up a new hobby which is VR gaming. Allows me to move and socialize with others without leaving my place.  
At first it was pretty fun but then I quickly realized how many couples are in those games as well so all of the bad thoughts hit me again. Most people in those games are also teenagers or around 20. I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore. I'm so lonely while everyone around me is in relationships. I kind of lost my will to live but I won't do anything stupid. I will just continue to exist in this zombie state. I just turned 28 and I'm nearly at 30. I have talked to many people about this but all I ever hear is ""don't worry it's gonna be better, you will meet someone soon"" and nothing is getting any better. I also realized that I was always giving people advice to help them with their relationship problems using my experiences but nobody ever asked how I was doing and even if someone did I would just say that I'm ok because what would it change if I actually told them that I wanna die. I would only hear ""don't worry it's gonna be better"".  


So yeah that's pretty much my life story so far when it comes to relationships. Nothing but depression. Being lied to/manipulated/cheated on. Wasting my energy on the wrong people and never getting anything in return as well as hurting because I really want to love and care for someone yet I'm nearing 30 and I'm still alone. To top it off growing insecurities and the feeling that I will die alone."

Though I’m not always on the best terms with my family I decided I would buy my mother and sister gifts for the holiday to show them I love them. Sent the few friends I have some cheesy Valentine’s Day images, and just went all out for myself. Ordered myself a very nice expensive meal to take home, got chocolate covered strawberries, wine, and watched a movie. I know loneliness can be soul crushing, but I wanted to share with you all how great I felt just saying no to that feeling and only allowing love for myself for a day.

lonely,How to be more social?,"How to be more social? - Hello fellow redditors,

I have been following this thread for some time now and finally build up the courage to share with you what bothers me. 

For my entire life, all 27 years, I have troubles with meeting people, making friends, or forming any meaningful relationships. I come from a standard family from Poland. 

When I was at school, at university or now at work, I feel generally liked by my peers. They always treat me with respect, value my opinions and come to me for help when they need it. I am always happy to support anyone who requests my help. Despite of all that attention I am not able to form a deeper relationship with others and I have never had a true friend, with whom I could talk to about anything. All my interactions nowadays boil down to occasional beer with some guys I met at the uni or co-workers. 

After all this time and especially now when true contact with others is far more difficult, I want to change something in my file and break this curse. I would be grateful If you could share any tips, experiences how to overcome this social anxiety (?) and be more open to others."

I’m a 25M and have yet to have a relationship. Usually various reasons I would rather not go into too much detail, but mainly I was alright with being alone and no partner. Same goes with friends I liked having friends but I had no problem being alone. These last few years hit different. I want companionship, someone to call a friend since all my friends kinda went separate ways, I want to experience love, just anything really.

lonely,At the loneliest and lowest point of my life,"At the loneliest and lowest point of my life - Just kinda want to get a big message out there. 

I’m sat in my room, alone, with basically no one to talk to and it sucks. A lot has lead to this point, and a lot has added to the sadness of the situation, but it is horrible.

Broke up with my girlfriend yesterday. She was honestly the light of my life and I love her to pieces but it was just littered with too many problems to work properly. It makes me cry every time I think about her not being with me forever, and it was very serious, but fuck it hurts. 

I’ve also fairly recently moved to a new town, and honestly have no one to talk to. Also with it being covid I can’t just go to a bar or social meet up, so I have literally no one. Yes I have a few great friends who are talking to me, and I have some family around, so I’m very fortunate in that sense. 

My main goal out of this I guess is to find out how you guys can be happy in just yourselves, and how I can try it. I’ve always surrounded myself with people, and losing my girlfriend and a lot of friends along the way in a lockdown has been really tough.

lonely,"Sometimes it feels good to be lonely, sometimes not!","Sometimes it feels good to be lonely, sometimes not! -  So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same.

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

I am currently attending a remote vocational school while in a living situation where I probably will not be able to meet people face to face for another year due to the risks involved to those I am living with. However, I would still like to somehow connect with people in a meaningful way. I have been in the 12 step programs for several years now and have found the act of listening to others without providing advice or judgment (and vice versa) extremely helpful to my mental state. 

I am thinking to create a Google phone number where I can audio call with someone for 10-15 minutes at a time and listen to their thoughts, feelings, their day, or anything on their mind. Would anyone be interested in this or think this is an idea worth pursuing? Thanks!"

lonely,Tried to defend my friend but somehow messed up.....,"Tried to defend my friend but somehow messed up..... - (Long read but I’d appreciate some advice.) 

A few months ago I introduced two of my close friends to each other. I don’t really have many friends and am lonely most of the time but these were still two people who used to talk to me and who I was and still am very bonded to. 

As soon as I introduced them to one another, one friend of mine fell head over heels for my other friends and she ended up liking him back and they’re a couple now. 

Naturally, I was really happy that my two close friends were into each other and supported their relationship wholeheartedly, even though I felt insecure and kinda bad that they managed to hit it off so well when I literally haven’t dated anyone in my life (22 going on 23). I also felt afraid that they’d be so involved with each other that they’d kinda forget me and start neglecting me and excluding me, which obviously started happening but I’ve not said anything because whenever I do they both use the “we’re dating and it can’t be helped it’s different between us and just friends” card.

The girl has also at times sort of tried to police my interactions with the guy and insinuated that I can’t be upset that he isn’t replying to me and stuff because I’m “just a friend” and again, “it’s different for couples.” 

He has been a very close friend of mine for years and we both bonded at a time when neither of us were really okay. We sort of helped each other out of bad situations by just being friends and we were always really comfortable and open with each other.
Since he started dating my friend, that bond has kind of gone and I hesitate to speak to or expect anything of him because they just use the relationship excuse to sort of deny that I’m allowed to care about my friend or expect him to tell me when things are wrong instead of just going quiet.

As I’m close to them and don’t want to spoil my friendships with either one of them I just let this all go even though it hurts.

The thing is, both my friends have mental and physics health issues and the guy’s health issues are so severe that he has been sort of completely AWOL for weeks now and I know the girl is hurting and missing him and worried. 
And since him and I are close I messaged him directly, even though I haven’t heard from him for weeks, telling him that he committed to her knowing he has health issues and he cannot just be distancing himself and not keeping in touch with her like this. I told him that if he can’t pull his weight and make an effort for her he should just break up because otherwise he is just hurting her and being insensitive. Again, he hasn’t contacted me for a while now and I don’t even know if he saw the messages because I keep read receipts off.

It somehow came up in conversation and I very honestly told the girl I had said this to him and she got really really angry with me and said I was interfering in their relationship and breaking her trust and taking away her autonomy in the relationship. And that it was her conversation to have with him and not mine. She even accused me of being “nonchalant about a potential break up” and always “fanning the flames and then disappearing” because I told her I didn’t want to talk when she is angry. I really don’t like arguing when my emotions are high and I like to step away if I can help it and talk calmly. 

Anyway, she hasn’t spoken to me since then and I don’t know if I was an asshole or something. I understand why she was upset and why she would freak out about this especially considering her last partner was abusive as all hell and would flirt with other girls in front of her eyes. Breakups are hard and painful and I get that she would be upset and worried about it, I really do. 
But I just don’t feel like apologising. Maybe I’m being egotistic but I said what I said to the guy as his friend and I also just don’t like the accusations she threw at me in anger. 

It took me years to learn to step away from destructive conversations and take a breath and I try my best to avoid arguments so being accused of “always fanning the flames and running away” seems out of the blue and denying the effort I made to be a more responsible and healthy person.

The girl is also at a risk of skin cancer and her biopsy results were supposed to come in today. I’m worried about her and miss her but I don’t know what to do and don’t know how to start a conversation again without either upsetting her further or apologising for something I’m not entirely sure I’m that much in the wrong about. 
I especially don’t want to let her baseless accusations slide but I also don’t want to lose the friendship because she’s important to me. I’m willing to even stop talking to the guy altogether if it means I can protect my friendship with her. 

But I just don’t know what to do. I’ve lost one of the only important people in my life and I just feel hopeless and miserable."

lonely,"As a guy, I've always relied on other people to approach me","As a guy, I've always relied on other people to approach me - I don't think I've ever made the first move, like ever. This used to not be a problem back in middle school up until early jr. high school because for whatever reason people were just way more social back then, so I still managed to have waaaaaaay more friends than I could have ever asked for. REAL friends, at that. They all treated me as if I was a big deal, everyone wanted to sit with me and spend time with me in general, due to that, and obviously a lot more private interactions which I won't mention, I can say with confidence I had the perfect childhood

Fast forward to today, I've been alone for a few years because of this mentality I grew up with and it's starting to take its toll on me. I used to wonder why people suddenly stopped caring but no fucking wonder dude, I'm the one with the problem here. I sit alone minding my own business on the phone, clearly uninterested with everything and I barely talk back when people approach me (because a lot still try to). I grew up not even trying to socialize, but just letting others do it for me instead, but it still worked flawlessly so that's why it took me so long to understand what I was doing wrong. The amount of people I've unintentionally pushed away, the amount of relationships -- both friendly and romantic -- that I've butchered because of this is insane

Now how am I suddenly supposed to change when it's the last 3-4 months of school? Everyone already has their own friend group, this situation sucks"

I have no IRL friends to hang out with and I do have my family around but it’s not the same as having friends.

However, when I do get new online friends, I’m constantly plagued with thoughts that make my barriers and anxiety go up. ‘What if they are only pretending to like me?’ ‘What if I’m really annoying and they’re just too nice or non confrontational to tell me?’ ‘What if they don’t want to hear my problems?’ ‘What if I’m pushing boundaries just by being the first to message them?’ All of that and so much more makes it hard for me to open up to them and truly them.

Liar

Okay, like, not all the time. As I said, I am trying my best. But what bugs me is that I do lie without a second thought, when it comes to certain things. And it just keeps eating me from inside out.

lonely,Destined to die alone,"Destined to die alone - Hey guys, I am making this post for me, when I was younger that is.

Some people just are not comparable, some are destined to roam alone. Don’t feel bad though, we are all really just a bunch of stardust flying through a great unknown, of unimaginable volume. It just doesn’t matter. Life is what you make of it, and you don’t get more time so just accept that, and focus on improving and living for today. While it is true you can only love someone as much as yourself, sometimes you don’t love anything, and that’s okay!

Don’t follow my walkthrough, it’s an expert only mode. 

I recently changed my life, i’m 20, ged, and no friends, up until recently the latter two were less than accurate. When I was in high school I was in an alone place, and a little depressed. What I did was I turned to less than legal items and activities with likeminded individuals, which gave me light and companionship. I truly lived as if every day was the last. This gave me the meaning in life I searched so hard for, as well as more life experience than most will ever see, at least I would hope for them. The countless events and items I utilized and were involved in is insane really, I never even got a ticket.

And if your on the path I was on, and happen to be browsing an online forum while committing not Christian acts, I implore you to look around. You are around people that love you, and love items as you do, and you may be truest happy. Now look at the future and past, you may be in a situation where you see no viable way out, and the happiness you have now is better than anything that functioning in a society could give,I know I was. You will find yourself in a situation where if you were to remove yourself, you would have to separate yourself from everyone you know, and every hobby you’ve done. It gets lonely, and incredibly boring.  But this makes the highs of life even more fruitful! 

I can’t end this, because I have not yet seen those fruits. Every day is lonely, and every night is dull, comparing to what I know I could make it, that is. 

You know i’ve never actually had a valentine, but today was the first time I ever actually noticed. I’ve thought more about how lost I am in this world, and alone than ever before. I haven’t had anyone call or message me wishing a happy valentines. I didn’t go anywhere, I just went to work, and sat alone with my dog. The only thing I wanted today was a fat blunt, because that is the closet thing to love I have ever felt, and yet I abstained. 

Being sober really puts things in a more serious tone, and sorry for getting mopey here. Car issues, Housing issues, being stuck in a dead end job, and knowing exactly what’s the solution is, money. You sober people are tanks man, really.

 I know I am 20, but the only thing I want in life is a nice quiet piece of land, with a fence and my dog, and a neat little motorized gate that looks overgrown and abandoned. Something that I may never possess. Even though I have no criminal background, I have no direction. I have become scared to commit my life to a profession that I would grow to hate, because how could you love something if you don’t live yourself?

Honestly, I just recently found the career that I would love to do forever, which is to fly a uav for the af. Unfortunately I am in no position to become an officer, if I am lucky I could get in it with a ged. Such is the irony of life I suppose. 

I hope everyone is well in these trying times, and I love you all."
lonely,Just another day,Just another day - They say it will get better but I don’t seem to feel better and it’s been years. When someone ask me what makes me happy I really don’t know the answer.

lonely,"So alone despite being in a relationship for 4 years... I’m alone and stuck. (M,52)","So alone despite being in a relationship for 4 years... I’m alone and stuck. (M,52) - I am just glad to have come across this group and applaud these efforts for trying to make us lonely losers feel a little less small and invisible. It’s a great step in self validation as we are being vulnerable with an unknown group of people who could very easily be not supportive of us and our thoughts as much as they seem like they are. I am very grateful to have found this as I struggle daily with the feelings of aloneness and suffer from total lack of self worth, lack of self esteem and lack of self care. I didnt eat all day as I was punishing myself for being lazy and not doing more to work on my weight and to get more exercise. I gained about 30 pounds this year since the lay off in March ‘20 and COVid shut the world down. so I’m not only sad, I’m upset at my weight gain, upset at my lack of self care, I skip showering to every 2nd or 3rd day cause why bother. I stopped shaving, I’m growing a beard, cause who cares, no one sees my except for my bf, who has not even noticed or said anything about the lack of shaving or the beard since over a month. Also, I have not heard from anyone in my friend circle in over a year. I did reach out to friends from time to time to see how they were doing, but after the 6 th or 7th time and they never call, text or email me first... well why bother. So Today I stayed in bed, drank coffee till 3:30 pm and watched a series on Netflix (Unorthodox) which had me hooked in the first 10 min. Great story. I don’t say this because I’m Jewish, I say this because it’s good. Besides I’m not orthodox, I’m totally reformed. As a gay guy I could not be able to be orthodox, but I relate to the lead character’s story of feeling like an outsider. I took care of me and rested in bed. My bf (m,37) was working till 9 pm so I went out to shop for groceries at 6 and made dinner at 8:00. He’s asleep now next to me. He never said anything about it being Valentine’s Day. No card. No flowers. No text. No wine. No words of love or care. This was our 4th VDay together. He works as a manager in a restaurant so I get it, he has to work. But so what ? Does all life cease to matter? I feel invisible, uncared for, alone, sad and depressed. I love too much, give too much and ask for nothing in return but what anyone is willing to give. Which all my life is nothing. My first two LTRs were identical. They took and took till I had nothing left to give. And then they left me for much younger guys. Now history repeats. I’m alone, taking care of the house, the grocery, the bills, the food and dishes but I get no thanks, no appreciation, no kindness and no attention. Not even a little mention that he wishes us to have a VD dinner on our own time or something. Just nothing. I might as well be single. Then I would not have to cook for two, shop for two, clean up after his lazy unkempt ass. Leaving clothes on the floor in the bed room and the bathroom, packaging from his online orders on the floor or on the sofa where he plops down every night. He has only done the dishes 3 times in a year since moving in last March and 1 time before that when he came over to sleep here before shacking up. COVid forced his hand. I’m lost and afraid to be alone. Even though I am already. At 52 what do I have to do to get some attention? I’m already alone. But at least it appears like not. I am just tired of being a maid and a provider when no one has ever provided for me. Thank you for reading. If you did. Although I doubt it. I’d have stopped 50 lines ago. There’s nothing to do but just wait for him to leave me or for COVid to get me and release me from this jail of life."
lonely,everyone always finds someone better than me...,"everyone always finds someone better than me... - Friendship or romantic, people always leave and find someone who makes them more happy, who’s better looking, more outgoing and charismatic, who has higher “status”.

No one  telling you what to do like study go clean the dishes' get ready
 You are your own self and you dont need anyone or anything else, just RELAX and what you need and want without a second thought about other people think about you or what your doing.

I don't really feel like I'm looking for anything all that special, but I guess it is with how rare it seems to be. I'm so passionate about video games and anime but I can't find a single girl that has a comparable level of enthusiasm or interest. I'm a pretty lovey-dovey, supportive person and want to give and receive affection, talk a lot, and have fun, but I just can't seem to find anyone I can relate to. I felt like I just wanted something so simple but it's become so impossibly hard to find that I've been forced into a depressing, isolated emptiness because of it. Now all I can do is watch VTuber Valentine's Day streams and feel a deep pain in my chest as I comprehend that the only positive female presence I'll ever have in my life is virtual YouTubers saying they love their fans. It's the only time I'll ever hear a girl tell me she actually likes me. I guess that's as good as I'm going to get. Better than nothing..."

For Valentine's day I took out this girl from work ive been talking to for a while, and I feel like we really hit it off. everything went great and she even said she'd want to hang out again another time. even though everything went fine, I still feel a sadness because of the fact that I assume things will fall through, even though nothing's happened to indicate that happening. I want things to turn out good with this girl, but I'm holding myself back and I don't know why. any advice?"
lonely,Life is just bullshit now.,"Life is just bullshit now. - I feel awful every day but yesterday being valentines was especially awful and having unrequited love didn't help. I planned on sitting at home all day so I won't be able to see other people but unfortunately, I had an exam so I had to go out. My friends also planned on going somewhere out to have dinner and drinks where I was supposed to join after my exams. Of course the exam center was close to the seaside which has always been a spot for couples to hang out. I still, went, gave my exams  and was heading to the place where my friends were supposed to be. I tell my parents that I'm going but instead of asking how my exam went, the first thing that happens is getting scolded for planning to go out. Granted I've been doing it too frequently but that's something that helps to keep my sanity in check. So, I tell my friends I'm cancelling my plan and tell my parents I'm going anyway. I decide I'm gonna go and just roam around for a couple of hours. I went to a mall, even though I knew how I'd feel, and I was standing there,alone at the center of the mall, surrounded by 100's of couples. Its as if the world is mocking me for being single. I hadn't had any food since morning too but when I saw even more couples at any place to eat, I just went away. I didn't have food for the whole day. but I think its fitting for someone like me, its a punishment for being lonely and single. All I can do is fantasize the life where I was confident, good looking and wasn't ghosted and got to actually tell that girl how I felt about her. I'm such a waste. Of course all my friends who are in a relationship tell me being single isn't so bad and what would I even do if I had a gf or how a gf isn't everything. Yeah, thanks. That means a lot to me. Actually, that is my whole thing now. I just want that one particular person. Before anyone even says, yeah I know I'm obsessed with someone. What even is expected of someone like me with zero  confidence, social anxiety and fuck ton of depression and desparation."
lonely,unlovable,"unlovable - I (21F) relate to Eponine from Les Mis ever since I was in high school. Home girl fell in love in her head and was greatly disappointed each time.

I fall for people in my head. I fantasize about the life we could potentially have together or even how we’d spend the next few months together. Of course, it’s not like these people are into me to begin with, so it’s a giant let down and waste of emotional investment. 

Almost all of my friends are in relationships, so Valentines Day was difficult to say the least. I’m happy for them, but I wish that, for once, they’d finally be happy for me. I wish they’d be honest with me and just tell me what’s wrong with me. To be a girl at my age with zero relationship experience must mean that there’s something deeply wrong with me. 

But hey, I don’t have any problems getting hit on men that are older than me. I started off VDay by getting hit on by a man in his 40s, who I met when I was 16. So you know, if I get really desperate, there’s hope after all."

Not until I heal... Bc I can't see you... Bc I never stopped loving you... Don't think I ever will. I'm only 29 but I know you ""were"" the one.  I just fucked up. So I hope I can be in our angels life. I hope some day she loves me as you used to."
lonely,It's so lonely here,"It's so lonely here - I don't have any friends besides my cousins and my sibling. It's so hard not having any friends in your neighborhood or in your school.

I see all the kids in my neighborhood having all the fun in the world. I would watch them play and it takes me to a time where my world was not bombarded with responsibilities and a shit ton of problems. I miss my childhood. I miss having friends. I used to have friends in my child hood too but in an indefinite time, they grow up and eventually your friendships sink and everybody moves on, leaving you behind.

I miss having friends. My cousins are younger than me and I have nothing to talk to them about. There is a lot of things wrong with me. I'm sure of it. I would have friends right now if I wasn't the way I am.

I need someone to converse with, to have a shoulder to cry on. I want friends to play pranks with and eat like pigs whenever we are hungry. I need someone to validate my experience. I have had too many friendships that ended because they were just using me. What a crock of shit those people are.

I have never been on a road trip that is not with my family. Do not get me wrong, I love my family but there is nothing like a bond with friends laughing our asses off while great sights pass us by. I wish I had friends. For my birthday, I wish the universe would gift me best friends. 

I just need to get this off my chest. Been crying myself to sleep everyday thinking about how happy I was in the past. And I'll never get the feeling of being someone's source of happiness."
lonely,I haven’t had a single friend in over five years,"I haven’t had a single friend in over five years - I’m 21 and I haven’t had a single friend since I was 15. I quit public school to be homeschooled due to bizarre  manifestations of depression/ anxiety (my homeschooling was a shit-show, I was left to my own devices and never got much of anything done, but that’s irrelevant). I cut ties with all of my friends from school because I just didn’t see the point and didn’t want them to see me in the state I was in (I had like two or three really close friends and some acquaintances) And, holy shit, if I had realized I would turn into a completely isolated, attention-starved, insecure, jobless, non-driving 21 year old, I would’ve sucked it up and stayed in school. My anxiety and depression weren’t even really school-related so much (school was never fun for me though) so it probably would’ve been fine and maybe I’d at least have a single friend today. It’s too hard to meet people as an adult. I’ve had jobs here and there, which never last more than a month, and people have been friendly with me, but it’s so obvious that they’re just being polite, and don’t want anything more than a “coworker relationship”. I also stopped using Snapchat back when I was 15, I stopped using Instagram when I was 18, and I’ve never used TikTok. I did this to help with my depression, because I was starting to see how toxic it all was, but it’s only gotten worse because now I feel too “out of the loop” and don’t know where to begin. I have younger sisters, and occasionally use Reddit/ Youtube so I’m not completely disconnected from trends and stuff, but overall I feel very out of place around people my own age. Reconnecting with high school friends is way too pathetic and out of the question. I, also, like I mentioned, don’t drive because I’m extremely insecure in everything that I do, and this only makes me feel more pathetic. It’s just a never ending cycle of insecurity and depression. 

TLDR/ I quit public school essentially because I didn’t want people to think I was weird for being depressed and anxious, then I only got depressed and anxious by tenfold due to feeling isolated and lame and out of the loop, which keeps me from driving, and having a job, which keeps me feeling twenty times more isolated and lame and depressed and anxious and out of the loop. There’s so much more I could say. I’ve only had my mother to talk to for the past five and a half years. I’ll spare everybody the extra boredom."

lonely,"So, just wanted to get some things off my chest.","So, just wanted to get some things off my chest. - A little background about myself, I am  currently in an Asian country. I would describe myself as pretty introverted? extremely awkward in text messages? I have managed to make several close friends throughout my school life. And yet, nowadays we only text pretty rarely and go out..maybe once every 3 months? And lately, seeing all my new schoolmates(whom I'm not very close with) always on their phones, texting their friends, makes me feel very lonely. I very rarely text people, much less on a regular basis. I made this post because.. i feel empty inside? Like I dont have any close friends? Maybe no one texts me because I'm hopelessly awkward in text messages? Never been in a relationship before. 

I do know that i have a very loving family that cares deeply for me, and i should be grateful...but i still feel very alone. Every minute, i look at my phone hoping for notifications, but they never come. Maybe once every 3 weeks. I actually like going to school as i do interact quite a lot with my schoolmates. But its just that. After school, we go home, and i sink into my shell again. And i am afraid, afraid of the impending 2-months long holiday, where I'll be all alone again. And there's nothing i can do about it. Maybe i just haven't met the right group of friends yet. Maybe i have and i dont cherish them enough. I just want this lonely feeling to go away...

Sorry if this wall of text made no sense. I just wanted to get this off my chest, even if its to a community of strangers. I never used to be like this... but now seeing my previous friends in discord calls with their newfound friends just makes me feel sad, empty, alone.

I think that's all. Thank you for those who have made it here, and have a good day."

lonely,I don’t understand the world or myself.,"I don’t understand the world or myself. - I hate that I feel lonely first of all, but I also hate that I don’t do anything about it.  My priorities seem to be else where and I often will tell myself that I don’t need a girl to be happy.  Other times I tell myself that if I had a girlfriend I would be the happiest person ever, but when I start talking to a girl I eventually get bored of talking about the random bullshit.  It seems like the stuff we’re texting about is just an excuse to talk to each other.  Why did I feel lonely to begin with if I got bored of talking to her?  Was I just horny the entire time and then the urge eventually went away?  Is that the only reason that I feel lonely, because I’m actually horny?  That doesn’t make sense though.  I have dreams and wishes of laying in bed with a girl and just holding her while watching a movie.  I dont understand.  I hate that a good looking person can be in a relationship and lose it because of a bad personality, however an ugly person can’t get into a relationship at all even if they have an incredible personality.  Nobody wants anyone with missing teeth and witch noses.  I hate that I follow this same thought process aswell.  I didn’t get a crush on the girl at the register because of what she said, it was the beautiful eyes and pretty smile.  I also hate that a girl can make me feel so different just because I see a picture of her with no clothes on.  I hate being horny, but at the same time those pictures are what give me the biggest dopamine spike of the day.  I wish I understood.  I wish I thought normally.  I wish I could love someone.  I wish I could watch Wall-E with someone."

It’s a bad time for all of us, some more than others, I couldn’t shower or cook in my own home for 18 months, I know the struggle to a degree. This bad will be repaid in the form of good times ahead.

I’ve been talking to this girl who I feel a real connection with that I’ve never had with anyone before. We’ve hung out a few times now which is a pretty big step for me. She takes me out of my comfort zone sometimes and that’s something I enjoy.

Recently on a night while I was struggling to sleep she spontaneously picks me up and we go to the state capital and I had the most fun of life..literally. She understands me even when I’m quiet and actually accepts me for who I am.

lonely,I (f28) feel...stuck. Like my last relationship was my last shot,"I (f28) feel...stuck. Like my last relationship was my last shot - For the last 6 years I’ve been in and out of abusive relationships. Every type you can think of I’ve been there. The last one was worst, he attempted to take my life in a drunken rage which has pushed me to go to therapy. For the past three months I’ve gone to therapy every week and I’m a much better and stronger person for it.

Or I thought I was.

I haven’t felt single at all. The thought of dating has never crossed my mind and I don’t think I could ever put my trust into someone else again. In a few days I have to talk to his PO. He wants to be in contact in the future, for whatever reason I don’t know, and I’m not strong enough to say no. So in less than two months we can talk again; only over the phone though and only if he’s been doing what he’s supposed to healing wise.

I’m scared and it’s bringing up feelings of how much I missed physical comfort. These past three months I’ve lost a grandma to covid, and another two are on hospice. That and my niece has been in and out of the er for an unknown virus. I’m so drained and beaten down and all I crave is to have comforting arms around me and for some fucked up reason my mind goes to him.

He wasn’t amazing in any sense of the word. When he wasn’t drunk and just buzzed we would watch movies, play video games, listen to music and go out to eat. Our connection was just intense and the moment we met we both knew we were going to change each other’s world. The more I look back though that chemistry was it and we were both looking for anyone to fill a void only we could fill ourselves.

He was dirty, physically and verbally mean when he was drunk and took advantage of my ptsd towards anything sexual when he knew for a fact I couldn’t say no out of fear or even give me a chance. On that topic whenever we were intimate I had to be facing away or face down which always made me feel so low about myself. He said it was because he had bad stage fright but...I don’t know.

I should hate him but I can’t. I’ve tried so hard and I can’t hate him or move on. Every time I do try to he comes back into my mind and I just feel so alone. My family and friends try to be there for me but they only have anger and hatred towards him which usually leads to arguments. Now in less than two months, if he continues to want to, he will be back in my life.

Half of me expects him to just use this to send out an angry message about how much he hates me, how he’s been with other woman, how he has no feelings towards me anymore. How I’ve been the only one suffering. Then he’ll just shut down all contact and I’ll be once again left an emotional wreck and have to start all over. I’m so scared of this...he knows exactly what to say to make me break and if he’s mad enough he will and yet I’m too weak to stop it."

lonely,Just a rant,"Just a rant - Ever since i was a kid i’ve always been the shy and quiet kid in class and i was often made fun of. In middle school i completely changed the way i looked because everyone was making fun of me, i went from being shy to being a complete prick, i would always be in trouble, my grades were extremely low, i was constantly picking fights with other people, and i started hanging out with the “cool” guys. To do so i had to always act like an idiot, constantly yelling or do some reckless stuff just to make other people laugh, while deep inside of me i was the exact opposite. I went from being made fun of to make fun of other people because i was scared that if i didn’t do it first they would hurt my feelings (i’m extremely sensitive but i had to act as if i cared about nothing). When i am alone i barely even talk, i’m extremely calm and i just like reading books listening tu music or playing my guitar and things like that. Having to act the exact opposite of the way i am was incredibly tiresome and everytime i went home i would just feel lonely and depressed. Now my friends left me, i have social anxiety and no one to talk to. I have no idea how to interact with someone because the only way people accepted me was when i acted extremely aggressive and i don’t even know how to have a normal conversation anymore."

They don’t even think about me. I have had one “conversation” that was really fun, but I was only being used to vent on. It hurts because I try to change myself, the people I’m around, the environment I’m in but nothing works. Friendship just seems so fun yet so impossible. Romance is absolutely out of the picture. I’m never even noticed unless I’m useful is some task. I like to make music but it all ends up being a reminder of how fucking alone I am. I always see my “friends” skiing or rock climbing without me.

How can I be acknowledged by anyone in any way."

I don’t want to be here anymore. - I’ve been struggling so much with loneliness and depression this past year. I don’t have friends I can hang out with. I never had a girlfriend and I’m a virgin being almost 21 years old. I feel like life is so meaningless. The only thing keeping me distracted is the gym and school work. I’m trying to “focus on myself” like they always say, but this is just a default “solution” that doesn’t really fix the root cause of my unhappiness. That I live a life of loneliness. That I feel insignificant to the world and everyone I know. 

I’ve spent months trying to find a therapist. Everyone is booked or doesn’t take my insurance. I can’t even get a help from a therapist...so at this point, what is there left for me to do? I don’t want to be on this planet anymore."

lonely,i’m just so behind,"i’m just so behind - **LONG**
i am behind in my age group. a lot of people have already had completed their firsts. i on the other haven’t. feel like i’m too far behind to be able to catch up without it being embarrassing. no one would want someone who’s this inexperienced. i don’t have much physical appeal. i’m just super average looking on a good day, nobody wants average. it’s come to the point where i’m just aware that i can’t be a second or even last option. i wouldn’t even be an option, i can’t be one. there really is just no hope for me to find someone. and being unattractive in the first place just makes it ten times harder, cause it’s deciding between someone who’s obviously attractive and experienced or me; who’s ugly and no experience. and no one would chose the latter. and i know a lot of people would always say that they are someone who is ugly, and their actually are not. but i actually am, cause when the only people that say i am good looking or give me compliments have been females, a male has never said that i’m good looking or anything. so it’s obvious that i am in no way appealing to guys. i think the only way that i could possibly ever get someone is just to buy my way into it. cause i have a well paying job and would be able to afford stuff, so if i can show that i can buy everything they’d obviously take up the offer to have their stuff paid for. i would be used to it anyways, i think everyone that i know just uses me for my money anyways. so it wouldn’t be hard to add someone else that could use me too. i don’t even think that people want to be around me in general, i’m just usually that last thought, the one that everyone feels pity for cause i’m always alone. all i do now is just work and go home, i don’t really have a life anymore. school helped with hiding that i’m just a boring person. i don’t really bring much entertainment when i hangout with people. that’s also why i don’t have anyone, cause i’m just simply a boring person. people want someone that can bring adventure into their life, i can’t. i’m just so painfully single, that i just crave the simple things that relationships have, like holding hands and just being around someone that you could hold. things that are just taken for granted. i would become a simp for someone if i could just have that. i’m just a embarrassing hopeless romantic that has no experience in anything. it’s obvious that no one wants me, i’ve shot my shot once or twice and they’ve just failed epically. people don’t want me. i have too many problems. i’m very clinging without even realizing that. and i know people don’t want someone who’s clingy really early in a relationship. i don’t mean to be, i just don’t know how else to show that i’m interested. and i have no clue how to flirt or be “seductive”. and since i don’t know how to do that, i just try to be direct and blunt, but that also doesn’t work. so i really just don’t know how to do any of this. i even tried tinder, but i’m just intimidated. that didn’t work because i didn’t want people to think i’m boring, or get confused when i have no idea what i’m doing. and the fact that i haven’t ever even been on a date would just be pathetic. and i have no clue on how to read clues and tell if the other person cares. i just have that mentality that if someone wants to text me, they’d be interested in talking to me. but after learning the hard way, that is very much not true. every time i’ve tired it’s always been one-sided. i always feel embarrassed when i think about how hard i tried when the feelings were never reciprocated. it was probably all a joke anyways, them thinking it’s be funny to watch me fail. cause the joke is me thinking i’d be good enough for anyone. i just don’t understand how any of this stuff works, by my age i should’ve already had some experience, but i’ve had absolutely none, and no one wants to try to show me how things are supposed to be. i know if i just change a lot of things then i could possibly be someone’s last choice. i would just have to change the the way i look, which will be me just having to deal with a ugly face after i lose weight. i have to change my personality cause no one wants someone that’s constantly sad and have random bursts of energy. that’ll probably be the hardest one, but i know i can just fake it, and i won’t ever talk about how i just got so many issues with me. no one wants to date someone that’s problematic. and if worst comes to worst i’ll just give up. cause there will only be so many times i can let myself be disappointed. i’ll just be alone, i’ll probably just seclude myself from others, cause i don’t think i’ll be able to watch all my friends, if i will even have any, do good and be successful. i’ll just work and make money and be by myself. and unfortunately that looks like that’ll be the likely option anyways. i can only realistically see myself be alone. and i mean i can imagine be being with someone, but it’s just so unlikely that i don’t like to picture it. i only imagine that kind of stuff when i am trying to sleep, cause waking in the middle of the night being sad is just as rough as crying yourself to sleep. and on that topic i can’t even stay awake late anymore cause i just become so depressed and just sob. which just sucks cause the friends i have they all are night  people. and they also don’t have a job so i just disappoint them all the time when i have work. and they’ve all recently gotten into drinking and smoking and i can’t do any of that cause i have a professional job, so i’m just like the only sober person. which means automatically the boring one, and it’s not like i have a good personality to make up for it either. i’m just not the fun person anymore, never was to begin with. just the person everyone feels sorry, if they even care. very soon all my friends are leaving to college and very soon there is going to be the last day i hang out with any of them, most likely, ever again. i just know i’m going to be forgotten and ignored once they all leave. cause as i said before, i don’t have anything to offer, other than money, and i don’t have a good personality. all i will be doing soon is just working and staying home. there will be no more spontaneous hang outs, or late night talks. because they’ll all find new friends and friend groups and relationships, and i won’t know any of them, so i’ll just be replaced pretty quickly. and no one would keep in contact with someone who isn’t doing much with their life anymore. i’ll have no one and i can’t do nothing about it. i’m just surprised that i’ve had friends that have been with me this long. and even if i were to somehow date someone, there would be no one to introduce him too, i won’t have any friends, and i don’t care about my family’s opinion. but he’d probably think i would get attached quickly cause i won’t have no one to hang out with. once any guy in general learned that i don’t have friends, there will be no chance for me. i’d lose any chance i have because i’m just not good enough for anyone.
i’m also just not feminine enough for anyone. i have to many masculine traits to where i’m just seen as one of the guys. my voice is just way too deep for someone’s who a girl. i feel as if i acted a lot more girly and looked the part too, i’d have a better chance. i see how other girls act around guys and they just have like a natural way on how to talk to people. and i feel as if i missed out on how to do that. i think if i just knew how to look more girly and could pull off more feminine ways to act i could have the chance. but even then, that’s just a bit if. it sucks that this is all just pointless and a waste of time cause it’ll never happen for me, but sometimes i just hope that i can at least get one chance to be able to do everything i wanted. but maybe it’s good that i don’t have any experience in any of this. cause. you can’t miss something you haven’t experienced. it was like when i was talking to a guy for the first time. i never knew what it was like and i was fine, but even since then i just miss it and have realized more so now that i am not very good at any of it. simply it’s just ignorance is bliss. if i don’t ever experience it, than i won’t know what i will be missing out on."
lonely,I don’t understand why nobody likes me back.,"I don’t understand why nobody likes me back. - I’m 18 years old, so I’m sure some people will say I have my whole life ahead of me. Which if you did say that, you are absolutely correct. But in a world where if you have little sexual experience or relationship experience, its difficult. I had some things happen to me when I was younger that impact the way I see my relationships now. I believe this plays a part in the way I approach romance, but I don’t understand why people don’t like me back when I don’t act different on the outside. My friends would say I’m fairly attractive physically and I have a very enticing personality. I’m told I’m funny, have fantastic hair, and I’m very kind (not trying to brag, this is what I am told often by friends).  But I still can’t seem to like someone who likes me back. It feels as though I always end up liking people that are too good for me or I like people that I don’t deserve. Everyone I’ve liked hasn’t ever given me a chance to date them or even returned the feelings I had. I don’t know what I am doing wrong. I don’t expect my soulmate to pop out of nowhere or someone that is supposed to be like my prince charming to come and rescue me. I just wish someone would come along and show me that I can be loved that way and that I’m not hopeless. I hope you guys are doing ok today. Valentines day always hits me hard."

Like an outdated software version on the latest hardware. I can function just enough that nobody sees how bad it is. But nothing ever works quite right.  

There’s a feeling of intense loneliness that goes with these. Most of the time, even when taking to people I care about, I still feel alone. I feel like nobody ever really sees *me*. Occasionally I find someone who is almost there, but they either don’t stick around, they don’t want to be friends, or they change. I really don’t have many friends anyway. It’s pathetic."

lonely,Finding it hard to cope with isolation - don’t see anyone but my family,"Finding it hard to cope with isolation - don’t see anyone but my family - I have been quite isolated since graduating university. I have never been as isolated as I am now though. I don’t see anyone outside my family at all. Only via zoom once a week and those people aren’t my friends.

Prior to the pandemic, we had people who’d visit our house on a weekly basis. We visited some family members too. I also tutored on occasion, so all of that provided me with an opportunity to socialise with other people. 

Then the pandemic came, the visits stopped, we stopped visiting people. I got used to this for a while. I then got a job which mean’t I was around people.

The job ended and now I am stuck at home. I don’t see or talk to anyone, as I said a part from zoom once a week. My sister comes home and sits in bed all afternoon (I don’t know what’s wrong with her), she doesn’t bother with us anymore. So it’s just my parents and I am kind tired of this.

I love my family but I need to talk to other people and I don’t have anyone at all. It’s feeling really suffocating to be in this situation, it is not normal as a human being.

 I want to meet other people but there’s absolutely no way to do this. All of the people I used to talk to, I haven’t seen in ages so it would not work to contact them.

I don’t know how to get out of this. My mental health is really bad. At night, I sit up, tossing and turning, worrying about my life.

I am really concerned about myself. If I will ever have friends/social life or a partner. I don’t want to be this isolated anymore.

lonely,"Can true, long-lasting friendships really be made online?","Can true, long-lasting friendships really be made online? - Whenever I see a post about someone lamenting about suffering from loneliness or isolation (as a college student, I see this alarmingly often), there's always a couple comments asking OP if they want to be friends. As kind of a gesture as it is, I always find myself feeling REALLY skeptical if anything ever comes from the invitation. When I think of a friend, I don't think of someone I hold a short conversation with and then promptly forget about, I think of someone who I talk to on a **routine** basis, not out of obligation or politeness but simply because I genuinely enjoy talking to them over being alone. As simple as that sounds, it's turned out to be an astoundingly high bar.   


I'm beginning to think that the concept of developing friendships/relationships solely through an online platform is simply an **impossible concept**  


A bit of my background: I'm a college student with painfully few friends in the real world, and the ones that I do have don't fully sate my desire for meaningful social interaction (otherwise I wouldn't be here posting this stupid tirade). I'm a STEM major with fairly standard interests like gaming, technology, electronic music, photography, aka nothing particularly standout from most people in my demographic. You'd think having such a generic profile would mean wider compatibility but that's simply not been the case. For whatever reason, I simply didn't click with others for whatever reason.  


Around three years ago, I started to consider the use of social/dating apps. This idea really fascinated me, because ideally it would allow me to quickly find and talk to people with mutual interests. Kind of like what Omegle, but without the rampant sexual harassment. Sounds ez peezy, huh? As most of you reading this have probably experienced, most matches fizzle out within the first two or three days, and some might make it past the first week before the other person (or you) inevitably loses interest and moves on. At some point the appeal of talking with a new person just wears off and if a strong emotional connection hasn't been established by then, continuing the conversation starts to feel more like a chore than anything else.   


This is a recurring pattern that I've noticed: I'll find someone, have a decent conversation the first day, and I'll get their social media (I don't ask them for it, I wait for them to provide it to me to know that they're interested in carrying things further). When I message them the next day, they'll seem noticeably less invested for whatever reason (longer delay between messages, one or two word replies, etc). I ask a question and they respond but never inquire any further or ask one of their own. I'll dig a little harder, change the topic, and think of another question and again they'll respond but won't add anything to the table, demonstrating a complete lack of interest in keeping the conversation going. At this point it starts feeling more like an interrogation than a conversation, so I stop messaging and more often than not I never hear back from them. I remove them, find someone else, rinse and repeat. I don't find these interactions to be very satisfying, and I doubt anyone else does either. This brings me back to my main point: without a consistent routine and physical proximity to bring people together, I just don't think an online medium can provide the type of bonding required for two people to **truly** become friends, even if they happen to share common interests or experiences. At best, it's a series of friendly exchanges before the initial appeal wears off and someone gets bored and moves on.  


I'm three years deep in this mess and I still feel just as isolated and lonely as ever, if not more than I did at the start. Literally nobody has stuck around for the long run after hundreds of matches (both male and female) and thousands of hours invested in conversations and holy fuck if that isn't depressing than I don't know what is. Is this a common experience or am I really just that incompatible/insatiable/incorrigible? I don't want to live the rest of my life with the overwhelming weight of perpetual isolation and loneliness on my shoulders."
lonely,So used to people flaking out on me that I feel like I should get a dog only because a dog won’t bail on plans.,"So used to people flaking out on me that I feel like I should get a dog only because a dog won’t bail on plans. - So a “friend” of mine suggested that we get coffee. I’m like ok, then they said they would text me today and let me know when and where. I had a gut feeling that they were going to bail. I didn’t even get excited about the possibility of getting a chance to hang out with someone for the first time in months because I’m so used to people flaking out. 

Guess what?

My “friend” texted me this morning and said they couldn’t hang out because they didn’t feel well. I was hurt by it, but I didn’t even respond to their text. I just left it on read and thought to myself that I would be better off getting a dog to hang out with only because a dog won’t bail on plans like people do. 

Good thing I didn’t get my hopes up about this. If they mention it, I may just tell them not to worry about it because after flaking out on me the last few times you wanted to hang out, it’s clear you really don’t want to hang out. Just don’t worry about it and don’t bother making plans with me unless you for sure can make it. Otherwise don’t even mention it. I struggle with loneliness and depression enough as it is. People flaking out just makes it worse. 

I just wish people would just not make plans to hangout with me if they’re going to bail rather than lead me on. If you don’t want to hang out with me, just don’t even mention wanting to hang out. Just tell me you don’t want to hang out and leave it at that."

There isn't enough to talk about, not enough activities to do one another, no shared understanding or passion. And I'm not just talking about activities, but like, values and beliefs as well. A lot of these things go hand in hand and I just can't ever get along with any girls enough to ""be myself"" around them. If I ""be myself"" then they just lose interest and get bored of me because I'm just a guy interested in guy things. 

Ultimately I want to experience affection intimacy and love with a girl but I just don't get how to find any I can get along with in any real way. It feels like I just get along so much more easily with fellow guys. Honestly it makes me wish I was just gay or something, but I'm not. I've tried thinking about it but I just don't feel sexual attraction towards other guys. I can try to ""expand my interests"" and try liking things girls are into but I dunno, it doesn't change the fact that it doesn't seem like any girl I meet will ever be into the things I like too. 

Is it possible to have an intimate romantic relationship with a girl you don't share **ANY** interests or hobbies with? What are you even supposed to talk about or do together?? I don't get it."

lonely,Does anyone else feel out of place in online communities?,"Does anyone else feel out of place in online communities? - I try to be involved with various discords and reddits and youtube comments online based on different topics but i feel so different compared to everyone else. Other people online feel so much more expressive and emotive and can easily share their opinions and have tons of people agree with them where as i rarely feel like i can genuinely agree, and my comments or replies never seem to get any recognition or sometimes even get downvoted even if i don't think it's controversial.   


It feels like other people online easily make friends with each other. I've been in new and old communities and there always seems to be a lot of people who recognise each other and act like friends like real life friends would. That is very hard to approach and get involved in for me.   


I just want to know if anyone else feels like this."

I guess my so-called friends were fake because all of them disappeared. To make things worse my best friend got a boyfriend and we don’t hangout anymore. my friend invited me to tan at her house on Saturday, and she told me about a plan to go out the next day for Valentine’s Day, but she went out without telling me, and I’ve spent valentines alone with my Chihuahua. She totally ditched me, and the social media post’s give me fomo. I’ve come to realize that my fake friends don’t like me because I am narcissistic, and only care about myself. I’ve been crying for seven hours on and off, i’m thinking about quitting friendships and instead getting on tinder or grinder to have a hot hot boy spring. Any advice? I’m feeling very low, my moms a therapist and she told me that your lowest points make you appreciate your highest points. I realized I’m really not a narcissistic person, I just rub people the wrong way. I put on a persona And I don’t know how to turn it off. I have zero friends now but my Chihuahua. Any advice?"
lonely,For some weird reason I've never had a happy valentine,"For some weird reason I've never had a happy valentine - It's like the whole universe doesn't want me to have a happy valentine. Here is my history:

2010 my bf back then cheated on me a few weeks before valentine's.
2011 my second bf cheated on me a few days before valentines.
2012 - 2013 no bf 
2014 my third bf and I were living in different cities, so we didn't spend that day together, and it broke my heart. We broke up a few months later. 
2015 my 4th bf cheated on me one month before valentine's.
2016 - 2017 no bf
2018 my 5th bf left me for someone else one month before valentine's.
2019 - 2021 no bf.

For me valentine's day is filled with sad unhappy memories and bad luck. I wish this day didn't exist.

 2009 valentine's day was the only valentine that had any sort of happiness, and only because I had a gift exchange with some friends. But at that time I was miserable because I'd never had a bf. :("

I've never opened up to anyone before, if I could feel the pain I'm in I think I'd just end it, my life's going no where Ive resorted to being a hardcore drug addict just to try to escape my problems and I just don't have no motivation or energy to attempt to do anything else that go to work every day in my endless hell of an life.

I spent most of my youth escaping the ""pointlessness"" of my life and instead of feeling liberated, this valentines day has just left me feeling utterly empty and devoid of meaning. I understand that I chose this for myself but I still feel like I fucked up. What would have been if I had just convinced myself to try? Would I be happy? Would I atleast have someone to lean upon and feel like tomorrow is worth fighting for? I don't know. But I honestly wish I had given myself a chance.

If there was a button I could press where I'd just stop existing, disappear out if this world Id fucking press it. Schools painful hearing all the voices and laughter, seeing all the hugs and shit. I just want to disappear into an abyss. I fucking hate life as I am right now.

I have hobbies and friends and stuff don’t get me wrong I don’t just focus on this all the time. I take good care of myself I also live on my own

I'm a feminist. Essentially, I'm, in theory, husband material. Honestly. All my life, no one ever felt the need to touch me, to kiss me, to hug me passionately. Recently, a boy have me some attention and I fell hard, but he took it away because he's ""straight"". He is the only person that ever showed me love. No one else, not a single person ever flirted with me, I've never been told I'm hot in that way (I get frequent compliments about my face and beard and legs, but no one whispers about me to their friends). Every day, I am perceived as a genius, my teachers and peers have called me talented,  brilliant, intelligent and I was called the smarted kid in school three times. All of these compliments, everything that people tell me I am, it's making me feel like an exhibit, like something to be regarded from afar, like some golden boy everyone admires, but no one can touch. All I want in life is to be touched and told ""I love you"". Seriously, I don't know how much more of this pain and loneliness I can take.

I did my usual thing, played some Fallout, watched a little youtube, ""made"" some ""tasty"" dinner(ok I microwaved ramen, don't @ me). Was it a lonely day? Sure, they almost all are. Was it a *bad* day though? Not particularly.

I'll be honest, I've all but given up on even looking for a partner anymore, between one of my big insecurities, my personality in general(I genuinely am starting to think people more often than not just simply don't like me), and being the fun combination of a cripplingly socially anxious, highly submissive guy, finding someone who is open to that all isn't gonna happen. I had a nice day though, I kept myself happy, even through the loneliness. 

Not sure if this sounds ""pity post"" or not, but I don't want it to. More just wishing everyone here well, and that even with today being what it is, I hope you were able to find a way to keep occupied and scrounge up at least a bit of enjoyment. I do hope you all are able to either find happiness even through the loneliness, or find someone who helps you find that happiness, and more importantly, that today was an ok day for you &lt;3"

lonely,Being single your whole life is just a fucking vicious cycle.,"Being single your whole life is just a fucking vicious cycle. - 18, never had a girlfriend. Only relations I’ve had was a hookup on tinder then I went and lost my virginity to a hooker a week later. 

I recently went out on a date with a girl I actually really liked and had a lot in common with. The realization that I actually had a chance with this girl and I may finally have someone caused me to be nervous (apparently noticeably since she literally pointed it out). And it fucked me over in the end, got ghosted afterwards. 

It’s just a cycle that keeps me single. I haven’t ever had a gf so when someone I’m interested in comes along it becomes a huge deal in my head and I don’t want to fuck it up so badly that I fuck it up.

I know the obvious solution is to just not care about the outcomes or what they think of you ,but that’s a lot easier said than done when your chance is right in front of your face. 

I’ve almost texted this girl again to try and recover but that just makes me seem more desperate. Last convo I had was the day after, said it was fun and we should hangout again, she agreed gave an excuse as to why she may or may not be able to over the next week and went ghost from there. It’s been a few weeks since then, do y’all think I should try just asking what’s up one more time? Idk what I rlly have to lose

I just graduated and I can no longer escape the void of my existence. Until now, I could always feel somewhat alive by holding on to my responsibilities, to my ex, or even these last weeks to my hobbies. 

But isolation has taken a toll on my mental state. I dread coming back home because I can no longer escape myself. I'm in a great place in my life right now. I got a job in my field, I have flourished as a person, I got no money problems, etc. I'm lucky like my parents like to remind me. But none of that matters right now. I feel so devoid of emotion. I care about no one, about nothing. If I could spend my whole day asleep until I could go back to work, I would. I on the verge of feeding myself sleep pills to avoid facing the loneliness that eats my sanity away. I know, it's hard for everyone and I just gotta wait a little longer before the pandemic goes away but I feel like I've been waiting for my whole life already for something to happen and nothing helps. Nothing brings me joy. Drugs managed to make me feel some sort of comfort and euphoria that I haven't felt in ages, maybe ever. They're just an escape and I don't rely on them to be frank but to know how far I am from feeling this way naturally makes me wonder if it's worth it. People care about me, They said that and they probably mean it. I hear it but I don't feel it. It's like reading a book without being able to process the weight of the words. This must be what dysphoria feels like. I want to feel good. I want to feel passionated and motivated again. I love to learn and improve, why can't I do that anymore? Why can't I do the things that used to make me happy? Is it commitment? I doubt it. There's something much bigger than this. It's like if I rejected this whole reality. I only live through this screen. This virtual world stole me from all my naivety. Nothing feels new. It feels like I've seen everything and that I'm stuck in this endless meaningless loop until i die. They say man up. It'll pass. I really hope so. It's been too long. I need to save myself fast.

lonely,To the friend who pretends he doesn’t know me,"To the friend who pretends he doesn’t know me - I don’t know what I did. I don’t know why you don’t talk to me anymore but it hurts. I know we were just online friends but the friendship was real. It started with me just following a  page (which was you) and some funny messages taking the piss out of bands and each other, then every time one of us got high or drunk it become a ritual to text each other funny shit and the friendship blossomed and for 9 months of non stop chatting, late night and early mornings we shared, vented, comforted and bantered with each other. The only thing that was missing from the friendship was to meet in person but living continents apart made it impossible but it was the kind of friendship that made distance feel like it was nothing. Then you started to get busy with school and got back into your schedule and routine and the chats went from everyday to every 2nd/3rd day. It was cool I understood, I’m not a clingy person and I knew a friendship born in the abnormal conditions of quarantine would need to adjust to when the things slowly got back to normal. So I just thought it was that. It started getting sparser towards Christmas and I understood since it was the holidays. The holidays came and went and it fluctuated, the consistency seemed forced on your end, like you were replying to me just to reply, like our friend was a chore to you and I was an errand on the list. Everytime I tried to ask if you’re okay you said you were fine. I remember when you used to actually tell me what was wrong instead of sending me formalities for the sake of it. I remember when you would actually initiate convos and be so excited to speak to me, when you’d double text me the details of your day and tag me in memes and funny videos and talk about nothing just to talk to me. 

And so I wanted to see if you’d care enough to reach out if I stopped initiating all the convos since it seemed for the past month it was just me in this friendship. So I stopped initiating, it’s been over a week and you haven’t sent anything. I get it, people get busy and you could just be overwhelmed with life on your end and based on what you’ve previously shared with me I know it’s not always easy for you. 

But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt, I was so happy with this friendship - as someone who only clicks with a few people when I find those I spark with easy, it’s hard to Let go or to pretend like we didn’t get along like a house on fire. Instantly, quickly, fast friends. It didn’t feel like a forced online friendship but like a fated friendship. But I’m not gonna push you, it’s not just style, I know when I’m not wanted, I don’t cling, I’m not gonna beg or anything. It hurts to know you don’t care to reach out, that a once really awesome friendship has to come to this. Your tone changed, it’s cold and distant, so I know you don’t care anymore. I’m left feeling like I’ve been used even tho our friendship was built on reciprocation.

Just once I’d like for a friendship like this to last and for me to mean to them as much they mean to me. I’ve been strong this week, feeling nothing at all. Then It hits and I feel everything again."

lonely,A smile made me kind of sad,"A smile made me kind of sad - Today I saw probably the cutest girl I’ve ever seen in my life. It was at work (I’m a delivery boy at a sushi restaurant), I was coming back to the restaurant after I finished my delivery. Coming up some stairs there she was, standing outside waiting for her food to be done for pickup. I was frozen for a second. When she saw me, she gave me the warmest smile. No one has ever smiled at me that way before.
After I had picked up some more deliveries, right as I opened the door I saw her again. She didn’t see me at first, but when she did, she gave me that beautiful smile again. It wasn’t an awkward smile like most people do, it was a genuine warm smile. I really wanted to talk to her, but I had to deliver the goods quickly (it was a very busy day). 
She has left a huge impression on me, she has really made my day, but at the same time it made me sad. Why? Because I will probably never see her again, unless she comes back to buy more sushi.
I haven’t had a crush in years, but I think I do now even though I don’t know anything about this girl...

lonely,Introduction and question about stigma,"Introduction and question about stigma - Hello everyone, I want to give a little context first:

I (22M) never had a girlfriend in my life, I only had like a couple of Tinder one night hookups. I think  this is because in the last 4 years I've experienced social anxiety and depression that became worse due to a lot of very hard family situations (parents divorce after years of toxicness) I've been facing for the last years as well as for some personal failures as flunking out of college and spending too much time unemployed. I engage in mild weed abuse. (Is legal in my area)

Almost two years ago I hit a new rockbottom during a hard time for all my family and decided to get help. Went to therapy for 8 months and started to get better, I passed a pending exam from college and landed a phone support job. I left the treatment halfway due to schedule issues with my job, both me and my therapist felt this was right because I was progressing a lot.

That was almost a year ago. 2020 was a good and bad year for me. On the bright side I was very lucky to settle in this job and be able to work from home during the pandemic. It gives me stability and the opportunity to feel a little valued as well. On the bad side a year of being almost locked down took its turn on me as well as for all (but i know i am lucky to be able to protect myself and my family this way). Had huge confrontation with my father after years of bad blood.

Now:

After a few months of self abandonment I decided to move on again. Even though I am not as half as bad I was the first time I'm returning to therapy, Feel like its is going to be good for me do the remaining sessions of the treatment. I will pickup college courses again as well.

I think i had a very long and deep process of introspection and self-improvement and feel less afraid about the idea of emotional and physical intimacy.

However it still makes me nervous think of the moment that I have to tell the truth about not having any previous relationships. Feel afraid that the other person will think I'm a creep, and I understand why they would think that:

Seeing subs like r/niceguys and other expressions of the online incel culture makes me want to vomit. During my whole adult life I have suffered because women wouldn't date me but always had clear that it is me that have personal self-esteem and socialization issues that I need to work out and overcome for myself (luckily I have support from family/friends) and these issues are not an excuse to harass women or have misogynistic thoughts.

I think I'm nice by default to people in general, but I understand and respect people still have the right to reject me for any reason."
lonely,Why are parents shitty?,"Why are parents shitty? - I’m literally 30. How do I legit still allow my parents to get the best of me? I called my mother to tell her I watched a movie she asked me to watch and I just was telling her what I thought. She said “ooh I really regret that I didn’t sit and watch movies or have dinner at the table like a family. We really used to do that before you were born.” Well was it my fault somehow? This is definitely why I decided I will not raise a child. They’re always judging me, but claiming they aren’t. Then asking why I’m so damn up tight. Ehh whatever."

lonely,The worst Valentine’s Day so far,"The worst Valentine’s Day so far - When I was really young I looked forward to Valentine’s Day because I loved giving and receiving candy from friends. In my early to mid adolescence I still liked Valentine’s Day for the candy, would wear pink or red to be festive, and kinda liked seeing all the cute couples. It just made me happy to see everyone enjoy the holiday. Now I’m 20 and everything has gone to shit. Never been in a relationship before and with the way I am now I don’t see it happening anytime soon. I’ve been depressed for over a year now and I’ve felt extremely lonely at college, and today is just making those feelings worse. Seeing couples all over social media, seeing friends hanging out and posting each other, and I’m just here in my room alone and depressed. I don’t even feel like treating myself. I just feel so pathetic that this is what I’ve become, a bitter loner."
lonely,"If you feel lonely today, I'm sorry","If you feel lonely today, I'm sorry - I know things are hard for everyone, we all have our paths and the ways that we get to where we are right now. I feel a lot of things all of the time lately. Today I'm angry and frustrated, and it stigmas from sadness. The pain of not being where I want to be or having what I want to have. Thinking about how maybe I'm not even ready for it, like I have to be or I'll never be happy. Time goes by nonstop it never stops, we don't get a break or time to think without wasting more time. Sometimes I look back at things and just feel empty, like what the fuck am I doing? And people... you want them in your life, but how are you even suppose to know when someone is worth your time or not? I've wasted time on so many people, I just want to be happy. I don't even know how to describe it anymore. I don't think it's something anyone can give you... you find happiness within yourself and from the things in your life, what you're doing with it, and the direction that you're going. Still, I hate feeling alone. It scares me at the same time. Like what if I'm not able to live up to a high standard when I find that person who doesn't make me feel alone anymore, what if I become unhappy? Because I've been there... and I don't want to go through that again. I don't want to repeat a cycle like that. I want to be happy and content with one person, for a very, very long time. When I feel like I can be, it's not mutual. So what the fuck is going on? I'm trapped, nothing I can do about that except hope for better. Hopefully I get back on track and things just fall into place. I have hope for a better future."

In my 26 years on this earth I’ve never had a valentine. Unless you count grade school, I don’t because it was mandatory to give something to everyone.

I’d just like to be able to participate for once and not feel like I’m on the outside looking in. I’m a hopeless romantic at heart. It may not look like it because I’m a man, but I’d be overjoyed if I had someone to make a sappy social media post for to show her off to the world and plan a romantic date with.

“Maybe next year!”- I even have jokes."

lonely,I was very lonely in high school,"I was very lonely in high school - I’ve always found it difficult to socialize and put myself out there. In school I wasn’t the best at making friends, being part of a group or being that interesting to talk to. Even to this day I feel a bit introverted. 
I have a lot more confidence, abilities and likeminded people around me now than what I had in school but I still keep mostly to myself. 

I remember in school there was this friends circle and just to let you know, I did not feel like I was a part of this friends circle at all. They would form a standing circle in the halls during classes and I was always standing behind people in that circle like an outsider looking in. They would pretend I didn’t exist. 
Whenever I stood out in a group it was just people making fun of me and not taking me seriously. 

At lunch I’d go to the table most people in my class would sit at and some days, I’d get a good seat if I was early. But most days it’d be packed. I remembered specifically people moving over and giving a small bit of space for someone to sit but no one ever offered or even tried to offer me a seat. I mostly sat at the end of the bench or had to pull over a chair across the cafeteria.
The most embarrassing part was when everyone would finish their food and walk away but no one ever waited for me to finish my lunch. I was normally last at the table and I felt so embarrassed that my so called friends would walk away from me in front of everyone there. I would just take out my books and pretend to be studying. Sometimes I’d sneak into the art room to work on my project during lunch breaks. The same people didn’t even wait for me to get my books at the lockers. Great friends is all I have to say.

A lot of people I got to be friends with before high school all left to do Transition Year (TY) so I had to make the most out of the people who were in my year. This didn’t turn on well exactly.
I wasn’t often invited to Birthdays, house parties, night outs, etc. except for one time when one of my classmates invited me to his birthday. But I was only invited because he was trying to raise enough money for a school trip to Kenya. We normally wouldn’t talk much.

Physical Education also sucked because I was always picked last on a team and most people didn’t like having me on their teams. I wasn’t the best at sports but I felt so isolated when it came to PE class. If I was ever a school teacher I’d ban teaming up and I’d pick the teams myself honestly. 
In my final year I made a vlog about a trip to the zoo for Ecology and the video was mostly me and the camera, no one else seemed interested. I did the same thing before high school and people loved it when I would make a vlog. Those were the good days before loneliness kicked in.
Funny enough the people I spend the most time with (that I mostly just followed around) didn’t even remember my birthday or invite me to parties. So they were never really my friends which only made me feel even more lonely.

One day when I was walking home, one of the guys from the group of friends I would follow around said to me that: “no one in the group likes you. We don’t know why you keep following us around and you should go find another group of friends”. I do appreciate his honesty but he’s still a piece of s**t. I know that’s not 100% true because one person from that group (who I’m still friends with) was always considerate for me when nobody else was. His name was Kyle.
At graduation, when the ceremony was over, I saw all my classmates getting photos with one another and I don’t recall anyone in my year getting a picture with me. That summarizes how isolated I was from everyone else.

When it came to The Prom (Debs as we call it in Ireland) I didn’t go because I didn’t feel welcomed and I felt like no one cared if I went or not. When school ended I was feeling really angry about people in school that I just didn’t care anymore. A handful of people (including Kyle) reached out to me wondering why I didn’t go, and some offered to buy me a ticket and asked I could share a limo with them before the event. But my mental health wasn’t in the right place at the time. And how I felt in school didn’t help in the slightest.

I still feel down in the dumps when I see photos on social media of those I went to school with having fun at parties, going on holidays and spending time with one another. It’s a shame people never showed as much interest in me as I did in them.

I was never close friends with anyone in high school. The loneliness I experienced made me immune to it and I’ve no problem being with myself and working alone. A lot of people I got on well with in school  were from sports and other things not school related. If you thought school was rough, maybe my story here might help to make you feel better and more appreciative of those around you."

Loneliness hits hard around this time every year - another valentines alone and day later birthday with no friends to celebrate with. 
If you want to talk, share memes, music etc. just send a chat msg or something.


Now lets proceed with ranty stuff I just want to put out in to universe :)

My life as of now (continuation from old post, which I'll add below) broken in to personal, uni and career.

**Uni** - *I'll probably get kicked out again, for good this time. * Because of bureaucracy, procrastination and getting covid 4weeks ago. I got back this semester back to finish thesis. But there were problems. I was officially re enrolled in November, like in systems, mail etc. Since September uni is in lock down mode aka everything has to be on line. By the time I could do something almost every prof was full with students with thesises. So it took going through one of the Dean to get thesis supervisor. First online meeting was at 28.12. I started redoing my old thesis but at the end of the year didn't really had time. Then 1st week of 21 had to go on delegation to this site 5h away where I had 4 days of 12-16h between going out and getting back (no time and energy to do anything)
2nd week I mostly procrastinated and on weekend started to get symptoms of covid. By 20.01 I was laying in bed with fever 38-40°C bearly conscious. If it weren't for my parent's I'd probably dehydrate. I was like that till 28.02 when fever disappeared but changed to cough where I could only lay on side because everything else was ending with suffocating cough including talking for a week. Aaand we have February! My deadline is end of February or I'm getting kicked out of uni again! I don't know how to pull this one off but I have to. Otherwise I'm fucked

**Personal life** - *still alone, with neither friends or gf.*  Procrastination (or dopamine addiction) is at all high this year. My relationship with parents is about to hit rock bottom... well, basically same thing that happened with every relationship I had. Slowly distanced myself subconsciously. It took years with my parents but here I am. Tbh i don't even know how to bring any of it up. Once i had great close relationship with my parents but somewhere along the way it went whatever we have now. I'm still living with them.
Last time they brought it up and pushed me to talk, i just chocked.

**Career** - still working in same company. But since half of December I'm working locally. Nothing special happend. Just day to day routine. 



*Where do I start... around beginning of '18 I kinda finished uni classes, started internship aaaand went in to downhill of comfort zone. At first day to day was same. Then i woke up before new year '19 with most contact lost, random people, friends, most of family... connections kinda faded away.
Summer '19 was last chance to finish thesis and graduate. But downhill never stopped. Internship turned in zombie mode work. So I've quit to focus on finishing uni. Well... i didn't and got kicked out. Then started job hunt. Succeeded after 2 months of searching with entry level corpo job that basically required english B1 and high-school. It's November '19.
During corpo copy paste ""work"" I've been looking for a job in field. Got one stating march '20. Here i was hoping for ""new begging"" and getting my shit together. Guess what. Corona hit. After month of work got great news (like everyone else in company) -20% salary starting april. Aaand then company downgraded. Me having 3month contract... was an easy choice.
Summer '20 fun with searching for a job during pandemic. Yay me! Luckily got one starting august. In uni field and also got reenlisted to finish degree. Qh and work is monday-friday delegation. I'm going back to my parents place for weekend's.
So here I'm lost. With next to nothing going in life except time demanding job, music, some manga/webtoon, rare tv series and loneliness. Also some subpar photography.*"
lonely,just really quite sad and lonely,"just really quite sad and lonely - I feel extremely lonely and sad. I’ve felt like this for maybe... the last 4-5 years and unsurprisingly I don’t think lockdown has helped. My boyfriend is really my only solace, the poor soul listens to me and is so patient but he suggested I put something out on here as he says the people here are amazing 🥺 I don’t have many friends any more at all. I keep in touch with my closest ones from uni but we don’t live near each other and they’re busy with their lives. I’m only friends with one or two people from school, one of them is great and knows how I feel but she’s also got a lot going on in her life so I never want to burden her, I just want to be there for her too.. like she is for me. It upsets me that I struggle to make friends as I’d like to think I’m a good person. I was burnt pretty badly when I was a teenager when my best friend completely turned their back on me and started to join in on the bullying I had already been dealing with years prior and I still now never knew why they did that. This was someone who knew everything about me and that I was dealing with a lot at home with my parents. It was like a switch and I was left in the dark. This along with the bullying meant my self esteem was pretty non existent and I’ve carried that through to my adult life now. It’s hard to remind myself that I’m a good person when I don’t feel good in who I am and how I look combined with the feeling that no one wants to be my friend. It’s like I had a base level of how feeling pretty crappy and then a trap door opened up underneath me, I was plunged into a further darkness of depressive thoughts and there’s no ladder to climb back out. On top of that, I feel guilty for even feeling like this. I’m not where I thought I’d be or feel at 27 and my boyfriend kindly tells me I need to channel passion and drive to make myself happier, but I don’t even have that. Sometimes it’s a struggle to even brush my teeth and put proper clothes on for the day. I wish I could climb out of that hole and turn off my thoughts just so I could have a break, but it’s constant and exhausting. I’ll leave it there... maybe one of you has some words of advice for me. I could really just do with some friends. 😞"

lonely,Anyone got any ideas for numbing/distraction?,"Anyone got any ideas for numbing/distraction? - Spent a good while listening to music this morning then played video games for a while but got bored/frustrated because I kept dying. Now I'm smoking weed which numbs the pain and allows me to listen to music some more but idk what I'm gonna do after this. Maybe another game? 

Today is my day off. I'm starting to dislike having free time. At work I may feel physically strained, tired, or whatever - nothing awful but at least I don't feel like this. Sometimes the idea of a abusing harder drugs pops into my head but ik that if I do I probably won't stop. I mean I already use weed for this purpose. I don't typically smoke alone but here lately I just gotta. But there's typically always someone (roommate, friends, coworkers) around and there is always weed around. Haha, the munchies make for an excellent distraction too as I gorge myself on sugar. I'd sleep but I have work in the morning.

Any ideas?"

lonely,Thankful for this sub,"Thankful for this sub - Lately, it feels like everything in my life has been going into shambles and I feel like I can't do anything right. I've been feeling especially lonely and down lately for a multitude of reasons. I've lost count of them all. Today on a cold and rainy Valentine's day, the feelings are only more consuming than usual. Seeing all the couples, lovebirds, and friends makes me feel so inadequate and neglected.

However, seeing all the support and stories on this sub helps me find some solace in the fact that I am not going through this alone. Reading that you all are out there with your own lives, stories, and struggles makes me feel like I'm not in a sinking boat by myself and that makes me feel very appreciative to be human.

So, if you're out there on this sub feeling worthless and lonely, just know that your story/experiences have value and helped brighten this dark period of my life. Thank you and happy Valentine's Day.

\- A truly grateful Stranger"

Why can't I matter to them anymore. I miss them so much. What's wrong with me. Why am I so boring. Why am I so annoying. I hate myself. I can't focus on any of my uni work because I miss them so much. I haven't felt happy in weeks."

You must’ve received an anonymous call today afternoon, well I just wanted to hear your voice so I had to use the public phone. You sounded so happy, I wonder why I was gasping for air when I tried saying hello. Its been 2 weeks since you broke up and left me, I know people say time heals but for me it just keeps getting worse. 

PS: I will always love you. You said you dont need me and threw me away, with my broken soul I only wish to hear your voice and sleep forever. I cannot imagine what life is without you, no matter what I try to distract myself you are always there in everything and in every part of me."

Today she didn't even wish me properly valentines day like voice calling me or something like that saying she feels its a normal day nothing special ...and on top of that she sent me a snap showing some gifts she received. Feeling more depressed and upset dont even know how badly it hurts to express my feelings...
I know I'm stupid to be in relationship like this but I can't even leave her I don't have guts to face my situation if we are separated. I simply am stuck in her having no courage to leave her..

I quite literally never had friends. I constantly meet strangers who promise me they'll be my friends, but guess what. A day passes and they forget about my existence. This loneliness was quite damaging my mental state, so I was always negative about it. But I still remember peers telling me this cliche thing some of you might of heard. ""Don't worry, when you'll grow up you'll find some"". I was first taught this during 6 or so years and then every year there was 0 results. In some cases I even tried. Yet obviously, no results shown. And I've being growing up more and more. And people continuing to tell me this cliche. Sometimes I wonder, that I am gonna be a record holder as person who lived their entire life without a single real-life or even an internet friend."

I tried going on these needafriend subreddits in hopes to make some friends to feel less lonely but i don't think that worked cuz well people just love ghosting me (except for one) and i hated how sad and lonely i felt all the time and all of a sudden i decided to rewatch this show ""Gilmore girls"" and idk what it is about this show but its so heart warming and its kind of making me feel less lonely and it makes me laugh.

Idk i just decided to share that with you guys, maybe you can try watching it, it's pretty funny so at least you'll get to laugh a little :')"
lonely,"Alone and ignored, this day makes it worse","Alone and ignored, this day makes it worse - I wish there'd be a day when I'm not ignored or laughed at by women for trying to talk to me.

I get used, led on and rejected. Too dumb to even realize what's going on and learn from my mistakes.

Why am I so naive and still have hope that it will be different one day? That's clearly not happening yet I still can't stop. I guess I'll enjoy being hurt by know. Can it become an addiction?"
lonely,Never had a girlfriend at 22,"Never had a girlfriend at 22 - 
I’ve never had a girlfriend at 22, for many reasons, but it’s something that’s causing me a lot of worry and I just can’t shake the feeling. I have a bit of a disjointed family, we don’t have a lot of money relative to the people I surround myself with and it’s something I’m quite secretive and embarrassed about. This is probably the main reason I haven’t pursued a lengthy relationship as I feel that when people see what I come from and my situation it will turn people off me. I’ve always received a fair amount of attention from girls but I never pursue anything further. Has anyone else ever found themselves in a similar situation?"
lonely,This year Valentines' makes me want to end it all,"This year Valentines' makes me want to end it all - I hate Feb 14th every single year, but last year I came *this* close to ending my life because of my loneliness. 

Not only is living alone during the pandemic driving me nuts but a string of events caused me to lose two of my closest friends. One of them was someone I had a crush on for FOUR years and close to my birthday he told me he was dating our classmate. Because of my depression I started self harming badly to cope with my pain, and after gathering the strength to tell my other closest friend, he instead turned against me and we have not spoken for over 6 months.

Today feels like a hammer to the face, mocking me not only for losing my crush to another person and having to watch them be happy on instagram but also not having my other friend to at least be less alone with.

I hate myself."

Had a good relationship for a year then my girl cheated on me , she came back I forgave her she left me again and when she came to me for the third time she told me that whenever she is with me she feels something is missing and i'm not enough for her . Been insecure every single about how I look , talk and work . I doubt myself everyday and I fear of not being good enough for things . I got some friends in the internet and they used to be good with me until now as they ghost me , leave me on read or act like they are annoyed with me . Even though I  try my best to be good with everyone and limit myself it ends up hurting myself . You can say that I am choosing wrong people in my life but that's not the thing cause from around 20-30 friends no one lasted with me . About parents , we are asians and there's not so much mental health kind of thingy for them , they think I am acting and should act like a man . Sorry for my English :(( but I would appreciate if someone  would talk to me thanks &lt;3"

lonely,Can you talk about my problem?,"Can you talk about my problem? - I worry that I may have made a rushed, promise to Gods that I wont bother myself with a certain compulsion again and asked for punishment in case breaking it, in order to use the fear of the punishment to force myself stop worrying about that compulsion.

I cant remember making a promise. Maybe they were just, intrusive thoughts but what if it was a real prayer about a promise that I forgot?

I worry because I tried to remember if I made such a promise and I worry that by thinking about it, I may have broken that forgotten promise, just, because my words could have been that I will never bother myself with that compulsion again. I may have made the promise to force myself stop doing or thinking about doing the compulsion.

If in case there is such a promise, did I broke it because I thought about this matter?"

I’m drug, alcohol, any addiction, and drama free guy. I’m a good listener and very accepting. I am employed in a career that I love. I like meeting people and having conversations or random outings anywhere. 
Last night I ran out to the store and saw a local woman in her 80s leaving and walking home. It was -15 degrees so I stopped and asked her if she needed a ride. I’ve given her rides before so it’s not creepy. I just felt good knowing I helped her a little. It was nice to have a connection for a few minutes.
I know my life could be a lot worse. I’m just lonely.

I don’t know how to meet new people and I’ve basically pushed all my friends away. I’ve spent the last month alone besides helping my cousin with something for the day.

lonely,Am I cursed or am I crazy?,"Am I cursed or am I crazy? - I feel crazy. This feels crazy. I'm so lonely. I know it. I feel it. Every second of every day. I sometimes go months without physically seeing or interacting with people. Lockdown was almost like a reprieve from making excuses. It was a normal year for me. I go through days of intense emotional despair. I cry and I hurt and I lament the loneliness and I beg for it to end. All I want is for it to end.

Then people call. Or I meet a person and suddenly I'm running again. I lock myself in. Don't answer the phone until they give up. And then I go into the cycle again. Most days I'm convinced I'm better alone. That people exhaust me. I go to therapy every week and it makes no difference. Moments in time perhaps but I always end up here. It's like a curse. A punishment. What's worse is when I do engage with people I do it well. I inspire, motivate, educate. People laugh. I laugh. The second I'm on my way home it's done. I feel so tired inside.

Every day isn't bad. I'm great by myself and I have a dog. But there are days like this where I see it almost from the outside and it just makes me ask myself ""is it me? Am I crazy? Or is this a punishment, a curse""
Sigh...."

I keep running in circles trying fo get over her and then wanting to be with her again. What I want is to be loved and accepted. I valued being in a relationship. I don't cheap, meaningless sex. In fact, I don't think I can really enjoy sex unless I have a strong emotional connection with someone. 

I'm so tired of being alone. Four years and counting of loneliness is driving me insane. If I can't be with me ex I want to stop missing her. I want to stop thinking about her and I want to meet someone who will appreciate me for who I am. I want to love and support someone. 

I just dont know what to do to make things change."
lonely,sometimes i wonder how my life would've been if someone had come to help me,"sometimes i wonder how my life would've been if someone had come to help me - maybe now i'd have a best friend or a boyfriend, someone that cared about me unconditionally, and i'd care about him too...

no one ever liked me in school, they told everyone to not talk to me...so, i was always alone...but i wonder how my life would've been if someone had just came and talked to me...be my friend

we would've gone to high school together...he would've defended me, and i would've defended him when he needed it

it would've been just us...but it'd be ok, it was always like that and that's not so bad

if we would've fallen in love that would've been just perfect cause now i'd have a boyfriend

my life would've been just...so much better

now i wouldn't be alone...i wouldn't be crying because im not good enough even if i try time and time again...i'd be enough...i wouldn't be alone, i'd have someone that cares about me, like everyone else has...i'd finally have someone that understands me and actually wants to be with me...i'd be enough...i wish i was enough...

i'd have someone that doesn't leave me after a while...someone that doesnt forget me if i dont speak first...i'd have someone to hug when i feel sad, or someone to celebrate when i acomplish something...

but no one ever came

i wish someone did...

i wish i knew what's wrong with me...why am i so unlovable...i just wish i could fix it already...then i'd finally have someone and i wouldnt feel horrible everyday...i'd be happy like everyone else

i just wanna be happy too"

lonely,"A look back at my life - friends, being lonely, and feeling like an unlucky loser.","A look back at my life - friends, being lonely, and feeling like an unlucky loser. - I'm tired of everything and I need to vent somewhere, so here I am. Despite the fact I'm writing this today, it won't be about Valentine's Day in particular (though it isn't helping if I had to be honest), I just kinda want to get this out of me here so I won't have to worry a few people that might slightly care for me. Not sure if I'll delete this account after this or not, we'll see.

Ever since I was a kid I've had trouble making friends. I was shy and quiet most of the time, and I guess maybe considered different because of it. I'd usually just keep to myself. As I got older ai became a bit more outgoing, I'd sometimes go outside and play with a group of boys my age. It was fun, of course, but I wouldn't say I had a strong bond with anybody, though I guess that's not something you really think about as a kid, you just want to play and stuff. Same thing at school, though I'd talk to some of my classmates, which was pretty nice. I don't think I've ever met anyone who'd share my interests though. Sometime around that I made a really good friend, we lived in the same area and our parents knew eachother, so that's basically how we met. We soon became best friends, and I'd consider him my first true childhood friend. A couple years later, he started hanging out with some other kids, which was fine, but not long after he'd start ignoring me. This went on for quite a while before I gave up. I was lost and I didn't know what to do. Why? How could a friendship just end like that? Did I do something wrong? This was probably my first impactful experience as a kid in that regard. I wouldn't call it traumatic or anything, but it was sad enough to make me more shy and timid again. I wouldn't have any friends for a while after that, I was alone. I would talk to my classmates sometimes without any full conversations, and that's it. I'd consider myself ""the quiet kid"" at that time for sure. After I went to middle school I somehow got into a small circle of friends. We'd talk at school often and laugh together, we had a similar sense of humor and even some interests (a.k.a. stale memes, video games, cartoons, some anime, all that good stuff). We'd even talk after school, either through text on Facebook or voice chats sometimes. I didn't feel alone anymore, I finally felt like I fit somewhere. Unfortunately, after we finished middle school we didn't stay in contact. We just slowly drifted away from each other, which is understandable - new schools, people moving, different career choices - it just happens. I managed to stay in contact with one of them however, being the one living closest one to me. I probably got along best with him, mostly because we played the same video games, so we would spend more time together as compared to others. Finally, here's high school. I didn't make any new friends, everyone in my class already had their own friend circles, so I didn't really find anyone to talk to. There are a few classmates I've known from previous schools, which I would interact with sometimes, but that's it, just kinda sharing memes for laughs. Back to the guy - we managed to stay best friends, even though we went to different schools. We would hang out after classes sometimes, it was great. Sometime after, the pandemic started. Despite that our friendship was going even stronger than usual. Since we were stuck at home and school wasn't that much of a pain, we spent a lot of time playing video games and just talking through voice chat. Sometime after my first year at highschool, he suddenly started ignoring me. I instantly realized this was the same situation as I experienced in my childhood - someone suddenly ignoring me, without seemigly any reason. This was excruciating to me, it was happening again and I didn't know why. I tried to contact him countless times, with no luck. Sometimes I wish Covid was never a thing, maybe then I could've asked him what was wrong but alas, here we are. I'm angry with myself for not trying harder to find out why our friendship ended. I think I'm just cursed, or maybe I don't have luck with making real friends, I don't know. It just hurts to see how easily a friendship can end, no matter how much care you might put into it. Do people really not care about such things? I don't understand anything anymore. Sometimes when I look back at those times I just feel like a toy that's been thrown away and forgotten about, waiting to be picked up by someone else, only to be discarded in the future yet again. I'm just scared now, I feel like I'll always be completely alone in this world. I feel like I'll never find someone who really cares about me, let alone someone that could love me (hell, I've never even had a real conversation with a girl). I want someone to be there for me, someone that'd be glad to just talk to me, but at this point I don't even have any motivation left to try. I keep looking down on myself and I think I'm getting worse because of it all. The only amount of human interaction I've been getting is talking to my parents and with a few online friends I made. They've helped me through this sad time after I vented about everything to them, but nowaways I just pretend I'm fine. They're great people and I don't want to make them feel sorry or sad because me, because I'm afraid I might push them away because of that somehow. Besides, they should have their own problems to deal with, and I don't want to be one of them. 

That would be all, big thanks if you read all of that, you're great. I don't feel like I want any words of encouragement, advice or empathy, because I've probably heard them countless times before, but if you want to say anything to me don't hesitate, I just wanted to vent a bit. All I want to say after this is treasure what you have and fight for it before you lose it, and Happy Valentine's Day everyone."

lonely,For anyone feeling lonely today,"For anyone feeling lonely today - Please remember that while this 'holiday' can be sweet for some, you're not alone in your feelings. Unfortunately a holiday like today is a gigantic marketing scheme and like most things pushed upon society, doesn't work for everybody, doesn't apply to everybody and that doesn't mean you're unworthy, in the wrong, not enough, whatever it is you might be feeling. Today will pass. The best thing to do, for a lot of people, is to give yourself some self-care. Focus on treating yourself special if you're single. Remember the first step of being ready for a healthy loving relationship is loving yourself first. So use this as a chance to spoil yourself. Set aside time to eat your favorite food, be cozy, play your favorite game, go for a drive, a walk, play with a pet, spend the day doing the things that put your heart and mind at ease and make you feel good. Here's a hug if you like hugs, here are my attempt at words to hopefully help someone feel a little better today. Happy Valentines day from me to you. For whatever its worth&lt;3"

And this time it’s my fault, if I had kept my mouth shut and hadn’t let my paranoia get the best of me, maybe I’d be spending it with the girl I was hanging out with until a month ago."
lonely,Loneliness is Getting Harder Each Day,"Loneliness is Getting Harder Each Day - I’m having a hard time dealing with loneliness, I do see a therapist, but the weekends have been especially rough. It started 16 years ago in high school when my mom cut me off from all my friends to focus on school, I wasn’t doing too well grades wise and I was obedient so didn’t go against my parents. Growing up I was the happy talkative kid but overtime due to conditioning of isolation (not my choice), don’t have much joys in life. I’m not super awkward but I am quiet and reserved. My patients/coworkers think I’m funny and stuff. For 16 years all I have done is work, study, and sit in my room. I do videography as a hobby but that is dictated by a lot of variables (the need for subjects to shoot/settings/xyz). I had even joined a group of photographers/videographers but found my alone in those groups too since most people came with their own group of friends.

In 2019-2020, my dad got dementia, I lost my grandma and 2 aunts, and had a puppy who passed away. On my birthday it was announced that a promotion I applied for was given to someone else (only 2 people applied), someone hit my car in the parking garage, and I had a girl I was interested in end things. It’s been 7.5 months since I’ve seen someone socially, over the last year only 3 times did i have the chance to do something socially. 

I’m 30, I have my masters, working on my second masters at Johns Hopkins, and I also work in healthcare - point being for those things is I’m educated and financially stable. For appearances I’m not ugly, but not gifted in looks, but I’m pretty stylish and maintain myself. I am very caring, always been told I’m a good person, I listen to people, and I try to treat them with respect - my patients call me an angel/savior/xyz, yet I have never had anyone who would consider to reach out first. most of my texts are work related with the exception of 2 people, a couple who recently had a kid so are “further along in life” and understandably consumed with other priorities. I only have 80 contacts in my phone.

On my 30th birthday, 4 of my closest “friends” didn’t reach out when they knew I was struggling with a lot of life’s things - they know birthdays are a big deal to me cus that is the only day I cherish being selfish, 2 have birthdays a week after mine and the other I got a signed vinyl for their birthday two months prior so it was a slap in the face. The last 2 birthdays I’ve sat in my room alone.

I was the person who would be sending memes and stuff to everyone so it hurts to see no one considers me so I stopped. I don’t have friends around me to hang out with, I’ve never had a girlfriend (not even the fake ones in elementary school), I am no longer on dating apps as at one point paid for 8 apps and never got any matches and was starting to impact me. I even had a diverse group of coworkers look it over, males/females/young/old/single/married, and they all said “it looks good I’m shocked” I’m the only single person in my department and most of the time I get the excuse of “my significant other and I don’t do much anymore on the weekends” so I don’t hang out with them. 

I am truly scared that I am heading down the road of staying lonely for my whole life. I have no experience with girls, been on about 3 dates my whole life and always have gotten the “you’re a nice guy but didn’t feel a connection.” I haven’t even held hands with a girl. I am by no means perfect but I think I’m a very good choice, yet never have gotten a match on apps or the real opportunity to start a relationship. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I’m sure many won’t read this or anything but I needed a space to vent as I feel like no one understands me.

Thanks"

lonely,A day like any other,"A day like any other - I know it's cliche for a single person to post about loneliness on Valentine's Day, but here we go. This year feels different. I'm still painfully single and horribly lonely. As I sit here watching Frasier and grading papers, I can't help but think about my friends who've all coupled up. They're celebrating the love they've found and I'm still carrying on alone. 

And yet, this year I'm not as affected by the day as previously. I'm glad for my friends and wouldn't wish the loneliness I feel daily on any of them. Don't get me wrong I do wish I wasn't alone, but instead of today heightening the despair and fear of living and dying alone it's just passing like another day. 

So why am I still here, posting on today of all days. It's because I'm stunned by how unremarkable the day feels. Perhaps I'm becoming accustomed to the loneliness. Maybe this is a sign I'm finally becoming resigned to being alone. It doesn't hurt any less, but it also doesn't hurt any more. It's a day like any other."

lonely,Just a way to put down some thoughts about sh*t and love,"Just a way to put down some thoughts about sh*t and love - I have no-one to talk about this, no-one to share my pain and make her flow out of my mind/body 
so I will let some part of me here.. How pathetic, so egoistic.. F**k..

I've found love.. Again.. After thinking about leaving the dating app that I used lately, a surprisingly charming person msg me back. Some word at the start aof the conversation giving a feeling like a familiar echo. Then come a call, earing the voice and the laughing put the feeling to a very nice level. Then the meeting... Like the sensation of what is like to be with someone precious, someone who touch you at some metaphysical level, plus the physical attraction, someone who share some ethereal aspect of existence simply by letting my heart beating and my fingers touch her face.. Kissing and just being well in each other's arms out of space-time 
Appreciating the same feeling that life is giving us a cosmic alignment ahahah, strange feeling to hear your word from the pretty mouth of her😅 I'm in love again.. I'm so alive

Then after this very special moment, some text in the week, a call.. Then a Saturday very simple, going out to check some stuff, and have a little time to cuddle on the couch before returning with our lives..

But after that all is perfect right.. But nah.. I'm sensitive and passionate, a labyrinthic exponential mind with a special type of memory and an ''eternal lover's heart''
 I can't suppress some sentences she told me ...

about being tired of deception with dates, wanted someone to be with, no wanted to be mean but not wanted to be in a exclusive relationship and can't promise fidelity.. Not wanting to give hope... 
At this point we don't had sex.. I'm a little bit confused that she abord that in this way.. 
She seem to be confused and have some hard time in her life too... 

Well i can accept that, she must have the reason to say that and the reason to appreciate the time with me too...
 but a week later, we can't be together, she not have time.. I want to but these are her words ""frome Wednesday and for the week end, I'm not free"", not any response since Thursday.. I messaged her to saying that I don't wanted to be rude to her or be an arrasment trying not to be pathetic but saying that I want to see what lie ahead of us, but writing that I do not wanted to scare her by being too present or being judgemental, and tell her to write or call me when you want
And then there's no sign of her at the time..

What do you think of all theses crap?

Now I'm with these thoughts about her being in a intense sex week end... I feel every heartbeat like a crescent pain.. I can't let my brain out of these thoughts about her doing her life, with some possible sexy way to ""carpe diem"" and I can't make my heart shut up about her being someone I want to let my love live on... Cause I want to be with her so bad, on every possible way, not all the time.. 

I can take patience, some days or some weeks..
I can endure the fact that she want to live fully without the limit of ""classic"" relationship, and beyond the fact that I'm pretty hurt to imagine that she want to share her sexuality with others than me... 
But if she just don't want to give a sh''it about my feeling? telling me that she fell something special, that I'm a good guy but she fear to hurt me and she don' t want to involve much... I don't know how it'll be but there will be a lot of pain for my f''cking little heart... 

Well, nice to have reading 'til here 🤘

Don' t hesitate to give your point of view, posing question or roasting what's left of my carcass..
 I will delete this sh''t after talking with her and see what she feel about what she want and if we can try to see what' s going on.. 

I know I'm a b' 'tch, but I'm not bitchin', just want to let this out of my head for a moment.. 
F''ck, I hope this will work even if it' s just for a moment.."
lonely,"Looking for help, from fellow lonely people.","Looking for help, from fellow lonely people. - Hey there guys and gals. So, the past year and a bit has been more than very rough on me.. I came to a lot of realizations that a lot of people that surround me are just using me for their own good and they don't really care about me that much. At first it hurt really bad, but you know, as the days went by I just understood that well.. It's just how it is, and for a long time I was okay with the fact that I am completely alone and I don't have any friends, but for the past few weeks it really started to hit me... The thing is, when I was a teenager (now I am 23) I was always surrounded by people, everyone were inviting me to hang out and I just got used to being around people all the time, thus now it's getting more and more difficult day-by-day, as I don't even remember when I had a conversation with a person which I can trust..

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am writing with a reason. I need your help, people. I know that there are a lot of people who are feeling lonely, but I feel that there are a lot of kind humans that overcame the loneliness and they are doing a lot better, even if they are completely alone. I need your advice, I finally want to fight this terrible feeling, but I am completely lost and I don't know where should I start. I tried to search for a solution everywhere but you know, I got mostly basic answers such as ""join some sort of a class, get a new hobby and all that stuff"" but these things won't really help, and I know that for a fact, as I have a fairly decent job, with colleagues that I can chat with for hours, but that's not the thing I wish for.. I wish to have at least one true friend, which I could trust, and these things are not that simple, as you can't build a friendship in one day, and all my old pals are long gone from my life. So I am in a search for a way to overcome that urge to have at least one friend, and that's why I am asking for your help.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the question: what is the best way to overcome loneliness? Please share your ideas, experiences and suggestions if you can. I know that I won't find a solution here, as every human being is living out a different situation, but I want to start somewhere. After many hours (days/months) of thinking and settling down everything in my head, I am completely fine with the fact that I don't have any friends, but that feeling of emptiness is hurting me so bad, that it is fairly difficult to ignore it. 

Thank you all who will take a minute to give their ideas, I appreciate you all. :)"
lonely,The worst day of the year,"The worst day of the year - Here's to the worst day of the year. 23 years and counting alone. I atleast want to be able to hold someone hand but I'm too ugly to be asking for things.

I hate Valentine's days. I've never had a valentines and I never will. Time to go to work and watch couples hug and buy eachother gifts. While I cry inside and wait for the day I have the guts to end it all"
lonely,I will always be alone,"I will always be alone - I don't know why, maybe because of my parents hating homosexuals from an early age (and I've known I've been gay for as long as I can remember), but I can't form attachments to people. Or rather I can, but the situation needs to be so perfect, they need to be saintlike in their compassion, patience, affection, and appreciation of me, or I simply do not believe or feel that they care about me at all. 

I don't care at all about my parents or my 3 siblings. 2 of the siblings are nice people and not at all anti-gay, and they deserved to be loved, but I cannot do it, as I don't know how.

I've romantically loved twice. The first was with my best friend who didn't feel the same way. Because of my extreme insecurity and his lack of reciprocation, I pushed him away. The second was a chance encounter which ended up becoming a relationship. I loved him for a long time but he could not sustain a relationship with me, as I have no drive or will to live (cannot really be very independent) and thus make a terrible partner. The only way I was able to move on from the pain of losing him was by cutting off all emotion for him.

I've platonically loved twice. As if some ironic hand of fate, he was a straight best friend, but he fell in love with me. I tried to balance being a friend but there was too much instability and it all fell apart. I lost all feeling for him. The second time has been quite successful, and has been strictly platonic on both ends. But there is unnatural jealousy, obsession, and insecurity already. He's got a great LTR, a supportive circle of friends, and a loving family. I can only imagine how long it'll be before I wear him down, and he pushes me away, or I do exactly that to prevent it from happening.

I am so desperately alone, but no matter how hard I reach for others, they always slip away. I don't think I belong in this world"

lonely,I wish people would just say no. Silence is the worst.,"I wish people would just say no. Silence is the worst. - Seriously, I’m just so done with just always being given the cold shoulder.

I’ve applied to dozens of jobs. All but 2 or 3 of them just haven’t responded to my application. Those 2 or 3 have given boilerplate automated rejections. And I actually wrote thank yous back to those 2 or 3 places.

It doesn’t have to be eloquent. It can be robotic. It can be “no” in just one word. Just let me know is all I ask.

I’m also a 25 year old virgin trying hard (paying, working hard on the profiles) on the dating apps. I get matches. I get ghosted after a few messages or texts on every single one. I have no bitterness over women that swipe left in the first place. That’s all cool. But hell, once you’ve matched with me and lose interest just communicate that to me. Unmatch me. Call me a weirdo or a loser. Just write “no”.

I guess you could say people are busy in their lives, which is true. But I personally think that when someone shows interest in what you are offering, whether it is a job or a relationship, you can spare 2 seconds of your life to say that the answer is no."

I am a total loser . So i thought let me try a few dating apps, here's what happened.

I downloaded it and messaged women asking how they were and if they want to be friends, they look at my pics and leave me on read.

Im thinking its because im very average looking and not photogenic, this amplified my loneliness.

i just want one woman to speak to me everyday and care it doesn't even have to be a relationship.

i rage quit the apps and deleted them as they further destroyed my barely existent self esteem.

&amp;#x200B;

alright then i said let me try kik groups , it was ok at first but then all the women were only flirting with and complementing the good looking guys and i felt jealous and left out .

deleted kik -2 destruction to self esteem.

&amp;#x200B;

now im trying  a discord server and my only social interactions are reddit.

i feel numb and dizzy and i just want to sleep all day to escape this hell."

I was 239lbs 6 months ago but I danced and lost weight). Anyways I’m not particularly “attractive” by any standard. All 3 of my sisters look better than me as hard as that is to say. I’ve always known that I was no beauty queen, no prize to be won &amp; I’ve been ok with that for 22 years. It hasn’t been since recently that it’s actually started affecting me. I see people getting in relationships and being happy and it seems as though a man will never find me attractive enough to date. Yeah I know “looks aren’t everything” &amp; “it’s what’s on the inside that counts” but tell that to SOCIETY! I genuinely do NOT care about someone’s looks. If you make me laugh &amp; treat me right then we’re golden! I’m also a virgin and I don’t know when I wanna have sex yet. I’m thinking of waiting for marriage until I know the guy is extremely serious about me. Or at least a while into the relationship. I don’t want to sleep with a man a day or even a month into knowing them. There are two main reasons for this. #1 I have to trust him completely and know that he truly loves me first. #2 Even after I lose the rest of my weight, my body still isn’t the prettiest thing. I have stretch marks on my thighs, boobs &amp; tummy. I also have back acne (that I’m trying to make go away but who knows if it will ever work). I want to know that even with these flaws he still loves me and won’t laugh at me or get disgusted by me. So now THAT scares me! Like are any men even willing to wait for sex and put up with a not so perfect body from an UGLY GIRL??? I feel like they will just get mad &amp; laugh and say that I’m not worth the headache. This thought is taking over my day to day and makes me really sad because I want a family one day. I want a husband and a baby. When I was 16 I had a dream that I became a mom &amp; ever since then I’ve been excited for the opportunity and although I’m scared to push it out I’m still excited for that day whenever it may be. I just really needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for listening."

For past 3 years I’ve made it my goal to better myself so one day I can actually have love or relationship I’ve done sooo much I take care of myself I’ve become disciplined and responsible I’ve made some friends as well

But man all I’ve ever wanted was a relationship that actually lasts I have had 1 gf before and it lasted 2 months and never had sex so Im still ashamed of myself for being a virgin still but those 2 months I felt best I ever have felt. 

Overall I’m just feeling down I feel like I’m wasting my youth and just feel like my efforts are pointless I keep telling myself things will happen if i just keep on trying however as time passes it eats at me and I feel worse and not sure what to do.

Anyways hope your day is going well."

lonely,Can‘t get close,"Can‘t get close - Hey guys it‘s my first time posting here, i don‘t know if i‘m right here, please don‘t be mad if i‘m not. I‘m sorry for my english but i‘m german so yes. 
I don‘t really know how to start so yeah, i feel incredibly lonely. I don‘t have a relationship to my father, i have a BAD relationship to my mum, atleast i have no friends. Sometimes i talk to a girl from school, we also meet sometimes but it doesn‘t feel close. It doesn’t feel like a real connection, i have fun, we can talk and do stuff but i don’t consider her as a REAL friend. I don‘t know how she thinks about me but atleast she likes me. Also, i have a boyfriend but it‘s difficult. I‘m very affectionate and needy, when we don‘t see each other for a fee hours or a day the feeling of emptiness is getting worse. Expect for him, i don‘t have anyone i‘m close with or i really talk to, i‘m too socially awkward to get new connections. I also think i‘m a bit depressed, i don‘t have any real feelings since a month, i feel numb, everything what‘s emotional let me cold. I just don‘t care. But at the same time i‘ve got a pain i can‘t describe, like a huge pressure in my chest. At least, i‘ve also got a huge problem with going out in public, it‘s getting worse the last weeks, the last time i went grocery shopping i felt incredible bad. I couldn’t really breath, i was sweating, nervous, it was hard to stand because i felt week, i had those thoughts in my head that everybody thinks i‘m looking weird and i was scared that anything embarrassing happens. That i drop something or i fell down. It‘s getting worse each time, but just when i‘m alone outside. When i‘m outside with my boyfriend, i‘m scared to be alone, i‘m also scared to pay at the checkout alone. I don‘t know what to do. And there‘s also another point, i want to fix this emptiness with rough sexual experiences. I don‘t know why and how to explain it but after having sex i feel better. Also after sexting or similar but it has to be rough and degrading for me. I really enjoy it to have no control. My partner isn‘t dominant so it‘s not 100% what i really enjoy but at least a little bit. I also enjoy needy looks from boys and in generel much sexual attention. When they are done with me i feel bad again, but for the moment it‘s a great feeling to get used and be useful. I hope that’s not NSFW. 
Another thing, either i eat nothing the whole day or i binge eat. I don’t know how to explain it. I simply can‘t eat without feeling bad, another day i just don‘t care and eat till i feel sick. 
Yes i don‘t know, just a few of my main problems. I don‘t know what i expect, but i just wanted to tell someone about my pain. Ty for reading."

I have never been in this kind of situation before, it literally shattered me from myself.

Ruined me I am no longer the guy I was. Worst thing is it's been over 2 years even after repeatedly meeting new people, I just can't date again.  It feels like I'm at loss. I see no sliver lining.

lonely,Valentine's day 3 years ago,"Valentine's day 3 years ago - It was 3 years ago when the male students of our class decided to surprise the girls for valentine's day. In general, it was just a platonic gift from the boys to the girls. Every boy had an assigned girl to gift and there were more boys than girls so you would expect every girl to receive a gift. One by one the girls were called. They were given presents such as chocolates, flowers, and there even were girls who received bags and pillows. I was excited because, of course, i thought i was gonna be given a present. But in the end, every girl was called except for me. I choked up my tears and thankfully, i think, no one noticed. But there were some who did notice that i didn't receive a present. I felt ashamed as i was the only girl with empty hands. I don't know if the boy assigned to me forgot a gift or just didn't care at all. I mean he could've gave just a little piece of candy or a flower and i'd honestly be happy with that. On a normal valentine's day, i don't mind not receiving anything. But this was the day where i was supposed to receive something. I still get a bit teary eyed whenever i remember this. I don't know if i'm just being dramatic but this was the moment where i really felt that i was excluded.

Arguments with my mother, being in the closet, terrible romantic relationships in the past, being sexually assaulted and being asked out as a joke in middle school, almost losing my friend to suicide and almost attempting suicide. 

This year has only gotten worse when I was just recently diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian syndrome and felt incredibly numb. After 2 years, I broke down in tears and started cutting again. I feel terrible about it because I was clean for so long but I just can’t handle what’s going on with my life. It’s unfair because I’m only 18 and barely getting my life together before graduation in June. It’s not fair that this is happening. I just want to drown my pain away but I know it won’t work.

I'm probably meant to feel like this forever."
lonely,University student with no friends,"University student with no friends - So it seems to be happening more and more often that all my emotions just come toppling down on me all at once. I guess I’m just unhappy and sad, but I feel really stuck because I don’t know how to change things.

So I’m 20 years old, I live in the U.K. and I’m studying at university. I started university in September and my emotions seem to have got more and more out of control since. I don’t have any friends and I really mean that. I feel lonely and isolated a lot of the time, and like a bit of a failure that I haven’t made one decent friend by the age of 20. I honestly question why I own a phone a lot of the time because I know no one will be trying to contact me. I think it’s just been made worse this year because I’ve been in an environment where I’m surrounded by people my own age, but also because I’ve had a lot of time to think.

I’m also transgender, which is relevant to some of this. I was born a girl but identify as a guy. Going to university was the first opportunity I’ve had to be myself, which has been great, but it’s also made me really self conscious. I look about half the age of most guys my age and I can tell some people don’t know whether to refer to me as a boy or a girl. No one has ever been nasty about it, but I just have zero confidence in myself because I know I stick out. I just get anxious when I have to speak to people, even if I know them well, because my voice is higher than what you’d think for a guy. I definitely am quiet, which obviously wasn’t great when I started uni because I didn’t say much and then I sort of got lost in the background. It’s definitely part of the reason I didn’t make any friends. I just have this internal battle where I know no one has been horrible to me about it, yet I’m still constantly scared people won’t like me because of it.

I’m also struggling to concentrate doing any form of work and I keep handing things in late. I know I picked the right course, but whenever we have a lesson I just can’t seem to focus or take an interest. This really is a case of me needing to get my act together, but I know a lot of it is linked to my current uni situation. I start thinking about my course, but then get stressed at the fact that everyone on my course seems to have made friends, and then I start dreading going back, and the cycle repeats. The course itself is definitely a positive, but it always seems to turn into something negative.

Today everything just felt like it was getting on top of me when I heard they may be easing lockdown restrictions, because I really don’t want to go back to university. I keep having these moments where I just panic or overthink something and just burst into tears. I spent most of my time there alone where I could go days without anyone speaking to me. That’s why I’m much happier being at home because at least I have my family to talk to. The idea of going back to that room and just being alone again fills me with dread. Seeing other people who had made friends hanging out together just made me feel worse. It’s been hard enough to meet people with the covid rules in place, although I obviously understand why they’re necessary, but now most people have made friends, it’s even harder to make some, because there doesn’t seem to be anyone who is the same situation as me. Trying to find people to live with in second year is also an issue because I can’t seem to meet anyone. I feel I’m just constantly on the outside, and I’ll just have the odd conversation with someone, but there’s nobody really to talk to or who understands you. It would just be cool to have someone to hang out with or even just someone who wanted to talk to me.

I know my situation is pretty unique, but I’ve not really found anyone else who seems to be feeling something similar, even if it’s just feeling isolated. I guess the main reasons I wanted to post this were to vent, see if anyone is in a similar situation, and just to say I’m up for making friends if anyone wants to. I mean that in the least desperate way possible. Also, if anyone has any advice on how I could possibly make friends, any advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading if you got this far"
lonely,"0 friends, no girlfriend nor boyfriend, barely any family, I'm at the peak of loneliness. How do I get friends?","0 friends, no girlfriend nor boyfriend, barely any family, I'm at the peak of loneliness. How do I get friends? - Basically the title and I need help. I just called my dad to wish him a happy valentine's day. He thought I looked sad so he asked if I'd be out with some friends. When I said no he talked about how his stepson has been lonely for like a year now and he recently got a friend. It turned him into a different person. The stepson is 11 btw.

I think he saw my fake smiles, my fake laughs. I think he sees my depression for what it really is and not a phase like my mom sees it.

I really need some friends but I don't know how to go about it. I suffer from undiagnosed social anxiety and overall anxiety where the tiniest fucking thing can send me into a spiraling thought loop. Idk.. how do people get friends?"

and my best friend. When does it get better? We were together for 3 years I guess it’s easy for someone to just walk away.. Sorry to be down, I just felt like I was losing my mind lol"

Probably just off myself afterwards since what’d be the point of living then but I wouldn’t wish this shit on anybody...

But at the same time I’d easily trade any of you for girlfriend. Maybe it’s the loneliness talking, or the late night Valentine’s Day vibes hitting but there some horrible things I’d do to have someone want me...

I guess it’s pretty good that this is all hypothetical, and the reality is that we’re all just a bunch of lonely fucks..."

I am happy for here but some part of it just made me sad I don't want her to date anyone because then I will not have anyone to talk to. slowly each one of my friends has started dating and I notice that whenever a guy comes into any of my friends' life the priorities change they no longer want to hang out the way we would earlier do. To this stupid love, I have lost many friends who now are only available for small talk and always feels like I am taking their time.

ofc I will let go this time also. it is her life but just that I can sense a friendship break up sooner or later makes me a little sad.

Any advice on this would really help."

***To all that are struggling and may seem they are alone in this world, Happy Valentine’s Day.***

Hello, there 😊 I love you! And Happy Valentine’s Day. Remember, we are not always alone. Though we may feel like it. There will always be someone for you, you are not broken, you are no different.

***To all that were hurt by love and may feel they may never find it again, Happy Valentine’s Day.***

The next one will always be different from the last. Whether you were hurt by family, friends, or your significant other. The abuse, the trauma, the breakup, the divorce. It will never change who you are. You are never too difficult to love. There will always be someone to hold you, caress you, and whisper the sweetest of words to you. There will be that someone that will make you feel like you are the universe. And it’s true, you are the embodiment of the universe, you are the universe personified. You are never too old nor too young to find the one, and it’s fine if it takes time. Love will find you and fate will make its decision. And it’s okay to feel. Cry, Laugh, love. I’m here for you, and we’re okay. You’re okay. I love you! stay Safe. You’re worthy and loved.

***To all that have a family, a lover, someone. Happy Valentine’s Day.***

I wish you nothing but blessings in your life. I wish you stay with your someone. Life is not always a smooth road, it’s bumpy and curved. But that’s is why we call it life, no? I send you love and light and hope you have the best Valentine’s ever. I love you!

***To all, that ache for someone, love in their life, or perhaps may have never experienced love. Happy Valentine’s Day.***

It’s okay, I understand. It hurts. But we’ll find someone. 

We’ll find that someone that will make us a roller coaster of emotions, we’ll find that someone that’ll stay with us through the darkest and the brightest of times. I’m impatient, but I’m also excited! Who’s this person that’s going to make me feel like I’m on top of the world? Time and fate will only tell! Until then, it’s okay, I’m here, and I love you. We’re in this together. Happy Valentine’s Day!

***Remember, we all have our time. Destiny will only tell, and it’s okay. Happy Valentine’s Day Everyone, I wish you nothing but the best! I love you!***"

lonely,Just a little venting,"Just a little venting - Hello everyone reading this, I just want to get something off my chest, a sort of explanation of myself that I just feel the need to tell someone.
Sorry if the grammar or formatting of this is bad I’m not the brightest when it comes to writing.

To start off , male and currently have 1 friend outside of my family. I don’t consider myself socially awkward, I have a lot of acquaintances but no very close friends. 

I’ve been homeschooled my whole life in a (until 2 years ago) troubled home, drugs were a big problem in my family (meth and ecstasy specifically)  that really made my parents very unpredictable, sometimes they would sleep for what seemed like days at a time, sometimes they would just be erratic and angry, looking for any reason to fight, I would spend lots of time alone in my room, hiding from everyone, doing nothing in particular, not coming downstairs where my parents were for any other reason but to eat, the rare occasion I would have to talk to someone I would almost always freeze up too scared to say anything until someone either got mad at me or just left me alone. This carried on until my older sister moved back home and finally sort of gave me a person to interact with, she is now my best friend and I’m extremely thankful that she moved home. But that’s just one person who I don’t even see very often anymore.

I’ve had a construction job with my family from the age of 13 that has let me talk to homeowners and customers and that has been the only social interaction I’ve had my outside of my family and all it has taught me is to say “yes sir” and “yes mam” and how to make polite small talk and tell light hearted jokes. 

I don’t want to admit that I have no idea how to make friends or talk to people. I don’t want to admit that I am a social outcast  with extreme insecurities and unhealthy coping. But It’s true. That is all, thank you for reading. I’ll gladly talk to anyone who feels similar or would otherwise just like to talk :)"

lonely,Happy Valentine’s to my always lonely and single life,Happy Valentine’s to my always lonely and single life - Nothing better to do that watch sad shit while alone on Valentine’s. Seeing your friends with their SO’s while they are happy and just having the time of their lives. Just another daily reminder that I’m going to be alone for the rest of my life. Celebrating loneliness for the 21st year in a row. Going real strong👍🏾
lonely,I wish I had someone to talk with at night...,"I wish I had someone to talk with at night... - During the day I have work. I have exercise. I have projects I'm working on. Sometimes (rarely) I have social events (masked, physically disranced, or just virtual) with my friends. I have reading. I have tv shows and movies.

But at night... when I'm lying in bed...
I don't have these distractions. I only have myself and my thoughts. And without distraction my thoughts tend to drift toward my feelings of isolation and being alone. That's when I feel the most lonely. At night.

So I wish I had someone to talk with. Someone to tell what I did that day (even if what I did was nothing because we're in a pandemic and everyone is stuck at home doing nothing). The progress I made on my projects. What my plans are for tomorrow. Someone to ask what they did, what projects they're working on, and what their plans are for tomorrow. Someone to listen to. Someone to connect with.

And, if I'm being honest, it would be nice if it was with someone I had a romantic interest in. Not because I'm incapable of making platonic, but because at night is when I feel the most vulnerable, the most sensitive. And I would like to feel close enough to someone to share the vulnerability and sensitivity with. I wouldn't have any expectations that our conversations would lead to anything more than just that: conversations. But, again if I'm being honest, it would be nice to feel desired by someone.

It wouldn't be a cure for the loneliness, but it would be nice to feel like I wasn't totally alone in those moments."

lonely,Anyone seriously considered mail-order brides/grooms? From countries like Russia/Ukraine,"Anyone seriously considered mail-order brides/grooms? From countries like Russia/Ukraine - It’s starting to make more sense to resort to these kinds of services.

Let’s face it, the more that we get rejected or see our crushes getting married happily... the less that I personally believe in ‘true love’

True love is the wild notion that the girl/guy that you are crushing on in your personal 5-25 mile radius happens to be unique and the one you were meant to be together.

Who is to say that are millions of these true loves that live in foreign countries... and you as a USA citizen have something of value that makes them attracted to you. 

This is a weird comparison for sure — but just like how an adopted dog or child is potentially the most rewarding experience and gratifying. An adopted wife/groom might be the most wholesome and rewarding for our lack of companionship"

lonely,I know I'm lucky to have people to celebrate with but,"I know I'm lucky to have people to celebrate with but - So here's the story my birthday was a few days ago. Yayyy I turned 25 but I didn't really enjoy it tho. My sister cooked for me it was nice and. I really appreciate it and it was good af. But right after everyone went to bed. I was just left alone as always I enjoy being alone. But I look forward to the attention I get on my birthday but I felt so alone this year. This is the first year where we actually celebrated on my birthday. my dad passed a few years ago now and we would celebrate on his birthday. We still went out to eat for his birthday also his is the day after mine. Am I wrong for feeling like that.

 But what really upsets me is there was. This girl I was starting to have a small thing for. We've been talking for about a month or so. And her birthday was a week before mine. She'd been talking about the tattoo she was getting for a month. So I knew it was coming wished  wished her happy birthday and then. she asked me for some money because she was gonna be broke next week because the tattoo was expensive. I said sure 10 now and 10 next week you'll need it trust me (she did btw). I then askedwhat do I get for my birthday. She said I'll give you some money or come smoke you up promise. I say ok send her the birthday money.

I thought  things where going extremely well. But she starts replying less often over the next few days. So my birthday comes around we were still talking she doesn't.Wish me happy birthday till the end of the day. Butno word on my bday gift. I remember she said she gets paid on Thursday b-day was on Tuesday so I waited. She had a bad day yesterday and the day before so I didn't ask her then. But today she left me on read 3 times. I texted her one last time to asked her about it. She completely forgot she said oh yea what did I say I was gonna get you again. I just said nvm and asked if she was having another bad day she said no I'm just tired af. 

Also my best friend didn't wish me a happy birthday that upset me I deliberately. Dropped hard hints at another friend who forgot didn't even take notice. Of it I feel like people don't pay me any attention I don't crave it often. I understand that people have their .Own lives but I'm the one who's always there for everyone but no one is there for me. And it makes me feel sad, mad, lonely but the fact that the world doesn't revolve around me. But Id just like someone to give the time I give them."
lonely,"For once in my life, I crave affection.","For once in my life, I crave affection. - Since i was a child, i never cared about getting married of boys. Even into my adult years i didnt care. I made friends and grew out of them. Its like i cant keep even a friendly relationship. I talked to people on here but we end up ghosting. Also i feel i annoy people so i never message first. You know what i do notice though? When i have feelings for someone, i never grow tired of them. When he likes me back it makes me even happier. Its such a euphoric feeling to get a message from them even if they ate just talking about what they had for dinner. This is rare though. I have a facial deformity and most people ghost me when they see what i look like. Im short, dark skin, overweight and have a facial deformity. Thats a default for today’s unattractive human. While I am used to the ghosting, i still get lonely. Dont get me wrong though, im not desperate and i wont take shit from a guy just because im lonely. I just wanted to vent.

I've been single the entire pandemic with a couple of text flings but no one I've clicked with on any level... Now with Valentine's day tomorrow and my birthday being right after I'm just in a really lonely place.  My friends are all married and starting families now and I'm just alone and feel like I'm being left behind.  I've been single most of my life and I've been happy most of the time but these holidays have been an extremely low point for me due to the almost nonexistent in-person human interaction I've had.  With the past year too it's been nearly impossible to meet new people and the ones I have through dating apps or other means just haven't been very compatible but I'm starting to think it's just me... I even had a date lined up for tonight but she canceled on me earlier because she had to ""dog sit"" for a friend out of town and it hurt cause from our conversations I really did like her and the dog sitting thing the same day seems a bit hard to believe as the truth... Just have this voice in my head telling me she thinks I'm weird or is probably just going to go hang out with some other guy. Think I may just need to go get some help somewhere... My mental health has deteriorated so much this past year I'm just feeling more apathetic and distant from everything. Even things I used to love just don't give me joy anymore...

I’m worthy of so much more. I’m extremely loyal and forgiving. They say you get back what you put out in the universe. I’ve actually tried making friends in recent years, and I have had fuck all back.

lonely,College senior struggling with immense loneliness. Feeling hopeless,"College senior struggling with immense loneliness. Feeling hopeless - I have been struggling with immense loneliness and hopelessness lately. College has been hard for me. Although I have individual friends, I've never really had a friend group, which has contributed to my loneliness. Although I really enjoying going out and am a fun person to hang out with, I never had a friend group to go out with pre-covid, so I spent a lot of Friday and Saturday nights alone. However, this loneliness has only skyrocketed during the pandemic.

On top of this, getting a job post-grad feels hopeless. Even though I go to a top university and have long been an overachiever, I still feel like I'm not enough.

I feel like I have so much love and joy to offer the world and absolutely no one to share this love and joy with. All I want is to love and be loved, and I feel like this love will never be returned. I literally cry everyday because of these feelings of loneliness and hopelessness, and I don't even know what to do anymore. I just want to be loved."

I am broke and never have free time, despite living at home. I’m 24 (about to be 25) and won’t be finished until next year... long story short, it sucks. I wish I had done things differently but it looks like one more year of loneliness... hopefully, it goes by quick and I can stop putting my life on hold. I haven’t dated since I was 20 and I’ve avoided relationships since due to economic, family and other hardships. I have some friends but they’re busy with their own lives... plus, ya know, there’s a pandemic.

lonely,the all consuming loneliness,"the all consuming loneliness - sorry kinda lengthy but just wanted to get it out there

My loneliness is setting in again. I just wish it wasn't so loud. I literally feel it in my chest,  and it is so painful sometimes. It's like a grey cloud hovering above me at all times. Whenever I see a couple on social media or my best friend tells me about her fairly new relationship, I am genuinely happy for her because I love to see people happy, but at the same time my heart rips/aches a little bit. especially now since she is less present in my life because she is occupied by her bf, which is ok. I understand new relationships be like that. Today, my suicidal thoughts came back because I just felt an overwhelming amount of loneliness. I just want someone to *want* to make the effort with me. I want someone to want to text me good morning and ask me how my day was by the end of it. To want to make me feel beautiful even though they know they don't have to. To want to make me laugh. Just someone that doesn't want to hurt me. It's sad because it's the bare minimum. Sometimes I feel like I must be a piece of crap lol because people do approach me, but they end up ghosting me or they never want anything lasting. Just a pit stop until they find what they actually wanted. 

It's also frustrating because people rush to say that I don't have enough self love, or ultimately insinuating that it must be something that I am doing or not doing. Or, that I am young yet (f20) and don't have to rush, and I am not. Is it wrong to still want something though.  My self esteem is pretty much where the average person's self esteem is in their life time after some inner work. Pretty decent with a hint of insecurities or two. Everything else in my life is going decently now. My mental health is better (taking meds), I'm actually not mad with my classes this semester, I think I have finally narrowed down my career choice, but when it is all said and done, I still feel that missing piece, which over time feels like all of me is missing despite all the great things I have going on.

lonely,"20 years without a gf, seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel","20 years without a gf, seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel - Back in high school I was extremely focused on my studies and didn’t spend much effort trying to find a gf. I thought college would be my time to shine. I was sorely mistaken. 

It’s not that I’m rejected at every turn or anything, it’s just that no one ever seems to be sexually attracted to me or see me in that way. I’ve been close with women but none of them have ever wanted me if that makes sense. I just feel kinda worthless and it sucks Bc I’ve worked out a lot, tried to be a more positive person, be more open minded, just more easy going but nothing seems to work. 

Some days I think about how I was born when my dad was 23. I might not have a gf by that age. That’s a scary thought. Sorry to be such a downer, this hurts a lot"
lonely,31/31 Valentines Days spent alone,"31/31 Valentines Days spent alone - I’m 31 years old and I’ve spent every one of them single. 

I hate my life. I like who I am but I wish the rest of the world did too. 

I’m introverted and not the life of the party, center of attention type of person. I’ve always felt ugly. People will say looks aren’t everything and will emphasize personality. By personality, they usually mean outgoing. Which I am not. I probably am just average looking. I have gotten some honest opinions saying I am attractive. But it’s never been in the context of dating or the attractive women I desire. I’ve never been complimented in the wild about my looks. I want to be lusted and loved. Attractive and handsome feel like adjectives people use loosely. Cute, hot, sexy are stronger words and more rare. 

I’m relatively inexperienced in dating, relationships, sex. And women don’t want to be with an inexperienced guy. I just got rejected for that just today. It’s like that old job/experience paradox. You can’t get the girl without experience, but you cant get experience if you can’t get the girl. 

Some have suggested finding someone with similar experience but that will leave me with a dating pool full of.. 16 year olds? Lol kidding but my point is all of these factors decrease my chances significantly.

I wish I was like the popular kids who everyone is attracted to. Even at 31 years old I have these insecurities.

FUUUUCK I hate my life. Or I hate myself (kinda). If I’m being honest, I like who I am. I just wish who I am was what works in society and is popular in society. But nope. 

I realized I have an infatuation with a certain type of girls. Even though I know we are basically exact opposites. And I realized it’s because to me, they represent the popular kids. The people society adores and are attracted to. And I want to be desired like that. Either be that type of person or be with a person like that. 

Damn I’ve got issues lol"

They were laughing and had a lot of fun. I got the feeling they loved each other alot. I sat there like a weirdo and watched and wondered if I'll ever be in a loving relationship with anyone ever.

lonely,Staying in a toxic relationship from lonleliness,"Staying in a toxic relationship from lonleliness - It’s toxic because he makes me feel unconfident, when ever anyone compliments my looks he thinks it’s a lie and this makes my confidence drop to zero (he’s never told me this but I can tell he thinks that all compliments are lies) but he’s my friend with benefits and my only friend. 

Idk like I work as a lingerie waitress and I got this google review on me by some guys like “Clarissa has a Gorgeous face and smoking hot body too, she’s the whole package and highly recommended as a lingerie waitress.” 
and my friend with benefits was like who are they talking about?! Who’s Clarissa?! And he knows it’s my lingerie model name because I told him!! And he kept acting puzzled and confused and like wtf 😳 

He was telling me that 2  other women we’ve met are the best ones of all time out of the women. 
Just to be honest but those women he was talking about probably couldn’t even be hired for my job at all.
Idk men at my job tell me frequently that I’m the most beautiful lingerie waitress of the night but he can’t even say it. 
He thinks everyone else is lying to me, but he refuses to lie to me just to make me happy? 
I don’t think he’s even lying I’m just not his type at all. 

Anyway he told me he thinks I’m not good looking when I asked him why he doesn’t compliment me. But he compliments other girls to me all the time and says he wishes he was sleeping with her instead. 

I argued with him a lot about it but idk what to do. 
I feel so sad if I don’t have his good friendship and sex but I don’t want to be with someone who thinks I’m ugly!!! 
I find it hard to like anyone else and would probably be single for a very long time if I dropped him tbh."
lonely,Quarantine,"Quarantine - Does anyone else feel like they are losing their minds? 

Moved to a new state back in July with a partner I separated from a few months later. I don’t know anyone except my coworkers who are older than me and married. I’m sick and tired of spending weekends alone.

If y’all t wasn’t for the quarantine I’d be at a restaurant of a bar or a library right now at least to be around other people.

lonely,Can anyone relate?,"Can anyone relate? - There are times when I suddenly have the energy to socialize with people(usually only in chat), everything usually goes really well or at least I believe so. 

During those moments, I get really excited and happy, blurt out things about our common interests, interesting topics or just funny things in life. But then when they reciprocate the excitement(e.g. I say “heyy share with me that video” then they say, “sure, let’s call/chat about that sometime”), I find myself secretly wishing that they don’t actually do that.

Like I feel sorta pressured and scared, regularly switching from wanting to be close to these people to “ugh this is a pain, how annoying, I really don’t care about this”. 

Once I realized and became more self-aware of these thoughts, I started distancing myself from other people because it’s just an uncomfortable feeling, and I would also be saving others trouble. I’ve kinda accepted it now, but there are times when I long for meaningful relationship and the loneliness become unbearable. Is this a problem and can it be fixed?"

lonely,I’m not truly alone but I still feel lonely.,"I’m not truly alone but I still feel lonely. - I don’t know where to start. None of my friends have the same interests as me, I spent my first year out of high school laying around the house getting fat because my mom would freak out if I wanted to go anywhere. I wanted to go hiking or kayaking so bad, but I would have to go alone so I was pretty much forbidden from going because “It’s too dangerous for a young woman to go hiking by herself”. Three years of trying to get out and get a hobby that would keep me active later and I’m still anxious about leaving the house. That first year plenty of people said they would go out with me, but when it came time to hit the trail everybody would ignore my messages. 

I love ice skating, my city builds an outdoor rink every winter, but I haven’t been to it in six years because all of my friends feet hurt whenever they go. The last time I went skating at all was a year ago, and the only reason I even got to go was because it was a trip my parents took me on in lieu of a Christmas present. 

Last February I finally built up the courage to start going to the gym by myself. I found a nice one with a heavy weight room and a pool. I went for about three weeks and then quarantine started. I live with my grandparents, and I don’t want to do anything that would jeopardize their health, so I fear it’s going to be several more months before I feel safe enough going again. 

Being lonely has turned me into a pushover. I’ll try and make plans, and nobody can ever pull through. But when one of my friends wants to go out I’m always there. Just sitting in my room waiting for someone to text me. I could be petty and cancel their plans at the last minute, but I know it could be a couple more weeks before I get another chance for social interaction so I always cave. 

I never have anything to talk about, and I don’t have any interesting hobbies, so it makes sense why I’m so prone to being flaked on. I’m tired of wasting my life away by myself in my room."

lonely,Do people just stop looking for friendships after a certain point in their lives? (I expect and appreciate answers),"Do people just stop looking for friendships after a certain point in their lives? (I expect and appreciate answers) - Some time ago I realized that I need new friends, but maybe… I don’t like people. 

Do you remember when you were a teen and you were like “parents are lame, I wanna hang out with my friends”. For reasons I don’t need to get into now, spending time with my parents was never an option so when my friends were rebelling against family nights, that was the best time of my life.

Now that everyone decided their parents aren’t lame, they have spouses, children and careers, and for whatever reason my life is at a different stage it can get lonely when I need the company of my friends and they have no time. I love them deeply and we have been friends for years. I get that it’s really no-one’s fault, it’s just life doing its thing, I don’t resent my friends for their lack of time but understanding that does not make it less lonely. On the rare occasions, every few months we are able to spend sometime together and I enjoy it, I just wish there mas more of it. 

I’m pretty busy myself so if the live like I do, it’s perfectly understandable that they want to allocate the small amount of time they have left, after dealing with all the shit adulthood throws at you, to their SO’s and their children, but I miss hanging out, having long conversations about random stuff, watching movies, stuff like that. 

Acknowledging the problem, I tried to make new friends, to build new relationships with people that might be at the same “life stage” as me. All those new relationships felt like acquaintances-strangers whose names I happen to know and who I will share a table at a meal with. 

Making new friends was so much easier 10-15 years ago. I just talked to people and we bonded. However, in this (mid-life, single, no kids’) life stage, it’s starting to seem like no-one ever really lets their guard down, not enough for you to get to know them, and certainly they don’t really try to get to know you. At best these new “friendships” seem transitory, just until they manage to move on to their next stage which is frustrating because I make time and put in the effort to bond and I realize that I’m a pass time, easily replaceable with, I don’t know \[insert random sport here\] lessons or whatever the fuck, until they meet their new SO or take up a new hobby or some shit. And maybe those sorts of transitory friendships are fine for some, but it does not meet my needs. Which has started to make me wonder whether the problem is me. Maybe that’s the norm now and I’m just somewhat outdated. Or maybe, I don’t like new people. Because the thing is, I really don’t like company for the sake of company. I’d rather be at home with a good book and my dog than have dinner with people I feel I barely know and who really don't wish to get to know me.

So, I have questions. Do people just stop looking for friendships (the kind were you actually know and care about your friends)  after a certain point in their lives? Is that a thing? Did what people expect out of friendship fundamentally change in the last decade? Did the way friendship is defined change and I was living under a rock?  Should the making new friends project just come to a halt? Should I just have an SO and then have that one human be the center of my time allocation (like the rest of the people my age do)? I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that BTW. It just feel that If I want frequent quality human companionship having an SO is the only option society is giving me (again it’s not a bad thing, it just feels like there is no alternative). 

I guess part of me is just venting. But, I also want answers to my questions so please share your thoughts."

lonely,Life being online is hell. I've been able to tolerate it all of last year but it really is getting to me now,"Life being online is hell. I've been able to tolerate it all of last year but it really is getting to me now - I don't know what it is with me. I am charismatic and all on-campus but I'm super lonely off-campus, I can never turn day-friends into close friends. I'm 20 and I've never had a relationship. I met a girl last year before covid who was perfect, but then everything went online and it fizzled out. I still stalk her Twitter nearly every day to see what she's up to, while she's forgotten about me. And it hurts to see how compatible we were, I've never met someone who shares this many interests with me. I know it's wrong to stalk her like this but I'm falling into self-destructive cycles and I can't get out. I tried OLD but I never get any matches (not a joke, 0 matches so far). I started skateboarding and I love it, I do it basically every day but then after I come home I have nothing to do and nobody to talk to. I don't even enjoy gaming anymore. My ADHD doesn't let me concentrate on learning something new, I always lose interest no matter how interesting the topic is. I have been lonely for a couple of years now but it's never been as debilitating as it is now, because I went to college and spoke to my friends every day. Now, MONTHS go by without having a conversation with my friends. Nobody on this planet even knows the real me, I am literally unable to be vulnerable, it feels like I always put up a facade in public. I'm slightly more extroverted than introverted, and I really am starting to crave large social gatherings with people I don't know. These days I wake up and the first thought on my mind is about how lonely I am, and that CANNOT be a good sign for my mental health. It feels like I missed out on my 19th year and I'm already through the first half of my 20th without meeting any new girls (or even guys to befriend for that matter). I never used to be ashamed of my looks but these days I'm more and more self-conscious and ashamed of what I see in the mirror (even though I've lost weight skating, and I'm objectively leaner now). To top it all off, I live with my parents as do most people my age here, except my parents still treat me like a child. For fucks sake, I can't even control when I eat. I skip breakfast and my mom screams at me for ""Starving myself"". Haha, good luck fixing your diet when you can't even make your own food choices. Don't get me wrong, they love me and I love them, but I need my independence.

My only source of comfort these days is to google my lonely feelings with ""reddit"" attached at the end of the search and see what other people have to say about what I'm feeling, but that really doesn't help. This post was mostly to vent my feelings, I can't keep it bottled up inside me any longer. Thanks for reading."

lonely,"I know you can get with someone by accident, but did you know you can also break up by accident?","I know you can get with someone by accident, but did you know you can also break up by accident? - So I've been with some guy for couple months, we were getting along amazingly, but because of past experiences we were both somehow keeping some walls. I thought to give it a try, open myself up, the worst it could happen was to be hurt again. Today we got into a small silly argument, we met, talked things through, I even told him my true feelings for the first time, that I started loving him (I've been lipstalking this when he wasn't looking plenty of times to check if it's true and lately my heart skiped a beat when I was saying this). Kisses, smiles, all seemed great. 5 minutes forward he's telling me how he doesn't feel that ""something"", even though we tried to let it work in the past months and proposes to break up. I agree, as being in a relationship with someone you don't feel something it's just lost time.

 However, now I feel empty. I acknowledge that it's for the best since my feelings were shared, but it just hurts man... I mean, it was such a silly argument and the kisses and everything. Looking back, I don't even know what happened that in less than 5 min we turned from doves to strangers. It's even more ironically as today is 13th and tomorrow's the freaking V day... What would you have done? How are you coping with this?"

lonely,"Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions(??)? Covers age, gender, interests, continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀!","Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions(??)? Covers age, gender, interests, continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts).

**How it works:**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.
* Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* [/u/finder\_of\_the\_humans](https://www.reddit.com/u/finder_of_the_humans/)/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"

I did meet a wonderful Israeli man and we’re engaged to be married (had to postpone twice now due to COVID) but only being able to see his family, visit his friends, spend Shabbat with his parents and never with mine is so hard. I love them, but I miss my family, too. And with my still-not-great Hebrew...I just sit at the table like a ghost while everyone chatters and laughs around me.

lonely,Motivational Letter to You,"Motivational Letter to You - Hey there,

you may not know me, but I’ve written this letter specifically for you. Yes, you. I know you’re feeling pretty down right now and that your current situation makes the world seem like a shitty gutter full of misery.

So I’ve decided to sit down and write you a good ol’ fashioned motivational letter. No deep profound thoughts, no life contemplation, just straight pure energy to jumpstart you back into beast mode.  


Things didn’t turn out the way you thought they would. Face it. There’s nothing you can do about it at this point, so stop stressing over the things you can’t change. Yes, you probably should’ve done some things differently – but you didn’t.   


The only way you’ll be able to break the  cycle is by not letting your current situation affect your state of mind. As a matter of fact, when your life is at its lowest, your mind  needs to be at its strongest for you to be able to climb back up.   


The popular saying goes: “when the going gets tough, the tough get going”. But the reality is that the tough  should always be going because that’s what makes them tough in the first place.    


 

It’s hard. Very hard. Sometimes Life punches you straight in the gut, knocks you down, and just keeps on  kicking. But don’t roll all over the floor and cry. Take the beating,  but don’t let it beat you. Allow yourself to be knocked down, but not  knocked out. You can’t anticipate the next punch, but you can contemplate your next move.

Life can be pure beauty. Life can be truly amazing. But Life can also be a battle, and right now it is.

Physical exhaustion. Psychological manipulation. Emotional disaster.  


When Life hits, it can rob you of your sleep, energy, and power. It may play with your mind, shaping it and twisting it. It can attack your emotions, self-esteem, and confidence.  


But never, ever, EVER let it fiddle with your mindset. Always keep a sharp focus. Never lose sight of what's really important.   


Keep pushing and struggling until you get yourself up, stand straight, and look life right in the face.  


  Because sooner  or later, you and Life are going to clash again. Only this time you’ll  be smarter. You won’t make the same mistakes again.   


You won’t get broken as easily. And this time, if you’re smart enough…

…you’ll be the one to throw the first punch.

Let this one sink in. I’ll be right here, waiting for your reply.

Sincerely yours."

lonely,I'm the cliché funny kid at school,"I'm the cliché funny kid at school - I'm the cliché funny kid at school. You know, acts all happy and cheerful in public, but is calm and introverted in private? Yeah, that. I am also slightly over weight. I learned how to make people laugh because of what I go through on a daily basis. I want people to have a moment of genuine happiness, even if that's just a couple of minutes because, for me, that's enough to make a difference. I keep everyone at an arm's length because I hate myself. I hate how over weight I am. I hate how disconnected I feel from everyone else(because I'm a half Canadian half taiwanese kid in taiwan and I look Canadian) I'll never truly fit into a place that I have lived in for my entire life. I don't have the guts to tell my parents because my mom wouldn't understand and I love my dad too much to make him concerned for me. I hate myself and I tell myself everyone should hate me too, so I never alow people to grow attached to me and I keep my thoughts to myself. My grades are mediocre at best and I don't have any REAL friends. They might think their my friend and I might act like they're my friend, but to ne, they're not. Video games and my phone provide the only true source of happiness I get nowadays because I can immerse myself in things I'm familiar with on YouTube or reddit. With video games, everyone is doing the same thing, everyone knows the same stuff. I no longer stand out because in the same. I tried to use writing as a way to funnel my frustration into fictional characters and events and places, it works and I really do enjoy it, but it doesn't work as much as I would like it to. I just wish I had a friend, a true friend, one I could spend time with, one I could sit and look at rocks with, one that would enjoy the same games and memes that I do, one that would make me feel less alone.

School's a fucking train wreck. My grades are laughable, I waste TEN FUCKING HOURS of my day there(yeah, the taiwanese school system is fucked right up)  at least three different tests a day and almost no free time. I'm pretty sure very one there likes me to some degree, but I have no idea what will happen if this gets out. They're probably try to help, only to be turned down by me, even if I really want or need their help. But that's just me. 

I'm sorry if this is a fucking mess to read, I just wanted to get everything off my chest really quickly because it was keeping me up. I know I'm not alone and I know I'm not special, but that doesn't make the pain I feel any less painful or unreal.

Thank you to whoever reads this. You spent your time to read through my mess of emotions. I'm not saying you should do something, I'm just putting my emotions out there instead of inside my head.

Truly, thank you, and if you're going through something, I hope it gets better, I really do. And if you're having bad thoughts like suicide, don't do it. Even though I hate myself, there are still people who would help me, even if I don't want it. So there will be one for you to, trust me, there will be someone. I hope for the best for all of you. I hope you have a wonderful day/afternoon/night.

It's 2 o'clock now. I should be in bed. I still can't stress this enough. 

Thank you."

lonely,No more purpose in life..,"No more purpose in life.. - Here I am, about to hit 35, and as I am sitting here crying on a filthy floor of a beautiful old apartment I recently bought (well, it's a massive mortgage) and which I am trying to renovate with the little money I have left over, I am now sure that I have no purpose in life...

I do have a good job and I am good at it, it pays well too. Impartial observer would probably think that I am a successful man with that new car and all. But outside of work, there is nothing. I am undoubtedly affected by being dumped couple days ago, no question about that. It happens. If only I wasn't rejected a month ago by another woman and if only I hadn't broken up a long lasting relationship another month before that. It's just been too much to bear.

It would be amazing to have a good friend on two to lean on in a time like this. But, I have none left. Except for my sister and ex girlfriends, there wasn't anyone who would message or call me on their own in good 5 or 6 years. Maybe I haven't invested enough effort in those friendships, but I never felt like they were real, you know. Out of sight, out of mind. They never really deeply cared, so I stayed out of the way and it ticked away.

What will I do next? I don't know. I will probably finish tiling the bathroom for the day, go back to the other apartment, turn on YouTube to have at least the speaker taking to me, eat, go to bed... Wake up and just do it again for no reason but to stay alive. Maybe on Monday a colleague will call me and I will actually have a reason to speak after several days without saying a word to anyone. Probably not, they are used to mailing me anyway. I should drink before I head out though, there is snot everywhere and I must have cried out at least half a litre of water by now.

Life sucks."
lonely,down horrendously,"down horrendously - down horrendously

Okay so i don’t wanna get to into it but i’ve been on and off talking to people on spotafriend for a little less then a year now. And I always start talking to someone and i think it get goes really well and then after a week the convos die out and the few times i reach out they are busy and then i wait for them to reach out to me and then it just dies out. i basically got stuck in this cycle of catching feelings for someone and trying to get to know them and then it dies out. It feels awful cause i think i’m fairly interesting and i mean i’m not like super good looking but i don’t think i’m ugly. in december i started talking to someone and they were super upfront and for the next two weeks we would talk all the time and fall asleep on the phone and send suggestive stuff. Sometime around christmas i asked her to be honest with me if she was losing interest. so i suggested we stopped calling And that fucking sucked. then in january someone else reached out to me. after a couple days of talking we started going out in person and it went really good and then after the first two weeks we wouldn’t talk at all i would try to reach out but she would just msg me later in the day and say she’s sorry she’s been busy. and even when we weren’t talking on text or playing games i stuck around because we went on a date once a week. she told me she isolates herself from all of her friends because she’s bipolar. she said sometimes she ghosts people for months. and so i broke up with her because what’s even the point if she doesn’t talk or do anything with me. and i don’t mean do anything like that bc we both decided we wanted to wait a bit in the relationship to do anything. and i always go back to redownloading shitty meet friends online apps when every long distance relationship i try to start falls apart. and i’m so paranoid and nervous i can’t even start irl relationships with people because i feel like i’m playing mental chess games and thinking about every thing i say and do. i don’t know what to do anymore i cry myself to sleep every night. i don’t even know what to do because i’m not particularly ugly or unfunny or stupid."
lonely,She was a beautiful chapter in my life.,"She was a beautiful chapter in my life. - Little heads up, this post is going to be kind of a rant since im hurting so much to the point i feel it physically and always feeling blue. 

So i made a post on this sub more than a year ago with a different account about feeling lonely . I got a couple of replies to that and one of them stuck with me for long. We were completely different people but for some reason we found each other interesting and talked all day, every day. I even started to stay up really late so i could talk to them coz ofc time difference. 

Our bond got stronger and stronger each day, a few months into it we got in a ldr for a while but it got complicated and i ended up hurting her. The fact that i hurt the person that meant so much to me was unbearably painful. I didn't wanna leave her right away coz at that time i was the only one she had in her life to talk to, and i also wanted to stay with her until she felt alright. 

After some time when she started to move on and focus on her life, i suggested her that we should part our ways since we have a tough past together, and if we stay in touch it'll hurt us more and maybe complicate things between us. But she protested against it, she went full on crazy mode and made me promise her that I'll never leave her under any circumstance. Ngl our bond grew stronger after that. She'd call me her best friend, but it didn't last long.

Our own lives weren't sparing us from complications and struggles either. We started to stray off from each other slowly, there were a lot of misunderstandings and miscommunication. Idk when exactly it happened but she slowly started to lose interest in me. I know i shouldn't complain since i was the one who hurt her first, but at this moment we were so close than we ever been and she meant so damn much to me. 

One day an innocent conversation turned into an argument and we both got furious and said harsh things about each other. I apologized coz she meant more to me than my ego or my opinion, she was still furious. I mean i can't blame her, i didn't give her enough space. She completely forgot everything we once had and started say lies about me. She deliberately said things that hurt me. What actually broke me was the fact that she forgot everything we once had and literally stop giving a shit about me. It hurts so much to see a person who you spent so much time with and put a lot of effort only to see them lose interest in you and become a stranger again. 

I couldn't take it, my throat was hurting so much i couldn't breath. So i cut her off and said you're really hurting me, and she didn't care and even made fun of it. I knew that it was over for us and i said goodbye, she literally replied with ""Byeeeeeee"". I can't explain how i felt then through words, saying it was painful would be an understatement. 

Its been a month since we split up. In order for me to move on from this quickly i deleted everything i ahd of her, her pics, number, chat even my old reddit account. I made sure that there was no means for me to contact her. I created a new reddit acc and ofcourse i searched for her account but for some reason i couldn't find it ( idk why). I was kinda relieved coz now i know that i will never have a way to see that's got to do anything with her. But, today for some goddamn reason i looked her up on google and found her account, she's made a new post and i read it. Yup now im a fucking mess. I was kind of moving on and i do this shit. Now i know she's there and she doesn't even care that im not in her life anymore. This hurts so much. So fucking much.

I miss her so much. I want her to be happy and succeed her life. But her memories are fucking haunting me. Wish i didn't argue back when that stupid argument broke out a month ago. Maybe things would've been different now, i still would've had my best friend with me. I miss you cutie. 

Sorry for the rant, i didn't know where else to go.

tl;dr 

I lost my best friend and im in extreme agony right now."

lonely,"Is there a social network that matches people based on movies, games and TV shows?","Is there a social network that matches people based on movies, games and TV shows? - Basically I have this one friend who I can sometimes call and discuss movies and TV shows with him but the problems is that this discussion lasts for like 15 min or something and when it ends it usually ends in between and he then almost always makes some excuse that he has to leave(no matter when I call him) and it just lefts me with this empty feeling inside cause I literally have no one else to talk to.

Recently I read the highest upvoted post of all time on r/highdeas and like everybody else I thought that would be the coolest thing ever. The idea posted was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/highdeas/comments/ir9tzt/ok_im_stoned_but_this_seems_like_a_good_idea_what):

&gt;what if there was an app that both you and your partner have where you both swipe right or left on movies that are on your streaming services and when you find a match it lets you know.

Does anyone else know if something like this already exist? cause I googled and found nothing(sadly)."

lonely,not really feeling it anymore,"not really feeling it anymore - i hate feeling lonely. like the one thing i can never stand is that feeling of loneliness. i hate turning everywhere i go and just looking at people be together, whether it’s just a group hanging out or a couple on a date. it just makes me feel so out of place. like an outsider looking in. i can never stand it. one thing that i’ve always tried is to never look alone or lonely. like i never wanted to be seen as some loser with no friends. but it feels like that’s all everyone sees in me. that i’m just someone who isn’t all there socially. that i’m lame and that i’d be a waste of time to be around. which i know to some degree is true. i know i have no friends. i know i’m not some spontaneous person. i know i don’t go out as often as most people do. i know i don’t joke at the same things as most people do. simply putting it, i know it all. i know that i’m just fucking lame. that’s why i’ve never dated anyone, cause i can’t bring anything to the table other than a boat load of problems. i’m just a problematic kid. no one wants someone like me, in any sense. as a friend or more than, i’m not wanted."

The regular chats with that girl I liked came to an end on this day. My 'friends' whom I loved as much as myself abandoned me, misunderstood me and probably threw me under the bus. Took me almost 2 years to come out of trauma. People are so disappointing. No one came and asked if I'm alright even though they all saw that I was troubled for almost two years. Can't believe I've given myself to people who didn't care at all. Not anymore though. I've cut myself from any new interactions, love opportunities and new friendships because the I can't risk living that way all again in that state of depression. I'm better on my own now."
lonely,2months,"2months - That’s exactly how much times I’ve spent completely by myself. I call my mom. Everyday. Who’s across the seas. I don’t have friends where I live. Why? Because no one is ever genuinely interested in me. I was ALWAYS interested in people. I genuinely hate this city where I live surrounded by lonely, egocentric maniacs who don’t care about anything else but themselves. I tried going into the world with my open heart and eager eyes to find a contact, MAKE an eye contact on the street only to be dismissed. I never felt this awful in my entire life. I don’t work, I don’t meet anyone. I hug my pillow before I fall asleep and talk sweet things to it because that’s what I would like to say to the man of my dreams, who’s probably never gonna appear. I am 31. I am a man myself. I lived through abuse and I am absolutely sick to my gut to be reminded of my traumatic past every single step I take. All I need is a simple: “I understand you. Everything is fine with you, don’t second guess yourself. I can relate to your feelings.” I gave exactly THESE sentences to a lot of people. Loads and loads of people. I was always empathetic, because that’s how I was raised. That’s what my mom taught me. It feels like I wasted my warmth and empathy just to nothing and to find myself isolated, alone, sad and depressed atm. It is absolutely challenging. But even know when my loneliness is crying to be eliminated I want to send out a Positive vibe to the world. Still. I want to hug someone. Just a freaking hug. Nothing more. I feel like people are paranoid, timid and plain crazy. Why can’t anyone understand such simple things as a human connection ? We’re living in a F lonely world and I am not proud of us as humans of what we’ve become thanks to technologies, careers and other bull%^’$. Is money and career will really make you happy? Go to southern pacific islands and see those warm people who are literally barefoot because they don’t have shoes but are THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. Think about it for a second and let that sink in. I hope this pandemic time will shake the humanity in the right away and much needed awakening will happen and all of the useless IG INFLUENCERS will disappear (because....what exactly is THAT?? An influencer of.....what ?!?!?!??? Fake boobs and fake abs ?!?!?)"

My mates are with their partners and Im just akone in my new half furnished house with nothing to do. Ive already driven around for hours aimlessly and broke after just being paid.

lonely,"Thank you, Valentine's day.","Thank you, Valentine's day. - Thank you for reminding me how much I've failed with my relationships. Every one of my friends is now engaged (yea, I mean EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. OF. MY. FRIENDS.) and guess what? I'll be alone in my room, trying not to cry because I'll be lonely af. I am not envy at all, I am happy instead for them. But there's a thing that stings me the most.

 When I was engaged I Always preferred, along with my ex GF, to include every friend that was single and spend the evening all toghether eating and whatching movies. I know that this might sound lame af, but I know how Valentine's day can be depressing if you are alone and unwanted. It's basically that day that reminds you that you are a loner.

And yes, those same friends ghosted me for this year, even knowing that I'm still grieving on my ended relationship and that I'm depressed AF. Maybe I should be more selfish next time. Or maybe not. But Who cares? Even my ex has another guy. And I am here. Alone. And unwanted. Yay. 

Oh, and another thing. I f HATE all the people that say me ""Oh, Every girl should be happy to be with you"". That's the cheapest, most stupid and annoying bs you can say to a single person. And yes, you can check my profile (I have a pic of myself in a post). I know that I may be hot and handsome for most people. And I am not perfect, I am not a Saint. What I've done is something I did with my heart for my Friends. But that's suifuel seeing how easily people forget you as soon as they reach their goal. It just sucks."

lonely,My Reddit bot can give you some random subjects to talk about 🤖,"My Reddit bot can give you some random subjects to talk about 🤖 - **TLDR:** u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t can send you a random question which you can ask to a friend. This means that, you'll need to find that friend first. If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It’s also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won’t even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON’T be forwarded!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‘!’ as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: What would this do…

**!changelog**: Why would you care about this?

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to.

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don’t provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won’t pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it’s good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON’T want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they’ll will still remain.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess… It displays all the commands and well… tries to help you with that.

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

**Have fun :)**"
lonely,i just want someone to like me,"i just want someone to like me - I'm not expecting to be *everyone's* cup of tea but it sure would be nice to have someone who actually wanted me around because they like me. Someone please like me

Approaching people always feels like such a risk, and I hate giving up on anyone, but I'm not going to stick around for someone who would keep me in their life just because they like having a human pin cushion or have a use for me. I can't be the only one who feels dishonest and low doing that even when it's not directly hurtful (I may be depressed but I don't rely on others to tell me I'm worth something).

All my friends live in a different city to me. I'm living at home with my family who are the only people I talk to. I dreamed one day that my 21st birthday would be an amazing event filled with people I love. Instead it's kinda depressing.

lonely,How do you support yourself emotionally and push yourself out of comfort zone? (Long post),"How do you support yourself emotionally and push yourself out of comfort zone? (Long post) -  I() have been thinking about the idea of relationships( because every second person I know is in a relationship).   
What I've concluded is that they're good as you would have someone to push yourself out of comfort zone and support you emotionally(thats not always the case some(many?) relationships are very toxic and they just drag each other down). The idea of having someone to push you out of comfort zone and make you realize about your goals fascinated me. Having someone who understands you and is close to you sounds great. My parents do take care of me but they dont understand me the slightest bit .  


Also the idea of having someone to talk to has been shoved down my throat recently, I get it , In case you end up in a dark place you should have people to pull you out of it.That's cool.  


I myself wasn't in a good place mentally and despite having people to talk to I didn't thought it would have been appropriate to talk about it, the chances of them giving a fuck was high(maybe not) but the chances of them actually helping me out was low as they didn't really understood and knew me.  


The problem(minor) is I don't think so I've ever felt proper long term attraction towards any girl. Nope I'm not asexual and aromatic, It just so happens that I've never been ""close"" with anyone. And Imo thats should be the most important part of a relationship and only it should give rise so some sort of attraction. For me that has never happened. No knowing the person = no actual attraction, that's how i dismissed whatever attraction i felt towards girls. And I don't think so I'm going to change this.Some girl did liked me at some point of time but we really didn't knew each other and I didn't approached her despite her making some moves. Knowing each other comes first for me.  


Superficial reading and you know just observing things around me in general led me to conclude that its hard to get into a proper relationship where both people help each other grow.Many relationships are just toxic.  


The major problem is that the chances are high that I might be a part of the pool of ""ugly"" people.  
I do posses physical traits which are considered ""ugly"" . Yeah I'm pretty short. I am kind of okay with the fact that it is ""ugly"" yeah your guy needs to be tall so you make tall babies , natural selection , I get it.

Kind of hilarious how nature makes the quality of producing ""tall babies"" such an important part of attraction of females towards males even when being strong(taller people are stronger than short ones on average) has no real advantage in 21st century.   


Another issue could be that I might even have an ""ugly"" face so that makes things worse for me. I did received compliments about my looks from the opposite sex when I  had just started with puberty. But the chances are high that I dont look good now. One incidents makes me chuckle when some people were talking about some girl , I didn't really thought highly of her. She was somewhat ""dumb"" and cringy .  
And then some guy comes and says how she is ""Out of my league"". I started feeling terrible. Tbh she did looked conventionally attractive. But the fact that I didn't really thought highly of her and STILL I was ""out of her league"". That hurt. I'm sorry if this turned into a rant.  


So considering the worst case senario(me never being able to find a romantic partner),  
I definitely would miss out on a lot.  


How could pushing yourself out of your own comfort zone and somehow supporting yourself emotionally? Also how do you deal with ""she is out of your league"" kind of comments?The Idea of being self reliant in this aspect fascinates me more.    
I'm going to be far away from my parents in near future and I kind of had a near death experience(this might be a little exaggerated) but whatever it was terrible and I don't know what would I have done if my parents hadn't been near me and I didn't had anyone to take care of me. So yeah how to be self reliant in these aspects?  


Could you advice me how do I achieve this?"

I’m just thinking about how my brother just decided all of a sudden that i’m not worth his time. And how the random middle-aged woman at the grocery store didn’t reply back when I said “excuse me I’m sorry” and instead gave me a cold glare, how I wish my mother would even just call me first. 
I’ve thought so much about why my life ended up this way. Why my entire childhood was shit. And the only answer that comes up in my head every time is “damn I must have done something fucked up in my past life”. This is the only way I can cope or understand why I’m treated the way I am. 
I wish i could go back to high school. It was a particularly small school and even if I didn’t have any friends, ik I could talk to my counselor or any of the teachers there. I think about them a lot, and how they would make sure I’m fed, and that I’m doing ok mentally.

I dont get to talk to him much in the morning. On his way home, he talks to me about work, when he gets home he talks to me about work a bit before he needs to play his games or take a nap. We do get dinner together but, so many nights I'm exhausted from being a SAHM, I kinda just send everyone to their rooms.

I dunno, ive always been WAY too needy of a person and I shouldn't feel alone just because I don't get to see or talk to my husband a lot, it's life.

Playing games, jacking off, talking to people, none of it gives me any feeling at all.

lonely,I had a friendship with a woman I met online and since it ended earlier this year Ive had a whole in me.,"I had a friendship with a woman I met online and since it ended earlier this year Ive had a whole in me. - 
Around a year ago I was in a really rough place. I felt very alone, and I also felt like a failure and a hypocrite. Despite these feeling I had a fairly ok social life. I would go out and spend time with friends but I always felt a disconnect from them. I would hangout with them but we never felt ""close"". I talked to a few people I had met online from posting on reddit and that was nice but I still felt very alone. 

Then I met ""L"". I really didn't even expect a friendship to happen, we were both pretty awkward but we were real with each other so we ended up continuing to talk. Our conversations were about things we cared about or even just random musings. We would share memes, watch tv shows together, and stay up late into the night just hanging out with each other. 

For the first time in a long time I could really bear my soul with someone. I have a lot of bottled up issues. Self esteem issues, confidence issues, loneliness, mild mental health issues (Mild depression/anxiety/adhd). We talked about these things as she had some similar issues. Neither of us had to hide who we were from each other and it was really nice. We could share our faults with each other and not feel judged, we could be honest about our loneliness without being judged, and we could comfort each other. Despite only knowing each other online we got to know each other quite well through skype calls. 

As time went on an attraction grew, we started to flirt some and I'm not going to go into details but there were a few moments of online passion. What was amazing about that is we could still be ourselves. I wanted to please her, and she wanted to please me, and we were both open about it. If one of us needed comfort the other wanted to give it. It was a deeply refreshing experience to not only have someone who wanted to comfort me when I was feeling sad but also who wanted me to comfort them when they were sad. 

Eventually though we started to drift apart, we had different goals in life and our short 5-8 month romance had more or less run its course. It wasn't all perfect, she was a good 6 years younger than me (i'm 27) and that created a strain at times because I thought she had a lot of co-dependence with her parents who I also think abused her (not physically but emotionally). She could also be quite naive at times. I wasn't always the most understanding, I wanted her to act like someone my age when she frankly wasn't, and I only am who I am now cause I was immature as a 21 year old as well. 

So It ended, and now for months and months Ive had this empty hole in me because I miss it. I miss her but I understand why it ended and why it needed to but I miss having someone I could be that vulnerable with."

lonely,No friends but my mom.,"No friends but my mom. - I just want to vent out my frustration at myself. I can never have any close friends I can talk with, share secrets, vent out or have fun hanging out together. That's right, I'm not exaggerating. I have never ever hang out with friends because nobody would invite me. So, my mom would tell me to invite them and there's always excuses from them. I'm not sure what's the problem with me? Whenever I ask my friends around me, they would always say ""what, we are friends, you can totally talk with me"". Unfortunately, when I try to talk, they'd just brush me off. 

Seems like I'm slowly letting this matter go because all in all, I have my mom. But today, it hits me on how lonely I am. It hits horrible after I see this one person, a friend of mine posted a picture of her and her friends (also my friends)  eating out together. Why did I feel so angry? Because, we're in the same college taking the same course. I only have her, and she only has me to depend on. I was the person who always remind her of our assignments, the person she'd find whenever she has problems understanding lectures. I have spent nights helping her finishing her lab reports. Evenings when she'd call me crying because she forgot her quiz which was due in 15 minutes or so and I'd help her. But, that's that. Never bothered to at least, hang out for fun or wish me a birthday. Why am I being used like this? It's gotten to the point where I feel like, I want to fly solo and do work on my own. I just feel like I should focus entirely in my education but the loneliness kept catching up. It...sucks."

lonely,No friends,No friends - I used to have hella friends doin hella shit and partying  and then they just stopped inviting me to things out of nowhere. Nothing bad even happened between me and any of them. Now for the last 6 months I’ve felt so lonely. Only getting out of the house to lift weights and go to school. I don’t get invited to anything while I just watch all of em party on their snap stories wondering why I never get invited anymore
lonely,fuck child abusers (they/them) 13,"fuck child abusers (they/them) 13 - i grew up with a 2 drug addict parents and anyone with a iq higher than a room temperature knows that’s not gonna end up well. they got divorced when i was 2 and my mom got custody. my dad got me and my brother every other weekend. while i was at my moms i was beaten slapped and starved. i was only 3 so i didn’t really know how to tell people what was happening. cps came after a few weeks and i was put in the foster care system and that was even worse. the first foster home i was at was total hell. my foster mother barley fed my brother and i and when she did it was usually some shitty microwave food. the hell my foster sister put my older brother and i through makes me sick to think about. she made us eat dog food, she molested me, she beat us a lot and use to cut us with a knife. the baby sitter my foster mom sent us to was hell as well. the dude that was watching us was named james and my brother and i would call him big fat meanie james (i was 3 give me a break), but anyways my brother and i were practically slaves. we did chores around the house and if we didn’t do them we would get beat. that went on for about 6 months and after that we went to another house. it was my step great grandma at the time and she treated me and my brother good. she was the person that made me feel better about myself then. i really wish she was here so i could talk to her, but i stayed with her till i was 4 then i moved to my aunt and uncle until i was 9 and moved back to my dads. it’s been hell but i’ve been hanging in there."
lonely,Final Realized How Lonely I am as a Result of Boredom (22M),"Final Realized How Lonely I am as a Result of Boredom (22M) - All throughout High School and most of my University life, I never really cared or deeply desired to pursue a romantic relationship with a girl. I of course wanted one, but it wasn't a priority in my life. I didn't flirt with girls, talk to them (or really anybody tbh outside of online friends). I had other priorities that I wanted. Having fun playing games and preparing myself to ""get rich"" by focusing on my studies (pfft, studying) and preparing myself financially. I got that last year when I was accepted as an intern at a large company and then provided a full-time offer later that year. 

&amp;#x200B;

In that year after receiving the offer, I started to want a relationship. Had a small thing with a woman online at one point (that wasn't going to go anywhere for various reasons) and I learned a lot. The pandemic hit just as I was creating a dating profile to apply the things that I learned. But couldn't apply the knowledge because of the pandemic. I was fine with this, I still had my friends, and I wasn't bored, so I put it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, as the months go by. And friends stop playing the same games. Wanting to do different things. The boredom starts setting in. I begin to realize how much I want a relationship when I'm not distracted by other things. A smaller group of friends I have where we only gather a couple of times a week all talk of their own romantic relationships. They talk about the good things they have, and I realize how envious I am of them and want to experience what they have. I started updating my profiles, really going at it. Working on improving myself to be more desirable. Writing better messages, better profiles, better pictures, etc. But, the results aren't what I was hoping to achieve. As I go to sleep at night, alone in my own bed. I just think about the relationships my friends have. How they are cuddled up with their significant others every night and I have no one. I was hoping to change tactics, move beyond the use of dating sites (not the easiest thing to work with), and try things in person. But I can't. We're in the middle of a pandemic, and I can't go anywhere to meet new people. Not to mention I still don't even know how to talk to new people to make new friendships, let alone talking to girls in the hopes of a romantic relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

So I thought to myself, well. I can wait a while longer till things start getting better. I don't need a girlfriend right now. But, the boredom problem still exists. This boredom has lead me to desire more regular friendships outside of the ones I have where we only meet for short periods of time in the week. But alas, I've forgotten how I even made friends in the past. And I can't stop thinking about how lonely I am when I have nothing to do or nothing exciting going on. All I have to look forward to are these brief 30m windows where new episodes of my shows come out and the bi-weekly raid nights I have.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; boredom has resulted in non-stop thinking of being alone"

lonely,I had a friendship with a woman I met online and since it ended earlier this year Ive had a hole in me.,"I had a friendship with a woman I met online and since it ended earlier this year Ive had a hole in me. - 

Around a year ago I was in a really rough place. I felt very alone, and I also felt like a failure and a hypocrite. Despite these feeling I had a fairly ok social life. I would go out and spend time with friends but I always felt a disconnect from them. I would hangout with them but we never felt ""close"". I talked to a few people I had met online from posting on reddit and that was nice but I still felt very alone. 

Then I met ""L"". I really didn't even expect a friendship to happen, we were both pretty awkward but we were real with each other so we ended up continuing to talk. Our conversations were about things we cared about or even just random musings. We would share memes, watch tv shows together, and stay up late into the night just hanging out with each other. 

For the first time in a long time I could really bear my soul with someone. I have a lot of bottled up issues. Self esteem issues, confidence issues, loneliness, mild mental health issues (Mild depression/anxiety/adhd). We talked about these things as she had some similar issues. Neither of us had to hide who we were from each other and it was really nice. We could share our faults with each other and not feel judged, we could be honest about our loneliness without being judged, and we could comfort each other. Despite only knowing each other online we got to know each other quite well through skype calls. 

As time went on an attraction grew, we started to flirt some and I'm not going to go into details but there were a few moments of online passion. What was amazing about that is we could still be ourselves. I wanted to please her, and she wanted to please me, and we were both open about it. If one of us needed comfort the other wanted to give it. It was a deeply refreshing experience to not only have someone who wanted to comfort me when I was feeling sad but also who wanted me to comfort them when they were sad. 

Eventually though we started to drift apart, we had different goals in life and our short 5-8 month romance had more or less run its course. It wasn't all perfect, she was a good 6 years younger than me (i'm 27) and that created a strain at times because I thought she had a lot of co-dependence with her parents who I also think abused her (not physically but emotionally). She could also be quite naive at times. I wasn't always the most understanding, I wanted her to act like someone my age when she frankly wasn't, and I only am who I am now cause I was immature as a 21 year old as well. 

So It ended, and now for months and months Ive had this empty hole in me because I miss it. I miss her but I understand why it ended and why it needed to but I miss having someone I could be that vulnerable with."
lonely,If anyone Wanna chat...,If anyone Wanna chat... - I just need a conversation...
lonely,Sometimes aloneness is better.,"Sometimes aloneness is better. - I had two instances involving two people that came up this week at work that resulted in me choosing to let go of them. One of them involved a male coworker that I play boardgames with once every 2 or three weeks. The other involved a girl that I had feelings for and she said that she is not ready for a relationship and now were are, or were friends. I guess it was a big decision for me to cut these people out of my life because they right now are the only friends that I have. 

The first set of incidents involved my coworker, ""Travis"" exploiting my frustration to taunt me. I know that people have a tendency to give another person a hard time in a harmless way, and in some ways it is good for you to experience this, but I feel he had crossed a line. Now I have had fun hanging out with Travis, but he is on the narcissistic side. He finds ways to demonstrate his superiority over others in a myriad of ways, and he is way more interested in deploying charm, demonstrations of knowledge and so on than having any reciprocal communication. He does not talk with people or even to people, he talks \*at\* people.

Anyways, a bunch of things happened at work that resulted in us all having to work upwards of 60 hours a week for a while now and by the second week I was getting pretty agitated and so was everyone else in my department. I was not being whiny or anything, I just was not happy. Travis, of course was elated by everyone else's frustration. There were two separate occasions where Travis was telling in a teasing tone of voice ""you know, if you quit, I could get even more hours and make even more money"". Now when he says this, he is sending me a message. He is going out of his way to let me know that he does not give a shit about me and I am completely interchangeable. by the second time he said a similar variation of the quote I posted above I said, ""alright, I get it. Easy come, easy go"", he than weaseled his way out like I knew he would saying ""no, no (nervous laugh), its not that but-"". I tuned him out and continued with my work. The next day when he was working beside me he was singing the part of the queen song "" easy come, easy go A little high, little low"" while giggling to himself.  I think it is important to say that I am a good worker at my job always meeting and exceeding standards, I show up to work on time and rarely ever call in. All my coworkers like me as a coworker and a person, and I even have the responsibility of training new hires for our department. So it is not like I am some dud that needs to go. 

So this week. Travis was trying to be funny and witty and im supposed to just stand there, so I dont. Now I'm either ignoring him, or i'm waiting for him to finish, then say ""what"" then as he repeats himself I just walk away and continue working. I was supposed to hang out with him this weekend, but I decided not to spend time with him anymore. The more I ignored him, the more desperate he was to get my attention and adulation. when friday came around and we were getting ready to leave, he said gloomily ""I guess I'll see you monday"", in other words ""I guess you're not coming over"". I kept walking. I have the statement ""you know, theres other people you can talk at"" cocked and loaded for when I need it, but overall it is indifference that drives narcissistic people crazy.  they need attention, whether its praise, or even being hated. but they can not tolerate being ignored. not that I want to drive him crazy but working in the same department I have to think strategically. Personally, from the clues that I have gathered, I think his ""easy come easy go"" attitude towards the people in his life to be a desperate attempt to demonstrate to others and himself that he is in control of his inevitable social downfall. 

Now the second instance, the girl I work with, ""leslie"". She is very touch and go. one day or even one hour, shes all smiley and giggly and even flirtatious and seeks me out, then the next, she is very cold and aloof. In the smiley phase, we spend breaks together talking and laughing together in my car. She even came over to my place before and we watched a movie together and played cards and she had a great time with me saying that we should do this again. during the aloof phase she pushes me back and so I withdraw, and keep to myself. when she notices this she gives me these looks like im hurting her feelings or she approaches me asking me questions about myself and has flirtatious body language, or asks me about hanging out outside of work again. It is as if shes trying to jolt me back into desiring her, then when I do, some part of her says ""oh shit"" and she pushes me away again. either by flaking on me or even displaying, intentionally or not, flashes of almost eye-rolling contempt. This cycle has repeated several times now. 

So, with this girl I chose to withdraw, or maybe it's better to say let her withdraw from me. No grudges, because otherwise she's a nice girl. I'm not avoiding or pursuing. She is just another coworker. recently, on our lunch break I was heading to my car, and she walked fast to catch up to me. She asked me how I was doing, I said ""I'm good"" she said sarcastically ""you seem \*really\* excited to be here"". I responded ""meh I'm doing alright today, how are you?"" she said, ""I could be better"" I responded ""well thats unfortunate"". she kept following me to my car. I turned to her and said, ""alright, well you have a good rest of your lunch"". I saw the hurt in her eyes as I turned to get in my car. 

If anyone read this far, thank you for listening. If not it is ok. I journal once every few days and this online post is essentially a journal entry. it feels liberating to be able to let people go. Am I being to quick to burn bridges? I think not. I am very lonely but I am developing a healthy sense of self-worth. I make an effort to be kind and considerate towards the people that I have in my life, and I will not involve myself with others who don't value me as a person. I think society in general has chosen a very dark path and I think what I have outlined in these to stories is more or less the way of the world now.   


""We live in a death cult. A gigantic death cult, and the religion is consumption. And we react to our own commodification with narcissistic defenses. 'Hey! See me! I Am alive! Notice me, I am a human being! I am special! I have something to say to you!' The more we shout, the more we out-shout. The more we shout, the less we are heard. Everyone is trying to shout louder and louder."""

I was in a hospital multiple times, my parents thinks that I’m not going to live longer because my illness, but hey I’m alive and kicking. At the age four, I was Diagnosed with autism. When I was started school, I was bulled by others students because I was different from others. I have been punch, kick, make fun of and more, I was keep going on for years. I have no friends at school and home, my life is crap and not fun. I was not going outside because at my old neighborhood there gangs and teens, I was little around that time. So my speech was not perfect as well my spelling, I was place on IEP system, long story short, it was not perfect. Around 10 years old, 5 years of loneliness, I was fighting depression. One day I was in a living room with grandma until I was walking to my dad room, I was grabbing a belt or a hair rope, I was trying to take my life but luckily my grandma see me and call my parents, my parents and my family shamed me for my suicide attempt, I was so mad in fact I end up holding my dark thoughts to myself because of the blame I got. I was looking on my phone every day with my friends hanging out with their friends while me crying and thinking about suicide because no one want to talked to me, it still happened to this day. My interest was to join acting but my parent don’t give a crap, every time I was talking about acting and my interest, they said ok and that it. I was trying to do something interesting or making friends but they don’t care.

Tomorrow is 2 years since my ex-wife suddenly, without warning informed me that she wanted a divorce.  I've been mostly on a downward spiral since, occasionally paused when I've forced myself to take on too much work that I didn't have any free time. But any time I have free time, I'm just alone.  No real friends, no real connections.  Most of myself hidden in my hermitage.  

I gave up my dream job/career to keep my now ex-wife from having to pause or slow her career.  But now, I'm stuck in a job path that drains me, annoys me.  I just constantly feel like a failure from it all.   8+ years getting a doctorate to throw away a promising academic career so my ex could pursue hers and her career.  10+ years in a relationship/marriage to have it fall apart.  What's even the point of putting effort into anything anymore.   I don't even know why or what I'm trying to accomplish with this post.  I think I'm mostly tired of holding the loneliness in.

lonely,"Sometimes I feel okay, and then I see something that truly drives home just how pitiful and empty my life is","Sometimes I feel okay, and then I see something that truly drives home just how pitiful and empty my life is - On January 7, my grandma passed away from Covid. My family from New York came down, including my cousins. One of my cousins is super nice and extroverted. She is one of those people that are constantly surrounded by others. Always has a boyfriend, and her snapchat and Instagram stories are basically her 24/7 going out or hanging out with others. Every other day is her wishing someone a happy bday or anniversary and “omg ily so much” and I think you get the idea lol. 

For the past couple of months, and especially after my grandma died, I’ve become quieter than usual. I’m also going through issues in other areas of my life as well. So I haven’t been reaching out to people as much as usual (I’m usually the first one to reach out anyway). I’ve become very withdrawn. 

A couple weeks after my grandma died, my cousin posted on her Instagram story “thank you for the dozens of people who gave me flowers, cards, food, etc after my grandma passed, it means so much.” 

It was that moment that I realized how sad I was. I got...almost nothing. My manager at work Venmo’d me $10 for coffee and that’s it. The few friends I’ve talked to since this happened said I’m sorry for your loss. There have been others that haven’t checked in on me / talked to me since a couple weeks before she died. I’ve been having a very hard time for the past several months even without her death, and have basically dropped off the face of the earth, and almost no one has checked in on me. Not a peep. I truly feel like I could die right now and they wouldn’t find out for weeks, and then it would barely make a blip. 

*I want to make it very clear that I did not expect gifts from anyone, and I don’t hold it against anyone who didn’t get me anything. I don’t care. I just thought there was such a stark difference between the grieving experience my cousin had (supported by others) vs me (basically alone), and I think it highlights how different our lives are. I’m not sad that I didn’t get gifts, I’m sad that I don’t have the outpouring of love and friendship that she has on a daily basis.* 

I don’t want to lose any of the friends I have left and I do have a couple that put in effort (shoutout to those two people lol) but honestly I’m so tired of having to chase people. I know the world is not perfect and almost no friendship will be a perfect 50/50 partnership. There’s always someone who’s more attached to their phone, better at communicating, etc. but I feel like its almost always 90/10 or something. 

I just don’t really get the point of my life anymore. I don’t have fun, I don’t go anywhere, I don’t see anyone even without Covid. I exist to get up, go to the spare bedroom, sit at the computer and work for 9 hours, and then sit on the couch until it’s time for bed. And before anyone says to pick up some hobbies, yes I have hobbies lol it’s just that there are some days where I’m too tired or demotivated to do it. And I’m always doing them alone so sometimes it makes me sad anyway. I feel like a robot.

lonely,I feel like not having friends is keeping me single (26/m),"I feel like not having friends is keeping me single (26/m) - I've never been the most social guy. Most of my old friends live hours away, and I can count on one hand the number of times I've ""hung out"" with people that weren't family or girlfriends in the past 2 years.  


I recently broke up with a girl and have basically been left alone with the exception of family. I feel like not having friends to hang with is a turn-off for women - To add to the injury, I'm trying to get back on tinder, but have no good photos to use and no friends to take pictures with, so I havn't bothered getting on there yet.  


Idk how I""m supposed to get friends at my age, even pre pandemic I didn't find much motivation to talk to or hang with other guys and for me it's always about looking for a gf.

Don't even text me once a year to wish me happy birthday, if you're doing it to be nice. You don't need to be force yourself to be nice to random people, and let's be real, I'm a random person to you. (Even if someone texts me to wish happy birthday, it's because my bday is 01.01 so it's not that hard to remember)

At this point, I'd take that moment when you're in a falling relationship (I wouldn't know what that is like, but I think I got an idea based on some movies), and you know it only ends one way, but that would mean that I was loved once. 

I want someone to hate me, because that would mean that someone thinks about me.

I'm young, just starting my life, and I know that I won't be able to love, or to give someone a chance to love me, after all the things that already happened (or things that didn't happen) in my short life.

I want someone to care enough, to tell me that it will be ok. 

I love my life, I have everything, but I'm so painfully lonely. But thanks to this experience I know what's the most important thing in life

I want someone to get drunk with and make mistakes afterwards. Someone to run away with.

lonely,19M - Losing the ability to relate to people,"19M - Losing the ability to relate to people - This is just a long rant. I'll probably delete it not long after posting out of embarrassment. Sorry in advance.


I don't normally look on people putting long posts online about their feelings favourably - it's normally done for attention or to passive-aggressively spite people, which is hard for me to understand the value in. I guess I'm doing it myself because I want to put my frustration on paper, so to speak, and maybe one of you will have something to say about it. I'd be interested to hear, if only because I wouldn't mind speaking to someone new for a while.


I never have related well to people my age. When I was much younger it was because I was a judgemental ass who hid his insecurities and frustration in a shell of directionless anger and judgements against things and people I couldn't accept as being complex or subjective. There was a time they thought I had Aspergers. Nowadays, it's just cynicism, bitterness and being disillusioned to how petty our society actually is.


People have such easy access to instant gratification that social interaction is losing its meaning. Relationships and sex are trivialised and trust is dying. It's easier now than ever before to mislead and deceive people; it makes people like me paranoid and afraid for our own feelings.


If I were to (god forbid!) catch feelings for someone, how can I know she's not talking to six other guys on her snap or Instagram? I can't. I'd have to trust in her character, but I'm not in the business of taking risks like that with my self-esteem. Just the thought makes me feel insecure. It's pathetic, I know.


If someone leaves you on 'sent' or 'read', you can't know why that is. Maybe they say they're busy. Maybe they saw your message but didn't want to respond to it. It's very easy nowadays to assume the worst, or to do this ourselves, justifying it as no big deal when it could mean everything to someone else. It feels like rejection, irrational though it often is. I hate it.


I don't understand why so many people feel the need to post their lives on social media. If their existences are so empty that they need to find validation through meaningless gratification, likes and views from other equally shallow people, then it paints a disturbing picture of society, doesn't it?


We're all so desensitised to the things that actually matter, so addicted to that three-second dopamine rush of having a post liked, all while big tech feeds us more of the same shit and polarises people against each other for nothing.


It's probably arrogant and presumptuous of me to cast aspersions like this at my age, but I'm just so done with all it. Covid has me living out of my bedroom. My relationships have almost all fallen apart without the prospect of meeting physically. Sex is the first and only thing on most people my age's minds. Love, actual romantic love, is nigh-incomprehensible to a teenager, and any teen who says they understand it is lying to themselves and everyone else, but nobody even really seems to try anymore.


With the job I work and all that I've learned from it I now look around and think everyone my age looks so.... young. I don't know how I'll be able to deal with frivolous students who only want to drink, party and fuck when Covid is dealt with and I finally attend university, not after handling some of the responsibilities I've taken on. The social expectation will grate on my temper without a doubt.


I'm just so tired. I have three friends left and two aren't even in the same country (I live in the U.K.). I want to love and be loved but it all seems so fake when I try - and I have tried, just enough to know it's a rigged game from the start. I've been made to feel like I've failed for not having lost my virginity at 19 while my (now 18yo) brother lost his at 17 - even though I've had more relationships by far. Not short ones, either.


The worst part is having nobody to physically talk to or interact with. One lesson I've learned is that, for the good of my relationships, the people in my life shouldn't have to shoulder the burden of my emotions. Everyone's got their own shit to deal with, and trying to help someone while having no real solutions to their problems will only result in both being dragged down. My friends aren't interested in deep emotional conversation, which is just fine - I know our sessions are their form of escape too, I won't tarnish that. I love my parents dearly but with my sick mother and everything my father's dealing with I can't burden them with this.


Guess that's why I'm putting it on random internet strangers, honestly.


I don't cry, haven't for a long time. I don't get anxious, or stressed. I've never had a breakdown. I'm not suicidal, I don't think I'm even depressed. It's just... disappointment after disappointment, and I'd just like to be happy for once. I can count the number of really positive experiences I've had with my own age group on one hand. I don't even think I'm that unlikable these days!


To cut a long rant short, I want to go out with my friends, I want to have a bloody beer and I want a goddamn hug. But who doesn't, right?

lonely,Night is the worst,"Night is the worst - I have felt lonely most of my teen years and I still do. I am a 22M with depression since I was 15 yo.

I feel there is something wrong with me, like a curse. Everyone tends to forget me, stops talking to me at some point. Even though I have a girlfriend, I feel so lonely even when I am with her. She basically the only person I talk to outside my family. Lately I've started to zone out when I am with her. My mind just turns itself off. It's like I am stuck in some empty place.

At night this feeling of loneliness gets worst. From my house I can see all my town, and when I look through the windows I think I am nothing more than an ghost. I feel that if someday I go and become one with the dark night, when the sun rises next morning no one will have a single memory of me. Other times I wonder who will show up at my funeral.

There is no moon tonight. Each day the darkness calls grow stronger. I have taken different medications, I've tried different routines, tried to keep myself busy.... It never works. I may be stuck in the past, because I can't get over the fact that I lost a friend due to my untreated depression. I was a complicated case back then. I can't get over the fact that our relationship will be same as before.

Sometimes I text him, but I feel some weird energies, as if I am annoying him. To be truthful, I feel this way towards everyone. I just want to shut myself in, people always hurt me. I can't understand how relationships work, how one makes friends... My therapist says I am in the autism spectrum, but I am not autistic. In her words, my depression comes from this inability to connect to people.

Even if nights are the worst, I love them the most. At night nothing changes. During the day there are too much movement and changes."

I just have a constant empty feeling inside knowing every day will be the same as the next and I won't see anyone new. - Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I am a college student dealing with some pretty bad lonliness right now. I had one friend that I got to see over the summer and over winter break, but outside of that it has literally just been my parents.

I spent August - December basically all by myself, which took a severe toll on my mental health. My insomnia rerurned. I was always in a passive and depressed mood. I didn't look foreward to anything. I have no social interraction.

I didn't have many friends even before covid due to introvertedness/social shyness, and so now not only am I always alone, but no one reaches out to talk to me. I can go DAYS without recieving a text or snap.

lonely,Comfortable with being alone,Comfortable with being alone - I think my whole life its just been certain times where I HAVE to be alone. Everytime my life is unraveling and I lose people who I viewed as special who end up hurting me and I lose pretty much all the friends that I thought I was cool with I always have to deal with this horrible time alone. So I end up doing stuff for myself. I'm not selfish in anyway but you obviously have to do things for yourself but this time I do it without someone else in my mind and what they would think or if they would be proud of it. I'm solely just doing things to make myself proud and I always have to be the one to pick myself up again after my heart gets broken. Which then leads to a time where I actually feel happy and I can finally share my life with others. In a way its sad that I haven't found that special girl that will stick with me through the bad and stressful parts of my life to come out on the other side with me together to enjoy the happiness that follows. I hope I explained that well enough. I struggle writing my feelings out. But it seems like I'm always alone when I need someone the most and then I'm never alone when I don't need anyone in my life to a point. Its still hard for me to go up to girls and talk to them because I'm shy and I think people misinterpret being shy with having no confidence but In my head I know I can confidently talk to her if a situation arises and I know I can turn the charm on lol but I'm to shy to start something from scratch. I just don't feel the need to talk to a random person whether I have a crush on her or not. I'm not scared of being rejected either but I'm literally just way to damn shy. I also feel that things in life happen for a reason. So if its meant to be it should happen no matter what obstacles there are.

Otherwise they'll just forget your existence.

lonely,I’m 21 and never had a boyfriend,"I’m 21 and never had a boyfriend - *Hey! I’m gonna tell you my hole love life story right now, so you can go down to the TL;DR if you want the general idea...


Hello! Well I’m female and I’m 21 years old and I’ve never had a boyfriend. I had this “topic” bothering me since secondary school.

I had my teenage crush but as a typical teenager I adored him and even he was super mean and Un-respectful I still really liked him and that hurt so much to the point of lowing my self esteem and me having to go to therapy. 

Then on high-school I had a crush again but never talked to him, then I had another crush who was my friend but I really didn’t felt in love that much so nothing happened. Also another boy from high school supposedly I thought  he liked me but never talked with him really and months later he had a girlfriend.

Until that point that really was it, no one had really confessed to me or something trough those years... (something I believe important to mention is that the schools I’ve been in are private and with very small groups)

Then I got to college and since the first day I felt deeply in love with a boy. I really really liked him, but also I think at that point I was really “desperate” and impatient, I remember being kind of obsessed with him even thought we didn’t know each other very much... I also remember getting super nervous next to him and acting weird and some times he would say “and  where is the boyfriend?” but also I felt like he didn’t care that much about me... I knew it he was pretty indifferent almost all the time. 

Later on in a facebook poll I wrote something and he commented that he used to think that I liked him, then I didn’t say anything. I remember I cried rivers for him! It really felt horrible and I felt heartbroken. Those situations were extremely painful for me. 

At that time I began to look for info about being over sensitive or over caring bc I felt that way but didn’t really take it seriously. 

But oh the suffering wasn’t done there, let me continue, there was another guy in my college I started to talk with and we became friends quickly, he used to text me everyday and I started to fall in love with him, but he was weird, sometimes super nice and cute and then very mean and awful, this kept on and on until it got to a toxic  friends relationship for me, in which he’d be super careless and I’d be over caring, but he still would look for me al the time.

Parallel to this another friend of school started to talk to me a little more and in a Halloween party we danced, a day after, a friend told me that this guy whom with I danced with in the hallowing party liked me and had a crush on me. I was pretty exited!! &lt;It was the first time I found someone was in love with me&gt; But at that time I was in love with the other =toxic= guy, this lead to me liking both of them, and some times being turn of by one or the other or turned on and so on...

After all of this freaking drama I started to go out to the cinema or hanging out with the guy from the Halloween party, who was super cute and fun! But we hanged out as friends, he never really had confessed or insinuated something... everything was going alright and I almost was deciding on him when suddenly.... the pandemic began!!! We all went to lock down and he returned to his home town.

At this point I was feeling supper puzzled and my friends encouraged me to confess to the =toxic= boy (yes I was still a little obsessed with him and also to finally finish that business) and well, I did! &lt;I had never done such sort of thing before&gt; And oh well, he told me that he used to like me at the beginning when we started to talk, and then he started better seeing me as a friend, that he had a crush with another girl and anyways that he wasn’t a “love relationship person” that puzzled me so much, broke my heart and felt the agony again, and cried rivers.... again!

Even tough the suffering of the moment, It also felt really eye opening! For the first time, I felt released and free and the burden I had carried 1+ year was gone! I also learnt from that experience that the most important thing of them all is to self love!!!!! I started to love myself so much, my body, my mind and my soul. I started to meditate and etc.

After this I stopped longing for love, for a relationship and being so desperate, I even felt more free and wiser!!! 

Meanwhile I kept chatting and making calls with the boy from the Halloween party! It was only for fun and to know him better, I felt desperate no more, sometimes I was deeply in love with him and others I was a little turned off (gotta be honest) and that’s it, until today have being waiting for him to confess or say something else but we keep hanging as “friends”  it’s hard to tell, also college is ending this year and he lives in another city now and wants to stay there so maybe he is giving up on “us” but still wants to have me in his life? I don’t know but I feel pretty calm, sometimes I feel the need of looking for other people, but also he is my friend and I love him... and that’s it!!! Lol finally!! If you reached  here thank you so so much for reading my story!

Now... in conclusion: WTF! Hahahahaha, for some context of how I am: I have an ambivert personality type, sometimes I’m too shy with people I don’t know. But also too outrageous and loud with my friends/family. I’m creative and artsy! I like to make ppl laugh, I’m super passionate and my friends tell me I fall in love with everyone, and maybe that’s true, I truly always look at the beauty of people! 

-I am a little scared of confessing somebody that I like them, I feel I still have sequels from my secondary crush. Also I think I don’t really know how to act flirty? Do you just say =hey you handsome=? That’s not natural for me... and nobody has ever asked me on a date.

Physically I’m 1.60m tall, and I have average weight, with clock sand body type and a big butt 🤭😂 I believe my face is also a little above average beauty and I love to use makeup. I have dark hair and I dyed it colorful pink and purple. Also people say I look much younger than my age! 

And that’s it, I feel pretty sad and frustrated I don’t know how people do it... I always have had the hopes that destiny would bring me someone special, and I believe I fall in love so easily. I don’t know what to do... the worst is I’ll never even get married but oh well...

There’s no requirement of how long / what it has to be, it’s just a way to share and hear things that we might not have when sitting alone at home!

Even though I expect it by now it still hurts more and more each time. I wish I was the kind of person who doesn’t mind that I’ll most likely spend the rest of my life alone but I’m not.

lonely,Can i talk about my problem that has to do with promises? I have been worrying for this problem for 2.5 years. everyday almost!,"Can i talk about my problem that has to do with promises? I have been worrying for this problem for 2.5 years. everyday almost! - I used to fight my ocd compulsions by making promises to Christian God and maybe asking for punishment in case breaking the promise. I was foolishly, trying to use the fear of punishment to force myself stop doing the compulsions. I could not ignore my ocd. It kept bugging me like ""do the compulsion! do the compulsion"" and if I did not do it, I could not calm down. It was always on my head like ""you must do it. you must do the compulsion""

So, I was making those promises (not do the compulsions) and asking for punishment in case breaking it, in order to threaten myself to stop worrying for the compulsions. I explained myself that I do not want to make those promises and that I am making them because of my ocd. However, I explained that I would only mean a promise only if I would understand what I am promising, if I mean it and if I validate by doing the cross sign 3 times.

I worry that I may have been forced by my anxiety to mean and validate those promises. I remember one time that I stopped at 2 cross and canceled the promise. (almost validated it).

What if there are other promises that I fully made the cross sign 3 times and validated them as real promises but forgot them? what if I asked for that specific punishment that ocd is threating me with? What if other Gods accepted the promise if in case Christian God is not real?"

lonely,How to accept my Insecurities and Loneliness,"How to accept my Insecurities and Loneliness - I used to cry myself to sleep every night because of my appearance but now I’ve been completely numb to it. 

I used to continuously attack my self-esteem by constantly thinking about how lonely and pathetic my life is, how I would never find a partner, or experience what a ‘date’ would be like or ever be married to a person. I know I’ll always be alone so why can’t I accept that? Why do I continuously day dream about finally finding a person who would accept and love me unconditionally? I’m just self inflicting more pain by constantly reminding myself about how undesirable I’am.

All my friends are constantly texting me about their relationships, dates, and the countless guys and girls that text them. But all it does is remind me is how lonely I’am.

How can I accept my loneliness and insecurities so I can finally be happy? 

I don’t want a partner because I don’t want someone to love me if I can’t love myself, it would be a burden on them to deal with my low self esteem. I just want to get past these emotions so I can stop caring about it. I want to be comfortable being alone."

lonely,Maybe I just have a shit personality.,"Maybe I just have a shit personality. - I've always been a lonely guy. I have to say thou I have amazing friends. But on the relationship side of things I've been lonely. In 19 years I never kissed anyone or had a girlfriend. This really bothers me cause most of the time I feel like things as kissing are kind of expected to be mastered at this age.

Anyway I've downloaded tinder. As many times before. Everytime I used tinder I only got like 2 matches if im lucky. But since the last time I downloaded it I started to take more care of my looks. And this time it actually went really good. I got a shitton of matches even though I really was picky. I always blamed me being lonely on my looks so this was really odd to me. I wrote with so many people. The problem is that every conversation dies off after a day or two. I'm so frustrated. I always thought my looks were my problem and now that I finally sorted that out everything will be better. But at this point I'm just questioning my personality.

What if just have a horrible personality? What if all these years I was just ignorant to the fact that my uglieness isn't the problem? What if I'm actually just a really toxic person?

I don't want to be toxic. I don't want to be bad. But I don't even know for sure if I am. I just can't tell. I'm so lost at the moment. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this here. Maybe someone has some experience with these thoughts."

lonely,First time on reddit,"First time on reddit - First time here I don’t really know what to say or how to say it but I really feel like I need to vent. I am feeling so desperately lonely and restless. I haven’t been sleeping well. At night it feels unbearable, I wake up multiple times and feel like I just need to run away and when I wake up in the morning I am sad and full of dread. A lot of the day I pretend I’m talking to this person I have a crush on who lives far away, telling them about my thoughts, feelings, etc. It feels pitiful and creepy to me, but I’m just trying to get through. I know they are not thinking about me as much as I’m thinking of them. I’ve been wanting a relationship for a while or some passion at least and have had very few meaningful encounters for a long time. 

During COVID I’ve only been with my family. I lived with my parents for a while and then moved into an apartment alone in a new city nearby some of my siblings. I’m really grateful to have consistent support right now, but I feel like I’m suffocating with how small my world is. Today I called my mom because I didn’t know what else to do, I felt so messed up. Then I had to hold the phone away from my ear as she went off with the same platitudes that I am tired of hearing - it’ll get better, it will change, go for a walk, etc. I wanted to scream. I know her intentions are good and she is struggling with her own isolation right now. I really don’t know what anyone could say to me to relieve this pressure. 

You know when you are so lonely you feel sick? I keep reminding myself I am not alone, that we are all connected. I do believe we are deeply connected and I try to open myself up to that and open myself up to the love that is already here. But I’m howling at the moon here! I so badly want romantic love, intimacy, to be touched. I’ve felt painfully lonely before but I’ve never experienced this feeling of desperation and panic. I’m a woman approaching her 30s ..maybe it’s my biological clock? Just finding it really hard to be at this stage in my life and the only people I see in person are my siblings and their significant others. I know it could be worse, I know I have much to be grateful for, I know things will change. But right now I’m screaming on the inside, feeling trapped, and I just want a big hug from someone that isn’t related to me .

It is the only time i do not feel alone, which for me is sadder. 

I have to pretend to not be me. I am friends with all the characters. But that is my only interaction. Aside from some posts on here. I watch movies. They are the only friends i have right now and they always know what to say. They always know how to resolve problems. And they are always there for me. 

I miss going to the movies, but i feel like i do not want to go anymore because then i will be sharing my friends with others. It is my only way to cope with the loneliness i feel everyday. And i have no way to express how nice it is to see my friends every night before bed."

Feeling lonely for a while now. Hard to explain. It is an empty feeling. Like I lost something or never had it. - Male , 48. For years i feel lonely. I strongly miss true connection with people. Most people seem so superficial nowadays. I've been through rough years and i lost many so called friends there. (long story). I am looking for people that are not afraid to write about their feelings, experiences, doubts, thoughts, emotions, regrets, laughs, and so on. I am not one to talk about work or material stuff. 

I also like to write long e-mails (preferably, every day)

I love music and the 80s are my favorite era! So music is always a great topic as well.

I am a sucker for movies like 13 gone 30, Breakfast Club, Say Anything, 10 things i hate about you, 16 candles. 

I am a soft person, nostalgic, some self confidence issues (looks) and i often wish i could go back in time (hence my profile name). Often feel i do not belong in this world. -&gt; like it is too hard and messy out there, especially now.

Would love to hear from likeminded people,  age isnt a big issue, hence i am in my 40's  i think its normal that if people approach me they are at least 20+ but lets say between 30-50 years old would be awesome. Please be sincere (gone through pain enough) and do not start a conversation with only ""hi"" or write 3 words and then ghost me. I prefer women to write (don't know, often they are the ones that reply due to my profile text is too soft for men i guess LOL) , so if you are interested than drop me a message and i would love to see if we can become close (penpal)friends.

One thing: I am not looking for romance. Please respect that. A soulmate can just as easily be a very close friend(ship)"

lonely,I expect too much.,"I expect too much. - I am sitting at home on a long holiday weekend with no one i can call up to hang out with. The one friend i have lives with housemates her age and hangs out with them during long weekends.

During the last decade i have pushed away a man who i loved to the ends of the earth because he was more commited to making his parents happy by agreeing to an arranged marriage.

I pushed away a decade long friendship because she had married and had different priorities and we had grown apart but kept on trying to naks things work..and i felt that i was trying harder at some point. The last straw was when she invalidated my feelings over a situation i felt really hurt about.

I pushed away my father after his decades long verbal and psychological abuse of my mother amongst other things.

I pushed away another friend who also invalidated my feelings over an issue of constantly rescheduling meet ups just because someone else we knew was invited too and could not make it. It always became a  3 sided friendship where it seemed like the others had plans and meet ups with me were the lowest thing on the totem pole.

Those hurt bad, but nothing compared to having to put to sleep my cat of 3 years. I pushed myself into making the decision to end her misery too soon knowing she could live more weeks or even months..but i never regret it knowing that it would only bring her more suffering..so i pushed her away too.

And then i find myself asking the same question..why am i alone? why am i unlovable? Why does everyone else find love and friendships and relationships when i have never met a man who thought of me as more than a side piece. When even the long term friends i had ,were not able to understand my hurt ..then what chance do i have of finding friends who can understand me?"

lonely,i lost touch with everyone after graduation,"i lost touch with everyone after graduation - I graduated high school this last year (2020), so when covid really hit the US. I guess you could say I lost my friends closer to March than after my graduation, but nonetheless, I have practically no friends now. The only person I really talk to is my boyfriend because we live together, but other than that, i talk to one person for about one minute a day (usually not even a real convo, just to keep our snap streak...). Everyone always told me how you lose contact with *most* people after graduation, but i’ve lost pretty much every friend I had. The friend group I was in for years is still in tact for the most part, i’m just not invited to anything. I feel so left out and lonely 24/7. I love my boyfriend dearly and i’m grateful for all the time we spend together but he and I both know that friendships are important. 

I’ve always had a hard time putting myself out there to make friends, I’m in no way a loner or reject, I’ve just always been shy. The only people who spark conversations with me are random guys who don’t care to be friends (if you catch my drift here). 

I just miss having friends who would want to see me. I miss school in a weird way only because I had a normal social life. I miss having a fucking life at all. I miss going to marching band and being surrounded by all my friends. I miss going to shows and going in pits. I miss going to amusement parks and museums and parks and parties. I feel so fucking lonely. My cat and boyfriend are the reason why I haven’t literally offed myself in the past months. I feel like i’m not worthy of friends. My boyfriends friends have been nothing but kind and welcoming to me but those are HIS friends and I feel bad and weird for being a part of every aspect of his life. I have no individuality. i wish i had friends. my boyfriend always tells me to just put myself out there but i have nothing to show for. i’m so over feeling this way. i just need friends. FUCK."

Middle aged and alone, I picked up and moved to be close to my parents so I’d have someone to talk to. The isolation of COVID really put me into a deep depression. 

In June I got a puppy to help me with my anxiety and isolation. He’s become a reactive young dog who lunges and barks at people. He’s bitten me a few times and has bitten my dad. He can’t be left alone without hurting himself and destroying his environment. Walks are a nightmare. I’ve spent most of my money on this move and training for him. I want to love him as much as he deserves but at ten months he’s hard work most of the time. 

Please don’t shame me about this. I know I should have known better. 

I’m now in a new city teaching remotely and unable to afford going back should we teach in person again this year. It was a big gamble moving here but I was at the end of my ability to cope without seeing other people in person.

lonely,Only I that has become a whole different person since childhood?,"Only I that has become a whole different person since childhood? - As I'm 18, I've just recently left childhood, but when I think back like 3 years I can remember this outgoing person that had multiple friends. She was bullied, but still had what she considered as friends and felt happy. She had hobbies, after school activities and did fairly well in school. Even worked as a mailwoman on weekends and earned $100 a month.

Nowadays as I'm about to leave high school, I've got no friends, I've forgotten how to communicate and every single inch of life makes me anxious. I just got a panic attack from walking around in my own home?? Like I don't even need to leave this house to feel anxious. I barely eat anymore, and when I do eat it's mostly junk food or just disgusting stuff I made up in a few minutes. Yesterday it was oatmeal with coconut milk and cinnamon for breakfast, and cereal for lunch, and a pizza for dinner. That's the most I've eaten this week on 1 day.

It's insane. I feel like an alien to myself. I feel alienated by society. Whenever I walk out of my house, I get weird looks from my neighbours as they barely see me go outside anymore. I go out like once a week to go to the grocery store.

Only I that feel like this? That I've become a whole different person and feel kinda alienated by myself?"
lonely,Alien,"Alien - Whenever I see a group of people I always wonder how they just connect so easily. I wonder if it’s just the way they look, music taste (I like skate punk, punk rock, pop punk) or just something else entirely. I always wondered wether it was my taste in music, since it’s not very popular. And when I do find people with my taste in music they always end up being my best mates because we have something big to talk about. I don’t know if it’s just me feeling this disconnection with people but I hope this finds some well."

lonely,Worrying for something that I cant remember!,"Worrying for something that I cant remember! - 2.5 years ago, I used to fight my ocd by making rushed promises to Christian God about not doing the compulsions and asking for punishment in case breaking them in order to use the fear of punishment to force myself stop doing compulsions. i did not want to make promises, it was just a way to find some relief from my ocd.

There was a time that I remember being anxious as if I may have made a promise or as if I broke one. I cant remember if really, made one or if I was having uncontrolled thoughts (intrusive) about a promise. What if it was a real prayer (real promise)? I now, worry that maybe other Gods (nonspecific) accepted that hypothetical promise if in case Christian God is not real.

I have tried to make clear in the past, that I do not want to make promises and that I am making them because of my ocd. I tried to make clear that a promise would count only if I understand what I am doing, if I mean it and if I validate it by doing the cross signs 3 times.

About that hypothetical promise. I cant remember if I did the cross sign 3 times. I'cant remember if it was a real prayer about a promise or if they were just, intrusive thoughts about a promise. I remember being very anxious. It was 2.5 years ago.

I worry that by trying to remember that event or writing about it in reddit, I may have broken that hypothetical promise. Why? If I made one, I may have said that I will never bother myself with that. (that compulsion). By trying to remember if I made one, maybe broke the hypothetical promise and counted as if I bothered myself with it?

I just, have some memories of me being anxious about a compulsion and walking away and looking back (accidentally) and then, worrying that by looking the compulsion may have broken the promise or something like that. I am not sure. I cant remember if it was just, intrusive thoughts or a real promise.

I remember one other time, I passed something on the street and ocd was telling me to check it and I got a bad feeling. A ""must not do it"". Probably, because returning to check it was written in my subconscious as something wrong/bad. And some other times, if something was falling from my hands and was behind me, I was worrying to turn around to see what fell or something like that.

Probably, all those bad feelings came from that time that there was a compulsion and I was worrying about something. I just, cant remember if I made a promise (real or just, intrusive thoughts) about not redoing the compulsion or not bother myself with it ever again. I remember some intense worrying that time. Worrying because of a real promise in form of prayer? I do mot think so. I remember a a memory like a very short gif of me looking back and then, worrying. Somehow it feels as if it fits. Probably intrusive thoughts about a promise and then, accidentally looking back the compulsion and worrying that I may have broken the ""fake"" promise. I cant remember doing the cross signs to validate any real promise or praying about a promise for real.

Still, I worry. What if I made a real promise and validated it?"
lonely,Well... just got rejected by a guy.,"Well... just got rejected by a guy. - My friends were encouraging me to tell my friend that I like him, so I did by writing a note with a pen that’s his favorite color. It only said “I think you’re cute.” and he responded with “oh thank you, i like your handwriting.” 

I followed up with stuff about the pen but he ignored me. I’m pretty sure he just didn’t know how to say he’s not interested, he’s shy. Oh well. At least I tried, right? 

It really sucks because it’s this close to valentine’s day, and he’s a friend of mine. I guess I made that friendship awkward now, and I’ll be crushed this Valentine’s.

lonely,lost my only friend,"lost my only friend - I had one friend with benefits and we had lots of fun and passionate times in bed and also he would help me in my life and give me sweet advice. he had a demanding job though so he didn’t have as much time for me as either of us would like 

however recently i have gained weight and have been way less popular, more overlooked/ignored and not complimented as much by people in general anymore. 
i used to get complimented by others a lot more. i work in a looks and tips based industry and haven’t been doing well at work at all anymore and it makes me feel so insecure and when i see recent photos of myself i hate them so much. 

he never complimented me but he’d compliment other girls to me, he told me that he wishes he’d be able to get to be with a hot girl etc and if i ever asked why he doesnt compliment me he’d basically say “pussy is pussy” and he’ll fuck anything. 
one time we even had group play with another couple and he was complimenting that other girl to me and recently he told me she was the best out of all the girls we had met together. 

i got really upset and insecure lately and i reminded him how he said she was the best girl and like i said he finds her better than me and like i told him it feels bad to sleep with someone who thinks im too ugly to compliment but would compliment other women to me. 
anyway at first he forgave me but then i kept saying it and i know i went too far and really hurt me and him i guess. 
but he’s the only man ive slept with and now im no longer popular and slim i feel terribly insecure and he can’t even help with that. 

other men do compliment me but tbh im kind of the forever alone type if it wasn’t for my fwb. i’ve never clicked with anyone else and guys usually just want sex and i will never give a guy sex without commitment again tbh 

i wanted him to do something for valentine’s day with me but now i dont even have maybe the last friend i would ever have :( 
in some ways he was an amazing friend but in some ways not good obviously.

Palindrome! Maybe and two days onward begin the great foolish festival. Oh! Did I tell you I had started liking someone and had hoped I would be loved back too but alas, all in vain. Whatever, an intuitive loner remains a loner whatever the situation begets and never falls for the same trap twice. He understands those lies, sweet beautiful lies, all that people blabber throughout the day. Or it is an obvious fallacy to fall into love or expect something from other people. It must be wonderful and dreadful to be anonymous or maybe it’s my paranoia that I’m typing these shits. Truth is I’m tired; tired of living; tired of pretending; tired of seeing people’s faces. Every day for some brief period there is a moment when I just want to give up but I don’t have the courage. And some days there is such a violent rage within that rather than ending my own life, I want to take some of the idiots down with me who didn’t seem to get past my behavior. Whenever I have these thoughts something inside me echoes like hey idiot! this is Kafkaesque; move your fucking ass, distract or it’s going to be worse. Luckily the servile me does what needs to be done. Smoking, Masturbating, Cooking, Running, watching the same You-tube shit again and again until the feeling subsides &amp; there I’m the new normal until they return. And the great things about these thoughts are they are just random, either while sitting in the office or lying on the bed, even walking!"

lonely,I need more people to talk to,"I need more people to talk to - For the last week or so Ive felt an uncomfortable loneliness feeling. Ive recently moved out of my parents’ place where I was the eldest of many younger siblings, and had the deepest connection with the youngest ones. I was the main babysitter as my parents were rarely around and sometimes it felt as if I was the mother of the younger two. I miss them a lot to the point of crying when I see their photos (im so emotional when Im alone) but whenever I try to visit, the responsibilities become too cumbersome and stressful. I moved out to have a clearer head and work on my own life and career (currently I work from home, a bit of an entrepreneur so I dont even have any coworkers to talk to) Being from a large family, and popular in school, I can definitely call myself an extrovert. I enjoyed just being surrounded by people either at home or in a small school community. I love pointless or meaningful conversations with the kids when I wasnt working because it just always felt so genuine and they were not only good listeners but also good contributors to the conversation in general. 
Now I have a lot of time on my own, and I have all the time in the world to quietly work on things but a wave of sudden loneliness struck me, being alone with my thoughts for too long is really affecting me. I keep trying to make plans with friends, people in the same work style as I am or even just reaching out to my closest friends to have even just a small talk. However, theyre all too busy and donot want to discuss anything with me from how their day has been to the depressing thoughts Ive been having. I feel like they might consider it a chore to talk to me. I used to have very close internet friends that would help me out of these very depressing loneliness pits but we all ended up drifting apart. Lately it feels like no one wants to spend anytime discussing things with me, as if Im just annoying, repetitive or boring? or as if they are just way too busy, but im going insane. I just need a distraction that involves communicating with other human beings.

 I was wondering if there are any specific sub-reddits or communities dedicated to just the ramblings of lonely people who just want to talk to someone that will listen and/or appreciate what the other is saying???
Thanks to whoever reads this &lt;3

I got bombed with downvotes for asking a fucking question.

I know that I should grow a thicker skin but that's just one of the things that's bugged the hell out of me during my time on Reddit, and I honestly just wanted to vent about it.

The last time I actually considered myself as having friends was in high school, and I just turned 27 five days ago. So it’s been a while. 

When I got older I started turning to men and relationships to ease the pain of feeling so alone. Which of course led to me doing things I didn’t truly want to do, just to get some attention. I’m tryyyying hard to break from that pattern but it’s so difficult. 

I’m recently single for the first time since I was 20 and I’m isolated because of the pandemic. I just feel like I have no one in my corner or to talk to. I have no close friends at all, only internet acquaintances.

I keep trying to make some friends, but frankly speaking i'm a boring and (i suspect) unpleasant person to be around. My interests are niche and even if i try to be a good listener, there is not much to work with since i don't speak much or speak too much about what they don't care so conversations end despite my efforts.

On my first birthday and was born the same day as me that corrupted me but at they end of summer I was feeling more better I had no cares but that also gave me a wake up call on how I was treating  my body and I needed to change physically and mentally but during October and November I had a fought time I went back to cutting myself and hating me feeling like people were watching me making fun of my everywhere like they are seeing me in my house somehow but my recover has been going up and I have been dealing with my mental health physical and my thoughts I still have those days but if you a kid younger then me or even older than me I’m want you to know people who are just like you always make it out and you need to talk to someone I haven’t even talked to anyone about it yet or as much as know yet you need time to heal you need to give yourself strength and strive to dig  yourself out of the tunnel"
lonely,Lonely Rant,"Lonely Rant - I realized how alone I was after a major depressive episode at 19. It strengthened me though, and exposed my flaws to the surface like pox. Once I had sank to the bottom of that pit and hit the bottom, I learned some forms of focus and presence somewhat like the teachings of zen meditation. Mostly it helped me keep my mind quiet, which allowed me to overcome my anxiety and honestly just stay high performance mode in life. 

I avoid books mostly, for time reasons, but also because my old self could get lost in them, books are great but I’m already so lonely I don’t want to rely on that imaginary world.

So I used the crutch of an online world(s), but it’s a dark place, now that I’m in my 30s I feel more isolated than ever in video games. It’s hard to make friends in video games, I can’t commit the time and energy, I feel like I’m drifting away from all relationships again, the main difference is I have a salary and a fiancée.

The one silver lining could be fitness. I now have a garage I plan to convert to a home gym, and I can get resistance bands for swimming in the pool. I’ve crept up to 230lbs from my fighting weight of 185lbs in high school. I think if I could get back under 200lbs maybe that’s all I need to feel “good” again.

Wish I had a way to connect with people again, played league of legends since closed beta, maybe talk to one person on my list in a year if I push for the effort. My friends list capped out in like season 5, yet I can barely find people to play with...

Not sure where I fit in the world anymore, I’m not giving up, just giving in, accepting I’ll lead a mostly lonely life with myself as my closest companion. 

Maybe I should of stuck it out in college, but not sure that being a pharmacist would feel any more fulfilling than staring at excel all day. Planting trees sounds great, not sure I could find a job doing that permanently local to my area though. 

The real winners are people who keep strong social circles their whole life, I’ve drifted or lost so many and now it’s just brain scars of when I was less lonely. Same with prior relationships, I feel bad for my fiancée but I just don’t have the same vigor and energy for life that I did before I met her, feel like I’m selling her short since I don’t feel like that version of me will come back, it’s not so much that it’s self defeating, I just don’t feel the same fire anymore.


Melancholy is fierce, maybe I should find an outdoor job, not sure I can afford a pay cut with a shared mortgage. (No suicidal thoughts, just that severe sense of being alone all the time). 

Feel like I could try to channel this depressive energy into some kind of creative outlet, but I guess that would require the discipline to write everyday, or learn how to paint or draw or something.... 

Musics good, but not helpful, it’s like a shared siren song, and when you try to play something upbeat it’s just jarring when it’s not the vibe your in. 

Hitting the 30s is also sad, because even though I can still theoretically do whatever I want with my life, it’s not the same as when your in your 20s. Nothing to argue, it’s just facts.

Pet in the future maybe, but not sure I want the stress of being the primary pet parent who has to do 90% of the training and then making sure she also keeps the pets routine to avoid breaking its training from conflicting commands.

Biggest plus is rarely smoke Mary j these days, that helped a little bit, not as much as I wanted. Almost never drink anymore(wasn’t alcoholic). Maybe getting back on one of these overpriced meal plans will help with my mood and energy.

I tend to overthink a lot when left alone with just my mind, so what I do is I would constantly always do something to distract me, I am always doing something to prevent overthinking about how lonely I am and how I’m gonna die alone, how my dog is gonna die, etc.

Because of my loneliness, I kinda became over imaginative, having a pretend group of friends, to just straight up talking to myself.

When I asked why she didn't want me near her friends  She said I don't want you near my friends She also didn't want me around the bowling alley which is all she does is bowling. We hangout once a week for no more then an hour then she's back at her friends house. I was even more devasted that she wouldn't even see me for the gifts. I was having anxiety and was depressed about her keeping everything private and her saying I'll talk to you in person just made me more depressed because she just kept giving me an attitude about it and didn't care how I felt. I was worried that she may have been being stalked or something and wanted to talk right then and now, not a week when we hang out again.. I told her about this and she said it's not my fault you feel that way. I was going to wait to see her in person but the next day my stomach hurt so bad I felt like I was going to throw up over the whole situation. She said bowling is time away from me and she loves it. I said okay. I asked if we could meet after bowling one day. She said Friday won't work because I'm tired afterwords. I asked about Thursday and this made me break up with her. She said no because there are old people at the bowling alley and they are mean to her and will likely be mean to me too. She talks about how she always gets along with everyone at the bowling alley. I think she was just lying to me about the old people being mean to her and I told her were through and blocked her from messaging me. I unfollowed her on Instagram and deleted her on Facebook and just feel like shit. I think she's cheating on me with these guys from bowling and didn't want me to know. She also never comes over my house she did once for a half hour and left but she never came over again. She just continues to stay with her friends from bowling 4 times a week and her parents the other 3 times. She told me she loved me since college which was like 4 years ago, she knew me from a distance. We didn't really know each other until early December and then we became boyfriend and girlfriend and I loved her too until she wanted to be secretive with me. She told me no one else knew about our relationship except her family but in reality I think she was dating me and one of the guys she lived with and didn't want me to know. I just feel like shit. Can anyone relate?"
lonely,I want to find love but I am terrified of intimacy and committment,"I want to find love but I am terrified of intimacy and committment - Does anyone else fantasize about being in love, when in reality you’re afraid of relationships? The thought of committing to one person or possibly breaking up with them is terrifying. So many friends have had terrible abusive relationships and breakups, and I am so scared it will happen to me. Not to mention, I am so scared that people won’t like “the real me”. Like I’m not really good enough for anyone, and it is only a matter of time before they realize that. 

I don’t get attention from guys very often, but when I do I freak out. A while ago, I got a direct message from someone I actually kinda liked telling me they thought I was pretty and saying they wanted to get to know me more. I was so flattered and I felt like I was on top of the world. Someone finally liked me! But then panic set in. It was a simple compliment but I had a full-on panic attack. I just couldn’t do it. It’s like I want to be loved but I am too scared of relationships to take action on anything, or even respond to anyone else’s advances. I ended up just kinda ghosting him cause I got too scared. I’ve done the same thing with other guys in the past too. My friend told me that when the right person comes along, I won’t be afraid of them. But I cant help but think that will never happen. I will always be afraid of relationships and I will just be alone forever."

lonely,Be careful what you wish for,"Be careful what you wish for - For years I have felt lonely. I craved the urge to have someone by my side. Some nights I would feel anxiety over being alone. Not having someone to talk to, someone to hold, someone to spend time with. Eventually things changed. I met someone.

I believe that most of us here feel more joy than others do when we find someone to save them from being lonely. I know I did. I felt like I had it all. Things moved a little too quickly. After a couple of months we had a kid and got married. We even received a house as a wedding gift. 

Fast forward two years later and I feel more lonely than ever before. We don't talk, don't have sex, our child is the only thing we talk to each other about. We tried therapy several times, but we are on two completely different planets. Every night I sit here wondering if there is anyone out there feeling the same way. I am thankful for my son, he is one of the few things that keeps me going.

Please, if you find someone take it slow or you will end up feeling more lonely than before."

lonely,"lost my job, very little social interaction left :(","lost my job, very little social interaction left :( - I didn't realize how alone I was after losing my job this Tuesday.

I knew I got a decent amount of social interaction from said job- I have plenty of coworkers that I'd consider to be good friends, who I talk to about personal issues, and they even texted me asking how I was once I was let go. Now I'm in the unfortunate situation that perhaps we were only ""friends"" because we worked alongside each other 4-5 days a week. 

This can't be entirely the case because they texted me saying stuff like ""I hope we can see each other again"" and ""I'd love for us to say in touch"" but I've messaged back and received no prior response. It's probably because they're busy and employed lol but it just hurts being a lower-level option.

One other thing that really hurts is that I do not live alone, I live with some family, but we don't talk too often (age gaps; old parent, young, young siblings). I had intended to move out and sign a lease just this week, one closer to my ex-place of employment, but being that I have lost the source of income, this isn't feasible. 

The reason I lost my job is that it was difficult to commute to. After two years and one relocation to a larger but further branch, they decided to pull the plug. The reason I was moving was to greatly shorten the commute (from a 40 minute bus ride to a 15 minute walk). One thing holding me back was lack of socialization, I would have liked a roommate but I was between two old school friends. 

Now I'm unemployed, at home, feeling stuck in a pit."

lonely,"Even after I got a Job, I feel like nothing has changed...","Even after I got a Job, I feel like nothing has changed... -  

After I finished School, I had very bad anxiety and depression do to heavy mobbing during my school time. I then lived at my parents home for about 3 Years. During this Time, I never left my room, spoke only a couple of sentences per day with my parents and was pretty much as secluded from society as one can be. I didn't even played online games or communicated with anyone on the internet. I started to loose interest to things that used to bring my joy. It got so bad that I would spend up to 16 Hours in bed. When I was awake I would mindlessly browse the Internet.

After about two years, I new that I couldn't continue living like that. I did go to a therapist during this time, but he didn't seem to know what he was supposed to do to help me. These sessions were very awkward and I decided to not continue because I didn't see how that would do me any good. A couple of months later I found out about a government funded program that was supposed to reintegrate people with disabilities into job market \[I was diagnosed with Asperger long time ago\]. Do to this program I actually managed to find a job.

It was difficult to adapt in the beginning and I was very anxious, but after a while I started to manage. Do to this Job I can afford to life on my own. In the past, I would always think that this would be the point at which I will be happy; when I have a job and my own apartment to live in. But that wasn't the case at all. When Im at work, I spend almost all of my time in front of a Computer and my coworkers speak only to me when they want something from me.

I would even go as far and say that I feel lonelier now than during my NEET phase. Back than, I at least had hope that when I get a Job one day, my social life would improve and I will feel needed and be happy. Now I feel like there really isn't anything I can do anymore. I have a job, tried therapy and read every self help book available. There isn't anything I work towards to, nothing that I peruse.

The loneliness really gets to my. I feel like I am addicted to a drug that doesn't exist."

A girl actually noticed me in class and introduced her self. Typically in all my classes I go unnoticed and I feel like I don't exist. But today a girl actually spoke to me and made me feel like a person.

The conversation was awkward and terrible because I don't know how to communicate with others but it went something like:

Girl ""hey *awkward handshake*""

Me "" hello""

Girl""I'm name""

Me ""Nice to meet you""

Silence

Girl ""if you ever need to talk let me know""

Then she walked away. It was great to feel like a person even if the conversation sucked. I'd like to talk to her more but I can't reach out to people or start conversations. I always need someone to speak to me first. I hate myself so much but today I hate myself a little less."

i want to express to them the level of frustration and loneliness they make me feel when we talk but i feel like i would just come off like i was being a selfish asshole (which is how i feel anyway) i want to tell them that our friendships feel one sides and that i want that to change. i love my friends and would do literally anything for them. i just wish they would do the same for me. i want to be able to tell them my problems and frustrations and not be ignored or judged. 

i am 22 and not in a relationship. it is something that is on my mind constantly and makes me very depressed. i’ve tried dating apps and things of the sort, but nothing ever happens. all my friends are in relationships and it just makes me feel so much more alone. ive told my friends about trying to find a girlfriend but they all tell me the same thing “yeah that sucks that you cant find anybody.” like?? my dude i am pouring my heart out to you and all you have to say is “damn that sucks.” they never ask me how my love life is going or try to give me advice. they never ask how my life is going, or really anything in general. i want to tell them that i am lonely and i want them to listen to me like i listen to them."

Here It goes, Last year I felt Depressed, Anxious, Suicidal and a Wreck. I posted on this subreddit *(from an old account)* I guess as the Last resort. I still to this day don't know why I did it, but I'm glad I did it. I ended up getting DMed by the regular **(creeps, pervs and people who love pushing people even lower)** then one person at 5 AM DMed me, He was so nice, kind and supportive. he kept my mind off my problems and we talked till 9 AM. I remember that morning I went to sleep with a smile. he made me feel the best I have ever felt. We started to talk daily, He will DM me, and I'd push him away, and he kept doing it no matter how much I ignore him *(sometimes I'll ignore him for days)* he will still DM me *""I hope your day is going well!""*

That one person is my savior. I owe so much to him, He is the reason I'm still alive, He made me feel like I'm special and I actually matter **(by listening to me and not trying to turn it to a relationship)** We still talk, He still offers me a lot of support when I feel down, He helped me figure out my issues and He helped me to deal with them. *(He even introduced me to so many shows, Music, Kpop, Jpop, Novels, Movies..etc. Which all helped me get distracted and in a light mood)*

**This is why I comment on People post and DM them or ask them to talk to me if they want**. There is *no ulterior motive*. I just want to help other people like He helped me. Everyone needs that &amp; deserve that. and Talking to someone who went through the same thing &amp; who understand it. Will help a lot, at least in my POV.

I know it sucks to have only **(creeps, pervs, people who enjoy seeing others in pain &amp; make your issues worse)** DM you. or people not DMing you at all and you just don't feel heard. It sucks. I went through all of that before. So I'll try to be there for people who need it as much as I can, and I think we all should if we can. I guess that's it. **That's my explanation and my story.**

Especially when they hate you, every harsh word just hurts so much deeper without her support. I mean, I'm happy we broke up and I wanted to be single, but the transition period is hell.

lonely,I know that all my boyfriend’s ex’s think I’m a joke.,"I know that all my boyfriend’s ex’s think I’m a joke. - They are all super problematic and were petty toward me the first year of mine and his relationship. Petty in the way girls are petty toward each other, where it flies right over a guy’s head and he doesn’t notice it. Eventually I brought it all to my boyfriend when I couldn’t take it anymore and said “Look I can’t do exes anymore. I can’t take it anymore. I’m not okay with you having friendships with them anymore when they act this way. So do what you need to do to make that happen, or don’t. Whatever you want. Just let me know what you decide.” After the specific events I told him about, he decided to cut all ties with them. 
But now, I know that I’m probably referred to as “his crazy jealous gf” and they probably say “He stopped being friends with me because I live in his gf’s head rent-free”. I just have a feeling there’s some petty shit, from what I know about them and that I’m being laughed at. And it honestly makes me so sad.
I hate conflict with people. It just came to a point where I couldn’t take it anymore and something had to give and I had to set some hard boundaries. Asking your boyfriend to stop associating with someone is the most fucking embarrassing thing I have ever done. I always thought it was just the asking part that was embarrassing. But it’s always embarrassing."

lonely,You don’t have friends and it’s “The Representative’s” fault,"You don’t have friends and it’s “The Representative’s” fault -  I cannot emphasize this enough; people can sense when we are not being genuine. Have you ever been around someone and they are saying the right things and behaving the right way, but something seems off and you just can’t tell what it is? I think your smelling bullshit. They are probably trying to be someone they are not. If I’m right (and I may not be) then, the first step towards building meaningful relationships with others is being true to ourselves. 

I’ve seen way too many times, too people being what I call “The Representative”. It’s like this creature we sometimes make up in our heads that’s born from what we believe we should be or what’s acceptable and eventually we learn how to act and behave accordingly (which is exhausting, but I’ll get to that on some other post). With time, through a huge amount of effort we manage to pull it off, The Representative is up and about, and we start to have interactions that seem to be satisfactory on its face but deep down it never feels quite right. Deep down you feel that if they only knew what inside they would walk away. 

So as time goes by, our true self starts showing between the cracks of that façade and when that happens people around us (I’m going to call them “The People”) start getting uncomfortable and we end up feeling like there must me something wrong with us. We feel hurt, lonely, and rejected and what’s worse we feel unworthy of acceptance and begin to lose hope.  

In that shit storm of negative emotions that is unleashed, we fail to realize that the problem is one of mismatched needs/expectations. It’s like getting ready to eat a hotdog, squeezing the ketchup bottle, seeing the red stuff pour out on top of the hot dog, taking the first bite and ugh! it’s cherry syrup. You see there’s nothing wrong with the cherry syrup, but, that’s not what you intended to come out of that bottle. You went out and bought ketchup for your hot dog, cherry syrup may be awesome but it’s not what you wanted to get. 

When we let The Representative be the one that reaches out to others, other expect The Representative 24/7 because that’s the “person” that meets their needs. When the true self shows-up they walk away and act disappointed/dissatisfied because even though you may be amazing that’s not what they were expecting when they signed up.

If you manage to show people who you really are, then sure, maybe X or Y person doesn’t give you the time of day (fuck them!) because that’s not what meets their needs (they are nice people, don’t fuck them). On the other hand, putting you true self out there actually gives you a shot at building a genuine connection that you know accepts you for who you are. Maybe it’s less people, but the ones that do come are more likely to stick around for the long haul and I think that’s what really matters."

I drown it out well enough by distracting myself via games and it does work most of the time, but I also know it's avoidance. I don't think I'm THAT ugly, until I compare myself to others and then it's like oh ok. Maybe nvm. I'm working on losing some weight cause I could stand to lost a few pounds and I try to take care of myself the best I can.  
My friends all have bfs and gfs, and those that don't have at least had one in the past. My closest friend on base actually had her bf come over for two weeks and because we hang out every week to rant, I feel even more left behind than usual. She has had many in the past and this seems like the one it feels like. I'm being real selfish when I say this, but I had hoped it wouldn't work out, so I can still have at least one single friend to meet with.  
I'm also conflicted because I struggle with anxiety and depression, and if I ever did somehow end up with someone, I wouldn't want to put something like that on them. With valentines day coming up, and having never received chocolates from anyone other than my mom, it stings even more.  
I'm already speaking with a therapist (getting out of military because of mental health atm actually) but it's not much help, so I just wanted to come here and ask if anyone else ever felt the same? Just for some validation I guess. I also felt like maybe writing it out for once might help. I'm just scared that no one will ever really think the world of me. I don't want a just physical relationship, I want someone thoughtful that cares. It seems really rare these days though.   
I could make this like a hundred pages long but I'm gonna keep it short lol"

I’m a strait male and I’m young but I’m starting to think there is no one for me. Every relationship I get into is just an ego boost for the other person because I overlove and overcare and I’m too clingy and that’s unattractive for me being a guy. I wasn’t always like this it’s just the build up of pain and hurt from the people I’ve loved. Every time it’s takes me a long time to get over the person I was with and I’m always the dumpee. I’m not saying this stuff to sound like a “pick me” boy I’m just very very tired and I don’t know what’s wrong with me really I mean obviously my clingyness is an odd trait but it just hurts me that they leave so easily with no regret and don’t come back. Like fuck I’m trying but I guess I’m just not made for love. I just want to be held but I guess I’m trying too hard. I can’t feel anything anymore and when I do it’s just pain. It just hurts that I look decently attractive enough for people to come try and be with me but I’m never enough or too much for them to stay. I just need encouragement to not give up bc it’s hard please help.

i know you wish to vibe with someone right now.. you already gave up habit of opening up and sharing your ideas and big dreams.. that just sounds naive and silly. end of the day and nobody to tell about it like you´d like to. In passionate way. You even gave up details, you just want  to tell about your day in general - yet still your tongue wont twist to say it out loud. it locks up. musics kinda bland

i think if you feel something like this then we are vibing right now on some lengthwave.. that gives me hope personally.

or maybe youve read too much philosophy or learned here or there about physics and possibilities about this existence, maybe you tried something that shattered your reality or something happened that was like seeing a gun pointing at you and shooting it right in your head - but not your head but your freedom of thinking and freedom of feeling fun and happy.

i write this almost thoughtlessly, as some sort of poem or song that i want to write one day. i want to travel to distant country that has something that would fulfill even one part of me that i was dreaming about. i cant know, i just feel like im spineless adult. i got job. i got hobbies. some people dont even have that. ive been there too. routine heals you mentally. so you can see this as a step forward towards that something

that something that sparked out of nowhere after all these years

is this the happiness that i feel?

lonely,I have lived my life wrong.,"I have lived my life wrong. - I'm 24 years old, have never been in a relationship, and have generally never been able to make really close social contacts with others. I also did very little traveling during my youth. When I did travel, I visited my relatives in Germany for the weekend and once I went to Ireland for three days with my school class. Otherwise, I always stayed in my hometown or went to the big city nearby. 

Today, I still have difficulties in taking the initiative and approaching to woman. For me, it didn't feel right to ask women out and reveal my feelings to them. I was so afraid of being judged and rejected for my feelings that I repressed them. I regret that very much. To build a relationship you have to take risks. I'm too afraid of taking risks. It feels like there is a barrier between me and the people, where my feelings and personality just bounce off. 

I have two friends who I have known since my school days. Over time, they have both built a very close friendship with each other. They know each other very well, support each other and do things together very often. I am also part of the friendship, but only as a friend, but not as the best friend, which also serves as an emotional support. I have to admit that I very often feel neglected when we are together. On the other hand, there is this barrier that prevents me from opening up to people and talking about it when I feel depressed, neglected, or hurt.

I used to blame others for my mistakes. However, I have long since realized that the state I am in is my own fault. I have lived my life wrongly so far. I want to change. I don't know how, but I want to change. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it even more difficult to meet new people and travel.

I am not a good advisor, but nevertheless I would like to give you something. In order to be successful and happy, you also have to dare to take this one step, which you are usually afraid of. Step out of your comfort zone. There is no point in crawling down and waiting for happiness to come to you. I have experienced that. We need to learn to no longer pay attention on what other people think. Even if we open up to people and still get hurt, we must not forget one thing: We still have ourselves. And that matters."

I asked her if everything was okay and she said she’s fine just tired, but it’s been about a week now. I’ve tried to think whether I’ve done anything that could’ve upset her and can’t think of anything. Maybe I’m just thinking the worst and it’s nothing to do with me, but it seems every time i speak to a girl it starts off really well and then for whatever reason the girl changes her mind.

lonely,a lonely and nonsensical post,"a lonely and nonsensical post - The pop, fizzle, and gulp of the first can of beer. The first feeling is that of relaxation. Relief. Utter satisfaction as your blood vessels expand and you begin to feel warm and giddy. But then come the shivers. The cold sinks in. You bundle up with cloth to feel warm but its a temporary reprieve. Then the need to get the warmth back rises up. You reach out to emotional connections. Those drunk texts you send in hope of attention you need, to reach out to the warmth others have or can provide that can soothe your soul and loneliness. 

Like cradling a warm cup of tea or whichever is your beverage of choice. A single point of heat amongst the cold. Comforting, but eventually the heat dissipates. It’s the law of thermodynamics. Heat transfers from a hot body to a colder one. Once it fills you up, its transfers in search of a newer, colder body. Isn’t that symbolic and ironic? Just when you’ve gotten used to the warmth, it leaves you, until you’re cold again and in search of a new source of heat. How cruel. How addictive.

It feels like most of my relationships follow the rule of thermodynamics. Once its warmth fills me up, it leaves me in search of a newer cold. I’m left numb, and desperately in search of my new source of heat. I stumble and I’m awkward, hoping the next one I find won’t leave me. But laws are called laws for a reason. They are absolute. So, without fail, the warmth rises and I’m left below with the cold. 

Condensation is another interesting scientific phenomena that can be related to emotions. When heat and cold meet on a surface, condensation occurs. Are tears applicable and a result of this as well? The heat of raw emotions and turmoil to a cold and uncaring surface of the world that meet like a pane of glass and leak through the irises? But only to be blinked away and evaporated until the lull of sleep and the dawn of another day finally come.

I feel like I can’t breathe yet I can’t stop hyperventilating. The oxygen is not enough but also too much. 

I want someone to wipe my tears away and cradle me as I try to control my breathing and calm down. Anxiety attacks me right before the calm of sleep and any rest I get is plagued by my id playing havoc in my brain while I try to subdue my subconscious for a somewhat regular circadian rhythm. I think I fall asleep, but when I awake I feel like only minutes have passed but in fact, it's been hours.  

I get up and live through the whole day again."
lonely,Hypothetical Promise,"Hypothetical Promise - My ocd has to do with old (hypothetical or not) promises to Christian God about not doing compulsions and asking for punishment in case breaking the promises, to make sure that I will never do the compulsions.

 I cant remember if they were intrusive thoughts or real promises in form of prayers.

 I worry that maybe other Gods (non specific) have accepted those promises, if in case Christian God is not real.

 I have some random, old memories of me being anxious about certain compulsions and maybe worrying for breaking a promise or thinking to make one. Probably, they are just intrusive thoughts but what if I really, made a promise and validated it as a real promise in form of prayer and I forgot it? what if a specific punishment was ask in case breaking it?

 I did not want to make promises. I was trying to find a way to get relief from my ocd. I was not meaning them! I even explained myself in the past that I am making them because of my ocd. Using the fear of the punishment to force myself ignore ocd. However, I tried to make clear that I would only mean a promise if I validate it by doing the cross sign 3 times, if I understand what I am doing and if I mean it.

 What if I made such a promise and forgot it? I remember trying once to mean a promise but canceled it in the last moment."
lonely,“It’s better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all” bish I disagree. Losing sucks big time.,"“It’s better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all” bish I disagree. Losing sucks big time. - I (23M) was with my last girlfriend for 4.5 years - met her first day of my freshman year of college, we hit it off and before I knew it we were virtually inseparable.

She drew me in with her charm and a succubus-like proclivity, I couldn’t say no. She took my virginity, although I didn’t get to say the same; she was fairly well-experienced because of her previous boyfriend. The first couple years we were together, we were in the dorms - separated, not coed. That didn’t stop us from sleeping over in one or the other’s rooms almost every night. Our junior year, we moved into an apartment together and we were there for the next 2.5 years, sleeping next to each other every night. Cooking for each other. Watching tv together. Over time our intimate life slowed down exponentially and by the last year or so we were at what I would call an old married couple stage. It confused me, because I still craved what we had started out as... but I didn’t question it for fear of starting an argument.

For reasons I’d rather not divulge into right now, she dumped me last April. I had to move back home with my parents three hours away for a few months while I tried to find a new place to rent, ended up buying a house instead. Ever since I moved out I’ve deeply, deeply craved nothing more than to have someone to listen to and someone to hold every night like I had for the last several years of my life. It’s absolutely miserable to go from cuddling up with someone every night to having nobody. I strongly feel I would be better off if I hadn’t ever gotten to experience it at all."

Let me know if it's the case &lt;3 - I've been feeling quite depressed for a while now and get these major downs where getting rid of myself really feels like a good solution. And I just can't help feeling like having a significant other (boyfriend) would really help and make things way better. I feel 100% committed and am convinced that I'd make a great boyfriend.  
**Here's what the title's meant for:**  
**I feel like I do not deserve finding a partner. I can't help but think that due to my depressive episodes, my extreme anxiety (which would turn into occasional jealousy as well) and insecurities, I would cause anything but pain and misery to a partner and would destroy the relationship.** But apart from that, I'm convinced that when it comes to loyalty, giving him my full attention and love, friendship and being there for him in general... well I'd excel at it. My love is all I've got to give and have no1 to give it to. I feel useless.  


Despite feeling this way, I'm just so certain that having someone to love (s/o) would be the only way I'd get out of feeling so miserable and lonely all the time. I'm feeling so lost with life in general. The last thing I want is to hurt someone in that way,"

And she's the type of person who's really social and has a lot of friends wherever she goes, but at the same time, she makes each person feel so important in her life and shares so much about herself

But for the past couple of years, she doesn't really respond to my texts. There'll be this short period where we talk a lot, Skype, etc., and then she doesn't respond. I mean I get it: sometimes I'm not good at answering texts, but it starts feeling like I'm consistently unimportant

It feels horrible and lonely (also because I don't really have any other friends lol). Part of me thinks it's my fault and that because I'm quiet and to be fair my life is a little boring, maybe I'm not interesting or that good of a friend? I can't tell if I'm being annoying by texting her, or she's just forgotten about me

Nobody ever really calls me or texts me to see how I am, like the last time someone from back home texted me was on the first of February. To provide context, currently I'm in the military and I'm deployed. I initially left home in a long-term relationship, but sadly things went south with that, and I've been left in a rough spot. People always say ""Learn how to be happy with yourself, and on your own"" which I completely understand, and I will gladly say I am happy with myself as I have made various strides to improve myself as a person since I've left home. Truly, the only thing I feel like I'm missing is a significant other. I fall asleep hugging a pillow every night and I often think about scenarios in which I'm less alone, like having a family or something like that in the future.

They tell me that I’ve become more and more quiet, more reserved, more cautious, more worried… “Look at your sister, she’s always so happy, she's so chatty!!”. Anyways… I can’t be the happiest person of the planet when I’m still struggling to make a close connection with anyone and trying to find a meaning. ""You are not happy with what you're studying?

Nearly 4 years ago my life fell apart; crumbled before my eyes. I lost nearly everything. My wife (now ex-wife) and I were living a lie, constantly trying to keep up with our fake-ass friends and their fake-ass lifestyles. 

I pled guilty to fraud, and now I'm serving a sentence in Federal prison (yes, I'm really in prison). At the first sign of trouble, my wife, while sleeping in the bed next to me, smiling and telling me she loved me every night, and unbeknownst to me, secretly made a deal with the FBI to inform on me and testify against me to save her own ass. I didnt find this out until my first day at court. That was the last day I saw my ex-wife in person. The night before we ate smothered chicken breast together in our dining room and shared a bottle of wine before making love for, what would be, the last time. 

To say I am lonely is an understatement. I don't hear from any of my fake-ass friends from that life. I don't really have anyone. I have myself. I don't know if that's enough for me. I'm the type of person who needs a life partner. I need someone to love. 

After I am released from prison I will never have to work again. I still have money, but I don't even have anyone worth calling when I get out, which is still a good ways off, anyway. 

Loneliness has many faces. I have no family, I have no real friends, I don't trust anyone, and I'm not sure if I even like myself. I'm in my mid 40s; I'm healthy. I need someone to love. I know it sounds crazy, but through loving someone, I think I can find myself again.

lonely,Not currently looking for love...,"Not currently looking for love... - ...but I do have someone in mind in regards to who I want my partner to be like.

Years ago, I used to study in the same place as her. She raised her voice whenever we made contact, giving me an intimidating first impression. A few years went by and I managed to work closer to her. I still felt queasy around her - but not because of her temper. 

It's because of her contagious optimism. 

I could see it in her beady eyes. Everyday, she would greet and have a comfortable conversation with anybody she walked into. Sometimes she would break into song! 

My favourite thing about her was her fiery passion for encouraging others. That friendly push-nudge thing... In fact, when the rest of my friends and I were struggling, she would dedicate her time to ensure we solved the problems. She was strict, but deep down she cared about the people around her.

Due to various circumstances, we can't be together. I am not currently looking for love, but this person was definitely my type in every way. I want to find someone this amicable. I want to find someone this companionable. I want to find someone this passionate.

Before she ends the phone call she quickly asks how I'm doing and it's easier to just say I'm fine.

My husband plays video games sometimes, and he talks and plays with his brother or best friends, and I just wish I had something. Me and my siblings aren't close or anything.

I just wish I could go for a coffee with a friend or have someone over for dinner 😔 My mental health has deteriorated this past year, and I feel like there's no end in sight with this pandemic."
lonely,Some embarrassing lonely confessions,"Some embarrassing lonely confessions - so I’ve always had the habit of cuddling with a pillow at night and in the mornings and pretending there’s someone there, but lately it’s gotten to the point where I put a heating pad in the pillow and listen to those ‘boyfriend sleeping heavy breathing ASMR’ videos so I can trick my brain easier. I just love to pretend someone is falling asleep next to me or is waking up next to me and is actually happy to see my face 1st thing in the morning. I also sometimes talk to the pillow when I do this, or will pretend there’s someone in the passengers seat when I drive and I just.... pretend to have a conversation I guess. Talking to myself out loud and having fake conversations is becoming such a habit of mine at this point that I’m scared I’m going to accidentally start doing it in public and someone will notice lmao, I just don’t know how to stop, I get so excited about music or movies or anime or some other interest of mine and there is just no one to talk to so I’ve just started imagining it instead. I also cook a lot and I like to pretend I’m cooking for someone, like I’m just waiting for him to come back from work and surprise him with something I made. 

What’s extra weird is ‘he’ doesn’t have a face that I can imagine or anything like that, it’s not like it’s an imaginary boyfriend that I’ve created in my head with a specific name. There’s just an empty space that I’ve decided to put all my affection and conversation into because no one is there to fill it. Weird coping mechanism that my brain has come up with because I just can’t take the loneliness anymore, I guess. 

I don’t even notice that I’m doing this stuff most of the time, it’s just a habit now. The other day I was so deep in my fantasy world and then just randomly snapped out of it and it hit me that I’m a 20 year old woman curled up with my pillow whispering to it and that is really deeply pathetic. I was like damn, what if someone else saw me doing this. So now I’m telling the 2-3 strangers who will read this so I don’t have to be alone with the embarrassment at least. I just got diagnosed with Aspergers as well so I’m starting to think it’s just gonna be me and this pillow forever"

lonely,valentine’s day,"valentine’s day - hello! valentine’s day is coming up and i know it’ll be hard for a lot of you. that’s okay. there will be hard days. being lonely is more difficult than a lot of people understand. but you can make it a little easier by letting the pressure go. 
valentine’s day is just a day. you don’t need to be in a relationship or be showered with flowers and chocolates. it’s all just a marketing scheme anyways, right? all you have to do is get through the day. maybe take a nice warm bath and eat your favorite meal or do something else that makes you happy. i won’t give you the ‘be your own valentine’ b.s., but it’s not b.s. to try to make the day a little nicer, however you can go about that. 
try to take a day off from social media, too. seeing everyone’s valentine’s posts probably won’t do you any good. just generally be aware of what makes you feel good and bad, and use that info to make the day easier for yourself. it’s 24 hours and you will get through it. then you’ll get through the next day, and the next, and good things will come eventually if you keep hoping and striving to make it happen.

all love and blessings to you my friends! stay strong!"
lonely,I feel like I have very few friends and I've been told I'm disliked - any advice?,"I feel like I have very few friends and I've been told I'm disliked - any advice? - I live in a city for university and have two friends from home there. I currently live with one of them and the other has done this year from home due to covid. They have both applied to do their 4th year (next year, we're third) in different cities.

I don't really have any other close friends in the city. I am part of a club and I know people from there but I am not very close with anyone, they are either mature students living with their partners or already in established friend groups that live together.

I had bad anxiety in 1st and 2nd year and didn't make any friends. I was pretty depressed and I just constantly looked for a boyfriend so that I wouldn't be lonely, but I just got fucked over so many times.

I'm doing better now and I joined a couple of sports clubs this year in attempt to make friends but it wasn't very easy cause you're not allowed to meet up due to covid and they were mostly 1st years that seemed to react badly when I said I was a 3rd year. I did make a massive effort to be enthusiastic and kind to everyone and add them on fb etc.

I try to contact my friends from home a lot but I never really get much of a response and plans never go through. All of last year we pitched in for birthday presents for eachother, I paid my share for all of them but right before my birthday they decided that the whole group gift thing should stop. I kinda expected this.

I've been in a relationship for a year now, but my boyfriend works in the military and is constantly away. There is no option for us to move in together at this point.

On a night out before covid a friend from the club I go to (she's not an option to move in with, she's a lot older and married) told me that I'm not very likeable to the rest of the girls in the club. She told me most of them disliked me. We were drunk so what exactly she said isn't clear in my memory but it was along the lines of me being too competitive, trying too hard and being standoffish. She said 'the girls want to be you and the boys just want to fuck you, which is the only reason they speak to you'. I do not understand this cause A. I am not an oil painting why the hell would anyone want to be me. B. I never even flirted with any of the guys in the club? I can understand competetiveness as I'm a very keen sports player, I live for fitness/exercise/sports. And the standoffish part, I'm shy as fuck. I think about what she said a lot - how can I come across more likeable?

I really don't know what to do. I feel like all I have is my family (who I am so grateful for). Do I move into a flat alone? Am I doing something wrong to make people not want to be around me? I'm trying so hard not to feel lonely as there are people in the world that have it so much worse than me but in all honesty I do feel quite alone and I'm really scared that I will get depressed again at uni next year.

Any advice on how to make friends/how to be more likeable/what to do would be greatly appreciated!"
lonely,There's so much I want to experience.,"There's so much I want to experience. - There's so much I want to experience before I die. Like going on a date with a girl or going on a walk holding hands. I wanna hold someone or be held :( 

I'm turning 24 soon and I've never even held a girls hand before. I don't feel like a man. I feel like a little boy. I have no self esteem either. I've tried to meet friends and go from there but I can't seem to keep anything. I have two guy friends I've known for years but I don't know how to talk to the opposite gender.

I've made the mistake of confessing to a close friend that I like her and I was turned down. We are still friends but I feel like a loser every time we talk. Like I'm ugly and inferior. I'm so lonely and touch starved. I want to experience everything but at the same time I want to give up on life"

Ever since I wa 18-19 year's old (I'm 24 now) I've had 
this extreme lonely feeling, and for a while now I don't even think I'm capable of feeling loved. I've never had a girl friend, never really had a kiss, I've never cuddled anybody, I've never celebrated valentine's day. I've had people say that I'm attractive and they don't understand why people don't adore me. Any time I see other people socializing and making connections it just makes me feel sad cuz I'm so bad at talking to people.  The pandemic is making it worse because when I try to reach out to friends they all say the same thing that we're all going through it, but then I'm like ""no you don't understand the way that you're feeling now is how I've been feeling for the past 5 years"". I feel so alone. I don't have a community. Nobody understands me. I feel like the only community that can understand me is the incel community, but I really don't want to be a part of that community. I feel like most people don't know what's it's like to go years without even having a single hug"

lonely,Falling Out Of Love,"Falling Out Of Love - It's quite sad to see people fall out of love in real life. The feeling of watching it may differ for everybody else, but I'm currently second handily experiencing it, and it's so tense. It's tense through the fake smiles, wispy laughs that are for show, and little gestures that don't hold any personal connection anymore.

The two have become distant emotionally through arguments with different feelings, and physically by sleeping in separate rooms and busying themselves so they don't have to spend time together. 

Since I live with them, I usually keep myself in my room. Locked away, trying to get rid of my sorrows somehow, which is typically through the most random things my mind can muster. 

I've never been *truly* in love since it's always infatuation, but having to see them fall out of love makes me never want to love. Yet, maybe I will one day. To the point where I don't understand how much I love my partner. I won't get it, nobody will, because it's there. The love exists freely. Although through the potential bursts and occasional fades, hopefully the love stays.

And hopefully I don't give up, we don't give up, yet maybe. Maybe we'll have to go through the fake everything's to realize it's coming to an end, and it's better that way. 

It's 3:04 am, I'm lonely, but maybe I'll get better soon. If not soon, than I'm fucked. Just kidding, haha, have a good morning, afternoon, and night!"

I’ve only had one relationship in 6th grade and I’m nearing 20 years old. I grew watching other people date and I just knew I wanted no part of it. It kinda didn’t matter since there weren’t people interested in me romantically anyway.

The idea of deciding whether or not you would date someone just by looking at them is so weird to me. There’s no indication of their character by someone’s appearance and this is *all* dating is today.

I guess I wish that true kind of relationships were more normalized. I’m not interested in finding multiple partners before settling on one. I grew up listening to music in the 70s where it was much more romantic and I wish that kind of stuff was more normalized. Not about hook ups or how this person looks but more about how you want to grow old with them. How you can feel like nothing else is important when you’re with someone and I’m uncertain that kind of love is still around."

lonely,My poem about loneliness,"My poem about loneliness - Crowds

When you think of isolation,
you think of being by yourself 
without another soul in sight,
but there is nothing more isolating 
than being in a crowd where 
no one knows your name or 
wishes to know it. 

To be surrounded by faces that you would 
welcome into a conversation, but no one even 
knocks on your door. 
You hear the chatter of lively conversation,
You see the laughter on cheerful faces, 
You feel the happiness 
that you are not a part of.

You think of the peace nature brings,
as birds chirp softly as
sunlight glints on dewy blades of grass, and 
you breathe with the lush trees and blossoming gardenias.

But once you have tears streaming down your face, 
and people of all kinds see those rivers yet don’t bother to ask 
“What’s wrong?” 
You will realize that you are truly alone in crowds, 
where no one will reach out their hands to 
pull you into their sunlight 
even as you drown.

Valentine’s day is coming up, and my thoughts of loneliness are coming around again. So many of my friends already have boyfriends/girlfriends, and I feel so isolated when they talk about their Valentine’s plans. I’m a girl, almost 17, and I’ve never kissed anyone. I can’t help but wonder why no one has ever asked me out. I feel like an outcast because most of my friends are dating/have dated someone before. 

Am I too ugly? Am I annoying? Am I too depressed? What’s wrong with me? Why am I not worthy of anyone’s love? I just know I’ll be all alone at home this Sunday as my friends go out and live their lives :(

Thanks for reading my vent if you got this far."

lonely,Been feeling low,"Been feeling low - I guess I just need somewhere to air my feelings. I feel so, so alone. As much as I love my husband, he has a whole host of issues that make him emotionally inaccessible a lot of the time (he works in a corrections facility and sees a lot of horrible stuff, so he comes home emotionally and physically exhausted and I don't want to dump my crap on him too). His job makes him distant with me, a lot more than I would like. A few months ago, I cut out the person who had been my best friend because I realized how terribly toxic our relationship was. Once we graduated college and I was actually away from her, it was incredible how my self esteem and happiness just picked right up. After getting together with her a few times here and there, noticing the snide remarks and the mean jokes and enormous spikes in my anxiety and depression, I realized she's been a catalyst for all that all along. So, I pulled the plug. Then, she turned around and told our mutual friends that I ""ghosted"" her (even though I had told her exactly what was going on). She's always been the dominant one in the whole friend group, so I don't think they would even listen to my side of the story. Now I'm a villain, even though breaking up with her was incredibly painful for me to do, and I hoped she would understand at least a little of that. Beyond that, two good friends that were unrelated to that whole debacle stopped talking to me earlier in the year because my husband's best friend was around sometimes, and they don't like him - which is just???? So now, I'm left with two work friends that I never get to actually see because of covid and an old friend from high school who, while I love her, is not the sort of person I really feel I can confide in at this stage in our lives. I feel so empty. Weeks go by where nobody outside my household says anything to me besides some IMs at work. I've tried talking to my husband about it, but like I said, he has problems of his own, and I don't think he understands how much I'm hurting. I'm not even sure how I would begin to explain it to him. Thank you for letting me vent, reddit friends - I feel a little better having typed it all out, at least."

It is just a feeling of emptiness, not in a sad way, just like you are missing, or forgetting someone. It is confusing. Nothing has really changed in the last couple weeks. It is just like there is a weight on my shoulders. I do not know who I'm missing, but I kind of feel bad that I cannot put my finger on it."

was scrolling thru twitter and saw a friend talk to their friends of a discord server theyre in and i just lost it a bit. because i dont' have anything like that. i dont have  a server with friends to hang and have a good time with. it's something so small but it would mean a great deal to me if i could just interact better with people.

I've always been different from others but it wasn't me it was all in my head because my mental health. home growing up was rly abusive emotionally and physical as well by my mum, and my dad was my mum's bitch because if he defended us her wrath would come down on him ahah and he would just complain at both of us for bothering him and go to a different room when my sister and I were being abused by her and begging Jim to help us. this hurt me so badly because I felt incredibly betrayed by my dad because me and him were super Close when I was little. (Drifted because of my resentment towards him)

my mum has always been crazy since I can remember and in my early years before she abused me I remember her doing other horrible things like locking us out side for hours until I thought to write sorry on a leaf and slide it under the door or balling her eyes out disturbingly to my sister ad I about my dad and their marriage and my dad's previous divorce which I didn't know about until my mum mentioned it so casually to my sister (I guess she already knew and I was sitting there not knowing what was going on). I WAS LIKE 5. And at the time it messed w my brain up finding out in that way traumatizing honestly mostly because of the way she was crying(like a crazy person) For this reason I never saw her as a mother and I I've never felt betrayal from her the way I did W my dad who I couldn't understand would say I deserved it. he told my sis and I most of our lives that we were dramatic and delusional but I clearly remember at every age of my life being left in the car for hours being so upset and my sister calling my dad begging to help us or get a divorce. He would tell us if he got a divorce she would get full custody of us. I remember thinking to myself at so young that I couldn't take this life anymore and I remember my sister talkin to me about suicide at rediculously young ages. The only thing that kept me going was hope for the future.

This shit affected my child hood SO much more than I realised. while everyone else in elementary was thinking mostly about school and friends I was in flight mode at school I hated it because I had to fake a face( the way I see it is I was in survival mode thinking about my bigger problems so didn't care about what the other girls did at that age I guess) 

In highschool when I was 16 I got in a relationship and fell head over heels with a cool Christian boy with a gorgeous family and we wanted to be together forever. At this point I literally had one friend and always found it really hard to get close to people.
So until about 6 months in I had never been this happy in my life and I had never been going out so much (it was summer when we got together and we had a little squad we would go out W and do fun things like every day) and I thought that this is how everyone else got to feel all the time and I thought the day I was hoping for all my life had come.

Very quickly we started fighting a lot, looking back we were sooo naive and immature for a relo as well, anyways it got fucking crazy. Like I'm talking Alexa and Jacob toxic from euphoria if anyone seen minus any part of it that makes it look romantic lol. 

One of the things that hurt me so much was there was a rly nasty girl who always picked on her friends and I always defended them and when I started dating my ex I fucked them all off because they were fake and I thought I had my bf. When she heard we were having problems she started becoming  friends W him in one class and started telling my friends that he said mean things about me and he doesn't love me and if he wasn't with me they would deffs hit it off. And she kept telling people she knew would come and tell me to hurt me and my bf did nothing. He kept being friends with her and when I expressed how much it was hurting me he still did nothing until I made it a big enough deal I ore much made him say something I sent her a jokie text saying basically nothing. This was the biggest thing that hurt me.

Anyways the next summer rolls around and he asked for a break but said we'll still talk and be together he just needs space. So the whole summer he lied to me about literally everything replied one text each like once a day and would get furious or ignore me for a few days if I ever did said or asked anything to not comply with what he wanted.  I literally spent every single day in my bed hoping for a text. Ik so lame.

So school goes back and we see eachother everyday and things go right back to normal for a bit and then we snuck into a locked classroom to chill and he tells me he cheated on me:/ and I find out people have been gossiping about it because his best mate who liked me before we got together was telling him if he didn't tell me then he would. And telling some other ppl too. I was fucked up. I remember when I told him I never even loved him anyways he grabbed my phone in anger and went to break it but I fucked on him and got it back. And I was like dude wtf? U literally just told me U cheated on me and Ur balling Ur eyes out in guilt and now U angry??

Anyways we end up being on and off for a bit cos I'm a weak bitch and then we finally broke up for 6 months and I made up with my best friend who I broke up with in all this boyf mess. We went out a lot a did a fair bit of drugs and I experimented and fucked a few dudes (and very much regretted alll of it) and I had a plan in my head that when I got over him I would give back his child hood teddy bear because I still always wanted him in my life because he meant so very much to me. So I got to that point where I literally thought he was unatractive and wanted to wait for Mr perfect not just what my heart wanted.

So I met up with him for a sesh at night at an oval near my house and he told me I was right about everything all those group of girls I fucked off because I'm real and I wanted real friends or no friends and I was sick of surrounding myself with girls who competed with eachother and put eachother down like they were not real friends simply put. (btw were 6 months outta school at this point) and damn we just yea idk it was like magical seeing him again. And we had lots of fun meeting for a sesh so we kept doing it and we would go to the middle of the oval and look at the stars🥺
So we got back together lol but we were still fucking fighting so we never became official and here we are six months later and the other day I was crying in his room because he was furious with me it was probably my fault but he full punched a hole through his bookshelf and trying to kick me out but he has a granny flat and I snuck in, so when he was telling me to leave and I was balling my eyes out I wasn't refusing to leave but like I would have had to sneak through the back and probably have to say bye to his grandparents to leave so I just sat there crying and he threatened to call his mum to his room and he did it and his mum came and I freaked out and it was so scary and embarrassing but him mum is an absolute angel and was so lovely and was trying to be reasonable and my ex was mad and was treating me like he does when his mad in front of his mum for the first time ever and then stormed out and left me W his mum. And I spoke to her for a while and I was so upset and she said the obvious that this wasn't right and she gave me advice for me as if I was her daughter and gave me her Mary bracelet and it broke my heart because noone has ever in my entire life been there for me like that. And I just realised how much stronger and how much I could do had I just had that support in my family or in my life and I long for a caring family so badly. Or at least have friends. But I don't. 
 
I want to add that my ex ended up telling me he was raped when he was little and he had so many demons to face just as I did. And that made things really fucked on a new level I guess:(

Now I've lost the few friends I had left including that best friend from highschool because they weren't good to me and in general. And I really finding it difficult to get close to girls. . so intimidated by most of them and 2. often can't relate to a lot of them even if they don't intimidate me. I wish to be a dude or just have guy mates but I'm kind of on the attractive side (not my opinion just I've gathered from life) and it doesn't work out. 

Btw looks doesn't change shit in life. It's all about self worth and if your pretty but have super low self worth like me then Ur just as fucked as someone who has low self worth because they're ugly.

Anyways I also quit my job because it was really toxic too the boss would hit on the young apprentices and I fkn worked with his wife who was an angel. Another girl quit cos he tried to get with her in the bathroom at the Christmas party and he and slept with another girl who was my age 19. He's like 50. Aand one of the girls who's who's parents invested in the salon is so rude to me all the time but idc but then she said my dad looked like a pedo and was a spastic to my face and refused to apologise and told my boss she apologized. Literally on top of other drama so I left. 

I've been sitting in my room day in and day out and I'm so lonely and I'm finally coming to terms that I'm depressed as fuck and realising that also means I've always been depressed. Since I can remember. This has been normal for me for so long that it took me my whole life to admit I am depressed.

After that day with my ex's mum I hung out with him the next day like nothing happened and it wasn't right so I ended up asking him don't you think we kind if have to stop seeing eachother now? And he said I guess so so now we're trying to be apart and I'm sitting in my room every day again and I'm so mother fucking lonely:// I want friends but at the same time I don't want to be with anyone I don't know that well I only want to hang out with people I know really well and I have none of those anymore:( 

Even my family on my dad's side my mum had a massive problem with them so she often would stop us from seeing them.so all my cousins and aunts are really close except for me and my sister:// 

Honestly I have found God so much more and grown so much more but even before that I've always tried my best to be the best person I can be, treat others with kindness and youre supposed to get the same in return right? But I feel like all Ive ever gotten from life in a fucking backhand and sometimes I just feel so tired. Like idk how much longer I can deal with the pain while everyone stands around and gives zero shits doesn't do 1% of what I would do for them. My older sister has fully abandoned me even though I was always there for her when she was abused by my mum and when my sister didn't have friends she would come into my room to talk and confided in me that she cuts and all this stuff Nd she has never been there for me I ask her all the time if she can hang out and just give me one day in a month, hell a year without making me beg and she can't. She knows I need her and I've even told her but I felt it pushed her away more so I tried to be super lighthearted and treat her like a friend and not a family member but It didn't change anything. I always thought we were all eachother had and I always loved her but he's always hated me. It's like damn it really is every single aspect of my life.

But then it's like it has got to be my fault since it follows me wherever I go like it has to be right. I am actually very aware of my flaws and they're not pretty but I swear god knows I try my best to be a good person:( it's weird but I honestly wish I had me as a friend. I would do anything for a friend:( but it feels like noones ever cared about me properly:(

If U read this thankyou but U must've been rly bored Xxx"

I don't end it because I'm a coward but I want to. I don't want to be tired anymore. I don't want to be alone, I'm tired of having to take 5 minutes anytime i go to work or even to come home to push everything aside and be the funny, upbeat, conversation starter everyone knows and pretends to love for the moment...I just wish someone would notice me, would give me a chance would help me in some sort of way. Any way...but it won't happen. I'll continue to be forgotten and exhausted until the day I'm brave enough to jump off a bridge or simply die."

Since I’ve graduated, I’ve cut those toxic people out of my life and realized that I have no one. I have absolutely no friends. No one that I talk to at all. I am very lucky to have my boyfriend, whom I consider to be my best friend and the closest friend I’ve ever had. But I feel jealous of how many friends he has. I wish I had that. I’ve hung out with him and his friends before and they all get along so well. He’s always telling me about different people he knows and fun stories about them. I really wish my life was like that.

lonely,Recommendation to watch Daniel Sloss’s Jigsaw and some other helpful thoughts,"Recommendation to watch Daniel Sloss’s Jigsaw and some other helpful thoughts - It’s more about romantic relationships and how some people are so desperate they are willing to try to force someone that doesn’t fit into their lives to avoid being alone. 

I think it has some good messages though that could help people in this sub. I don’t completely agree with the idea that “you have to love yourself before anyone else can” - I think that’s a pretty harmful message, it almost implies we don’t deserve love if we don’t love ourselves. But there is some truth to it. We have to learn how to be happy alone, otherwise we will sacrifice parts of ourselves to make relationships work so we can avoid being alone. It’s easier said than done, don’t get me wrong. If you don’t like the idea of this maybe start with asking yourself why you don’t like time spending alone.

Another unrelated helpful quote: “wanting positive experience is in itself a negative experience. It’s what the philosopher Alan Watts called the backwards law. The idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you feel become, as pursuing something only reinforces the idea that your lacking something in the first place. The more you desperately want to be rich, the moor poor you feel. The more you desperately want to be happy and loved, the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you.” 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not denying that any one on this sub feels alone. The world can be lonely. But sometimes I think absorbing media such as the stuff common on this sub can do more harm then good. It just reinforces our feelings of loneliness. I know this sub is for discussing these feelings, so I’m also not saying people should stop posting stuff like that - it can be helpful. I just think too much of it can do the opposite.

I can see I ruin the fun because of my awkwardness whenever I talk with them. And I have the feeling that they don't want me to be involved in anything they do together. - Like, anything they do, like hanging out. I'm not involved . Don't get asked to join. Some friend group chat. Not invited. Whenever they talk about them hanging out, and I say I want to join but can't because of family reasons, they don't say anything like ""that's a shame"" or ""damn that sucks"" no, they just keep quiet or say ""yeah"".

Recently they said something about them wanting to write or create a world where they live as the characters. I'm not included. Plus, I am a proud writer and I say it nice and loud to them. I love writing, they know that. And they didn't even mention the idea without me asking for it.

I just want to hear the words ""do you wanna join?"" or ""wanna come with us?"" or maybe even ""it's gonna be  boring without you."" or something along those lines.

But nah, it doesn't happen because I'm just not in their league. They keep calling me ""too smart"" for them but I just have a broad general knowledge of stuff. I keep stumbling over my words, I can't compliment anyone or anything nor say anything brave without getting cold feet or making it awkward. 

Goddamn it man, this all sounds so sad but I'm used to it. They show love in a different way for me but still feels so damn pathetic that in their minds I am not involved in their social lives. Damn I wrote a lot, well, good to vent."

lonely,I’m starting to realise just how much of my childhood I lost out on due to mental illness and I’m finding it really upsetting.,"I’m starting to realise just how much of my childhood I lost out on due to mental illness and I’m finding it really upsetting. - (I’ve just realised whilst writing this that it’s kind of a long read but I’d appreciate anyone that can stick through it and can maybe relate to it. My DMs are always open for anyone who’d like to talk.) 

Growing up I always knew I was different, I wasn’t out going or confident or good at making friends but I didn’t know why. It wasn’t until my early 20s when I was diagnosed with chronic depression, anxiety that I realised why I never really fit it much. 

I had a couple close friends but they were similar to me, quiet and outcast, the kind of kids the at sat in the corner at prom and watched everybody else have all the fun.

I’ve always been really skinny which for a guy really isn’t fun, especially when other guys and girls point it out and grab your arms to see if they can fit their hand around your bicep. People always say it must be really easy to gain weight. “Just eat more, right?”. My parents worked long hours at fairly crappy jobs and we couldn’t exactly afford protein shakes and to eat chicken every night. When my parents were working late and I was on my own after school I usually just had to make-do with microwave meals.

Around the time of high school when everyone is getting into their first relationships I became more secluded and more depressed. 
This always hit me worst in the summer time when we were free from school and people would be out making the most of the nice weather but I’d say inside on my own. Even when I did go out I’d always wear long sleeve shirts or hoodies even in the hot sun because I was so afraid of people commenting on how thing my arms were.
I always struggled with girls too, I had zero self confidence and my anxiety meant I had no idea what to say. Of course their were always girls I had crushes on and looking back there were probably 1 or 2 girls who might actually given me a chance if I asked. 
When I was at university I met a girl who became one of my best friends but I eventually ended up falling in love with her, after five years I found the courage to tell her how I feel, she gave me the cliche: “I don’t feel that way about you but I hope we can still be friends”. Inevitably after we left university we drifted apart and she’s pretty much non-existent in my life which really sucks because even aside from my romantic feelings for her I still really loved her as a friend. 

Now I’m in my mid-20s and during lockdown  I’ve been spending even more time on my own than usual and have had a lot more time to think and reflect about my childhood. It wasn’t really a bad childhood, just kind of a lonely one. Sometimes I see films or listen to songs or hear people’s stories about how their adolescence is the best time of their life, a time before serious employment and other responsibilities and it breaks my heart. I just feel like I just missed out on so much, I never had any wild adventures with friends, never had a teen romance never had a “Summer of ‘69”. 

I hate it because I think I could have had those things like a normal person had it not been for my mental health issues holding me back but they did and I can never go back and get those days back. I’m in a 9-5 minimum wage office job now and I don’t really ever seeing my self leaving. My university grades were very average and I was too anxious to do doing any real work experience while I was there which is something else I really regret. I guess I always thought taking the ‘safe’ options in life would secure me a stable future but even people who I know who went out and partied and had friends and romances seem to have much better lives than me now. 

These thoughts practically consume my mind these days and I find myself fantasising about a past I can never have. I’m finding it really hard to accept the truth of it all and I think it’s one of the main reasons I still struggle with my mental health. 


I know no one has probably read all this but it actually kind of felt good to just get off my chest anyway. Sorry it was so long winded and poorly written. I hope someone can relate to it and maybe be up for a chat about it, like said at the start my PMs are open &lt;3"

lonely,I don't now how to ceap a conversation going,I don't now how to ceap a conversation going - I'm tired of the person I am And I'm tired of the fear of being alone. So I'm trying to put myself out there and just meet people and work in geting comfortable  with that that before I start looking to go on dates but  I don't know how to make a conversation last more the a couple lines... I'll start by asking how there day is and then move on to something in there professional to talk about and giving it a minute or two before I respond but once that done I have run out of ideas. I don't want to play 20 questions with some and have it be completely one sided you know. What should I do to get them to ask some thing or at least so I get more then a one or two word answers? I don't want to do the wrong thing and come off as an ass or a creap or something.
lonely,Feeling empty,"Feeling empty - I dont know how to describe it. I've been feeling empty inside, it feels like I don't even have a purpose in life. 

This feeling started about a couple months ago, why? Even i don't know. What is it that im missing? I have parents whom i adore very much. I have friends that I talk to normally on a daily basis. I have spare time for hobbies. But I just feel empty. Could it be love? Perhaps, but im not chasing after it nor do I need it for know. I have school to spend time on.

I get this feeling that Im not heading anywhere in life however hard i try. I just get this feeling randomly, not on a daily basis but just randomly even on ""happy"" days. When this happens, I usually sit and stare at whatever I was doing and think about life. Will I get my dream job? Will I find love? What if I fail school (3rd year highschool)? 

If anyone can relate and perhaps give me a tip on how to deal with this that would be great :) !"
lonely,Anxiety 😔 I don't have severe anxiety but just enough to torture myself,"Anxiety 😔 I don't have severe anxiety but just enough to torture myself - I wish I had someone to come home to, this loneliness is so hard to deal with but I feel worthless.
   My problem is that I can see everything wrong with myself but I hate myself too much to fix it. I don't have any motivation to be happy and socialize. I am young and fit (M24) so I shouldn't have any issues in socializing and dating but I am extremely self-conscious and very sensitive in sensing when someone doesn't like me.

I have my work colleagues that I am very open with, apart from those two I have no one else to talk to. Although I'm not this open with them, they don't know my mental struggles.

 When I'm on my sofa at night I look to the other end wishing someone was staring back but unfortunately that's just a fantasy, for now.

I don't have the confidence to chase a girl to win her over and without that I know my love life will struggle. I don't want someone just to have sex with purely for the sex as that isn't satisfying to me, I need love, I need the passion, I need the romance, I need that connection to be happy.

I have a 1year old son and I need to be happy for him, I need to be happy to make him happy but I'm afraid to get my heart broken again like his mother did to me but I also hate myself too much to be happy or to even try to be happy. I need that someone next to me in life, I can't cope by myself, in order to love myself I need that someone beside me but I'm too afraid of getting hurt again and I'm also too afraid of being a disappointment to someone.

I know what needs to be done to be happy but I'm refusing to let myself be happy both consciously and subconsciously. Maybe some anxiety pills wouldn't go amiss, do I really wanna go down that route? I don't think I do but maybe it's for the best, just to get me back on track."

lonely,Lonely,Lonely - Hi I’m 24M from England. As you can imagine the lockdown in this country is serious having an affect on everyone mental well being. No one is allowed to go out so it’s hard to interact with friends or meet new people. Online dating is just a scam getting you to pay to chat to people that are only interesting in boosting their online platform so that’s not a good option. So I’m wondering if any female from England in the same situation would like to have a causal conversation 😊

I’m so lonely. Romantically lonely. I’ve never been on a date, never had a relationship, never have had a kiss. It hurts so bad and I’m miserable. It doesn’t help my standards are extremely high and I don’t want to lower them. Im also really depressed about my own physique because I have high standards for myself. I lost 120 pounds and I’m trying to get buff now but I haven’t noticed much muscle gains and even my mom is doubting me which is extremely depressing. I’m afraid I’m going to fail to be the man I want to be and I’m always going to be lonely forever so my best option is ending things"

Who do I go to when something pisses me off and I need to rant about it? Who do I go to when I feel hard done by? Who do I go to when I want to share amazing news?

I felt like I had nothing to say the whole time. Nothing funny, clever, intriguing or interesting. I was just kind of... there. It's not like any of them will actively seek more times to hang out with someone like me. Now I've just ended up back home alone, not trying to go back out and I don't feel like doing anything anymore."
lonely,You don’t realize how lonely you are until it’s the end of the day and you have a bunch of things you want to share but no one to share with,"You don’t realize how lonely you are until it’s the end of the day and you have a bunch of things you want to share but no one to share with - But it’s like you think about the prospect of telling someone and it never seems worth it unless the person listening doesn’t know you, so they are ironically in an anonymous and therefore more loving position of perspective. I wish we could be connected to the people we actually know though, but people are more focused on keeping order instead of being honest.

Edit: I wanted to add that even telling someone you don’t know is lacking in the sense that there isn’t that comfort of familiarity, and personal connection. It frustrates me that it is this way, and has been this way in my own relationships. I know the solution is we just have to focus on healing our own trauma in life instead of focusing on what everyone else’s demons but it is traumatizing in itself to go through life alone, something feels extremely wrong about it but it seems like the better poison, and maybe it won’t always be this way. It’s just hard to draw on encouragement when you are walking alone. But on an upside, I am glad there is many lovely people on here who thinks it all absurd as well that it has to be this way in life sometimes."

lonely,"Hey! Are you looking for a friend? Up for the challenge with 28 questions? Get matched based age, gender, interests, continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀!","Hey! Are you looking for a friend? Up for the challenge with 28 questions? Get matched based age, gender, interests, continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts).

**How it works:**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.
* Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* [/u/finder\_of\_the\_humans](https://www.reddit.com/u/finder_of_the_humans/)/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"

lonely,I have been lonely my entire life.,"I have been lonely my entire life. - I am 22 yr old guy. I have been an introvert ever since I could remember. Even in school, whenever someone had to pick a pair, iam the one left alone. Iam the kind of guy that people hate for no particular sign. Whenever I enter a party or celebration, people become tense and hostile. After several incidents like that, I stopped attending them. I have ignored so much that I stopped talking with anyone. This went on till my sixth grade until a few extroverted befriended me. I had some of my best years in life with them but as I had  to change school, I lost contact with them. And from then, till now I could never make any interpersonal relationship. Those few friends I had have left me , I avoid communication with others unless necessary, for fear that i may lose them also. I never had a girlfriend. Few years ago a girl took interest in me, but I had severe anxiety and never reciprocated it. I have chronic anxiety which causes me to stutter. I simply live with my pain. I never told anyone about this because they will think I am trying to gain sympathy."

I've always been a quiet type, people usually don't even notice I'm here, so getting a big friend group is hard enough, let alone a soulmate. The one thing that I just don't like about Valentines is that usually when they see I'm alone, they say that there's someone out there for me. That just makes me sad, and mad. Because I know what kind of person I am. And I know I'm not the most approachable, likeable, or sociable. So everyone who is those things will go for someone else, and the ones who aren't would just stay away from me. Because there's always a better option. Always. I'm slowly coming to terms with that, and I've begun to realise I don't need a gf in life, but God fucking damn, is it hard to watch couples be couples when I've been lonely all these years."

I know it’s selfish and idealistic to expect someone to magically heal all your worries away. I know, I know I’m being a bit unreasonable. 

But can I just say what I’m thinking and feeling at this moment? 

I wish my messages conveyed more of what I truly felt. 

I wonder why, why the things they said didn’t make me feel better at all? 


I sort of regret saying what I felt... I don’t wanna reach out to anyone anymore. I wish she just ignored my texts instead slow replies that is making me feel like I’m not important. 

I really just have to suck it up and deal with this shit myself huh? 

Well, no matter, this feeling is my fault to begin with, I guess it’s what I deserve. I’m worthless, and I’m being troublesome for no reason. A bit of difficulty, I crawl back and wallow in self-pity. 

Look how I am a piece of shit. I’m privileged, has no problem or whatsoever yet for some reason I’m just like this. Every day I eat, I sleep, I don’t help my mom, I ignore my dad, I don’t talk to the cousin living with us, I don’t take my studies seriously while my parents work hard to pay for my education. Every week, there’s always a moment where heart feels extremely uncomfortable. I hate school right now, I find what some of they’re teaching pointless and a waste of my time, yet I can’t do anything about it. I know I have nothing, absolutely nothing to offer, yet I can’t even make improvements that. 

Everything is so bothersome! I hate it! I hate this so much! Sometimes, the thought of not existing is wonderful. Ah, I’m not suicidal or anything like that though, dying is... painful. I also don’t want to die.

lonely,I feel broken,"I feel broken - 
I feel like I’m not living but like living in some kind of fake shell. Growing up I was obese and had no friends until probably college (I’m in college rn). I would just spend my break times by myself. 

It also didn’t help that my dad was so hard on me as a child for being fat. When I was 8, He would feed me vegetables and stuff while my brother and sister ate whatever, he would constantly call me fat, he would wake me up at 6am in the morning to run 50 laps and would be chasing me if I got tired while running, he would insult me at every chance he got about being fat. Then when I got to school the next day I would deal with the same insults from my classmates. 

Only friends I had were from video games or anime probably. I always wanted to die when I was younger and I got sent to the guidance counsellor one time cause I was drawing pictures of me dying. 

Even today in college, now that I’ve lost all the weight at 19 (I only lost it in 2018) and have friends, I feel like I’m not mentally in there. 

I feel afraid to tell anyone what I truly feel because I’m scared if I did I’ll be alone again. I spend so much money on clothes as some kind of coping mechanism, I hate looking at myself in the mirror, people use me and I don’t care, a girl broke up with me and I showed no emotions...

I feel like I hate myself and I’m only existing and doing whatever to have company because I’m afraid of being alone again"

I miss my old natural happy go lucky self. - Ive been feeling loneliness since 2020 started. Been going downhill since then. I try my best to talk to people and to spend time with them. I used to enjoy spending time with friends even just through online by playing games or chatting or call since its still the pandemic. Recently ive also been going out with a few of my friends. But i feel like im not myself anymore. I dont think im really enjoying the company. Im not that happy playing video games with them anymore. 

I feel like ive been pretending to be jolly and hyper now. I used to be naturally fun and hyper back in the days. Now im such a try hard. Its tiring. I just honestly want to isolate myself and stop talking to everyone because i feel unimportant and useless and not really heard. 

Should i isolate myself? I honestly cannot deal with people anymore. Even talking to them still makes me feel so lonely.

Damn i honestly miss my old self. I kept on thinking this is just temporary sadness but why have i been feeling this way for a year?"
lonely,Forever Alone {STORY TIME},"Forever Alone {STORY TIME} - Just for background, I am 19 and I have never dated anyone (which sucks). 

So I met this girl at a church camp 4 years ago, we met in these things called community groups. The group would meet once a day for three days, in that time I got to learn about everyone in the group specifically this girl we’ll call her Ella. At the time I thought she was cool but never really saw any interest in dating because first of all I was 15 and she was 14, neither of us could drive, and back home she lived two and a half hours away. 

After camp, I would text her every now and then for the next 3 years just to kind of stay in the loop, and I got to see her each returning year at camp, again nothing serious yet. At this point I knew a good amount about her and realized that I really like this girl, she’s super cool, she plays soccer (i was playing soccer in high school at the time), overall she is a great christian girl with good morals and ambition. So naturally i started texting her more and more and realized that I was going to college around 45 minutes away from where she lived (still a drive but better than 2 and a half hours). We were able to connect a couple of times which was awesome. We got to be pretty good friends and talked to each other about serious stuff that was going on in our lives, so it really felt like we were moving in the right direction. 

Unfortunately i flunked out of my first year at college and had to move back home with my parents, however my parents didn’t enjoy where we were living so we ended up moving back up near where i went to school about 3 months ago. In the time after leaving school I surprisingly got closer with Ella, we started facetiming every night and being really intentional with each other so when i told her i was moving up near her again, she was super excited.

In the coming months while my family was figuring out the moving situation, i felt like i was close enough with Ella to really start pursuing a relationship with her. I got to hang out with her a couple more times and then it got serious. Out of the blue she asked me one night over text what my ideal first date was, so I indulged her and said something easy like going to play putt putt or something like that, so i asked her back and she said her ideal first date was a drive in movie, to which I replied in a jokingly serious way “Soo when are we going?” She then laughed and said what about this coming weekend. So at this point y’all gotta understand i’m sitting in my room looking at my phone just geekin’ out, I was so filled with pure excitement. 

We got a firm day, time, and place set up for our first date about a week and a half out (Like late August early September 2020). So this whole week I couldn’t think straight I was so filled with Joy and nervous excitement, I was on cloud 9. I take a couple days to let her do her own thing bc I don’t want to be to pushy or annoying. 

So two days before, I text her to make sure we are still on for this weekend, and ofc she says she had something come up and she won’t be able to make it.... I literally caved, i didn’t want to be a dick about it so i told her it was okay and that i understood and told her that I was free next weekend. 

So we make plans again for the next weekend and everything is looking good so i text her one day before and she says she has something that came up again. Again I can just feel the joy and excitement exhale from my body. Again, i didn’t want to be a dick so I told her it was okay and that i was free for the next weekend.

This time we make plans two weeks ahead, surely nothing could get in the way if we plan that far ahead. Sure enough something came up. At this point in my head i’m like wtf is going on, i’m becoming more and more exhausted with this. I’ve tried to put myself out there to this awesome girl that obviously has some feelings for me, and she just can’t follow through with anything. I’m thinking I wish I could just tell her that this isn’t cool and that i’m really frustrated with her, but at that point if I say that then whenever I finally get a chance to hang out with her it won’t be because she genuinely wants to be with me, it’s because she feels bad for missing all of those dates. And i’m just thinkin I don’t want to begin a relationship with someone who feels like they owe me something, like that would suck. So again, I push it under the rug and let her know i’m free whenever she has time. 

So we follow the same pattern for the next month or so, and so now I’m getting super depressed because i’m devoting all of my time and energy into this girl hoping that I might get a date with her, or at this point even get to see her at all. 

So finally a couple weeks later (First week of Nov) I told her I was in town for a golf tournament and I’d love to see her if she has any time. So she responds and invites me to go to church with her and her parents. So ofc i’m like yes that would be awesome. So these nearly two months of not seeing her have led up to this point. Again my stomach gets butterflies and i’m really excited. So we go to church and have an awesome time, everything was going really good. After church she invited me to get lunch with just her. So we go and sit down and eat a good lunch, again everything is going great, i’m making her laugh and we’re both telling stories and stuff. I was having an awesome time and it seemed like she was too. So we are driving back to the church so she can drop me off at my car and she says, “Hey, I really need to tell you something”.  As you can imagine in my head i’m like ah damn here we go. 

She says, “I feel like it’s important for me to tell you this, i’ve been talking to this guy for like three weeks and i really like him.” And again all of my excitement just escapes my body. (Even now, writing this, my heart is beating out of my chest) I didn’t want to act off of emotion in the moment, so i asked her how they met and she replied and said her cousin set them up in a blind date a couple weeks ago and they have been hanging out ever since (I couldn’t tell what her reason was behind telling me this, i didn’t know if she was asking for advice, or trying to let me down easy, or trying tell me that she has other guys interested and i need to make a move). So i asked if she was serious about this guy and had intentions of dating him and in short she said that she did like him and was probably going to date him. 

So the rest of the car ride back was pretty quiet, I tried to play it off like i wasn’t upset about it because i didn’t want to make her feel bad, it took some balls to tell me that straight to my face, so i didn’t want to make her eat her words and like backlash at her like how could you or anything like that. We got back to the church and I got out and asked her for a hug and the. walked to my car and that was it. 

For the next week I was still confused on why she told me all of that, and my head was spinning so I decided to give myself peace of mind I was going to call her and tell her what was up. So i called and told her, “i’m sorry if this is a surprise or shock, but i really like you. I feel like i have made an effort to get closer with you and have become good friends with you, and i just can’t leave this without saying how I feel about you, it will literally eat me alive, i figured you meant what you said about this guy and how you plan to date him, but i have to know why you told me that, if it was to let me down easy, or asking for advice, or telling me to make a move.” She was shocked and said, “yea, i kinda saw this coming, hey, i really like you too, i think your cool and are definitely the kind of guy that i would date and maybe even marry (which i thought was super forward), but rn i really like this guy and i think i am going to date him.” again i didn’t want to be confrontational so i told her that i’m still gonna be her friend and i’ll still be here for her if she ever needs to talk about something. And that was that. 

I have now spent the following two months wallowing in utter loneliness and depression. Wondering what I could’ve done differently, or how i could’ve been more effective in different situations. 

It just sucks to know that it wasn’t my fault that this didn’t work out. If she would have just made time for any of those dates we had set up, we would probably be dating rn. I mean i told my friends and family that i couldn’t do stuff with them because i had plans already, there were a couple times where i cancelled plans with family to make the date happen and obviously it was all for not. 

Idk i feel like all of these stories you read are supposed to have a happy ending or that you’re supposed to learn something from your experience, but i genuinely learned nothing from this and it was obviously not a happy ending.

With that being said, I appreciate you reading my story and taking the time to care ab me. I hope you have an awesome rest of your day and I pray that you’re endeavors in finding a partner are much more successful than mine....

everyone makes it seem so easy, just making friends and one of them just falls in love with you and then wow you have a boyfriend that loves you and cares about you and now you're not lonely and sad and wanting to dissapear forever or sleep for all eternity cause everything's better thay way, one feels happy and hopeful and makes plans for the future because now you have a future, you can do whatever you want and feel amazing

i feel like no matter how much i try, how many people i meet, how many friends i make, i'll never get it right

i just wanted to not be alone anymore, to have someone that understands me and cares about me and someone whom i can make happy, someone to plan my future with, someone to make gifts to, someone to play videogames with, someone to wstch movies with, someone to just lay down on the floor listening to music and singing together...

i just wanted to be happy like everyone else

i dont even know why do i bother posting things like this...sometimes it helps, maybe someday the universe will hear me and he'll appear and finally good things will start happening to me

maybe its too late now, maybe i should've jumped to the train when i has the chance

At first I was absolutely broken but then I had found out she had been doing shit she would get mad at me for doing behind my back and was seeing someone she lied about having feelings for behind my back. After finding all this out I was distraught with thoughts of how or why did this happen to me I’ve made some questionable decisions but nothing like cheating or anything of the sorts and yet she, someone who I literally gave up myself for, did that to me. But that’s just some background of the situation i have been making progress slow but progress nonetheless throught the months and I thought I had been doing really well but recently I had a dream with her in it that felt so real and in the morning I was just so hurt and mad at myself because I had thought that I had finally moved past this and I guess that dream made everything flood back in and it’s just all been on my mind recently"

Lately I've been caring less and less about everything that's happening around me/with me. Schoolwork doesn't seem like a priority anymore, losing touch with some friends, realising that I've been absolutely single for multiple years. Few close calls with smoking, though I'm starting to drink more out of my own will at home. I'm a party drinker, but guess I'm not anymore. I love my friends but I'd rather stay in bed than have an actual conversation with them. I used to be an emotional guy, crying at small scenes in shows where an important character dies. Crying at funerals as one 'should'. Crying in general cause I feel bad. Lately I haven't had a tear in my eye except for when I was fake crying for funny videos I send to friends. Sadness = Comedy. I'm training my arms to be stronger, that's a good thing I think. Every day I do a couple of exercises for them. Though I am gaining weight rapidly, I don't care. If I die of a heart attack or something so be it. I barely sleep anymore, and when I do I have stressful dreams or nightmares, therefore the ""barely sleeping"" I mentioned.

I'll Always Be Alone... - First &amp; foremost I wanna say that this post is mostly for me to express myself. This is referring to what I've been through and the patterns of my life that only I know 100% of and lived through. Therefore, don't tell me I'll ""find someone"" or ""I'm young"" or any other dumb bs like that. Stfu. I'm just expressing myself and I'm a random person from the internet you know nothing about. Shut up. OK now here we go! :)

I haven't had friends since the last bit I had at 14. I used to be the kid who was universal. Middle school was my prime. I could literally strike up a conversation with anyone and considered basically everyone in my grade a friend. But then childhood trauma from a toxic home life started building me up and the saga of my depression, anxiety, etc started coming in. Yay. It made me mature very quickly and it also made me figure out the truth about the universe. I was figuring out too much. A lot of times I wished I could just be mindless and oblivious like everyone else, but no. Everything had to be so cryptic.. and that became my main trait. So that happened and obviously most teens want to be popular and fit in... obviously I had no friends during my high school era lol. I always thought to myself as I was approaching 16, 17, 18: *Damn, I needa hurry up and actually make one close ally because even I'm losing myself and nobody knows who I really am.*

And that's what happened. I deteriorated and lost myself completely. So now I'm 20. And when you're that age and you meet people and this has been my experience I'm not saying this for everyone so again Stfu. Nobody actually gives a fuck about you. Nobody texts you. Nobody checks up on you. You can't truly know a person, people hide their selves more and become better at being deceptive. You don't know the baggage they carry, they don't know yours.

lonely,A message for all my folks with social anxiety,"A message for all my folks with social anxiety - As someone who struggled with quite debilitating social anxiety for years and overcome(i think) it, I know how hard and hopeless it can feel sometimes. But as I’m scrolling thru this sub I read posts from people who sound like what I felt like when I was struggling, and want to provide a message of hope and affirmation for you all. First; there is another side and it’s greener. When my anxiety was at its peak all I longed for was to be ‘a normal person.’ But that itself is the paradoxical trap that is severe social anxiety. The more you distance yourself from thinking you’re normal, the more desperate and lonely you get. You start believing that you just werent made for society and shut yourself out. If you haven’t figured it out yet, there is no ‘normal.’ Everyone and yes even you is a wholly unique and complex person. The more you think that you’re abnormal the harder it is for you to express yourself, because you’re telling yourself you’re less than or broken or uninteresting or awkward. Many of us who struggle with social anxiety didnt receive a lot of affirmation when we were growing up or even in our early adulthood, and so we calcify in that experience of feeling excluded. Do yourself a favor and give yourself a break. You ARE enough and you have totally beautiful and unique experiences to share with the world and those around you, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. Don’t let other people’s perceptions of you, be it past or present, define you; only you can do that. I know these might just sound like words but believe me I’ve been where you are now. I was so socially anxious that going into a Subway to get a sandwich was the most frightening thing to me, because I would have to talk to the worker and tell them my preferences, which was so difficult for me and Id find myself whispering my order and going along with whatever the workers said even though i sure as shit don’t want tomatoes on my sandwich. A few years and lots of personal work and reflection later, I’m a social butterfly. That doesn’t necessarily have to be the goal for you, but being honest with yourself and others should be. There is a Bernie Mac quote that has guided me throughout the years and I thought maybe you’ll get some inspiration from it..’Boy just be yourself, if people don’t like you when you’re being yourself, FUCK EM!” :) feel free to pm me if you’re ever feeling so overwhelmed or hopeless, I’m here to help. LOVE"

I'm probably going to buy my little sisters some gifts bc they're the only ones that love me 😔✌️ Remember Valentine's day doesn't have to be about your significant other. You can use it as a day to show your love and appreciation for platonic relationships you have with people, or even some long needed self love and care. So, don't get sad you're not cuddled up on the couch with someone this Vday. There will be other opportunities to do that. Eventually, maybe.... 😂"

lonely,My current state,"My current state - Right now shit is not going so well. I was a senior in high school when COVID first hit and shit kind of went downhill from there. My best friend who I was really tight with for 3 years and we did so much incredible shit together and talked about personal stuff just randomly cut me out after going quiet for like 3 months. When I texted him he said he found new friends and was doing way better and wants a fresh start. This would somewhat understandable if he was going to a faraway college but he’s literally in the same college as me and I even have a class with him on zoom. My other close friend who I went to comic con with just became incredibly more toxic and I could  never talk about anything personal with him because he was so narcissistic and I kind of cut him out for my own mental health. Another pretty close friend I had who I liked just blocked me on everything randomly and we had also had a good connection and were even planning on making a game together. Now top that what the fact that 95 percent of my college is on zoom including clubs and organizations so it is very hard to make new friends considering it’s the teacher or club leader just talking most of the time. I still have some friends from middle school and high school but a lot of them are out of state or r pretty introverted so I’m usually the one hitting them up and I wonder if some of them would ever hit me up if I just randomly went quiet. I also struggle with a bad anxiety disorder and it been this way ever since I was 11 and I was bullied by my peers and isolated from the rest of them. In general, I’ve felt this sense of alienation from a lot of people. Im very empathetic and I will always try to view things from the persons perspective and try to understand the world from their point of view and I also always try to help ppl when they need it. In the schools I’ve been to there’s always been this sort of casual cruelty that ppl have like “clowning other people”. Like I remember a giant group of guys were making fun of how “ugly” a guys gf was and were laughing hysterically. This completely disgusts me and it feels like shit like this was always going on. I have a lot of interests that a lot of ppl around me didn’t have and most ppl would rather talk about some extremely bland and basic shit while I’d rather go beyond the surface level. (Although I have bonded with a lot of ppl through gaming which is good) I also struggle with a bad anxiety disorder and some social anxiety and I will constantly overthink everything while most other ppl around me will be chill af. Like even something as simple as walking I will overthink like hell. I’m also learning how to drive and while I was doing good at first, I had some close calls while on the road and last time I drove I just felt this horrible anxiety and feeling in my chest. I’m 19 rn and my road test is next month and I really feel like I need more practice. A license is essential not just for financial reasons but also for cultural reasons too. I feel like if I don’t get it will a massive turnoff to most women and even ppl, but I’m also very scared of getting into an accident since my focus has been really off. Top this off with my parents splitting up bc of my dad having insane anger issues which probably contributed to my anxiety disorder and while I love him and still spend time with him I do feel like I’m walking on eggshells when I’m around him and they should for sure be selling the house and splitting by summer. My best hope is becoming a clinical psychologist to help ppl which has been my dream for a while but I also feel like how can I become one when my mental health is currently shit. I’m seeing a pretty good therapist and my mother tries her best to understand when I talk to her about these things but idk man there’s still this empty void that I’m carrying inside of me. I’m posting bc I’d like to make some friends on this forum and talk about this shit together and have a dialogue. A friend of mine said she made some pretty good friends on here and I’m hoping to do the same with y’all :). Feel free to private dm if you want and I wish you all the best on your journeys!"

I surround myself with good people, but absolutely hate reaching out to people, making everyone at best good acquaintances. I really feel like the only person in this world looking out for me is me, I get that it should be enough but I'm just so tired of being the only person looking out for me.

Because, that's what I want, I want to have friends that I can smoke weed and hang out with, but I'm too socially awkward. 

I have quite a few friends, but I don't like many of them, and we all live far apart from eachother. Also, they're like me and probably wouldn't want to hang out on our own. 

At the moment, all I can do is try to strengthen the friendships I already have, and hope for the best."

lonely,I just want to be loved.,"I just want to be loved. - I've always been okay with not having A LOT of friends because I do get on very well with the friends I have but I've never actually been in a relationship with a girl before.

I recently caught very strong feelings for a girl I was friends with and told her. She told me she used to like me but she's now with someone else. When we were close I would tell her every single day that I'm there for her because she suffers from depression and so do I and she would say the same thing. But since she's gotten into a relationship with another guy I just want that feeling back. That someone I care for unconditionally loves me the same way, and that no matter how much we fight that feeling of love still remains. I'm just so tired of not being the one to be loved or truly cared for. I want someone checking in on me randomly during the day and seeing how I am, someone who truly does want to hear about my problems and will listen no matter what. Someone who just wants to speak to me, spend time with me, hear my voice, see my face, be near me. The same way I want all that with her. 

I have only ever felt this feeling of warmth for a few days when I was talking to this girl but I miss it so much. I miss her. I miss what we could have been. I miss being asked how I am. I miss that mutual feeling of love and concern.

I will always care about you and how you are. I don't care if you scream at me about your problems. I want to hear about them. I want to listen to what's bothering you. I just want you to know that I'm the one you feel you can count on to always be there regardless. I know you're still suicidal and it hurts so much wanting to help you and be there for you while knowing I'm not the one you want to hear it from anymore.   


&gt;If you ever fall, that means I fell first You will land on me, you will never be hurt First birth, then the dirt, but in the middle you learn That dialect no longer helps, you know there is no words We could live like birds, just watch out for the windows Float around forever, go wherever the wind blows Or we could be worms deep down in the dirt Any fucking thing you want no matter how absurd

I have some days where I feel like I've let her go but then I just fall back into that state of sadness. I can't stop thinking about her. I took her for granted and I'll never forgive myself for that."

As the subreddit name says I've been living like this for almost a year and it's been 5 or 6 months that anyone had talked to me until now. One of my univ friend actually called me and talke about how I was looking good today during the online class. He further asked me about how I'm doing and what I've been upto lately and I asked the same to him. We had like some good 30 mins talk and it felt really good.

lonely,Social anxiety at 10,"Social anxiety at 10 - I developed social anxiety when I was 10 yrs old because these boys in my class decided to make fun of me everyday. They told me that I shouldnt get mad because if I did then what they were saying was true. I told my teacher about their behavior but he told me that it was my fault for giving them attention and said if it werent true then I shouldnt have gotten mad. Slowly, the people who I thought were my best friends started to drift away from me. They didnt defend me at all nor asked if I was okay. The teachers were shit too. In the previous grade, believe me, I had a LOT of close friends and teachers. I had no enemies and was very outgoing. Those boys and teachers became shit. I started eating lunch alone, take recess alone pretending that i was sleeping in my seat while everyone was in different groups. Everyday at that grade felt like hell. The only thing that gave me some glimmer of hope and bliss was topping our class. But even then I still felt alone and became the last choice for everyone. I started talking to myself, telling myself not to trust anyone. I started forcing myself to laugh to trick myself that I was fine and that I didnt need anyone. There were only a few times when they didnt tease me that I felt something was wrong or lacking in my day. I got used to their torture that the sudden change made me feel something worse was gonna come. So I somehow instigated that they should tease me or make fun of me. 4th grade was a fucked up year for me then this continued until 6th grade in the same school till my parents transferred me to a new one. 

Now Im 21 years old. I managed to fix myself just enough to become a functioning person. But some effects snowballed into college. I still cant forgive those kids and teachers. I have a grudge against them. I still cant trust anyone. I immediately have to prepare a mask when I meet new people. I would rather be in a group with strangers than with people I already know so they cant pick on me. So you could say that I still dont have a close group of friends and I choose who I can be acquainted with. Even then, I still cry and wallow in self-pity. I just want someone to ask if Im okay, not just because they’re curious but because they care. I havent felt any empathy from anyone in years.  

Takeaway from this: Please take care of your kids. Defend them. Ask your kids what is happening in school. Please dont let them turn out like me."

Either I let them vent, or they let me vent. Maybe we talk about hobbies or personal lives but nothing ever goes anywhere. I either get ghosted, start getting one word responses, or the conversation just fizzles out because it turns out I'm talking to someone different from or incompatible with me.

I'm guessing this is the norm, and I've basically stopped reaching out now because I'm seeing the same things over and over

Has anybody successfully made any friends hear? Like actual friends, not being invited to a massive discord group or something like that. 

1 on 1 connection.

seems the only people I've found here are the people who simply listen then encourage me to get help (which isn't bad, but it doesn't really help me personally) or the people who are in the same boat as me, and usually aren't compatible or want me to do all the talking, meanwhile I want them to do the talking 😅 

I get it, you can't really makes friends just by chatting on reddit, plus what would you even chat about? To actually makes friends you need to actually do stuff together. And that's why I'm sat here asking whether or not people have been able to make friends here? Or is it just a bunch of platonic one night stands?"
lonely,affection didn't help,"affection didn't help - a while ago my friend introduced me to someone who eventually started acting pretty affectionate with me at first I just didn't believe anything they said but they kept trying to get me to trust them so eventually I let my guard down I believed them started acting affectionate back. they would compliment me, they would say they loved me, and they said they wanted to cuddle me, every once in a while they would screenshot something when I asked why they just said it ""made them happy"" and at this point I trusted them eventually I found out that they were sending screenshots to basically our entire friend group this upset me because I wasn't even fully comfortable saying these things just to them much less everyone I know and thanks to a beautifully timed mental breakdown I came to the conclusion that they only ever wanted me to be affectionate so that they could make fun of me for it later even before this happened whenever they came to mind I would either question their motives or beat myself up for liking them after the little incident with the screenshots it was back to square one and I didn't trust them at all I got scared and started acting rude and now I don't even talk to them and now I know that history is bound to repeat itself with anyone else who dares to compliment me even if I get the affection I'm so desperate for I can't comprehend it and everything goes to shit."

lonely,I feel incredibly lonely. [M24],"I feel incredibly lonely. [M24] - I'm pretty isolated due to my life style. I rarely ever go outside due to social phobia. It's not that I hate going outside it's just that I'm scared of being hurt by people. I've been hurt badly in my childhood and it makes it difficult for me to trust people in adulthood.

My life is very lonely and I desperately need a friend. I find it hard to form friendships with people online and have been trying for a very long time. I think one of the biggest issues I have is probably that I lack common interests with the people I talk to. I wouldn't consider myself a normie at all. I'm weird and love nature. Evolution, selective breeding, ecology and animal behavior all fascinates me.

Throughout my life people have tried to tear me down and make me forget about my purpose. I never lost sight of my dream, but recently I've been faltering a bit. Loneliness is a big part of that. I lack any kind of decent support network. If I'm struggling emotionally with something I have nobody I can rely on to listen. I live a life devoid of emotional understanding and it's hurting me. Every day that passes I become more and more pessimistic due to feeling so deeply lonely.

I don't want to be alone anymore. I want to reach out and make some kind of long lasting friend. I'm starting to worry that maybe I'm unable to form anything meaningful anymore."

lonely,My Disorder,"My Disorder - Reddit 

I don't know if this is the right subreddit. Sorry for making it long and disorganized. I just want to get my thoughts out there. I know post this to Reddit is dumb but I need help or someone with the same experience on how they dealt or dealing with the situation. Because I'm on the verge of ending it. I have told this to a couple of close friends and they are really helpful but it feels like it's not enough. I was born with a disorder called oculocutaneous albinism, ""Individuals affected by oculocutaneous albinism have very light skin and light-colored irises; they may also have vision problems such as decreased sharpness of vision, rapid eye movements ( nystagmus ), crossed eyes (strabismus), or increased sensitivity to light (photophobia)."" (By Google). And this disorder is making it harder to live. It feels like, and as I'm an adult, life is so much harder. And on top of all that, I'm not trying to diagnose myself (I don't want to be diagnosed), I believe I have mental issues. Like ADHD, social anxiety, OCD and dyslexia. For example, it took some time to write this but you can probably find a lot of grammatical errors. I want to know what to do. I'm holding out hope but it feels like I'm slowly losing that. I have a fucked up body, with that, will I ever be happy or find someone to be with? It feels like my emotions change between happy and sad every few days or so, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter. I realized how bad my emotions got when I was watching a romantic comedy, awhile back. I know this is kinda weird but I had a panic attack during one episode. I kept thinking I could never be this happy. Couldn't breathe for two minutes, called my friends afterwards to calm me down. And, I don't really wanna die, I just don't see any other option of moving forward. So, how do I accept, if possible, myself, my body and who I am? And, how do I improve my confidence? I just wanna be happy but sometimes that's just such a hard task. This is the first time I post something so personal, so please, any useful help is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you again for reading this. "

For example, I look at my instagram and I want to delete everything. I look at the photos I used to post and that girl seems so frivolous. I don't know what's the point of instagram if you aren't selling anything, have a small circle of friends and are introverted AF. I feel lonely on there. People I follow are old friends who I barely keep in touch with anymore. They're people I used to be in a social circle with before I moved across the country.

Now that I'm moved to another state, I realize that I am alone and I am lonely. I keep feeling like I don't matter. Nothing I do or create or say matters. No one cares because there are more interesting and artistic and cool people out there.

I kept hearing from my 28 year-old friends that when you turn 28, you stop giving a f\*\*\*. But now that I'm 28, I feel more empty, alone, and depressed. I am struggling with my own identity and who I am.

I have a good paying job, a lovely girlfriend, and a game that I religiously play and enjoy. Everything seems to be going into a full circle for me, but unfortunately, I still.. feel the need to reject such concepts and it makes it hard for me to overcome the feeling of depression. I’ve been mentally abused since I was 4-years-old, which doesn’t exactly help as to why I can’t function normally, and I’m 23 now. Being called worthless my whole life has been the cycle that I’m used to and after working hard for happiness, after mistakes of breaking up with loved ones due to my shortcomings, destroying my own life due to my insecurities as being labeled as insignificant, I’ve finally obtained some sense of it. However, it’s just not.. real to me for some reason and I still feel an empty husk within me. I always feel like I have to carry something, to make it right, but everything seems right as what everyone perceives, but to me.. nothing is. I thank you all in advance for your thoughts, whatever they may be. I’ve been trying so hard to achieve self improvement, and I believe the input of others would help."
lonely,I don’t know whether I should commit to being a loner or continue making efforts to be with people.,"I don’t know whether I should commit to being a loner or continue making efforts to be with people. - I’m in this weird predicament where I hate being lonely, but I also hate being with people, and to some extent receiving the love I spend time dreaming about. I’m a little different than most people like me though, in that I genuinely don’t care about anyone most of the time, but when I do I get super depressed. I just wonder if I should try and address whatever weird self sabotage I’m doing to myself, or give up on that, and focus on myself. The more I focus on others, the more lonely and depressed I feel for not being close to others, and the more I focus on myself, the further from others I become (granted it isn’t much better when I focus on others) and I always end up breaking down the pillars I build up for myself and wallow in the loneliness. What’s better, wading around in the swamp for the chance that I find a way out, or climbing up a tree with the chance of falling back into the swamp at any time?"
lonely,A paradox,"A paradox - I was the more social of two autistic siblings. However, I overshared a movie event that the more popular people of my group were attending to the less popular.

As a result, the organiser changed the movie time and the group excluded me. All because I 'couldn't keep my idiot mouth shut'.

It's hilarious how trying to socialise more with my group eventually ended with them abandoning me."
lonely,"Beautiful, successful, and friendless","Beautiful, successful, and friendless - Beautiful, successful, and friendless  I consider myself pretty successful at my age, and I have a lot going for me honestly. Everything of which I have created from nothing, and then have gotten helpful nudges for along the way. I’m beautiful. And I am incredibly grateful. I say this all with humility, because my success or my looks- things that are determined physically- do not define who I truly am. I know that I am a great friend, and I go out of my way for everyone that I love.  But- one thing that always gets me low, and particularly when I am not distracted by my duties/hobbies, is that I have no friends. I have no friends that are supporting me in these endeavors from the sidelines. I have no friends to share good news with or to talk about the mundane with or to ask for some support when I get tired of having to be so supportive of myself all the time. I have a loving boyfriend, and he is very supportive himself, and I love him so much; I consider him my best friend. But I don’t have anyone else. It’s so hard.... My boyfriend has so many friends and he will always share stories about them with me and it’s always hard for me to relate. I feel like my friendship doesn’t matter enough to anyone for anyone to seek it out or to keep it. All of the friends I have had I have lost because they used me, they became toxic, they became disinterested, moved away, or just got closer to their roommate/another friend. I feel like I have “friend trauma”, because I noticed that it has become increasingly harder for me to open up to people even when I want to so badly be their friend. That desperation for a friend has even left me hurt, because I trust too easy, before trust should be earned.  I always doubt myself as a result of being friendless- in spite of my looks and my success, and my kindness expressed to everyone equally- I feel that I am boring, awkward, and my goofiness is taken as weird by many. It’s hard for me to even relate to a lot of people my own age.  I don’t know what to think anymore.  I went to a therapist last summer and they weren’t very helpful, because I felt they focused on all of my success. This is a vent, but advice is welcome. Will I not find valuable friends in this lifetime? Will I ever find solace in this loneliness? How do I stop comparing the fruitful social lives/groups others (my boyfriend included) have, that I don’t? Will my continued success keep driving me further into loneliness?"

But other than that, every time of get off I just feel empty. I dont talk to much of my family. Dont have a girlfriend. I have a handful of friends that i can talk to on games but not irl. Its sooo fucked. Be a sociable creature who cant socialize is the worst. I have tried to find someone that i could wake up and talk to every morning. Chat during the day and evening.

what do i have to change? or, what do i have to get? when am i gonna be enough for someone to appear?

i just wish it was my turn too...

i always wanted someone to be by my side, someone to go to the deepest parts of the world and enjoy them together, someone to plan a life with and have fun on the way, just enjoying everything us two

i almost had someone like that...i was so close, it was perfect...but...i guess i was not enough

and i feel like no matter how much i try, i only get worse and worse...i try...i just wish i was enough already

everyone says i should just better myself and it'll happen on its own but at this point it seems like a useless effort

everyone else has someone and i feel like i'll never be able to do anything i've always wanted to do

some people they just up and fall in love and have a perfect life together...i just want a little of that happiness too

i just wish i was enough to have that too

She says, ""You have your own bedroom, you have your own laptop, you went to a great high school, you dine out fairly often, we travel overseas more...what more do you want?""

Funny how she assumes that people like me should be happy due to having a lot of resources. That sickening, gut-wrenching trait of people my age that is just growing and growing.

lonely,First time poster. Long time emotional trauma.,"First time poster. Long time emotional trauma. - The title doesn't make any sense and ironically enough, neither do my feelings. Ill be honest. I have no idea what I'm doing. For whatever reason a character in a series I have been obsessing over for months died and I guess threw my glass bottle of feelings at the wall and I had a massive breakdown. 

I dont know man. I don't have anyone to vent to. I have family but their support is very shallow and next to meaningless. I guess I thought I would find solace in venting to the internet. I dont think its working though. 

There is one thing I wanted to know though. I have never been to therapy and I considered it the past week. My issue is I feel like all emotional and mental therapy is like a scam. Set up my corporations to make a quick buck off of the misfortune of others. I understand its a job and people need to pay the bills but it makes it so much more ungeninuine when I know I am paying them $100+ an hour. I feel like if I wanted to pay someone to listen to me cry for an hour I would save a lot more money by finding some random person online and giving them like $20 to just sit and listen. 

I dont know. Maybe I am being too cynical. Maybe I am severely traumatized. Who knows. I sure don't. Comment or dont. Im just a lonely person, not a cop lol."

I have no friends, never had a relationship with someone, I can’t small talk with people, I don’t speak to my family, I can’t even voice chat online. I’m actually screwed in life. Idk wtf happened, I tried so hard to be friendly and kind to everyone at school, but at the end of the day nobody cares or bothers to reach out. Everyone else seems to have social circles. All I have is suicidal feelings, tears and a knife to SH with. I feel like kindness gets you shit in life. I’m sick of it, you just get walked all over and ignored, and then left in the dirt as voiceless as the dead. I don’t feel like continuing the long, tiring, boring, painful journey that is life all alone without friends, family, and love. I wish I could just be normal like everyone else with good relationships with their family and friends. The only reason I’m not dead is because I don’t want my mother to find me and have to go through that. I wish I could say I have other things keeping me alive, but I have no passions, and don’t leave my room other then to work a shitty job for money I don’t really need. I really hate my life, it’s dull and boring. Of course I had to live in the tiniest town ever so that doesn’t help. I haven’t even seen someone my age outside of work for 5ish years now. I wish I was normal and now awkward and a freak of nature of everyone."
lonely,What if you find comfort in being lonely,"What if you find comfort in being lonely - When I was younger, I was never lonely, I had so many friends and never gone a day without having the time of my life. But when I got to high school, I was put in a position where access to friends was damn right impossible. Of course I could talk to them online but that only lasted a while before they moved on and filled the position I held in their lives with other people whom they could physically interact with. As the years went by, still in the same situation mind you, it definitely didn't get better. I was lonely to a point of near madness, and I know people would say ""you can just make new friends where you are"", but they had no idea how difficult that was. It reached a point in my life where I suddenly stopped caring. I never complained to my parents how life sucked and the thoughts that I had stopped bothering me. Being alone was no longer an issue for. I had made peace with the fact that this was how it was supposed to be. 

Currently I am at a place where I can interact with new people and make connections that I had lost. The problem with that is that I dont fell like doing it. I rather just mind my own busy and stick by myself. People don't realise it, but, when am around them I only think about when they are gonna leave. To me that's has become my normal despite me having been a sicial and friendly person back in the day. Tbh spending all of that time alone has really helped me be more self aware and to be aware of other people.

Hence my question, What if you find comfort in being loney? Is it unhealthy for me to feel this way? What consequences can transpire?"

lonely,Shoutout to the folks out there who aren’t the best looking or even sightly at all.,"Shoutout to the folks out there who aren’t the best looking or even sightly at all. - If you question if you are ugly because of how lonely you are, I want to tell you that you are not alone. I have been overweight since before middle school, and combined with acne, I was picked on more than my fair share. I have a few pieces of advice for everyone who is lonely and desperate, as I was and perhaps still am. Never lower your standards because you are desperate. A reevaluation of standards every now and again is okay, but do not date someone you know you wouldn’t just because you’re desperate. I regret it very dearly, as I not only spent time in a dead relationship, but it also tarnished my reputation for a couple years, and I still dare not speak of it. My second piece of advice is to develop a thick skin and a good bravado. If you lay the confidence on thick, it becomes natural. However, never go full ego. Don’t do it. If you think you are ugly, remember that looks are not the only way to be attractive. As horribly superficial as it sounds, a big wad of cash and rock hard abs are nigh interchangeable. Remember that both are superficial, but that you have at least a bit of control in one of them."
lonely,Hard to find my friends?,"Hard to find my friends? - I think I continue to believe people hold similar fundamental values to myself that simply aren’t a primary value to others? Certain character traits and social behaviours I’ve learned to be correct and respectful, are not reciprocated by most people my age. Nothing wrong with other people for that, just something I’m trying to adjust to, but am having a difficult time.

I don’t feel like I’m above anyone, as I understand that sort of gives the vibe of. Just, it’s me not being a normal person my age socially, which can be tough. But, I still want to be myself. I need to remember not everyone is like me.

Ok, well for instance, talking to anyone, I’ve always had the expectation to give 100% of my attention to the individual I am speaking to. Or, being honest, communicating and respectful. Just a lot of people manage to have friendships with people that aren’t serious or mutual and I have difficulty wrapping my head around it.

I do feel like I’m more mature sometimes. But, I understand that’s also quite egotistical. I think the way I was raised both at home and in school I took seriously, as other children didn’t. Which made me into pretty much the model person a school wants to produce in their system. I’m happy with who I am. But, just not well prepared for most socially typical non-formal “hangouts” or chats. But, it does workout for me with some people, just very little.

In the end, this leaves me feeling very lonely."
lonely,I just asked someone to apologize to me,"I just asked someone to apologize to me - I've been doing a lot of apologizing since last year for various idiotic things I have been involved in or pushed into doing reluctantly. However, the tables have turned for once. In this case, someone was lying about her age and constantly pushing me to be in a relationship with her when I wasn't comfortable with that, so I just wrote her a message to apologize to me and to never do anything like that to anyone else again. I hate myself over that and many more things in my life. I just really hope the person apologizes to me. I deserve to feel alone, and have been doing my best to cut off most acquaintances as a result. I just need to do a few more things before I off myself."

lonely,"Married and lonely, and I think she she cheated","Married and lonely, and I think she she cheated - Ok so a little background, married 15 years with my wife I have 3 kids, 16 15 and 7. We met at work back in San Francisco, our hometown currently living in south Arizona. For a good part of our marriage I was the soul provider, it was hard but we made it, reason we left San Francisco for southern Arizona, I had family that lived here and so we moved, been here for 13 years. As the kids got older it was getting harder and harder to maintain the single provider. A little over 3 years ago I got second job to make it through. I worked 2 years at Walmart. It was around the second year that well, my wife entered the workforce after 15 years of staying home, she got a job at Walmart herself, not mine but another one in town. I quit mines after she was comfortable at her job. I thought it was going to be great, 2 INCOMES!! Not so. At first it was good she was happy learning her job but a few months into it she changed, became distant and well things were getting rough, she became distant. It’s been like that through the years, here and there but this round it was the hardest. Yeah she told me she didn’t love and want to leave. It was a shell shocked. I was I guess being very emotional, I mean I have this woman 15 years and now this. I wanted to work things out and she didn’t. I gave her space. It was a rough summer, on top of thatcher sister moved in with us with her husband and her two kids. That’s another story. Anyways yes I insecure and thought it was another man, she always has maintain that she doesn’t believe in cheating she had a rough childhood growing up and always remember her mom bring other men around her. Anyways back to the topic. In my emotions distress and her not really talking or communicating with me one day I was on my laptop and just just typed in Facebook. Well, she was logged on a I found a chat with her and a coworker. From the conversation they seemed really close, they would say good nite and good morning to each other’s. One day he said good morning beautiful and one day looking at the day stamp they were talking on my birthday like wasn’t even watching tv with her. There was one conversation how one of her coworkers thought they were fucking because I guess they had so much “sexual tension” that riled me so much. Like a fucking lot. Im getting so made thinking about it so much right now lol. This was September last year. They were talking a lot during the summer, looking at the conversation it was the time she was blowing me off. Hell there’s was one time she text me back that she was in class with my son, online, blew me off but she was talking to him. Their online relationship kinda tapered down toward the end of September, lol Amy due to the fact one day I did tell her I dreamt that she was stalking a janitor on Facebook and she was crying because she felt bad, mind you this was before I found about everything. Well one day I just logged off and made sure I deleted her info so I couldn’t get back in. I was driving myself crazy. Not healthy for me. Months passed I guess out relationship got a little better but now it just feels different. I did ask about they guy, she doesn’t know I know, but she said his dumbass got fired for stupid stuff he said, getting fired from a janitor job at Walmart, what a  real winner there huh. Anyways I guess I rambled on too long. I just now think of all those times and now it’s like I don’t know our spark isn’t there. There’s days I want to ask her about that time but then she would know I went through her Facebook. Right now I just feel married and lonely. Sorry for the long story."

Anyway, it’s going on three weeks since we last spoke. It’s truly been an eye opener for me. I’m starting to realize how much better she made my life. I’m also starting to realize how much of an asshole I was. 

I’m looking back over all the times she would want to hang out &amp; I would say no. It’s not because I didn’t like being around her, but because I enjoyed being alone. I would get mentally exhausted after hanging around people too much/often. Now, I would literally give anything just to hear her voice &amp; hug her. It pains me in the inside when I think of how long it may be till we are physically around eachother again. She was more than my partner. She was my bestfriend—and one of my only friends. 

I just wish I wouldv’e appreciated all the times she wanted to hang out. Like, since she left it’s been like I’ve went into a social-less void. I feel empty. I feel like I lost my other half. 

TL;DR My girlfriend went to basic training &amp; now im terribly lonely. I have a hard times making new friends. All of my old friends are too busy. Life sucks without her."

lonely,Feeling so depressed makes me so guilty,Feeling so depressed makes me so guilty - I mean like why shouldn’t I be depressed in this fucked up world where I only get used by people and nobody will ever care about me. I don’t blame anyone though because they shouldn’t. I’ve accepted I’ll never be truly loved or cared for. They just want me to be successful so my feelings don’t even really matter to them. All they’re worried about is when I’m gonna get my shit together and stop being depressed so I won’t keep causing them problems. I might as well just die so they can move on already.

And then we can opt in if we want to join. - All of us are on here wanting the same thing, I wish reddit could sort our profiles and match us with proper age range, sexual preference, and part of the world.  
You could opt in or out whenever you want to.

And then you get a message in your inbox that there is a match and then an email is sent to both of you to start the conversation for those of us that have a hard time starting social situations.  The email can have a template of ice breaking and appropriate questions to get the party started.  

For some reason I feel like I would feel more safe than OLD, We will already know the person is lonely And looking for companionship and it will get the conversation started for people that are shy.  

Sometimes I chat with somebody and then a couple minutes later I am revealed that they are 12 years old. This would just funnel us into each other without something like that happening.  I don’t know, I wish There were some other options besides online dating especially during Covid, in my state you can’t go anywhere or do anything."
lonely,Does anyone else get the feeling that they're second rate?,"Does anyone else get the feeling that they're second rate? - Medium/Semi-Long post:

As the title implies, I have had the feelings for a while that I'm a ""second choice"" or a ""backup"" when it comes to things like friendship. All of the friends I made through highschool with the exception of one, all have their own friend groups. 

This in itself is completely fine, I want my friends to be happy. But it leaves me completely isolated.. especially now during this whole Covid time. I hear from them maybe once or twice every four months, and even then it's only 5-6 texts. 

I guess.. it just sucks, you know? I used to try really hard to maintain communication, but after a while it just felt like I was trying to pull teeth. I stopped messaging them entirely to see what would happen and the communication has almost completely vanished.

I want the best for my friends, and even if I never hear from them again I hope for the best for them. But in a time like this, it just makes crippling isolation that much worse. They know I've been struggling too.. so it just leaves me with the feeling of complete abandonment."
lonely,"I feel like before you know it, I'll be 60 yrs old with no good memories and not very many good times","I feel like before you know it, I'll be 60 yrs old with no good memories and not very many good times - I just isolate myself out of my anxiety and fear of the public. I'm so depressed because I can't get out of this shell. I don't even talk much anymore, because I don't feel like I even have much to say. I'm only 22 and have had friends and a girlfriend. But I don't think I'll ever find any ever again. Like my anxiety and self esteem are so life ruining, it's not even funny. I fear l'll just become a hermit loner for the rest of my life. So far I feel like that's where I'm headed."

I struggle so much with this push/pull of just wishing my friends would try to get me to open up and share. To ask me how I’m doing , etc. I just want to talk and open up. 

But, as soon as someone asks me how I’m doing, I don’t want to be a burden or am ashamed, so I just say something half hearted like “I’m okay.”

Why am I like this?"

I am so lonely, and anyway even when I meet people I still feel lonely because I am just not able to assume myself. I don’t know what to do about this"

lonely,Story time. (Hopefully I haven't already told this one. Plus there's a life lesson at the end),"Story time. (Hopefully I haven't already told this one. Plus there's a life lesson at the end) - After my divorce and before I bought my house I had a couple roommates to help ends meet.    The last of these was my really good friend Alan (pseudonym).   When he moved in I knew he had a bit of a drinking problem but I didn't realize how far it went.    Turns out he drank about 2 pints of vodka per day, give or take,  for the last twenty years.    After a couple years of living with me he collapsed one day and I had to call the paramedics.    Turns out he had numerous organs shutting down and a day after admission into the hospital he was in a coma.  For about a week no one thought he would wake up.   Then they said even if he did his kidneys liver and pancreas were thrashed and he would die anyway.     But then after a week and a half he woke up.    He wasn't very coherent and he couldn't talk because of the tracheotomy.....  it was touch and go.    They thought he'd need dialysis the rest of his life and at one point they thought the dead pancreas tissue had gone necrotic and he was running an extreme fever.    They couldn't find a doctor willing to operate.     But then the fever broke and he woke up.   Called me.    I barely recognized his voice.    Apparently the past two weeks he had no recollection of.     At the end of it all he was discharged.    No dialysis at all.   Just treatment for type 2 diabetes which developed from the damage to his pancreas.    

He came home.   He wasn't drinking.    He kept his room looking nice,  he looked after himself.    We were really optimistic.     (I cleaned out his room while he was in the hospital it was so bad I'm surprised it didn't get the building condemned.... alcoholics don't look after themselves)  unfortunately he wasn't willing to get into treatment.   His parents weren't able to help because they simply didn't understand addiction at all.     And there was only so much I could do to stop a grown man from drinking. 
The drinking started up again.   It gradually got back to every bit as bad as it used to be.    We had so many fights that would end with me in tears telling him I couldn't go through all of that again and I can't watch him die ....  and I can't put my kids through him dying..

But things maintained.    For a year and a half,  through other wacky adventures. 

Then one Sunday night at around 2 am I was woken up by him falling over on his way in from having a cigarette.    He was on the floor and I asked if he'd been drinking.    He said no.   I told him that just made me more concerned.   He said that yes fine he'd been drinking.    I told him I wanted to call the paramedics and he begged me not to.    Against my better judgment I agreed on the grounds he call his doctor in the morning,  and I helped him get to bed. 

When I got home from work the next day something seemed off, it didn't look like he'd left his room at all?   But I fell asleep really early because I'd gotten so little sleep the night before.    I woke up and rushed out to work Tuesday but there was still no sign of him.....   I got about an hour into work until I was too stressed and had to take a sick day. 

Well I got home and I knocked and pounded.   It took me hours to finally work to the courage to unlock and open his door.   Where I found him Grey and cold.   The lady on 911 wanted to walk me through CPR but there was no point.    He'd been dead since probably Monday morning. 

After the funeral I got a goodbye letter from his parents with some parting comment about how maybe if id done something different he'd still be alive.    And you know what the worst part is?    They were right.    If I'd called 911 like I knew I should have,  maybe he would still be alive.    But I didn't.   And that's how I lost one of the best friends I'd ever had.    

Ever since I've just always wanted to make sure the people I know understand one thing. 

If you ever feel the need to intervene to save someone,   just do it.    Because if it was unnecessary yeah there may be consequences.    But if you don't?   And you should have?    You will second guess that decision for the rest of your life.    One phone call.   One pissed off friend for at most a few days.    Even if he'd died I would have at least known that I did what I could to save him.    Take serious medical symptoms seriously.    Take planed and serious suicide threats seriously.    Look out for the people you care about because if you drop the ball at the wrong moment that's it."

But since I dont have much a life (Sitting at home, on PC all day) at 23 years old now, you'd think that, like 99% of everyone else I would be able to somewhat make ""friends"" since well everyone else has them by using voice chat. But of course, I can't even make myself do that even though I know how useful it could be. The fear of wondering what the other person thinks of my voice etc. It must be part of social anxiety? I don't know. It really makes me feel down knowing that I just can't even be normal, and knowing that everyone else has no problem in voice communication through Discord or whatever, and without that I simply can't even make friends online.

My Ex-Girlfriend used to always assure me that she would be by my side through the highs and lows but when I found myself stuck, I suddenly didn't fit the criteria for her anymore and she ended things, so how am I supposed to believe anything my current girlfriend tells me? I really wish I could believe her, but words have genuinely lost meaning to me because of how much I've been lied too. I don't even think people are actively trying to lie to me either, I think somewhere in my exes mind she wanted to support me through it all and I think that hurts even more than just a plain faced lie. I'm always on edge thinking I'm gonna lose the people in my life despite how much reassurance I get. There's a part of me that wants to believe people, but am I just setting myself up to be let down again? And I wonder if I'm too young to be putting myself in a position that could end up devastating me. Maybe I have to stop putting so much effort into others, or maybe I'm not putting enough effort in, I'm not entirely sure. Sorry for the rant, just in a state of confusion and uncertainty. I encourage others to comment if they feel the same way, I would love to chat with somebody."

I didn't care that he didn't truly care. He was as nice as never anyone in my life before to me. The memory of how he was when I got to know him was enough for me to let him manipulate me.

I hate that he hates me now. He lied but I still feel like I'm at fault for how I handled what happened.

I'm 26y/o now and I think it started when i was 16-18, I was a young boy full of motivation to study, to explore and to make my life worth something. I got diagnosed with a chronic disease and I spent most of the time in my home drawing and playing videogames until I was 20, then it was time to make some money and luckly I've got a medicine that helps me not to feel pain that much. 

I have a job and I try to go back to studying something, I have a girlfriend and my mother is alive and well. But the last year kinda ""broke a thread"" that was keeping my mental health together. My girlfriend moved to another country months before the pandemic and I haven't seen her since. Everytime I try to talk to her about how I feel I just receive a sad emoji.. I know she is lonely too and I always try to be there for her, I can't blame her knowing how hard it was for her to move and to be there all by herself. 

I can't push myself to talk to my mom about it because I really don't want her to feel sad after all those years I was sick. I move very often to other cities so I also don't really have friends to talk to eather, basically, I don't know what to do.

Long story short, I just wish to talk to somebody about anything.  I just hate feeling alone, I hate not being able to talk to anyone about pain in my chest and all I want is to disappear. Of course, I can't do it because my mom is alive and I know she loves me, but lately I don't find any reason for my existance.

I wanted to get something off my chest. I've been with my boyfriend for 2 and a half years and I'm sad because he never talks about a future for us. I really wish we would take the next step because I love him so much and I'm scared that he's just leading me on.

I don't know what to do. I feel stupid waiting on him. I proposed last year...he said he wasn't ready and I thought that maybe I was too impatient. Nothing has changed since then, except I'm ashamed and doubt whether he loves me. 

I threw the ring I bought away...it was painful knowing it was there and that I'd never give it to him again. It lost it's value to me... In hindsight, I know it wasn't wise to throw away, but honestly the rejection hurt more than people realize. I wanted it out of my sight.

So, I'm posting this because I need support right now. I want valentines to pass quickly because the advertisements are triggersome. Not every hopeful partner will be receiving that perfect proposal. Here's to all the lonely hearts out there. I am truly sorry for all of your pain and disappointment. Love can be a long, lonely road. Just remember, wherever you are out there, you aren't alone. Millions of people know this pain and are routing for you."

lonely,I tried to hang myself last night,"I tried to hang myself last night - (This post also contains a mention of PTSD and abusive relationships). 

Unfortunately, my shoddy college housing prevented me from establishing a stable point from which to hang myself. Had the belt around my neck and then the towel rack started to move.

I cannot do this anymore. I'm a college senior about to graduate into the most uncertainty I've ever faced in my life. I'm a survivor of an abusive relationship with PTSD that haunts me on a near-constant basis. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder with Secondary Depression and ADHD, and I fight a daily war against my own mind. I'm a left-of-center, agnostic, closeted bisexual in a predominantly conservative area and I live with two homophobes, one of whom is annoyingly religious. My family would never accept me if they found out I was bisexual, and those two roommates would probably kick me out. I have 16 credit hours, I'm trying to maintain a solid GPA, and I'm trying to prep for my LSAT, all while also trying to enjoy my final semester. Nothing takes this pain away and I need it to go. I don't want to be alone again on Valentine's Day. I just want a fucking girlfriend, I haven't dated in a year and I'm so tired of being demonized for my desire for partnership by people who are in successful relationships and couldn't fucking be happier."
lonely,"The closer I get to my online ""friends"", the lonelier I feel...","The closer I get to my online ""friends"", the lonelier I feel... - I (26M) never used to have trouble making friends, however my problem was keeping them - started with a combination of me moving away from my friends (pre-widespread internet) and then all my closest friends at my new home moving away from me (shitty luck, right?). Couple that with a few bullying experiences of people pretending to be my friend when they weren't and I got pretty good at throwing up walls to keep people at bay. 

Fast forward to now, the pandemic means I've been gaming a lot more and I've become pretty close with a few other people online - however I've always been skeptical about calling people ""friends"" due to the past experiences. When I'm playing with them, I feel better and we all have a good time, but the problem is they are in NA (while I'm in UK) so timezones mean for most of my day they're either asleep or busy with their lives. They also all have friends and relationships irl whereas as I mentioned I don't. 

This leaves me in a position where I get jealous of them and their friends when they're not online, even though I hate feeling that way because its in no way their fault, and when nobody is online to talk to I've started to feel lonelier than ever. Its like when I had nobody at all I became numb to it, but now I'm remembering what its like to have friends except I can't see any of them and I know soon they'll likely get too busy to come online and forget about me and thats causing all these emotions to just run wild. Its making me feel lonelier and lonelier, and overthink things, and it sucks... 

Anyone who got through the whole thing, thanks for reading my ramblings! I'd love to hear if anyone has had similar experiences, especially if they managed to make things better."

lonely,More lonely each day,"More lonely each day - Meeting new people during the pandemic has revealed itself very difficult and lonely.
I suffer from general anxiety disorder as well as social anxiety. Back in the beginning of 2020 I moved back to my home country after 7 years away where all of my old friendships had faded away. In October, after a few month of therapy, I made a huge effort to try and meet knew people, and I did. There was this one guy   who seemed genuinely interested in me and things, even though very new, seemed to be going on the right track.
But all crumbled down once this new lockdown began in 2021. The people I met as well as that guy started reaching out less and less, despite my efforts to try and stay in touch via texts.
Needless to say that guy never texted or called back, but on his social media it’s like he’s having the time of his life.
What a waste of time, energy and effort trying to overcome my anxiety when it all went down the drain.
It all feels purposeless and I’m giving up on meeting new people.
Everyday more and more it feels like there’s no  other fate than that of ending up alone."

If I had kept my mouth shut, maybe I’d finally have someone to spend it with this year. - A few weeks ago I said something that made the girl I was hanging out with not want to talk to me anymore. I was gonna tell her that I liked her after we had hung out a few more times. Here’s to another miserable, jealous Valentine’s Day by myself."
lonely,"Am I the only one who often crys infront of a mirror, just to imagine someone was there?","Am I the only one who often crys infront of a mirror, just to imagine someone was there? - I don't like crying infront of others a lot.  
I don't really have any friends. My ""friend group"" dosen't talk much to me and when the subject shifts to personal stuff they quickly laugh it off. We know each other since years, but we kinda have this ""this is fun, but surrfice level"" rule.  
My father is dead, my sister isn't there, my mother would probably do it; but I don't want to annoy her and my brother is part of the friend group.  
Also crying with a family member isn't really specail to me. My family caused me a lot of pain in the past and even tho I love all of them dearly and they're good people now, I would like to talk about them with someone else. And even tho this sadly isn't always the case, family is ""there"" for that stuff (at least that's how it's suppose to be) so having a meaningful talk/cry like this with someone else, is much better.

So what do I do when I feel lonely again? When my days just feel like wasting time, until going to sleep, in the hope that someday something changes that makes me feel less empty?  Well then I cry infront of the mirror.  
I just let it all out, while looking at myself. I try to trick my brain into thinking that someone is with me and gives a shit right now.  
I had a not so nice past with lots of problems and talking about it to myself helps, even tho I don't understand myself at all.  
I don't have any friends. Never had and probably never will. A girl or boyfriend? Yeah, I dream about that a lot when I go to bed. Like almost every night, I think about how nice it would be like some pathetic nerd from a high school 90's movie.   
I'm smart enough to not get my hopes high. I'm happy that I at least have a mother and sister who would listn. And a therapist, who I often lie to these days, but it's still nice to talk to.  
Honestly without him or my little ""friend""group, I probably would just lay in bed and dream about my relationship or cry infront of the mirror and play some videogames from time to time.  
Crying infront of a mirror is great, because it makes you think for a few minutes that you actually aren't alone, only to then realize how sad you truely are. But those few minutes, are all worth it.  
Can anyone relate?"

lonely,People are picky...,"People are picky... - It's always weird when I see someone on YouTube or somewhere who starts crying or just they're sad because something bad happened to them. They tell the story and everyone start to feel sorry because it's a really sad thing...

Okay but... Many people can't or simply don't want to share their problems with everyone. I (and many people here) don't want to look at others while/after let them know what is wrong. And it would be even worse to hear than most stories online but people won't know that because we just don't want everyone know what is going on in our life...

And many people simply can't get sympathy by others for some reason. I don't know why but that's the truth. If you say, you just don't want people know what is wrong, what makes your life that sour, or you let people know, doesn't matter, they will find an excuse why you are the bad.

Most of them feel sorry for only a few person. I don't know how they choose them but this is it.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I never let anyone know if I had problems because it's my own thing. But when someone knew that what is up, they started blaming me for everything. If I had to tell someone, they said I want people to feel bad for me and they ended it up...

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like they don't have feelings for others. It's just when the majority feels sympathy for someone, then everyone wants to join not to be the only one who says no."

lonely,Lonely once again after a girl cut contact with me,"Lonely once again after a girl cut contact with me - In college.

I recently stopped talking to a girl, actually she stopped talking to me, who I have been talking to daily for roughly 7 months. We were not in a committed relationship and possibly seeing others, but we were creeping towards one. I was unsure on whether I wanted a relationship in the first place, so I didn’t have many expectations with her or fears of losing her in the beginning. It was only at the end, when it was too late, that I realized I didn’t want to lose her. She had been the only one I’ve talked to daily for the past few months over just about anything. She was one of the few girls that I would talk to that seemed genuinely interested in our conversations and conversation was so natural with her, which is rare for me.

Things changed during the last 2 months due to some unfortunate events. When spring semester began, I dropped the other girls I was talking with to focus more on school but I wanted to keep talking to her. It didn’t take me long to realize something was off since she was no longer communicating like before, she had gotten short and kinda distant. I knew what this meant, she had found somebody else and was no longer as interested in me. It didn’t take long for her to stop talking to me.

Now for the first time in months I feel that loneliness I’ve only felt during my worst times. I am slightly depressed and can’t stop thinking about what I lost. It’s worse because these feelings caught me off guard, I haven’t felt like this over a girl in years since my first break up in high school, and this isn’t even a break up. I know this empty feeling will pass but I’m struggling to deal with it while it’s here. Talking to family and my few friends doesn’t really feel good as of now, and the few girls I’ve talked to since then have only made me wish it was her still talking to me.

While I do miss her, I think what makes it worse is that I was left all alone. Nothing unusual for me, but it has just been so long since I’ve felt like this. It’s the worst knowing she isn’t even thinking of me right now. She’s moved on quickly, while I’m left feeling lonely. I’m not mad at her since she did nothing wrong, but I am just depressed over the whole thing. 

I miss the feeling of having some one being excited when my name popped up on their notification, and seeing her go from that to no longer interested hurt me more then I thought it would."

we get so fixated on having people that we forget the part where we have to build meaningful connections with them in the first place. it's either they don't really get you, or sometimes they  just don't want to be around you, you're just conveniently there and when who they're really waiting for arrives, you get back to being no one. i get that it takes both people's efforts to get somewhere, but i guess it's being used to having things taken more than you've given; and being scared to strike a conversation first because you always think you're bothering them. even to those you thought you grew close to, but now you see them with their own circle of friends.

i don't know if anyone feels even remotely similar, but i just wish i was never too much into my head and be able to ask stuff that friends usually do. and if you do happen to relate somehow, yes we do exist: you're known, and heard, and felt for. and i love you. :^)

lonely,How music helps me,"How music helps me - Soometomes, I dread the weekends for the fact that I won't get to socialize with friends.

But that bit of loneliness was still in the back of my mind. But then I smiled and remembered I have a record coming in this week. A record full of music. Even if it only has 2 songs, its 2 songs I love. I looked over at my record shelf and went through the albums I have. I didn't play any, since I was focusing on Fallout New Vegas, but it really made me smile. And then I really music is a very reliable friend. It's there whenever you need it. No matter where you are. No matter how you feel. It can make you happy or let you relate to it so you don't feel alone. I can go on for years about the joy and power of music.

This has become a very painful time of year for me. A year ago I had to end a very special friendship, which lasted for half my life to that point. My best and only real friend for roughly 12 years, from middle school, who I spent almost all of that time hopelessly in love with. And while he didn't return my feelings, we were inseparable. We'd hang out just about every week, despite living an hour away. We knew everything about each other, we were practically family. 

And then, about this time 3 years ago, he got prescribed Adderall, and no one can convince me that what follows wasn't entirely caused by the Adderall. 

Suddenly, he no longer wanted to hang out. Like a light switch, we went from being inseparable, seeing each other every week, to him saying ""no"" every single time I asked to hang out. His excuse was he needed to ""figure out his future."" Understandable, he did have a shit job. But it's not like he had his nose in a book every waking hour, researching careers to the point where he couldn't even spare a few hours to hang out. This went on for months. In reality he was busy playing WoW.

For the next year, we saw each other about once every 3 months. Only 4 times in an entire year, and even when we did, he was obviously a different person. I hope I don't offend anyone here with ADHD, but it really felt like my friend had become little more than a speed addict. All he cared about was his Adderall and his WoW server. One of the times he came over, he actually brought his computer and spent almost the entire time working on his server. Because, you know, Adderall.

The final time was 2 years ago, Feb 2019. We had planned on spending 2 nights together at my house. I even took a day off from work for it. What does he do? he leaves after one night because he was ""bored."" (he didn't want to do literally anything) Ok, sure, you go home, I'm totally fine. Don't worry about it. That was the last time I saw him, 2 years ago.

Then what happens that very week, on Valentines day no less, as if that day isn't crappy enough already, I caused an accident on my way home from work. Everyone was fine, though the other guy was dazed from his airbag, but my car was totaled and the other guy had a brand new lease which I probably also totaled. I was pretty miserable that night, more because I felt guilty for inconveniencing the other guy than about my own car. I texted my ""friend"" about it, and asked if he could come over the next weekend. I got the usual ""ehh not really feeling it."" That's when I blew up at him. You can't even be bothered to be there for me when I'm dealing with a fucking car crash? Then it was pretty much ""well now I definitely don't want to come over.""

I keep asking, every week, getting lonelier and lonelier because my only friend keeps rejecting me. I start getting really upset more and more often, and making it known to him. He starts saying my loneliness isn't his responsibility, and gaslights me saying it's all my fault, I'm pushing him away and if I don't stop I'll lose him forever. So fine, I promise I'll stop asking, I'll just wait until he wants to hang out. We keep texting daily, sending memes and talking about our lives, but he never asks about coming over. Not once. 

Even as the months pass, even when he QUITS HIS FUCKING JOB and has infinite free time and no responsibilities, even when I get a new job and give myself 2 weeks off in between, (which normally would have meant road trip to Cedar Point for us) he doesn't once try to hang out. And I promised I wouldn't ask, so I didn't. We just keep texting like nothing's wrong. And of course, even though he's not working or in school, he's still on the Adderall. From my perspective all it seemed to do for him was turn him into a speed-addicted jobless hermit. 

I gave him exactly 1 year from the last time I saw him. 1 year later to the day, in Feb 2020, I said this is it, and sent him a very long text about how we're just pretending at this point, and that pretending is so painful to me that I would rather be totally friendless than keep this up. I was expecting some kind of shocked reply, with any kind of pushback whatsoever. All he said was ""Well, I guess that's fair."" and that was the last I heard from him. 

1 year ago now. Still friendless, lonely as hell, he seems to have dropped off the face of the earth, and while I've come to hate his guts, I curse his name every time I'm reminded of him, I'm still not over him. I'm still in love with him, when I hear a song I know he'd like I want to send it to him, when I find something interesting I want to tell him about it. And I fucking hate him. I have endless memories with him over the years that I want to forget, I want to stop being reminded of him, I want to move on, but even 2 long years since I saw him, and 1 year since we last texted, I'm still not over him, to the point that I know the exact dates I last saw and spoke to him. Deep down I still hope he reaches out, apologizes for everything and begs me to take him back, but I know that'll never happen, and it's for the better. 

Seriously though, how the hell do I get over it?"

lonely,Idk what to do,Idk what to do - I just feel so alone and empty. Everyday I sit alone in my room and cry and hold my stuffed animals as if they could help me. Honestly if I didn't have them its kind of sad but I wouldn't be here. I know it sounds stupid but its sad when you only really have a connection with stuffed animals rather then real people and holding them stops me from doing things to myself. I've been used and broken and every single one who's broken me have given no care in the world for me. They show me there true lying and manipulative self that I was so blind to and they wanna be friends after they leave me for someone else. They will never understand the emotions and pain that I go through. They won't ever have to feel how it is to have your heart literally clench like something is holding it and that deep anguish I feel as I try to hug myself to stop it.

I'm 23 years old, unemployed, studying a career I don't like (Electronics), but I think I did because I did well on the exams (near the ten top students or so). Now, in my last semester, I discovered that everything I learned in Uni is so outdated compared to electronics nowadays. I feel like I have learned nothing and I'm a total failure. While everyone else is getting internships and studying abroad, I just feel like I'm way behind everyone, I don't have the motivation to go on. I used to have a girlfriend from the same career, I helped her through all our time in uni, even depriving myself from doing things that I really wanted to do for her to pass all of her courses. She dumped me in September.  These past 4 months have been horrible, nightmares, waking up crying, crying to songs that remind me of her, crying because of my nonexistent successful future. Everybody thinks that I'm so smart and ready to be someone in life, but I know in my heart that I'm a complete loser, in every aspect of my life."

I am inconsistent with texting but it would be nice to have some people to chat with that mentally stimulate me who i can share music with. I am a positive individual and I love creativity, music, learning, and philosophy. I won’t be able to hold conversation if someone is boring but I’m not to sure if I should tell someone they are being boring or if I should just not say it at all.

lonely,Just this strange coldness,"Just this strange coldness - When he reached the bridge he stopped and sank into thought. He wanted to discover the reason of his strange coldness. That it was due to something within him and not outside himself was clear to him. He frankly acknowledged to himself that it was not the intellectual coldness of which clever people so often boast, not the coldness of a conceited fool, but simply impotence of soul, incapacity for being moved by beauty, premature old age brought on by education, his casual existence, struggling for a livelihood, his homeless life in lodgings. From the bridge he walked slowly, as it were reluctantly, into the wood. Here, where in the dense black darkness glaring patches of moonlight gleamed here and there, where he felt nothing except his thoughts, he longed passionately to regain what he had lost.

It feels near impossible to get girlfriend during these times. It wasn't like I was doing any better before the pandemic struck either. I feel extremely isolated even though I have a couple friends. I love them and appreciate them, but it doesn't feel like I can express how I really feel around them. It doesn't help that one of them is my brother and the other is more his friend than mine. I hardly say anything to them. I don't say anything to anyone. Other than the standard stuff like hi, bye, thanks and answering questions. Even talking to people online is hard. I feel like I doomed myself to a life of crushing social anxiety. How am I supposed to get a girlfriend if I can't even talk to people. My ex girlfriend is the last person I had a real and deep connection with. It's been over 2 years now, but right now I'm missing her a lot for some reason. I wish I could just have a like minded person in my life. Not someone who's exactly like me and agrees with everything I say, but someone who understands what I think and cares about things I care about. I haven't had that in a long time. Right now I just wish I had someone to cry to and be hugged."

To hold hands, cuddle, kiss, and just chat with someone who cares for and loves me as much I do for them. 

And every single day I have to snap back to reality and realize that it's just not something that's realistically going to happen. 

I feel like I should just stop entertaining these thoughts and just embrace being alone, I'd probably be better off that way.

This emptiness I've been feeling has gotten so much worse in the past few months that I just want it to stop, I've found myself doing things I never really would've seriously considered a few months ago.

I've just been looking through posts in this subreddit for a little over a year, and now I'm actually posting in it.

ASMRs and x Listener videos were never even something I liked at all at any point, and now within the last two months I find myself listening to them and even dozing off to them before I go to sleep.

Soo many thoughts , sometimes it feels like I'm drowning in them.

We are all ""unique"" ,
Normalcy is the most overrated concept,
Yet we're all just fucking humans , we all feel the same , different situations same chemical reaction in our brain.

I wonder if I'll ever give up on humanity, 
I wonder if I'll just cut people off and just disappear , 
I wonder if I'll be seen if I didn't know what I know now, 
I wonder if I'll regret life ,
I wonder if I'll ever regret not having taken my life back from around the age of 10-15 ,
I wonder if I matter,
I wonder if I'll just not wake up tomorrow.

Will I ever truly love and feel happy , will I find peace within myself everyday , 
will I ever stop opening up so easily , will I ever stop being naive and believing what people say to me.

I know a lot of you think of me as this brave , confident and strong woman , brave and strong I am but confident is questionable .

lonely,I hate telling the truth,"I hate telling the truth - I'm M27. This girl and I had been friends for more than a year or so but we only hung out once and talked on messenger once in a while, mostly about random stuffs in our lives or works. Last November, I noticed something was different from her, and she clearly showed her un-interest in this friendship anymore despite me trying hard to sooth her down with her pains. She never wanted to share anything about her even when I kept asking to know what were hurting her. She hid everything and acted like the world didn't care about her at all, and it took her forever to reply to my messages. I didn't care much at first because she was probably a bad-texter, but as time went by, it started to bother me as I was doubting our friendship was going to nowhere (I was always the one to talk to maintain this shattering friendship). After cancelling our dinners from time to time without talking much, I guessed she was done for so I decided to give her the distance she needed to be herself and disappeared from her life. It was painful for me to lose such a friend but I couldn't do anything more to heal it, so disappearing sounded best since she didn't care much anyway. Eventually, I got over this pain, and came back to my life, still thinking about how we could have healed this relationship if she tried more on her part...

After 2 months, she texted me back asked if I was mad at her. I knew that if I lied, I would indirectly damage myself more  so I told her the truth without stating it directly, that I didn't hate her back then, but I disliked the situation we were in, it was going nowhere. She got mad and said she wouldn't think that we couldn't hang out together (the last time) that I would unfriend her on Facebook and not being friends anymore. So I calmed her down by saying it was not her fault but her busy life that dragged her away from me, but she just saw the message and never replied back, just like old times.

If you can read these lines (I know you sometimes stalk people but I don't judge you for that :) ), I know truth hurts but it's even more painful if I keep lying and maintaining this friendship. I cared about you as you cared about me so please be open instead of hiding in your shell from time to time. You were a great person when I first knew you, but you had become someone else I didn't even recognize, so cold, so empty, that every single word you said were hurtful, and your neglect were like a sharp knife tearing through my index finger's knuckle at work.

I'm sorry for what happened, but as your ex-good friend, I still wish you the best of luck in your life, and become the hot dreamy girl you are always wanted to be, Th.

lonely,bpd and loneliness,"bpd and loneliness - hi all, hopefully everyone's doing okay.
I'm extremely bad at reaching out, facing reality and talking about my mental illnesses. I hate the weird looks I get, the change in peoples tones and  the judgement. all the advice from ""normal"" people (think positively is definitely the one I hate most) does nothing but piss me off and make me feel even more alone and miserable because literally no one in my life really understands my illness. they're not trying either - it's so easy to google and read about it. that's like the least anyone does for someone they love. yet, my family thinks otherwise and my boyfriend literally refused to do so because a professional will do a much better job at managing my mental health, even though I'm unable to go to therapy at the moment. I'm 22 now, diagnosed with BPD, depression and anxiety when I was 18. when I was 19 I ran away from my home country and moved to the UK. I've had literally 0 human interaction since moving, except at work or when dealing with legal issues. all the friends I had before lost all contact with me and just ignored all my messages. I met my boyfriend at work and shortly after we moved in together. he is the least toxic person I have in my life, but just doesn't care about any of my symptoms and worries in general. I have been feeling extremely suicidal lately but can't tell anyone because it's always the same story. especially not him because hey, it hurts him more than me. (his words. also all this doesn't mean that I expect him to take care of me, but we've been together for more than a year now and he still doesn't know what bpd actually stands for or any of the symptoms???) 
I really tried to put myself out there and have tried to make friends online and at work, but 3 years have passed and I'm still the unlikeable freak.
I'm always antisocial yet I crave and need social interaction. it's horrifying. 
there's more drama to all of this, but, to summarise - sorry for my shitty English and thank you for reading through all of this. could really use a friend."

This happens to me a lot and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. When someone talks to me I am always excited and happy and try to be as polite as I can be but when I try to talk with that person they always never answer or they act like I’m weird. It hurts so much...it’s not fair. This happened to me just today.

lonely,Everything went downhill,"Everything went downhill - My mother passed away when I was 18 years old, right before my senior graduation. I thought my family would be more closer and look out for each other but,

My dad only comes home 2 days per week, my sister has been abusing me for the past couple of months (She abuses me way before when we were younger, she just had more power since my mom is gone)

Every night I make this scenario in my head that one day I will be hanged in my room and they wouldn't probably much care about it. 

It's much worse than it sounds and all I feel is loneliness and anger, I'm so envy at my friends for they have such loving parents, hearing them laughing and having fun while we are talking on discord effing breaks me. I wish to be with my mother soon... 


She died of stage 4 cancer."

But I never received what I deserve. You just you have me and stop putting in effort. I know I am wasting my time. Is this just what I am destined to deserve?

lonely,Just Need to Say This to Someone,"Just Need to Say This to Someone - I feel very alone: immediate family is all gone (died) in the last 90 days of 2020, friends are a 1,000 miles away physically and or emotionally, and about the only social interaction I have is (outside the grocery clerk, my therapist, and talking to the Drs office) in text or on a social media platform. I’ve tried reaching out to cousins but that didn't really pan out. My friends all hate talking on the phone so if I want a response, text. I’d like to say it's the pandemic but it’s not. Life is pretty much like this outside the pandemic, just fewer masks. *shrug* I keep fantasizing about retiring (I can in time but not in finances). I think what is most appealing is moving away from here and becoming a part of a community someplace. My work makes it such that being a part of the community more is difficult. I simply long to be a part of a community but thats not possible at this time."

I’ve never met anyone like me BUT I see memes all the time about resting bitch faces and social anxiety 

I don’t have friends anymore because they never cared enough and i got tired of being the only one making an effort. So I figured, there should be a lot of people who are actually experiencing the same fate as I am right? 

There’s got to be people somewhere in the world who has a resting bitch face and social anxiety who are basically craving for real friendship."

I also recently discovered that many more people than I thought know what touch starvation is. Thankfully it’s not as necessary as food or water or I would’ve faded away half a decade or longer ago lol. 

I’m sorry for this random vent thing, I’d if this is even an acceptable place. Nothing good will come of it, for me at least. Now I’m dreading actually posting this because if it even gets seen, I’ll either get really bad messages in my inbox or I’ll get some alright ones which I’ll feel completely undeserving of xD.

I'm a 26 year old decent looking guy,   yet still an involuntary celibate because the Match group is biased against people like me and that's like the only way to   date now because of covid. I'm probably going to hire an escort in all   honesty, I'm so tired of not having any sex. I'll pay her $300 extra  to act like I'm the best guy she's ever been with, I really need it tbh,  and it's her chosen profession anyway so she'd be doing it to someone   else if not I. I just don't understand why an attractive guy like me in   his 20s is still not getting any, If I can't find an escort I'm  probably just  going to off myself, but that's another story. Any ideas  where I can  find escorts or a professional cuddler that isn't virtual  (defeats the  point). Thanks. I'd love to find a brothel nearby   (Pittsburgh PA area)"

lonely,Making Peace With My Situation (M25),"Making Peace With My Situation (M25) - Not even sure if this is the right place to talk about this, but it's late and I gotta get this off my mind.

Ever since I was little was lonely and forgotten. Half my family, very traditional, looked down on me because my mom was divorced and leaving me little more than a bastard in their eyes while the other half saw me as a burden needing to be watched. All the people I grew up with, including cousins, harassed and physically harmed at every opportunity cause I was the 'weird kid' with the adults only stepping in when I decided to stand-up for myself. Though when I was finally diagnosed with being on the autistic spectrum later on it at least brought context to why I was singled out. Eventually the ostracization got to the point where after several suicide attempts alongside being kicked out my first high school (possibly even more factors that I'm not even aware of) did my family had to move to entire different state to give me some peace of mind. I thought that a new start was willing to help, but only slightly.

While I was finally able to focus on actual schoolwork and trying to get use to not having to look over my shoulder every second out of fear, I went through my whole later high school and college years without a single person bothering to remember I existed. I tried hard with all different kinds of people to make friends with but it always ended up the same where barely even remember my name after a few weeks. Occasionally someone brought up a party or event and, barely, asking why I wasn't there. My answer was always the same.  At some point I stopped trying putting in the effort with not much changing after that. To this day I haven't heard a single word from any of them.

The overwhelming feeling of loneliness has become more harder to deal with recently. I see my parents and grandmother are get older, slower, and in more pain while my sisters are getting more distant as they grow up. I got dogs, yet I know that they get old someday too. I'm just bitterly resigned that I'll be alone in the end. Some nights I wish that I'd just go to sleep and never wake up again. I just don't have the fight or resolve in me to hope for anything better."

lonely,Still lonely. Need a hug. Hard day at work,"Still lonely. Need a hug. Hard day at work - Had a truly long and stressful day. My manager decides it’s a great day for him to vent about his day and I couldn’t take it. He then asked was I mad at him.. Dude idgaf about you! I want to get things done with my team and handle all their petty ass issues, I don’t have time for his issues too. After work, he called and said I’m usually the one to calm him down so he wasn’t used to me not being there for him. Well ummmm who’s there for me? Because I’m currently typing on my phone to vent my feelings. Whatever though."

I do message my mom daily and my dad weekly but that's about it. I am beyond grateful to have my parents in my life but in my books that doesn't really count. They don't fill the gaping hole of loneliness and they're not supposed to.

I feel conflicted because most days I feel like my dog is enough. I don't need anyone else to talk to, I don't want to talk to anyone. But then there are other days when it hits like a ton of bricks. I'm supposed to have friends my own age. Or even one.

And no, it's not covid. I've been this way for years."

lonely,Where do I belong? (20F),"Where do I belong? (20F) - I just want to be apart of something. I’m not a apart of a family, I don’t have a group of friends, I can’t even find anywhere online where I fit in, which used to be my only safe space. 

I’m just feeling so left out, I wish i was apart of a culture, a group, a family. I just wish so desperately to feel loved and comforted by more than 1 person. Im so tired of living a life where I’m not benefiting in any way. Why was i born to be set aside my whole life? Why was i born to be used as a stepping stool? I feel so irrelevant. 

Someone in a discord server came back after taking a month+ break. Was super stoked to be able to talk to them again, but i just cant stop thinking... I was gone for a while too, and when i came back no one even really cared. I’m also in a discord server with my brother and his friends, and they used to talk to me all the time but now i’m getting ignored and only 1 person responds to my message every single time. Why do things end up this way for me? I’ve done nothing but support and love the people who i think are going to be there for me through it all. I just want someone to stick around and want to stay around for me, and not for what I offer. 

I feel like people only ever really liked me because of how kind i was to all of them. How i would break my back for all of them just to get little to nothing in return. I’ve been stuck in this cycle my whole life and I don’t know how to meet genuine people who just want to be my friend, ask me if i’m ok every now and then. I want someone to ask me to hang out with them without me having to beg. I dont know why I’m put into situations where i constantly have to beg to be loved. Even by the people who i thought would always love me no matter what. Why does this keep happening to me?

I dont feel I was made to be here anymore. I dont see a purpose to continue living a life if it only is getting worse every year. I’ve been through so much shit and I always got through all of it. But the loneliness is something I can’t control anymore. I cant sit in my house for another day without speaking to anyone, wishing someone was here with me. Watching families pass by laughing and having a good time, seeing friends post eachother on socials, i dont think i can take anymore. It’s really eating at me and i feel I’m being destroyed. Hell, i was watching a show on Netflix today about cancer patients. The whole time I was thinking “maybe someone will show they love me if I had cancer” How sick is that? I dont want cancer and that’s not even something to fantasize about but here I am, fantasizing about having cancer. 


I dont want people to be friends with me just because they feel bad for me, i dont even want anyone to feel bad for me. I definitely wasn’t trying to come off like i’m the greatest and I should have friends if that’s what you got from this. I guess all I’m asking is, where do I belong in a world that has shown me again and again, that I don’t belong anywhere?"
lonely,I wish I wasn’t lonely anymore...,"I wish I wasn’t lonely anymore... - I wish I knew how it felt to have friends who actually care about me. The “friends” I have now only come around when they need something from me or if they need to vent about something. They don’t care about what I go through. If I was in trouble right now, I would have no one to call. I have a boyfriend and he makes me feel lonely even when he’s around. He’s not loving, sweet, or understanding. I stick around because without him I would have literally no one. I wish I had a few good friends to be around that I could be 100% myself and they would love me and accept me for who I am. I wish I had a bf that looked at me with love in his eyes. I wholeheartedly feel like if I wasn’t here anymore, no one would even notice or even come to my funeral. I wish I had a purpose in this world. Thank you all for listening to me."
lonely,I got an old friend back today,"I got an old friend back today - We just stopped texting each other like 3 years ago and I haven't had any other friend ever since, so I texted him saying if he wanted to do something and he agreed, we ended up talking for one hour and a half that went flying and I don't think I have talked that much in years. I asked him if he wanted to hang out again some time and he said it would be great

Something kinda crazy is that even though I hadn't seen him in more than 3 years, when we were talking I felt like I had been doing it forever, like we never stopped hanging out and those 3 years never actually happened"

lonely,I've given up on finding someone. But not in the way you think.,"I've given up on finding someone. But not in the way you think. - I see a lot of people on this subreddit talk about how no one loves them or is there for them, even though they are good people. I kind of have the opposite problem. I seem to be able to attract people but can't feel anything for them. I've been in several monogamous relationships over the past 10 or so years and none of them have I had a true emotional bond with my partner. I've had great chemistry with some. Attracted to some. Good conversation with some. Shared interests with some. But they all end the same way. I feel cold and empty inside while they pour out their love for me. Eventually, I leave. 

I've talked to friends, family, and several therapists about this. Nobody knows what it is. Some won't even acknowledge that I'm telling the truth. I feel like the protagonist in a horror movie where I'm the only one who can see the monster and everyone else thinks I'm crazy. 

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. So I've stopped trying. I've finally let go of the idea of loving someone. Every pot has a lid, but sometimes you're just a skillet."

It’s been quite a while since the last time I posted on Reddit. Or maybe it really hasn’t and for once in my life I’ve just been really busy. 

Anyways, I wanted to hop on here to talk about the two+ hour long conversation I had with someone on Omegle regarding my psychosis and a whole bunch of other shit. It felt good talking to somehow who genuinely cared and listened judgement free. It felt good to let it all out, having everything I’ve experienced validated, and being able to connect with another human being although online. It’s been a while since I had someone I could confide in irl. It’s been years since I had a friend. 

Life has been very lonely. Today, I’ve spent close to 6 hours on Omegle trying to find someone to talk to as I don’t have anybody to do that with irl. I’ve been putting off this simple HW assignment that takes literally 15 mins to complete for the past 10 hours and I don’t see myself doing it anytime soon.

I had a breakdown yesterday towards my loneliness, bc some of my family members let me live in a living hell!
I had some issues with my mom about going out or anything like that (from middle east) which makes me feel like trapped in her set of mind. 

So, I ended up making friends on social media the problem is I can't tolerate these ppl so I blocked them eventually. 
I don't like knowing anonymous person .. I hate the feeling I hate my attitude, too.

I feel like this is partially my mistake but even though I'm aware that no one is gonna understand my insecurity when that someone leaves me alone.

Maybe my writing isn't articulated .. my mind is messed up sorry :("

People have been asking me if I’m okay when they see me in person, and I thought about it more. I’m tired. They can see it. They can see the pain in my eyes.

But my only 2 friends, they have a lot of other friends and I don’t talk to them. 

Usually (like once or twice a week) they talk about their conversations in other group chats whenever we’re playing Xbox and they also talk about what they did when they went to other people houses (because I know the people but don’t talk to them I don’t get invited). I know going to other people houses isn’t responsible because we’re in the middle of a global pandemic, but I really wish I would get included in those events.

I’m only in 2 group chats, my class group chat, and my 2 friends and I groupchat, I usually spend most of my day playing video games with them or alone. You could say I’m not that alone because I still have them but I really wish I’d have more friends. I’ve tried reconnecting with all my previous friends and only succeeded once but we only talk about homework and school. 

I’ve tried everything to get other friends. I’ve tried online friends, but the people whom I encounter only speak English and I also do, but not very well. Like I said, I’ve tried reconnecting with my previous friends, but none talk to me and one even blocked me (I found out that when I wanted to talk to her and couldn’t) 

Even before the pandemic, all the friends I had were school friends. I only went to a party once and I was super awkward so they didn’t invite me again. I only went to a friend house like 6 times in a year, while they went to their other friend houses regularly, and they also went to parties 

I don’t know what to do, I feel so lonely right now. I know this isn’t what most people would consider lonely since I still have 2 friends, but still, I just wanted to vent

Edit: I haven’t spoken to them for 2 weeks, maybe that’s a reason for why I feel lonely right now"

lonely,24 M US Feeling Alone and In Search of Long-Term Friends,"24 M US Feeling Alone and In Search of Long-Term Friends - Hello all,   

It is genuinely lovely to be reaching out to such wonderful people, I hope I can find someone who would like to be my friend. I am a male, 24. I am from the US. I would so love to make friends from all around the world, but particularly in the US or Canada as I can easily visit with you in the near future.   

I am very much into music, I love folk-rock and other classic rock of the ’60s and ’70s. Also am into straight-up folk, bluegrass, some country, singer-songwriter, and even some 90’s alternative rock. I love bands such as Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, The Eagles, The Beatles, Smashing Pumpkins, The White Stripes, Radiohead, and many more. I collect vinyl, or as I typically refer to them, records. I also collect blu rays and have a somewhat eclectic taste. I like all sorts of films but especially the work of Wes Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Danny Boyle among many others. My favorite film is Lady Bird. I also want to learn guitar and mandolin and get into photography. These interests certainly do not sum me up, I simply just want to get to know people. There is so much hate in the world and in all honesty I just want to share love and hope with some like-minded people that can hopefully stick around as long-term friends. To everyone who is reading, I quite actually need you. I hope we can be friends, I’d truly love to get to know you. I wish you all of the best!   

Please let me know if you would like to chat, I will be replying to everyone. Even if it takes awhile. Thank you for your time."

lonely,How can I ever be honest about my true feelings and thoughts with the people I know?,"How can I ever be honest about my true feelings and thoughts with the people I know? - My life from the start has been a let down and it's only getting worse, I think there's something wrong in my head. Probably because of the porn addiction I got when I was in kindergarten. I sometimes get intrusive perverted thoughts that won't let me focus. I'm only 13 and I've had suicidal thoughts for about 3 years now. The only people who know about my suicidal thoughts is a friend who never cared about me and who I no longer communicate with and my mom who doesn't seem to care and told me to suck it up and that I shouldn't be sad because others have it worse. I've also had thoughts about murder but I won't get too deep into that. At this point the internet has raised me more than my own parents. I only have 3 people who I genuinely like, a friend who moved away and who I barely talk with, an aunt, and an uncle who I'm not related too by blood but by law. Everyone I've mentioned has no idea about any of this and I don't want to put any weight on them by telling them.

How could they ever know that I've recently started cutting, still deeply consider suicide, have no self love, I am also completely talentless, cheat and lie my way through everything, I'm also really dumb like I can't even solve a simple math equation without taking 10 minutes to write it down and solve it or by using a calculator, and the fact that I have perverted thoughts??? They would all treat me and see me completely different and I KNOW they'll distance myself to the point I never hear from them again. They would tell my mom about it, they'll probably tell her so she can send me to a mental hospital or something. My mom would either treat it like no biggie and just yell at me and punish for the rest of my life or totally overreact, send me to a mental hospital forever, treat me like a deranged kid, and she would distance herself almost entirely.

What's the point of even trying? I really wish I never existed, why couldn't my parents go with the condom instead of the pills? It feels like my life is nearing it's end and the feeling won't go away. Life isn't worth it, if I ever somehow end up as an adult. I'm almost 100% percent sure I'll become a hobo addict or something. I would give the world if I could have a painless death right now this moment. I'm sorry"
lonely,This month specifically hurts the most,This month specifically hurts the most - I bet you can already tell why.  I've always wondered what couples feel during this month. Its seems like its the month of love. I've always been alone during February. Valentines day falls on a Sunday which means I can lay low at home at least so I don't see what I wish I could have.

lonely,Misery Merry-go-round,"Misery Merry-go-round - I tried Tinder again today, evidently it's been long enough that I'd forgotten how depressing the experience is, or had just become too desperate to maintain good judgement.

I had forgotten how strong the grip social anxiety has around my throat until I got a match and instantly knew I wouldn't even try to talk to her. Where does it lead? If it goes well I have to call her, which I can't do, and if that goes well I have to date her, which I can't do. How can this still haunt me? I'm a 29 year old man, I walk fearless through rough neighbourhoods at night, I don't care at all whether I live or die, or what kind of physical pain could be inflicted upon me, yet a phone call is what terrifies me. Not death, not injury, simply saying the wrong thing. 

You would think that the misery of a day to day life in which you're part of nothing, create no memories, and experience no joy, would spur one to overcome a fear of talking to a person, but it doesn't. How much pain, how much loneliness do I have to feel to be able to confront such a fear? More than I can bear. 

People tell me I'm kind, attractive and funny, and that I have a beautiful soul, but all I see in the mirror is a failure, an outcast ghost. I hate him more than anyone in the world, I hate him so much I want him to die, but he's too cowardly for that, too."

lonely,"Me, without me!","Me, without me! - I'm a big believer in DIY! I'm dyslexic, and did poorly in school but managed to get into a technical collage. In collage I studied engineering and to this day it is a passion of mine. I love making things and working out how things work. I make furniture as a hobby. Many of the skills I've learned over the years have been self taught. I improved my reading and writing. Taught myself skills like metal working, electronics, computing and too many more to list. I have decorated every home I've lived in myself. I've never called a plumber or carpenter and have even been called on by friends and family to carry out minor repairs and odd jobs for them. Which I enjoy doing immensely. Straight out of collage I might the girl how would be my wife! we where the same age and her circle of friends and mine had a few common connections. We dated for 18 months and were married just after Christmas 2000. The next few years were what anyone would accept. Struggling to find a job, living in my parents house, getting pregnant, having a kid in our late teens! the whole nine yards! But we where happy and very much in love. By the time our eldest was 4 we were living in our first home that was ours, and my wife filled it with love and joy and happiness. and soon we were pregnant again. life was hard! I was working 45 hour weeks at work and always looking for over time or the chance of a promotion. My wife did everything for our kids and kept our home. At one point nearly raising the kids by herself as I was only home from work when the kids were already in bed and up and out before they even got up in the morning. But I thought we were happy. Sadly I had completely missed my wife's slip into post pardon depression, I was so fixated on work and money and job I missed her crying for days at a time, I didn't notice she was spending days just sleeping, not even getting up to change the babies nappy. We started arguing! I'd come home from a 14 hour day at work and pissed off ask her why there where no clean plates and see that the dishes from yesterday where still in the sink! She would get up set and go to bed, and I'd clean up. And I resented her not knowing what she was going through. Looking back, I see how callas and heartless I was. One day, I came home from work to my support system! because at this point that's all we were to each other. She kept house and I brought the money in. I came home and had a go at her for not cleaning up, or something stupid! and she just broke! She couldn't take everything and me being a complete and total dick! so, she kicked me out! And the seconded she said ""get out!"" I knew it was over! 6 months later we where divorced. I called round every Thursday evening after work to help out with the baby and house work and to give her a break and every Saturday I'd call over and we'd have family day. We'd go out together or go on shopping trips together. We'd be a family. She never asked me for a penny but I paid all I could afford as maintenance. I'd help out round the house and loved spending time with our kids, who I love for. I never asked her about her private life as It's none of my business and she never stopped me seeing my kids.

For years it was like this, and again we where happy. But apart. I felt I didn't need anything more, I had a good job now with the promotion I'd hoped for. I was making good money and living with my Dad who is quite elderly. I always said... ""if it's a week day! It's a work day!"" And work was really the only thing I had. My ex made sure I never missed anything to do with our kids, phone calls, picture messages, video calls. I was always in touch with them and them me! Years passed like this, and slowly I stared to notice I was spending less time with our friends, finding them to be annoying and overly complex! I stared to spend more time reading or researching practical skills online. Until, one summers afternoon, while walking home after spending the day with our kids, I was walking behind a young couple walking hand in hand, they looked so in love and so happy. And as they kissed and I walked on I thought to myself... ""Why not me!"" why can't I have passion and tenderness and romance in my life!? And then, I looked at my life!

Every day was a work day! With overtime, and extra shifts! Each shift was 12 hours long minimum! I stared thinking that I'd taken myself out of the race before even crossing the starting line! Being locking into a life I had no idea I was making for myself and realising that changing anything was going to be impossible. Well that just hit me like a dead weight!

Depression followed soon after. As I started saying, I'm big into DIY, self help, ""No one is coming to help us! we need to help ourselves!"" kinda thing! And for a few years now I've tried everything I've been able to get my hands on to help me!

I started drinking! numb everything down until I didn't care about it! I've taken proscription medications like uppers, downers, mood stabilizers, pain killers. Whatever the doctor told me to! I've tried meditation, which does help with the depression and anxiety! Better than drink or drugs did. And I've read a few self help books.

And after all this time, all this looking, I've got it down to this...

My ex and I met when we where young, and horny! looks didn't really play a roll in it, we where into each other and that was that! Everything else was an automatic reaction to the situation we where in. As we got older and matured we got to know ourselves as well as each other and developed our tastes and preferences as older people with more experiences. Kind of growing apart but definitely growing.

After splitting up because both of us wanted different things that the other didn't want, we opted to make it on our own. She, as far as I'm aware, as it's none of my business, has had 2 or 3 relationships snice we slit and has a great circle of friends she enjoys keeping in touch with. I being older am now looking for a woman my age as I am now to have a somewhat lasting relationship with, not something quick and dirty! and I realise that, I'm short, fat and hairy! And when someone doesn't know you as a friend or lover would they tend to look at what you are on the outside while asking themselves... do I want to get to know this person!? Sadly, I am now playing a different game where looks trumps whit every time! I'm sure that anyone using a dating app will always be checking their matches, height, weight, status, general looks. If one or more is a no... the swipe left is the only option.

Since our split, the loneliness has slowly soaked into me like venom in small doses over time, slowly poisoning me from within and warping my mind! I'd love to find someone to hangout with who inspires me and engages me in conversation. Someone who could return the tenderness and romance back to my life. Someone who could be my anti-venom. But before people want to get to know you, they are going to look at you! And frankly most people don't like what they see when looking at me.

I alienated my circle of friends years ago, either by giving all my time to work or because I just couldn't stand how board I was around some of them. I'm 18 months sober and plan to stay that way, So when friends asked me to go out for a drink with them (before Covid) I would turn them down and work an overtime shift! To the point when the friends that would ask... just stopped bothering! Meeting people at work is a no as I'm a manager now and the whole department is under me! And online dating is me spending upwards of £60 a month to be a premium member only to be heartbroken after 90 days and no matches!

If your lonely, start up a conversation with someone you know, even if you only know them a little! If they ask you why your talking to them... tell them your lonely! When your lonely the loneliness robs you of that ""fuck it! let's do it live!"" attitude! It convinces you to take yourself out of the race before you've even run! You need to start treating yourself like a poison victim! Start telling people you've been poisoned with loneliness and the antidote is mixing with people! Be a yes person! Go watch Jim Carrey in Yes man and you'll get the idea! If you don't like the people you start to talk to, don't worry! they know people! Circulate! Meet people to meet people! If people are nasty to you! move on! If your honest about why your there and what your feeling, if their good people they will help you! If they don't! their not good people! move on!

Don't do what I've done!!! Don't wall yourself away convincing yourself that everything you need is already in your house! Because when those four walls start driving you nuts! and they will! you'll realise you've already nailed the door shout from the inside! So don't! You will be anxious!, you will be nervous! Your learning a new thing, like learning to ride a bike! your frightened of falling off! Please! Please! Be more frightened of waking up one cold morning and knowing! in your core! knowing that you will be alone for the foreseeable future! And the reason is because you look the way you do, and exercise and diet won't help and if you hadn't cut off all your friends to work a job that now owns you, you might have bumped into someone at some party or cook out and now be spending time getting to know them because you made them laugh with some dumb joke instead of being alone!

Loneliness is a poison that will rot you from the inside! And the quire is just talking to people! Believe me it is! Even if your a hot mess! even if you THINK! your ugly!

Just try!

Because I tell you what! If I could be me, without being me! Knowing what I know, learning what I have! If I was just a foot taller! I'd be killing it!

And for all you short guys out there! Like I said! Before you take yourself out of the race! I have no people to mix with! I'm done! I got the job the debut and the regret! Even if your short! Make the time to mix! Talk to people! Someone will laugh with you at your jokes! It's a numbers game! The more you play the more you win!

And please, be Kind."

lonely,Help for my brother,"Help for my brother - My brother has had quite a hard childhood. He has suffered with depression for more than 10 years and he is now in his mid twenties. He has living parents who have abandoned him. He is really struggling at university, and the university’s support is shockingly poor. He has lost all remaining joy he had left during this 3rd lockdown (in the UK), after an already terrible year. He is sad all the time and hasn’t felt happy in over a year. I am struggling to support him. He is extremely sad, with suicidal thoughts and spiralling downwards. Positively he had everything to live for, unfortunately the depression and the past stops him from seeing this or being able to function so he can work towards this. Pausing uni is not an option. He feels alone and nothing I say or do is helping him. He has lost nearly all faith in the world and people, and sees only negativity. He’s impacted daily by current problems and affairs, which are constant triggers for him. Even good things in the news trigger him. I know you don’t know him personally but I know that there are good people out there who care. I want him to know that he’s not alone, just because his parents have no care or love for him. If you have a little time to note just a few words of kindness or encouragement for him then I will be very grateful. I will pass these messages onto him, just maybe they will help him find the strength to believe that he isn’t alone, there is still good in the world, and he can and will be well and happy again. Thank you in advance! Please, if you have nothing kind to say, please don’t say anything at all. xx P.S. although we are concerned, he not a danger to himself. But we continue monitor closely."
lonely,My life (19M),"My life (19M) - This post will be about everything I'm dealing with because its worse than ever. No one needs to feel obligated to help or even read it.

My first and only memory of my Dad was when my mother kicked him out for coming home drunk so I've never actually experienced what it is to have a fatherly figure.

My mother has many issues which ill now list
-she has a terrible memory so forgets a lot of things about me.
-she spaces out a lot so I get ignored a lot.
-she can't hide who her favourites are, and spoiler alert, I've never been the first person she thinks about.
-she never thinks about the damage her words can do.

My mother tries her best despite her issues and for that I'm grateful for her, but its still painful.

I have this things where I just self destruct. If something annoys me, no matter how small, I loose it and say the worse things to people.

Because of my self destructive behaviour, I lost the last of my friends 4 years ago, they weren't great people but since then I haven't had the energy to try again with anyone.

A few weeks ago an old friend got in touch with me and we became friends again, it was amazing, but she quickly moved on and I realised she only used me for sexual favours, I hated it all. It was the most painful thing that has happened to me.

But then my mother said something that has taken the place as the number 1 most painful thing I've ever experienced, she told me ""you are turning into your dad"".

She thinks I'm becoming the man who abandoned me, who never cared about anyone, who sold mine and my siblings toys to but alcohol, who never thought about the effect of his actions.

I can't deal with what she said, I can't deal with anything anymore. I don't have the energy to fight back anymore.



If you did read all that, thank you for taking the time, you are all amazing and stronger than you think."

I've sought therapy only for my therapist to leave me because evidently I was too much for her to assist effectiveky. I get that. I'm trying and I don't want to leave my sister without siblings but she has her boyfriend to support her. He's great. This to shall pass. I understand that I may cause people pain but life goes on and they'll get over this. Mortality is devastating but people are resilient. I'm just at the point where it doesn't matter any more. People I've loved I believe will be hurt but they too will move on. We all move on. I'm 38. How much longer do I conduct this life experiment."

Why does everyone treat me like their fucking therapist and I'm expected to solve THEIR issues. Every close tie with someone I have results in them just taking. Its exhausting and I'm done with it.

I only have two friends, but one lives 2 hours away and the other just had a baby, so i don't see them that much anymore. I visit family often (the pandemic isn't that serious at the moment here where i live, so you can visit friends and family, but there must be under 10 people) and that is really nice and all, but i would like to have more friends, irl or even just online. To have nice conversations with. But every time i try to talk to people online, they always turn out to be creeps after a while of talking. 
I just want a group of friends, or just a friend that i feel like i really belong with. 

I feel like i'm missing out on so much. I have never been in a relationship and honestly being in one scares me a little, even tho i would still like to be in one some day. But meeting anyone, especially now with this whole pandemic going on, its hard. I'm not a party girl, so going to a bar is not something i like to do, there is no clubs that i can join at the moment and in school i'm just too awkward to talk to anybody really. I just feels so out of place and weird. 

Even writing this here is making my hands shake a little, that is how nervous and anxious i am sharing this here lol

I have a lot of friends but no one to go to and talk about anything and everything. No one to have a laugh with, a good cry with. No one to hug me super hard for no real reason. 
I had them. I had like 5 people at different stages of my life but everyone left. Every single one of them. 
Im somehow surrounded by people; lifeless soulless people who have got nothing to do with me, is how i feel.

lonely,I just want to know what it's like to have a close group of friends.,"I just want to know what it's like to have a close group of friends. - I want to be invited to things.   


I want someone to think about doing a thing and think hey it would be fun if Agile\_Scar8943 joined us.   


I want someone at work to reach out to me just to get to know me. Or respond when I try to get to know them.   


It would be really cool if one day when I walked into a room people got excited to see me or smiled at my presence like they do with other people. Or even just noticed me in a meaningful way.   


Post covid using video conferencing software and stuff there are times where people will join and everyone gets excited and asks them questions. People only ask me questions out of necessity. Or sometimes people will vent to me. But nobody really seems excited to get to know me.   


I've been trying. I try to be welcoming and inviting. I comment on people's hobbies and ask questions. I try to put myself out there it just doesn't really seem like people want to be my friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never really had friends growing up for a lot of reasons some of which were out of my control. I don't know what a slumber party is like. I only ever remember going to family members birthday parties as a kid. I was usually the kid that teachers would force other kids to socialize with. I got called a spaz pretty much all throughout elementary and middle school. In high school I played sports, joined clubs, and was super involved but I never had a close group of friends or a community.   


As an adult I tend to get unintentionally excluded from things. People will talk about each other's weddings or other people's weddings, mutual co-workers, that they got invited to. People will talk about parties or events. I've even been in a situation where an invite got extended to someone else but not to me.   


I have a partner and they really are my best friend so I am not lonely in that sense. But they are my only friend currently and it's not healthy to depend on them so much for socialization.   


When people post photos of events, trips, or outings it's always with groups of friends and they look so happy. Even when my partner shares photos it's with the close group of friends that they've had since uni.   


I want inside jokes. I want to be the person that someone calls late at night cause they need help and they can depend on me. I want people to be interested in my opinion and perspective. I want people to socialize with me because they want to instead of out of necessity. Everyone just seems to have their people or their tribe and it's just not something I can relate to. Even among my own team there seems to be social events I am never invited to. People will play video games together and then talk about it at work the next day. I know people aren't trying to be rude it just kind of hurts.   


COVID is making it even harder honestly. I've kinda given up on having friends at work cause it just seems like a place that already has like defined friendships and groups. I've been working there a year now and only 1 person as ever reached out to me for something non-work related.   


I know it won't be this way forever and I don't want to pity myself. Just some days it's really hard and I could really use a group of people to lean on and take care of as well. I am also hoping at some point I can move and get a pet which I think would help as well."

I was best friends with this girl since we were 14 (so for around 7 years) but these past 2 years it's been one-sided. She takes FOREVER to reply to my messages and by forever i mean 2-3 weeks! She always uses excuses like ""Oh im so sorry im busy with work and school"" and etc but i refuse to believe anyone can be that busy that it takes 2-3 weeks to reply with a 2 min text.

I used to believe her excuses and she would always tell me about how we should move in together after University and travel together to South Korea. And that we would be sisters for life 🥺

It sucks because she was my last and only friend and i used to buy all her excuses but  I realize it's because she really doesn't value our friendship. If you value someone, you'd make time for them even if you're super busy. Even if that means just a 2 min text every day. It's not a lot to ask for lol I can't believe it took me so long to realize that but I have the emotional intelligence of a peanut 🙃

So yeah I officially blocked her. As well as my annoying cousin who uses me to vent about her life (one-sided as well) and just about everyone else I used to be in contact with 😂

lonely,Lonely in sobriety,"Lonely in sobriety - When  was a kid i started to use drugs i then developed a drug addiction it lasted for almost 5 years I'm sober now but i used to hang out almost daily with friends who are all drug users and now since I'm sober and its corona and here its lockdown i haven't been with a friend in 2 weeks and before that i haven't seen one in 4 almost months reasons why is because when i became sober me and my friends couldn't hang out because they were a bad influence for me i tried it a couple weeks ago but like i expected because i was with him again i started to think about drugs and i slipped and i used drugs again after that i blocked him and said that I'm sorry n that i needed to focus on myself but now i am feeling lonely again..

What should i do? I want real life friends but because of all these corona limitations i can't socialize anymore and the friends i had previously are a bad influence on me i still love them and i am down to give them another chance but i think i need more time to focus on sobriety but i still want friends so right now I'm in a bad situation

lonely,Friends!!! Please!!!,"Friends!!! Please!!! - ***If anyone needs a FRIEND (and friend ONLY), please private message me.***

I'm a 20 year old female living in England. I'm also in a long-term relationship, so I'm not here to find a partner or someone to flirt with. I just really lack friends, and the friends I do have are just not as supportive as I'd like them to be. Plus, they just don't seem to like me as much as I like them. I'm just sick of one-way friendships, and wanting to talk to someone about something and holding back because I either think my friends won't care, or I don't want to bother them because I find myself being too needy. 

For some people it's important to have common interests with their friends, so if that's you then here's a bit about me:

I'm an avid weed smoker who listens to mainly female artists like Amy Winehouse and Joy Crookes. I am, however, an emo at heart from my 'phase' at 14 years old. I love the drama genre in movies, and I used to be a film student so I really appreciate a pretty film. I'm looking into being a family and children social worker but struggling to do so due to the current lockdown. I'm not working currently as I'm being furloughed, so I have plenty of time to chat. 

There's obviously more to say about myself, but if I seem like someone you'd be interested in being friends with from what I've written, *please* private message me. I cannot stress enough how much I need love and support right now, and I can imagine there's a lot of people on here feeling the same."

lonely,"so lonely and empty [19, F]","so lonely and empty [19, F] - I've been struggling with my mental health for around 5 years now and right now it's the worst it's ever been. I just started therapy but I have no hopes of it working, and I'm so scared that as time passes I'm just going to feel worse and worse. I don't even know if it's lockdown or what, but I just really want to die. 

I feel so lonely. My friends say that I can talk to them and when I do they end up saying something so insensitive or just plain unhelpful. E.g., I was feeling so suicidal so I got drunk thinking that it would numb everything but I ended up feeling way worse - someone messaged me for conversation and I mentioned that I was probably going to kill myself and they said 'that's really cool man'. I also stopped being friends with someone who referred to me as her 'best friend'; the friendship was so one-sided it made me exhausted, like she would know I was going through something but she wouldn't even bother to check up on me. It's like the more time I spend on this planet I realise that humans are inherently evil and selfish. 

My own parents don't even care about me. They will hear me sobbing in my room and they don't bat an eyelid, but they hear me talking to someone on the phone and they barge in and demand to know who I'm talking to. Their priorities are insane. I told my mum I wanted to kill myself and she told me to do it.

I just want people to care, but since that's too much to ask for, I want someone to talk to."

All my life, for as far back as i can possibly remember, i {M} have adored women. There has always been a special sense of comfort i’ve felt with women and girls throughout my life. And, even being really young, i’ve wanted to have a wife - a true partner, significant other, romantic relationship. But, while harboring this deep longing of mine, i have only ever been rejected. 25 years (believe me, i’ve heard enough of the, “you’re still young” troupe - i’m sick of hearing it) and i still have no clue, at all, how to get a girl. i can “be myself” all day long with a girl, i can “play the game”, and even try out different approaches, but the result seems to always be the same - after a short while, i’m left ghosted and rejected, replaced by someone better. No matter if i’m to the point with my intentions or trying to slowly develop something. There just seems to be something about me as a person that doesn’t deserve anything. And the paradox here is that it’s to the point where i WANT to be rejected. It’s all that feels “normal” to me. i get off on it because it just fuels and reassures that little voice in my head that tells me i’m worthless. It’s a voice that echoes my father’s abuse and the insults from bullies and teachers from my childhood. But yet, i’m so lonely all the time, constantly craving female affection, BURSTING with repressed desires, but feeling as though a train has left me at the station and it’s what i deserved all along... i was never meant to board that train - to become a man. i crave this rejection on a daily basis but i don’t want to be lonely like this anymore. Deep down, i want to be normal and actually have a healthy relationship with a woman. But, even deeper down, i know no woman will ever want me."
lonely,How independence of women has been demonized in history,"How independence of women has been demonized in history - Did you know witch hunts originated with the fear politically empowered (rich and powerful) men held of their wives and daughters gaining some freedom and power in the economic system? People who seemed to have control over health and happiness of others without abusing material power over them, but instead from some other source, terrified them. It's like if the rules of a game were unfair, so you just changed the rules. The people winning previously wouldn't be very happy about it.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmk47kh7fiE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmk47kh7fiE)

This mindset still lingers in our culture today. Everytime a woman gets into a position of political power, she is accused of having sex to gain the role. Lonely women on these communities are often treated like they can't possibly claim the title ""lonely"" because they're women and have some kind of magical fairy dust powers, I guess? News flash: Getting messages from 200 horny guys with low-self esteem and horrible mental health isn't some kind of party.

If we want these communities to be productive and helpful to lonely people, a serious shift needs to take place in the way we communicate and support one another..."

lonely,"I apologized to a girl, and later she blocked me on Facebook","I apologized to a girl, and later she blocked me on Facebook - I've been thinking a lot about elementary school (I'm currently in high school) and the friends I had, especially this girl who I'll call Ellen for now. I actually have very confronting feelings about her: On one hand I often hated her, because she was kinda mean to me. But, on the other hand... thinking back, I was always a very thin skinned person (I have many memories in which I cry for no reason), and I feel like I was kind of emotionally abusive, even if I didn't want to be (as much as a child can be, of course).

So anyways, I decided to apologize to her, but she didn't answer. I didn't do any concrete bad thing, but I wasn't the best friend. She didn't answer. I'd be lying if I said it didn't made me sad, but it was kinda okay, because I didn't know why she didn't answer. 2 weeks later I decided to befriend her on Facebook and she blocked me within an hour. And I know it's stupid to be sad about this, but I keep wondering; does she hate me, or she just simply doesn't care about me? What if she simply forgot about me? After all, it's been five years since we last saw each other and I barely remembered her name.

I also sometimes checked her Instagram profile (stupid decision, I know), and it feels shitty to know that her life is so good compared to mine. It's actually one of the reasons I hate Instagram: It makes you feel bad. What I wanted to say is that I pictures about her friends, and it made me angry. I always hated seeing other people have fun with their friends, because it always makes me feel bad about my own friends.  It's going to sound very childish but I always compare my friends to other people's friends (Why aren't my friends as cool as Ellen's? Why am I stuck with people I don't generally like).

I honestly think that's the core part of my problem. No matter what I have, I'll always regret having it. And I always end up missing them when they're gone.

On a more positive note, I think getting into Buddhism and relaxing have helped me a lot. I feel like I am less self-centered as I was. So, if you want to be more calm, relaxing is a good way to earn it :)"

lonely,Help me,"Help me - I'm crying on the bathroom floor of a really close friend rn, so help please
I'm 20f and will be admitted to a mental hospital tomorrow. I'm really scared because I suck at finding new friends and talking to strangers because of anxiety.
I'm afraid that the close friend, in who's bathroom I'm crying rn, will start to forget me or will start to not care.
I've visited him almost every second day this January, we watched movies and started getting closer.
We cuddled, kissed, talked cutely and even had sex even tho he never had a girlfriend before so he was a virgin.
He's the type of guy that was never interested in sex or anything like that.
Now we had it maybe 4 times last week.
Last Wednesday he asked me that I think about all of that and I told him that I loved him but he answered that he wasn't sure. He's afraid to be in a relationship with me because of my depression and borderline and it hurt me so much. He said we *could* try it after my stay in the mental hospital if the feelings will last that long.
Now I'm afraid that he'll start to lose interest in me because I've fallen so hard for him. He's so important to me and I really caught feelings and I want to be with him.

Help me
Please
I don't know what to do
I'm suicidal but I can't do that to my dog and my mum"

lonely,Nobody cares about me,"Nobody cares about me - I really hate that I have to turn to anonymous strangers on the internet for a source of consolidation, but I’ve learned that everything becomes worse once you open yourself up to people you know as a man. And it doesn’t help that I have no close friends, and even my family is rather distant from me. Quarantine also doesn’t help me fix my lack of friends. 

I’ve tried so hard, for so long, with so many different people to build friendships, but it never works. Once I get past the basic interest in new people, everything becomes bland and I get seriously anxious and depressed about the relationship, and everyone loses interest, if they ever had any in the first place. Then we grow distant, and just thinking about contacting them makes me sad, I never do it, and when I do, it never goes anywhere. 

Someone once said to me that friendship is like a game of volleyball, you hit a ball over the net, and then you just have to wait for them to hit it back before you can hit it again. I can’t help but feel like, in this analogy, I’m the annoying kid that somebody invited because they felt bad for me, and I’m overeager to participate, and they’re tentative at first, but inevitably get frustrated with me and shut me out. 

I think a big part of the problem is the lack of intimacy I’ve had growing up, has made me seek it desperately from external sources like (nonexistent) friends, so when I see someone or a group of people who seem like they could supplement my deficiency, I try too hard to get close to them and become overly personal. I’ve become more conscious of this, and have stopped doing that, but nothing’s changed from the pattern. 

Every time I get given advice on how to get out of my situation, an exaggerated part of what they recommend is time, to just be there, and eventually you’ll get close. But I never know if I’m doing enough, or the right things. How do I message people? How often? I still don’t know if I’m texting people too often, or not enough to foster a healthy relationship. 

Some of my thoughts: 

“Maybe you should put something on your story, people will see it and maybe comment on it and start a conversation” “No, you’ll just be annoying them, they don’t give a shit what happens in your life, and bothering them with that is only going to make them think you’re annoying”.

“You’re repressing your emotions, you need to talk to someone” “You’ve tried that before, nobody cares, they’ll only think less of you.”

“It doesn’t matter if you’re important to others, you’re the main character of *your* story, not a side character in there’s.” “But I hate being so lonely.”

“This is just your self doubt manifesting, if you continue, things will pay off.” “Then why is every interaction telling me otherwise. You’re wasting your time in toxic relationships.”

“What would you do even if they did like you? You spend so little time thinking or caring about anyone or anything that isn’t actively part of your routine.” “But maybe that’s just because you’re used to not *having* anyone else to think about”

I’m used to being able to identify the things that hold me back and actively work on fixing them, but the only things left are so deeply ingrained in my behavior that I can’t see them. How can you fix what you don’t even know is an issue? Am I just forever cursed to be alone?"

A couple months into the pandemic we just stopped hanging out and communicating at all. Tbh I feel like it would be weird to reach out to any of them. My GF also broke up with me a month or two in cuz she just lost interest, can’t say I blame her, but it still stung a bit.

lonely,Why isn’t My partner enough?,"Why isn’t My partner enough? - Feeling ping of guilt for craving attention from someone else other then my partner

Hey, 
Just found this post and this really started to get to me. So, me and my partner have been together for about 5 months. I have to keep them hiding from my family because my family doesn’t support me dating them even though I believe I’m truly in love with them. It’s not good enough for my family.

I grew lonely suddenly and it made me want attention from someone other then my partner. Like Someone  completely new. My partner tries hard but I still feel lonely and I fell guilty about it because I have no reason too. I’m in a healthy and happy relationship but yet why isn’t it enough?  As I looked for other people even for just friends I feel guilty about it and  gross about myself"
lonely,I’m crumbling,"I’m crumbling - I’m nearly 40 years old. I’ve got 4 kids. 3 divorces. Been a stay at home food for the last 6 years with small part time jobs that made very little. I thought this one was going to last forever but my mental and emotional issues kept causing problems, as well as the way she treated me and her behavior. For the most part we always forgave each other. This time it’s over though. Divorce number three. To be honest the second one was a sham fir something we both needed. Even if some crazy woman is willing to start anything with me, I don’t ever want love again, too much can go wrong, not worth the chance of all that hope again just to be crushed when I’m alone again. I won’t fully commit, completely invest or open up to anyone ever again. But let’s be real and accept that no woman in her right mind wants a guy with the baggage I’m toting. Besides that, if she ever gave me even the slightest chance to be together again, I’d drop any chick in the world regardless of looks, feelings, money or anything else she may have to offer for the only woman that I have ever been in love with. The mother of my children. I’ve loved her since I was 17, that’s more than half my life. I’ve compared every woman I was with to her and told them they didn’t measure up to the one that got away.  I’ll do the same this time around too. We found each other when we were both in need of each other. But that’s all gone now. I don’t want to catch feeling ever again, just roll along and have some fun. Fool around, hit the sheets and get down. To strings, no commitments, nothing long term and zero expectations with the exception of pleasure and satisfaction. Obviously that’s not really an option so I’ll just be lonely and depressed for the rest of my days. It’s actually better this way. No one to try and change me. No one to be accountable or responsible to and for. Never having to explain myself to anyone. I’m my own man I’ll do what the f I want. Honestly I have no desire to sleep around either. I’ll be just fine. 

Damn it, I’m so depressed, broken, probably toxic and just so lonely."

lonely,All of this is my fault,"All of this is my fault - The NSFW in my life is a crucial part of the issue so I cant leave it out.

Ok so this post is basically an explanation on my life and advice and help from people online because I can't be truthful  with anyone I know, so get ready to read a lot.

Quick recap on my past life:

I'm in kindergarten and I find out about this fetish and I get obsessed, gives me a rush and feeling I couldn't explain then. I hide it from my single mom who was in her early 40's. She finds out after at least 3 months later, nothing changes and I continue doing it. I get caught again years later, and I don't even get a slap on the wrist but now know what sex is (because somehow I didn't exactly figure it before). Now I've lost all my friends like 2 years later, I become depressed (at least I think so). I lay in bed and surf YouTube all day. I have this deep emptiness in the pit of my stomach that won't go away and I cry all day whenever mom goes to work and leaves me in the house. I also considered suicide and have tried to plan it out multiple times. Another thing I have considered is straight up murderering my mom because I practically have almost no love for her.

Now the present, I'm 13 and I've been raised by the internet, I think I've gotten rid of my ""depression"" because I no longer cry all day or have that empty pit thing. Though I still have absolutely zero self love, still consider suicide, no talent, nothing to give to this world or anyone, I cheat and lie my way through everything, and I've recently started cutting. I also still spend all my time on YouTube. My entire life I've had this habit of becoming obsessed with something new every month or so. I could get obsessed with either people, my pets, fictional characters, and fictional worlds (games, movies, etc.). I also have some perverted tendencies and thoughts. I honestly wish I never existed, life isn't worth it.

I'm currently obsessed with a family member, not by blood but by law. They live in another state and came over with his wife (who I am related too by blood) for 6 days. I can't explain why but they make me so happy. I've never been close to any of my family but the both of them are different. Though there is something that has been tormenting me, I see them as parental figures. I see a happy life and family in them. But do they see me the same way? Something that he said once really stuck with me ""if you were my daughter, I wouldn't be able to stop hugging you"". Maybe his love is reserved for his biological daughter. I feel so clingy and creepy. I SHOULDN'T BE THINKING THIS, my mom told me I can't be sad because I have food and a roof, she said I was choosing to be sad. Wow really all of this really makes me irritated, I just wanna quit it all. What the hell, why do I have to deal with these feelings. Couldn't I just grow up normal? How could I ever be honest with anyone I know. I seriously wanna disappear from existence. Someone help me, at this point I'm not really that sad I'm just fed up with this bs. She would take the fact that I've lied more seriously than my feelings."
lonely,I envy those who can make lasting friendships.,"I envy those who can make lasting friendships. - I have made many friends but none of them were lifelong. Most only lasted around 2 years and even the close ones rarely lasted more than 5 years. Now friends will come and go I get that but, most people seem to have at least one small group of core friends that has been there since their childhood who they are still close to even now. I've never had this luxury and seeing people who are able to connect to others so easily and find people who genuinely care about them. I can't help but envy them and even feel slightly bitter."

So I walk over to a group of ‘friends’ and say hi, they say hi back and exchange the simple how are you with me before continuing as if I was never there. I stand there for a few moments hoping to be noticed before walking off to a group of strangers, we talk for a few moments and agree to talk again later but that never comes to pass. I decided to go dance hopefully attract the eye of someone but no one even thinks to look my way. So I leave the dance floor and say hello to the people I pass while they say hi back. I decided to sit in that one chair in the corner where I can see everyone else. I’m still a part of this party yet I feel like I’m watching from the outside. When the night ends couples go home, people help clean up and ‘friends’ leave together. When I ask my ‘friends’ if I can join them they smile and say I wouldn’t enjoy what they were gonna do. An excuse I’ve heard dozens of times, they want to keep it small, they have to ask their families yet they invite strangers to come back with them despite their claims of how close we are. So I catch my ride home and smile thanking them for the night but when I enter my room thinking it was a good night...I know it’s a lie. Yet I do it all over because I hope that one day the party will end differently."

It was all just my brain giving itself what it wants and needs unconsciously through a dream. The only way i can get it.

Im a decent looking guy, smart and kind. But i feel like my anxiety is the biggest ball and chain that prevents me from anything and everything. Especially if it involves other people. My mind is a prison i cant escape anymore. My conscious is the only person i have to talk to anymore. I feel like this may be the point some people start going off the deep end... Its hard to stay positive anymore.. Welp. Time to smoke a bowl and stare at the completely unenjoyable tv in utter loneliness for 12 hours till i can hopefully sleep again..

lonely,lonely &amp; have a hard time making friends,"lonely &amp; have a hard time making friends - title. i’m  turning turning 16 soon with only one friend. i’m graduating two years early from homeschool online, but before this pandemic i went to a regular high school. i saw the few friends i did have since middle school slowly stray away. long story short is life kinda sucks right now you know? i’m dealing with really rough depression right now and in the winter it gets worse, but also comes and goes so i never know how i really feel :/ also dealing with depersonalization which comes and goes. 

i’m in the house most of the time but some days i don’t even wanna get out of bed.. nothing is more depressing than waking up and having no agenda or nothing to look forward to other than getting some school work done. i don’t go anywhere but the same routine places/sides of town. feel like life would be way better if i just had more friends. only interacting with your parents gets old, but it’s just that i have it so hard socializing in person. although it’s gotten better, it’s takes some time for me to warm up around people and i have a hard time articulating my thoughts to people i don’t know out of nervousness. i can end up seeming awkward. 

tbh i’ve kind of adapted to it, but feeling like i have nobody stills brings me pain. all i really ever want these days is my license and a car. some days i just want to drive with no destination. i get being whole by yourself but after going extended periods of time with no connections things kinda suck. this post was probably sounded baseless and i’m leaving a lot of things out that i can’t put my finger on. but this is what came out. if anyone wants to be bothered with me or maybe even be friends just dm."

lonely,I'm on a loneliness trip to nowhere.,"I'm on a loneliness trip to nowhere. - So, uh, never been good expressing myself. I'll try my best. 

I'm almost 20, finished highschool and I'm currently employed. Everytime I wake up I stay on my bed for 30 minutes, sometimes longer than that. I hug my pillow, firmly yet gently, I'm not sure why I do this. I force myself to get out of the bed because work is mandatory, without it I will be on a worse situation, I don't like it, I do it just because. I don't have any ideas or entrepreneuring shit in mind, I don't know what to do with my life. I have a poker face, tried showing happiness but it's dull and fake. I never speak to anyone about how I feel, I don't have anyone to. It's a heavy feeling on my chest, it makes me want to cry but I hold it. At certain times it gets worse, it feels like a thunder through my body, it fucking hurts a lot and makes me tear up but I hold it. I have to be strong. It's been a lot of time since I've cried. This feeling gives me a knot on my throat, doesn't let me speak properly. It hurts, but I can't show it. When I'm home I do to Discord and play with people, you know, typical multiplayer games. Funny, I spent months saving money for a gaming PC, finally managed to buy it and I don't know what to play. I have over 20 games I love but never have the will to play. So, I play LoL, Fornite etc with these people. It feels empty, I try to befriend them but it doesn't go anywhere. I put myself in the line, God, the amount of anxiety I've suppressed to be social, to get a friend is... Anyway, haven't worked. Maybe I'm autistic, maybe I'm stupid, maybe I just haven't found ""the right people"", problem is I don't want to hurt them. What if they don't are ""that group?"" Should I leave them? I don't like them, but I don't want them to be sad. I force myself to play with them. Why do I do this? Don't know. 


I want love, you know? Nothing sexual, not necessarily a partner. I just want to feel validated, wanted, loved. That my existence is for something. It's been years since I've hugged someone. Ironically, the last time I felt human affection was there years ago when a doctor pet me on the back wishing me to get better. It felt nice. I almost cry on the room. I yearn that feeling of wholesomeness, heck, every time I see something like that I get a feeling of empathy, makes me tear up. 

Always I ask if I'm a bad person. Not sure why, but I do. Am I evil? Idk, I've done wrong. I've hurt people, myself included. I was terrified of commitment. Please don't put anything on me, I'm not capable on handling situations. I made a friend some years ago. They tried to help me. They were a bad person though. One day they disappeared, never answered my calls. Sobe months after that I see them connected. They ignore me to this day. Hm. Maybe I got that behavior from them. I'm horrible at maintaining any sorts of relationships. My low self-esteem, anxiety and incapability of common sense tends to ruin it. I think I've been getting better though. 

I was walking home one day, finished working, quite a social day at job. It exhausted me. I was crossing the road, it was nighttime. The lights of the cars mesmerized me, they looked pretty. I thought to myself: “Should I jump to them?” as I started waking forward. I walked. Didn't look left, just forward. Don't know why I was lucky. Was I? 

Oh God, I wrote more than I expected, I'm sorry. I should be sleeping, I have to work in 4 hours and I haven't slept. I'm scared, I don't want to go to work, it tires me, people terrify me, I'm feeling anxious. I'm sad. Why do I do this to myself? This will cause me pain tomorrow... I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, i just want to feel all of this work is for something. I want a hug. I'm sorry. I'm pathetic. I'm weak. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I should be strong. I need to be stronger, I'm the only thing I have. I have to look up for myself. God, why am I like this?"
lonely,I feel like I lack confidence for relationships.,"I feel like I lack confidence for relationships. - And I don't mean in approaching someone, I never had a problem with that. But simply put, I can't help but feel like everyone else is better than me, when I am interested in someone and start talking, as soon as things get on a more serious level I just give up, I usually start unconsciously pushing them away or show lack of interest until they move away. I don't know, it just feels selfish, I don't have anything to offer to a relationship, so it's obvious they deserve someone better.

On the other hand I also find myself being extremely jealous, exactly because of that, because I also want them, so what happens is that I start a mental wrestle between those two mindsets which makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and stressed out whenever I start talking to someone new. Under normal circumstances, I avoid talking to people/developing a connection to people in general, but in this case it wasn't me that started the talks, but the person I am talking to right now is a whole 'nother mess because of many different reasons.

I know this sounded extremely convoluted but I got no idea how to explain, I feel just as confused about this situation."

I feel you guys and get it. I hated the mental strain and stress and anxiety/depression it gave. What helped me was to find purpose and that in a bad mind state its difficult as hell. Be that whatever but as long as it gives you a good reason to live. For me, I have no friends had nobody to care for me. I felt completely unnecessary and just obselete. And I found that my purpose was to help someone else since they would understand. Then that made me closer to family and then made me closer to things that were apparent to me. Essentially, I found a purpose that gave me more purpose. I can't say that all of it disappears but it definetly put me in a better place and I wanna help those in the same place.

Tl, dr: Have a great day keep going, it will get better."

lonely,Too Boring..,"Too Boring.. - I just got off a call with a friend and I'm worried I might be ruining things. I'm just so boring, I have virtually nothing going on in my life to talk about (besides some gloomy stuff, I've been in a tough place emotionally lately). She was pretty compassionate about it and I kept saying it's because of lockdown, but I honestly think I might just be overall boring, even without covid restrictions. I'm worried I might lose this friendship because of how bad I am at conversation and telling people about myself. I'm good at listening, but that could be anyone, a much more interesting person could listen and also speak about themselves with a friend.

But, to be honest, I'd still be okay if she left me, even though I really enjoy our friendship. I know I'm bad at socializing, so I don't really expect to excel at keeping friends. I'd miss her, but this has happened before and I've been okay. And I do like my time to myself. It's just sad that I'm possibly putting strain on a relationship from just being too boring, but I guess these things happen."

It still meant something to have her looking for me,  to have someone to say goodnight to. I was completely non judgemental and supportive in every way you could imagine. It's pretty clear she connected with someone in real life and chose to just let me go. I don't mind. I'm not vindictive or cruel and I'm realistic about life. I really would have appreciated a simple goodbye though. A little bit of closure or a note just to say something. Ghosting is cruel. It's heartless. I'm a big boy, I can take it. It still hurts though. When you care about someone and they disappear with no message or comment. It's not right. Don't ever do that to someone. Even if it's uncomfortable, say goodbye. Say something. Humans deserve that. I lost her but I'll find a better one I guess."

I do have social anxiety but I am seeing a therapist, but once again I have to find a way to talk to family since I am on their insurance. And it's very easy for the therapist to refer me out, and if I don't reach out then nobody cares. 

The only factor is I go to a top university so people expect the best, not someone who relates more to beggars or cashiers. 

I have to make some big decisions without any support lol. My future is blank, there is no one to guide it. I don't think it's possible for me to just join a group and have them 'accept' me. That was basically my whole life. 

So I hide from everyone, and almost use any conversation as emotional support, and don't have confidence for anything anymore."

lonely,Neverending loop,"Neverending loop - My entire life has been a loop of trying to be nice and helpful while simultaneously getting shit on in return.

Childhood was watching my dad beat my mom and I while being able to do nothing because he always had a way to cover his ass.

I met the girl I thought was the love of my life in high school, we were married for 13 years... but the entire time she was more concerned about staying with her family (who lived 20 minutes away from the place I got us) while I worked 60 hour weeks to keep a home for us that I just lived in alone. I stayed silent because I loved her more than anything.

Hit young adulthood and get diagnosed with ankylosing Spondylitis and it makes me unable to work like I was and lands me on disability. I start to spiral into depression and any attempts to talk to my wife just turn more into a lecture. This eventually leads to us divorcing.

Spend 2 years being deep depressed and finally had enough of it so I start taking care of myself again, one of said things includes trying to date. Well perfect timing because a pandemic hits just in time. I use online dating specifically because my medicine takes away my immune system so I have to play it extra safe. I meet some people and we chat and I talk to a few who seem extremely promising, actually getting my hopes up that I might be able to love again.

Well too bad for that because their ex messaged them back now or something and I was really just a good emotional support for them when they needed someone. As soon as they're back in the clear I'm ghosted and it was all for nothing.

I want to keep trying, I really do, but after all this I feel more like just going into the woods with a shotgun and never coming back.

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, idk where else to post and I had to just get it out there."

lonely,I literally don't know who i really am anymore.,"I literally don't know who i really am anymore. - So here's me another depressed boy. So until 2019 i was a really happy guy and always felt like I've been succeed in every field and I'm on a right track and all but something happened. 

Since childhood i was a really good student with a very good kind of friends and alot of good dreams. I got really good numbers in high school and got the admission in one of my favourite college. I always felt that I've succeed in every aspect and now I'm just going to study even harder. In college, i made some really really good friends like the kind of Friends which anymore imagine. I had 2 girls and 4 boys(including me) in my group and we were the like most famous ones in our batch and i was really happy with them and my overall life. I didn't want any changes in my life and everything was going as i planned as a 12 year old kid. 

So in 2019, everything changed. My parents had the money problems and there was this stupid thing that my uncle who live in another country said to my parents that don't worry i would sponsor him in my country and I'll pay for him here and all and my parents being the stupidest people convinced me at that time and literally scared me that we can't pay for you and me being the ultimate stupid 18 year old agreed to them even though the money was not that big of a deal. I was going to have a scholarship in my college and i was going to start earning money in like my 3rd or 4th semester but i did the most stupidest thing of my life and i agreed to my parents. 

Now i left the college and i had in my mind that i would go to this other country for studies and it would be really really better but time really passed and that uncle really didn't do much. He was always like a very good person to me and i always believed him but I don't know what happened but he really screwed up my visa applications and that delayed everything. 

So being a good boy of my parents i started my studies in my own city in a really mediocre college with really no person with my type. Literally there's no one my type. Maybe I've made my standards too high or idk its just I'm a bit different now but i just feel really really empty. I have my best friend in my own city and we meet every day but still i feel really lost whenever i get home after meeting. I was this jolly, happy and very extrovert kind of a person and now I'm just a depressed, always angry kind of a person. I've literally zero interest in my studies now. I have no one to talk about these feelings not even my best friend. I've no girlfriend for my any ""physical needs"" although thats not a big concern but still. I really don't know how to get back that 2018 kid with soo many dreams and soo lively and happy guy."

lonely,Vent,"Vent - It's been almost a year since I got broken up with, later I found out I was cheated as well,
I made many attempts to find a partner along the way to recovery, I've tried and given up a dozen times, some of them were fruitful but short-lived.

My need for love, closeness, intimacy isn't constantly 
eating away at me, rather it's comes in moments when I'm watching movies, scrolling through posts on instagram, seeing a couple on the street being sweet, such triggers evoke deep hurt and pain within,
being unable to experience and hold someone dear tight against me.

I tend to suppress, ignore and abstain from such situations and triggers, knowingly feeling empty and 
lonely.

If I could put into words how it is for me, if you ever played the Sims games, there are these bars that need filling up, you have your hunger, energy, hygiene, etc. when I first experienced love the real kind, I developed a bar for love that only a partner could fill up, yes I can and do stuff to turn my attention and feelings away from that bar being empty and affecting my sims, but that only goes so far before it starts overwhelming the character you're playing as, in this situation me."

Recently I've made a pact with myself that if I hit 30 and things haven't changed, I should probably just end it all. Anyone else been thinking that recently? No matter how much I achieve in life it will mean nothing if I'm alone. Even lockdown is no excuse (unfortunately, I've been cursed with living in the UK) as 3 people I know have found relationships since it's started. I get so lonely recently it hurts, I get this sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach and when I see friends and even random people with their partners I just want to cry. I tried getting therapy, it didn't work. I went to like 3 sessions then when I missed one (I couldn't be fucked to get out of bed) he never followed up or asked me how I was doing.

I’m 16 and haven’t had a friend in 6 years. I was homeschooled for most of my life and have no social skills. Having social anxiety doesn’t help either but recently it’s been better. Like how do you talk to people!? I don’t relate to anything anyone says so I just sit there awkwardly. I play volleyball which is something most of the super social people do (ig they’re popular?idfk) but people still don’t talk to me...I should mention that I’ve been playing for 6 years so I’m experienced like them too. I’m quiet but that’s only because I don’t know what to do. I’m so lonely and I can’t even help myself which makes me so frustrated. I struggle with mental health enough as it is and I feel like things just keep getting worse for me. I’ve gotten better but I’m starting to fall apart again. I just don’t want to be alone.

lonely,A day of overthinking,"A day of overthinking - A day of overthinking

Hi. This might be a bit long since I really want to get some stuff off my chest. I’m a 26 year old male and English is not my first language so I’m sorry if i write anything in a way that might not be very understandable. My background is my parents divorced when I was 11. I moved with my dad and my brother and mom stayed together. I’ve finish high school and started working at my dads and his wife company. Been working hard, I’ve moved into my own place by myself but couldn’t help but notice that our relationship was becoming more and more distant as they worked a lot and I could not handle the stress and expectations from them. So when the pandemic hit, I’ve moved back with my mom and brother after 12 years of living in the city where I met most of my friends and had a decent life there. I felt really free after I moved back. I felt like it was the right decision. Now I don’t work for the past 10 months because I worked in tourism so obviously everything is closed. I have been getting support by the government since I am still employed but I am looking for a new job because I find myself just.. being depressed. I played a lot of video games in the past year and I feel like it’s been my escape from the pains of this world, not to say that i’m running from my problems though. And I really want to become a content creator and build a brand around the stuff that I do. But still I feel depressed.. my mom says I’m very triggered lately by a lot of small things. She doesn’t even believe I go out anymore even if I do because I just spend so much time in my room. I barely have the interest to hang out with anyone at all or interest to go out. I literally just spend time in my bed or on my PC and I worry about the future. I can’t vet a job right now, my mom and brother want to sell our house and after that i’ll be left without a roof over my head and have no idea how i’ll be able to pay at least a rent by myself if that happens. I just look at my future and don’t see anything bright in it right now. Now this might be just momentary irrational thinking but I can’t help but play this scenario in my head where I’ve fucked up everything for myself and am left with nothing just because I didn’t want to work with my toxic father and be a“psychological slave” but then again not getting support from my mom. I feel like i’m left alone in this situation and the only way out of here is that I create something for myself so that I can live the life I WANT to and keep my family on a distance. Not to mention that I had lots of partners in my life but I haven’t even had sex for the past year and a half because there’s nobody that I’m meeting right now and it just all feels like i’m a huge massive failure."

lonely,I don’t even feel sad anymore 😆,"I don’t even feel sad anymore 😆 - I’ve tried quite a bit to make online friend becoz irl friends are kinda out of question for me.but most people just leave after a while. Like they just, leave, for whatever reason. This is online but it’s more real than irl.

Oh one would expect that since it’s all online aren’t they in a way always available? Nope, so wrong. They just leave forever. And unlike this small planet where people often bump into each other, it’s permanent. 

I used to feel sad and cry too. But it’s all uselesss. I won’t feel sad anymore, maybe shed a tear or two to help my body calm down but that’s all. 

I always dreamed of having online friends I never met for years and then we meet someday in some city after a decade or two but people seem to have no patience or wish. It seems that leaving is so easy for them. And when that happens, the question of whether it even mattered to them from the beginning hits me so hard that I come back to an even bigger reality than the one I’m living in. 🤷🏻‍♀️🌹🍁🍂🥀

lonely,Back to having nothing.,"Back to having nothing. - Here I am again. Another year another group of friends I’ve alienated and lost. I could sit here and tell myself I’ve out grown them. My therapist tells me this is the natural progression of things, and that things will get better as long as I keep working on myself. But I’m getting so sick and tired of this. I’m almost 30 and the only thing I can be proud of myself is being fit. I don’t have an amazing job, I’m a college dropout, I’m dropping the alcohol and drugs but I want to go back. It seems every time I try to make myself better I just end up losing more and I ask myself, “when will this all be worth it?”. 

I thought this group was the one, the ones that will be there for me no matter how bad I got. I thought they cared about me. But just one slip up and now I’m nothing to them. I feel used and lied to. And I know this is all my fault. The one constant in me losing friends, is me. I’m the problem even when I try to set my boundaries and expectations, I still end up giving my all and losing out in the end."

It’s been a few days since I’ve last eaten, I can barely sleep and this is all because of how lonely I’ve been feeling. I’ve never had a girlfriend before mainly because of my social anxiety but about 5 years ago I decided to force myself out there. I managed to get on a few dates but none of them went well except for my last one. I thought things were going great between us for a few months then when I felt ready to take things to the next level I found out she slept with another guy. Idk if this makes any sense but when I found I instantly had tunnel vision and my ears starting ringing? I know this may sound stupid considering the fact we technically weren’t dating but I just got happy because I thought I finally had someone to be intimate and weird with you know? Fuck me idk what I’m doing wrong here I just want to feel truly happy for once."
lonely,"Love yourself, or you can't love nobody else","Love yourself, or you can't love nobody else - So you often read ""I'm so lonely, nobody loves me, I hate my life and myself"" here.   
And yeah, I can understand that, I think it's pretty normal to do that if you never met anyone who loved you back. Same for me, 26 and single for all of my life. 

But I think we have to talk a little about the concept of ""loving someone"".   
I can only speak for myself (but maybe some of you can relate), but if I'm honest to myself, I never really ""loved"" anyone. It's my loneliness playing tricks on me. I want to be valued and get approval from another person, any person, and my mind tells me: You're in love with this person. But that's not what love means.

Love means that you like the other person for **who they are** and not for how much approval you get from them. If your happiness depends on someone else, you don't want that person, you just want to be wanted and the feeling that you are desirable. And that's because you don't love yourself enough so you need to get the feeling of beeing loved from someone else.

You have to be at peace with yourself first, only then you can love another person. And that's not easy to achieve, because it is hard work to build up a feeling of self-worth that can't easily be shattered by someone elses opinion on you. But if you (and I) manage to get to that point, then you can really fall in love with someone else. 

Also, try to change the point of you: Would you fall in love with someone who doesn't care about his life or interests and who is only happy if someone else tells him that he's worth something? I think I wouldn't. But **I am** this person currently, so I'm not very suprised that no one falls in love with me. 

I would really like to hear some opinions on this. What do you think about it?"

We remained friends, but well, it's not like he is here for me as he was before. I've been opened to meeting many people over the Internet as one of the way to cope with being sad and I did, but it's backfiring as hell now. I usually spend so much time with them and we are having fun, but since they are busy people, who work, study, they can't be here for me 24/7.

And physically I’m like a 2/10. I do not have really anything about me that’s loveable.

My friends say they love me but it feels as though it’s out of obligation. I do not know really how to be a good person. I try so so hard but I don’t know.. I do not feel as if I am loved even through my efforts 

I feel as if there’s a wall between everyone and myself- so I can’t fully connect with anyone.

I also feel gross. everything physical about me has a flaw or is gross. I try to use soap and deodorant but can’t shake feeling like I smell horrible. Maybe that’s from my dad telling me I smell bad though. When I was like 11 he would get mad at me for smelling like sweat but then no one got me deodorant. And I would smell like mildew and wet clothes because we lived in a homeless shelter for years and my parents would leave the laundry in the bathroom which would get wet and then smell awful. Maybe I’m still not over that or something.

I fear everyone will leave me after highschool. I have 2 close friends who I want to stay- but they are closer with each other than they are with me. Both are able to give and receive physical touch and they’re able to be carefree with each other.

Physical touch scares the shit out of me despite how much I crave it (refer back to hating every aspect of my physical self) and I can’t be fun and carefree because my social anxiety.

I don’t know. I feel so lonely- physically and emotionally- that I’m just accepting the fact that this is how it is for me"

I've been drinking nearly every day to cope with those feelings and depression, I feel my anxiety getting worse with lessening contact with people, it's just much more cumbersome to try and keep in touch all virtually with them. And there's no replacing that real interaction. Moving is just really fucking hard, I have the idea of joining a jiu jujitsu gym but with my social anxiety as well as new covid restrictions and all it's so damn tough to push myself to want to do this.

lonely,"Question, Do yall ever feel comfortable in your loneliness, even though you wish you didn't?","Question, Do yall ever feel comfortable in your loneliness, even though you wish you didn't? - I () have one friend, B (), and she is a social butterfly, the type of person that initiates conversations and is proactive in getting what she wants. Once every couple of days she talks to me and just checks In on how I'm doing, I ask her about her mental issues and she asks about mine, its a nice part of my life. Other than her I have zero human contact outside my family, I don't get along with them well. I was content with this through 2020. In 2021, however, B invited me on a holiday with 11 other ppl (most of who I knew from school and were friendly with). For a week I was in a house of 13 ppl that were all kind, and accepting. Socially, I'm more comfortable face to face than online, I think it's because I can see their face and can tell when I'm being weird/awkward or an asshole, whereas online I cannot. 

Being with them made me realise that I wasn't happy with the situation I returned to, I feel I'm missing out on so much, relationships, intimacy, hugs, deep talks and different perspectives; friendship. But at the same time I am returning to old routines at home - sabotaging my happiness for comfort. I've stopped talking to ppl except for B again, and am feeling even more lonely and guilty than before the trip. I'm telling myself that feeling the guilt is good because it means I recognise the problem. I don't think I'm going to be able to change my behaviours though.

Do yall ever feel this kind of regretful comfort in your loneliness?"

Normal women my age are already on their 3rd partner at least, and way more hookups. My friends are always in relationships or always have hookups. When they break up they’re never alone for more than 6 months.

They have been avoiding the topic because they know about my body problems and lack of sexual relationships, but now I feel like I’m just ruining groupcalls and they can’t talk about the things they want to talk about because of me.

I used to avoid parties because of stuff like drinking games, but now i don’t even feel like joining videocalls or groupchats anymore. I am ruining their vibe.

Edit: I know there is nothing wrong with being a virgin. But that doesn’t mean the absolute lack of intimacy and missing out on a part of your life most people already get to experience during high school doesn’t have a big lasting impact on people like me mentally. No, I can’t that pride in the fact that I waited, because I wasn’t “waiting”, I never chose to be like this. Most people want affection in their life. It is human to be intimate. When everyone around you is being intimate and you’re not, you stop feeling human after a while."

lonely,My girlfriend broke up with me and for the first time ever I feel truly alone.,"My girlfriend broke up with me and for the first time ever I feel truly alone. - Its times like these that I'm forced to properly acknowledge the fragility of my mental state. I am so scared for tomorrow because I will be truly alone. I loved my girlfriend, properly and fully but she likely doesnt feel the same way. The breakup hopefully was left open ended intentionally but I've invested little hope into such a notion.

Its just we share a group of friends and because of this I dont have anyone I can vent to our discuss how I feel with. I've been locked into this perpetual cycle of feeling lonely and having no one I can talk to which makes me feel even lonelier. I'm hurting so bad. I havent felt this way since the death of my father 10 years ago. Everything about what I do reminds me of her. We are still on good terms but I dont want her to regret her decision by whining to mutual friends (who, admittedly, are my only friends.)

Recently she's started getting distant and it's made me fear that, in spite of what she said, it was something I did. I feel so betrayed for no reason. Her excuse for ending the relationship was valid and I respect her gs or having the courage to talk to me about it face on. It's just... I invested so much trust into our friendship and then later on our romantic relationship and shes discarded it and seems to be moving on really effectively which, I'm obviously happy about but it also ticks me off. I  am in an immeasurable amount of distress and the fact that she was able to so easily disregard what had happened between us made me question if anything was really there in the first place. I just don't know what to think. Maybe I set myself up to fail by being so understanding it's just... When she told me she wanted to stay friends, I knew I'd be able to handle doing so. Not much changed between us as we shifted into a romantic relationship but now that we've broken up it feels like she's been avoiding me like the plague and I just dont know what to do. I dont want to bring it up to her because right now is a very stressful time for her. But I love her and I find myself in a similar position to Freddy from iCarly. Holding out a small bit of hope for a highly unlikely but not impossible chance that I may get with the girl of my dreams.

Right now the wound is fresh and I am, by all accounts, depressed. I just really want someone to talk to so I dont do anything silly tomorrow. Not so much in the realms of self harm or anything related more in the line of just not acting myself. Loneliness is getting to me and my now realised fear of being abandoned is eating away at what little self confidence I have left. I just really would like a shoulder to lean on. It may be too much to ask and I understand if I dont get a response I just really need to get how I feel off my chest."

It just felt utterly discouraging, and I wonder why I even bother. It makes me feel gross about myself.   
 By next year, I’ll have to decide what university I’d want to go to, but no options at the moment are what I want. I’ve been trying a few personal projects here and there but recently I’ve just felt so discouraged.   
 Where I work there are tons of beautiful people, and it just made me feel pretty shitty that I was single and wouldn’t have a chance with any one of them. It’s been a long time since my last relationship and it’s hard to remember what it’s like.

When i was in Belarussia, before i got medication perscribed for my ADHD, all the time i felt hatred, i felt like i couldnt control a single thing, just because my mind is very bad at focussing. When i came back from Belarussia, i started smoking weed again as regularly as i did all years, and when i was in belarussia i remember thinking ""i'm never stop smoking weed, these idiots here (in Belarus) die average at the age of 60 because their sigarettes littarly cost 2,40 rubels a pack (which is about 70-80 euro cents and about 50 dollar cents), these people are retarted and im gonna be old like dutch people (which dying age is 84) because i will be smoking weed.""

Oh boy, let me tell you how wrong i was because i was thinking about stuff i didnt know actually about..

When i came back home from Belarussia i also started studying medicine and i learned that altho smoking 7 joints a day is definetly better than smoking 5 sigarettes, it still will harm your lounghs at some point if you're planning about to make smoking joints everyday an ""lifetime thing"". (but indeed, if you smoke less than 1 joint a day on average the substance will not hurt you.)And now the day im going on ADHD medicine again is near, i realised; altho a substance is not physicly addictive, it doesnt only not mean you still can die from it, when you're actually feeling addicted to the substance the biggest chances are that you just need a substance that is easier for your body to substain on long term, or maybe there is a chance that you are trying to ""escape"" from reality because you dont like yours.

This is me saying goodbye to r/lonely and at the same time me slowly saying goodbye to being a ""fulltime stoner"", but attending you that maybe you're not looking for love and that you should maybe first be happy with who you are before you can be happy with how somebody else is (and i know you've heard this before, but nobody ever even suggested you HOW and this is why i'm writing this to you right now) and maybe, just try it, go to a psychiatrist, because going to a doctor doesnt make you sick, so going to a psychiatrist will not make you insane, because i know you're not, insane people cant type, they're too busy counting the ghosts in the mental hospitals, you're not one of them and you never will, because you will do anything now to prevent that later. You just need a doctor with an extra degree and that is completely fine ;)

This isn't me promoting my asexuality, nor me promoting aderall or other concentrational substances. And for the people in countries where mental care isnt just ""not accepted"" but where its only for ""crazy"" and ""rich"" people, you can send me a message, i don't know everything but i would love to be your ""first psychiatrist"", or maybe even, your first real friend :)"
lonely,I’m tired of being told to “be myself.”,I’m tired of being told to “be myself.” - I’ve been myself my whole life.  No one wants to hire me.  No one wants to date me.  Be yourself is advice from people who have never been alone.
lonely,Touch deprivation. And other things associated with loneliness.,Touch deprivation. And other things associated with loneliness. - “You have to learn to love yourself” has to be one of the biggest pushover invalidating responses you can tell someone. I can handle being alone for long periods of time and even enjoy my own company. But when it goes on for years things start to get to you. Even to the point where you start to have multiple sexual dreams with strangers. Or even dreams about other intimate things like cuddling or kissing. Trying to take advice about being alone by people who have never really been alone is like a punch in the gut. Many people are ignorant and it sucks.

It’s hard for me to open up about my private life (my family issues and my love life). Because I did it before with my only best friend and my boyfriend back then and both of them betrayed me. So how can I open up to someone new that probably genuinely cares about me? What if they did the same? So bottle up and deal it with myself is the safest option I have. I wish i have only one person that i can trust and tell them everything, not to solve it, but just listen and tell me everything will be alright and not going to leave me or mocking me or seeing me differently. I don’t want to disappoint anyone. Sorry"

lonely,About 2 years now since I had a true friend..,About 2 years now since I had a true friend.. - 2 years. Since then I have not connected on a real level with anyone. I have forgotten any social skills I once had and fuck its uncomfortable.. I guess it can't be helped and for the most part I've been able to not to ponder on self destructive thoughts to the extent I would in the past. But fuck if only I could be myself more often. Express myself confidently without anxiety.. I alienate myself  from society to often now days because it allows me the excuse of it all being my own doing. But the truth no one attempts to pursue a friendship with me and i'm too anxious and dissociated to try with them.. I wonder if I will ever connect with anyone again or am I doomed for some solitary life.

It’s been hard to get to where I am as a socially awkward extrovert, but here I am. Now these 6 months of living in a town where I know NOBODY AT ALL is very frustrating &amp; has brought back some of the thoughts &amp; feelings I had a couple years ago regarding suicide. Except I don’t want to let myself get to that point again. 

I’ve decided I’m going to force myself to socialize with people. Baby steps of course, whether it’s complementing a stranger, or starting small talk in a fucking market. Point is I don’t see myself surviving another 6 months in isolation in the mental prison I fought so hard to once escape. 

These little things like saying an extra sentence to the barista or complimenting a strangers hair might be enough for me to live as I need verbal, in person communication. 
I talk to some friends from back home still &amp; some online friends, although that’s been helpful I’ve been starting to struggle again as I realized how much I miss people in person. 

Although I see my near future is great &amp; extremely promising, it’s hard to see myself get to it when I’m this deep, deep, lows. 
So these baby steps &amp; dumb missions I’m putting for myself might be one of the only things keeping me going 
Well tomorrow I’ll start. Wish me luck."

And I still see them at work and they invite me to hangout every once in awhile. I think it’s out of pity tbh. My depression has returned full swing and I do nothing but think of how useless I am even during work and class now. I have no real qualities or any useful parts to me anymore. And I just hate being alone when I’m surrounded by people all the time. Oh jeez I’m so sorry for the rant. It makes me feel pathetic, but everyone needs to rant every once in awhile right?

lonely,Mad at myself,"Mad at myself - I have a crush on a guy at work who only wants to be FWB. My pride and self-respect are telling me to cut things off with him, but he is one of my only friends and I like the attention since I don't get much from anyone else. 

The last time we saw each other (last Friday) he said he may or may not come in on Monday (today). 

Well, today I was feeling excited about potentially seeing him. I wanted to tell him that I started watching a show over the weekend that he recommended (""The Boys,"" SO FREAKIN' AMAZING!!), and I wanted to surprise him with some bubble tea because he said he wanted to try some last week. 

I messaged him excitedly asking him if he was indeed coming into work, but he never replied. It's been 12 hours and I am super disappointed. 

I am disappointed with him, of course, because I believe him to be a good friend of mine. 

However, I am mostly disappointed with myself. 
I am putting in so much effort to keep this friendship going with a guy who isn't shy about telling me he wants to use me for sex. (We've never had sex, I keep saying no and we don't see each other outside of work.)
When he asked for my number a few weeks ago I allowed myself to get super excited that I might FINALLY get a BOYFRIEND... but he told me that he doesn't want the ""responsibility"" that comes with a relationship and that he thinks it'd be great if ""we use each other before we find other people"" who are better for each of us. 

Also: He doesn't really remember things I tell him or even things he's told me. When I refer back to previous conversations we've had he has trouble remembering and it always pisses me off. 

Also: He only contacts me when he wants to know if I am coming into work or not. And he wants me to message him on my off days when he is at work, but when I am at work and he is off (like today) HE DOESN'T MESSAGE BACK. 

Also: He doesn't want me to talk to his brother. Sometimes his brother fills in for him (they are both security guards) and I wanted to introduce myself to him. But he said he doesn't want the other guards on his team (including his brother) to know that he is the way he is with me (silly and flirty and I playfully pretend to beat him ip sometimes) because he has to ""maintain a certain tough image."" 
... I think he is just ashamed of me...

I am so mad at myself for allowing myself to be treated this way!! I know he isn't really interested in me and that I am convenient for him and that I boost his ego by flirting with him at work. Even though I know all these things I wanted to keep him in my life, so I asked if we could just be friends. At first he agreed, but he always finds a way to bring sex into the conversation and then tries to convince me to see his point of view. 

I really need to find a better job and make new friends (I don't really have close friends). 
I crave attention and affection so much that I am subjecting myself to being treated so badly."
lonely,I just want to be a main character,"I just want to be a main character - I don’t mean this in the trendy tiktok way. I feel like I play such and insignificant role in everyone’s lives.

lonely,Why do I get used?,"Why do I get used? - I am a guy and I got used numerous times for nudes and emotional support but no one wants to look at me like a person to love. I hope I could have a woman to understand me more but all of them whom I met either don't find me attractive (which is completely normal, it's not their fault) and even if they do, they either get me into sending explicit pictures of myself which I actually do considering my hormones are always sort of raging or they start to seek emotional support from me and then make me the villain when I give them advice. Why is it like this? Why can I not be seen as a person to be loved? Why am I always an emotional trashcan? I am waiting for the day when I meet a girl who sees me as a person than an emotional trashcan. I am tired of this. I am tired of being treated this way."
lonely,"I feel like I bother everyone around me, even my family","I feel like I bother everyone around me, even my family - Its late, but I can never sleep nowadays. I'm 20 turning 21 in May, and for the last 5 years of my life, I've felt like a complete screw up. I lost all of my friends from high school, my siblings and parents barely talk to me and I feel like my dog is the only one I feel comfortable opening up to, since I've never really spent a day apart from him. I've had my fair share for friends that ask me for advice or help, I do it, then never even talk to me again. High school was bad, and college is honesty worse to me. Part of me really hates all of this because I feel like its something I can fix, but at the same time, my mind makes me think on one would want someone like me in their lives. I honestly think the world wouldn't miss me if I were to disappear. I'm not suicidal, but that question weighs on me a lot, especially now. I just wish I could have a fresh start sometimes, be able to have someone I can talk to and be able to help each other out."

lonely,I'm trying but it's just so hard,"I'm trying but it's just so hard - I've been depressed my entire life and have been in an episode for the past 3 years. I've been seeing therapists, but this covid is really pushing it. 
For the past 8 years I've been living in Asia, but got bullied at work and that really made me feel like it was time to leave. I came back to the US (also partly for my long distance boyfriend) and moved to the east coast where I knew nobody. I took a shitty job because I thought it's better than staying in my toxic environment and my optimistic side thought I'll figure it out and find a community and new job soon, and by the least I can move on from a painful environment. But 2 months in, covid hit. 
Now I'm lonely af, have no friends in this stupid new city that I hate, and stuck in a shitty job. It sucks that my boyfriend is probably tired of how depressed I am, and honestly he's making the situation worse. Im sleeping on the sofa tonight cuz I just need to play some tv show in the background to get away from my thoughts (as he triggers me and then snores away). 
I fucking hate my life, and myself.  I wish I can just wake up a different person and have a different life... if I ever even get to sleep tonight :(

I look down and see blood soaking into my shirt from the cuts. And there is no one for me to talk to. It’s been over two year since I have been n invited to anything I just want someone to care about me. I work two jobs now 65-70 hours a week because I can’t make the same I was before COVID because my restaurant was shut down. There is no one, I will always be alone. The truth is not everyone gets to be happy in life...... and I don’t get to be happy."

There’s no passion no matter what I try. I’d love some interesting conversations with a woman. Tell about your hopes and dreams, what is exciting to you, what really interests you."
lonely,Getting replaced as soon as you help a person out with their problems,"Getting replaced as soon as you help a person out with their problems - I have talked to this girl for a long time, eventually we both got feelings for eachother. All that ruined the pandemic and the lockdowns since I couldnt meet her anymore.

Now she has a new dude to talk to and I have become a third wheeler. This made me realise one thing. I like to help people, I care about them, I try to make them happy. Lets say for example another person has a low self esteem, I help them raise it. And when I helped them, they suddenly just forget about me and replace me with someone. 

I have seen this before many times. I help people out with their problems, and when they got through with it, they actually start to distance from me and eventually replace me. 

I just dont know what to do. Its been going on for years now. It made me change my view point of humans, to the point that I dont trust them, not one, because I know that a new person, who will come into my life, will also disappear without staying for at least a year or more.

And when people ask about me why I dont trust any human being, they get surprised, and even my explanations makes them think that I'm very strange to them. 

Now any new relationship, doesnt matter if its a friendly or a romantic, gets really hammered by me because I dont trust that person fully and therefore I lose potential to make a meaningful friendship and then the cycle keeps on continuing. 

I just feel sad and lonely that it keeps on happening"
lonely,Nights are the hardest,"Nights are the hardest - When I'm all alone and need to distract myself and make the time go by. When I'm not in as much pain, it's a bit easier. Maybe I'm a bit more optimistic about the future... but when things are fresh, they fucking suck. Some things still stick with me to this day. I spend the moments that I have alone refreshing new on subreddits and reading posts, listening to music, and playing games. This combination of things helps keep my brain busy the most. I keep the hope alive in my heart that one day things will change and I'll meet more people who don't make me feel alone and make me look forward to each day. Someone nice to spend the nights with. I know there are people out there that feel the exact same way as me, somewhere. We need each other right now but we just haven't met. Maybe we never will. Life is cruel like that... but it's okay. I'm doing my best, and maybe things will start to look up for me. It's all I can hope for, because without holding onto that hope and optimism, my life will only be sad. I want more, I want to be happy. Hopefully I don't have to wait much longer, because damn I'm having a hard time. 23 is my lucky number, and since I'm 23 now, I've been telling myself maybe this year good things will happen. Not yet, just the same shit. BUT the year isn't over, so I can hold onto my lame superstition for a little while longer."
lonely,The void in my chest has been there for so long,"The void in my chest has been there for so long - First off I want to say, I’m not suicidal. I love life way too much for that, but sometimes it catches up. As the title states, I’ve had this seemingly ethereal or Metaphysical void in my chest that just won’t seem to go away. I feel it the most at night trying to fall asleep, like I am now. I’m pretty sure it stems from the yearning for a relationship, but even then I’m not sure. I help my friends with their terrible relationships just to go back and think, “I wish I had those problems”. Sometimes the void becomes so overwhelming it’s the only thing I can focus on, I wish I had someone to fill it."
lonely,It doesn’t seem to end,"It doesn’t seem to end - Since November, I seem to keep losing people in my life. First, a friend of 7 years ended our friendship, then 5 friends moved at the same time out of state, then my gf broke up with me, and my family seems to barely acknowledge my existence. It friggin hurts and all i get is “it will get better” well I’ve waited for almost 3 months, and it hasn’t."
lonely,I’m missing you so much today,"I’m missing you so much today - It makes me want to cry how much I miss you today. And not just you but everyone I’ve ever loved. You just happen to be the last one to have hurt me and remind me why I don’t get close to others. In six days it’ll be 2 months since we’ve talked. 

I wonder if you still think of me and miss me as much as I miss you. Do you have nights like this? Where you yearn for my touch, listen to songs that remind you of me? Do you obsess over everything and count down the days until we can officially talk again? Do you worry I’ll say no?

Or do you really not care and yet again I’m the one putting in all the work?

All I know for sure is that tonight I miss you. I want to be in your arms. I want to feel your lips on mine. Instead I’ll mark another day off the calendar. 57 days left. I can’t tell if that’s too long or short. Now I’ll lay back with music on and try to pretend I don’t care about you let alone love you. 

Because I really don’t know if you do anymore and I’m so scared of being played again. I’m so scared all of this anxiety and depression are meaningless and once we finally do regain contact it’ll only be for you to break me again."
lonely,I’ll be lonely forever,"I’ll be lonely forever - I’ve felt alone for most of my life. When I first came to America I was happy, I had many friends, for all of middle school I was genuinely happy. Then it started, the loneliness. In high school I was always left out. I would always talk to people, want to do things with them, hang out with them, but no one ever felt that way about me. If I didn’t come to school, no one would notice, no one would ask me where I was, what happened, nothing. All the people that I thought were my friends all are gone, one after another. I’ve always dreamed of having just one friend that you can count on any second of your life. I guess watching anime my entire life gave me false hope. I will never ever get that one friend I dreamed of. I will always be lonely. People say they care, but they care one day, and forget the next. I’m a failure to all the people around me, a failure to my parents, my brother, and a failure to my partner. I grew so much with the loneliness that I like it more than people. I like crying to sleep 4-5 times a week. I like feeling the pain of being lonely. For anyone worried, don’t worry I’m not going to end my life, I still have hope! I made a promise to myself long ago, if by 30 I’m not happy, then that’s the end of my story, I’m 19 now. No one can see how I feel, no one cares how I feel. I’m like a staircase in a skyscraper, forgotten. Everyone uses the elevators, no one thinks about the stairs. I have been feeling this way for 6 years now, nothing will change this feeling. I thought I was the main character, turns out I’m not even in the cast. My heart feels empty, there is nothing inside, just emptiness, just loneliness. I don’t drink, I don’t do drugs, I don’t play video games, I don’t act like other guys my age. I’m nothing, a waste of breath, and corpse waiting for it’s burial, waiting until someone digs my grave."
lonely,Scared of being lonely,"Scared of being lonely - I was so lonely from ages 6-12 and even though I was a kid and I thought I was over it, I’ve realized recently how deeply it is affecting me as an adult. Some backstory: when I was a kid, I was last to be picked for teams. I hated recess on the days the library was closed because I was scared because I had no one to hang out with. I was the only kid in class not given a present for someone else’s birthday party in first grade, and then I was the only one in class not invited to a girls birthday party in 6th. When I thought I found a friend group in third grade, I was again the only one not invited to one girls birthday party. The friends I managed to make would always move away quickly. Always. When I made another friend in sixth grade she called me boring and left. Someone else who I’d known my whole life decided to bully me pretty badly bc she was sick of knowing me so long or smtg. When I tried to hang out w her she’d always say she wanted to spend time w other friends (we have known each other our whole lives and a year afterwards that year in which she bullied she apologized like truly apologized and has made up for it since). But she was also the one who would send me away in 4th grade to have “secret conversations” with her best friend. When our mothers had a party for the kids both of them begged me not to come so they could spend time alone. I went home in tears that day but didn’t want to impose my company so when her mother came to my house to pick me up I said I didn’t want to go but she kept pressing and asking why until I started crying bc I was so damn lonely and hurt. 

Ok little happier part of this story: Currently, I have friends, and they are incredible. I have friends at home, at college, at work, etc. but when I was younger, I didn’t. I have deep conversations, people who are there for me, a best friend who is truly the best friend of best friends. The best friend id want in every lifetime. 

And yet, my childhood haunts me. I’m SO eternally grateful for what I have. The gratitude I feel for having people after feeling alone for so long is so so so intense, but “no amount of friends at 25 (I’m 19) can replace the empty lunch tables of my past” (Taylor Swift haha). Meaning... I don’t feel secure. I still feel like things could break and I’ll be left alone again. I try to just enjoy the moment and I succeed most of the time and then there are times like this where I’m alone and wondering about all the ways things could break and being so fearful about it all. I want to just be okay being alone and stop caring and worrying so much. In college I felt lonely (before pandemic) bc I felt like I was the last choice, I always do. I feel invisible. You know what I feel ? I feel like despite all the current joys in my life, loneliness is always around the corner, and when my mind wanders, it is dreading loneliness. I do live in the moment when I’m with my friends but when they’re gone, the dreadful feeling of loneliness being around the corner scares the crap out of me when it’s just me and my thoughts bc I can’t go back to that. I can’t I can’t I can’t. Just needed to get this out somewhere. Thanks."

Kinda scared to &amp; I don’t want to be hurt ever again. Nobody really checks up on me to see how I’m doing. The only friends I do have are busy getting married, having kids &amp; creating their own families. Blossoming their own lives. I can’t be mad at them but I can’t help but feel like nobody really cares about me. I’m completely forgotten... by my cousins... by my friends... peers, acquaintances &amp; by my entire family. I guess I’m a black sheep. 

I haven’t had a gf since a really bad breakup back in November 2017. During thanksgiving week to be precise. I found out she was cheating on me for a few months &amp; just broke it off with me one random day. I got confirmation when i got nosy &amp; went on her fb page &amp; saw a picture of her kissing another man. I’m still hurting somewhat to this day. It left a pretty deep scar mentally, clearly emotionally as well. We were supposed to get married. Sometimes idk if I can date again after that but I guess it is what it is. Ever since then, I’ve been having trouble making friends &amp; establishing new connections because I can’t help but feel like nobody likes me, I’m too different or I’m just too plain weird in comparison to my peers. I have 2 shitty retail jobs cause I have a ton of bills to take care of so my jobs are the only place I seem to have a form of social life. I don’t really have friends at work, just acquaintances &amp; coworkers. Maybe a boss &amp; a store manager who just barely tolerate me at 1 job &amp; another job where nobody ever really talks to me. Everybody usually chills amongst their own crowds &amp; I usually find myself in the same spot I used to find myself in elementary school, alone. Sometimes, I just like being a basic human &amp; look forward to having a small talk w/ somebody even if there isn’t anything of substance in the conversation. I find myself usually having moments where a quickly shed a tear or 2 out of instantaneous negative thoughts or feelings about myself or my life or bad flashbacks or etc etc etc. sometimes I get overwhelmed by a sudden feeling of sadness &amp; it usually happens at work so I kinda have to be quick about it &amp; wipe my tears fast enough to be able to speak to customers w/o giving myself away. I used to get bullied as a kid, I used to get picked on a lot.... I’ve been in gangs &amp; I’ve almost gotten stabbed by 3 different blades by 3 different ppl during a run-in w/ MS-13 gang members where I used to hang around. Maybe some of these bad memories run deeper than I thought. Streaming has helped somewhat but where I’m renting has the worst internet connection known to man. During a time like this where everybody is stuck indoors during the pandemic. I just want to remind ppl that a lot of ppl are fighting feelings of worthlessness &amp; loneliness but a certain demographic is getting the worst of it &amp; those are single folks, like myself. I’m so used to waking up alone, going thru live alone &amp; going to bed alone. It sucks but I guess I’m used to the cold embrace of loneliness. 

Just pls remember to be nice to others to pls be mindful during these times cause not everybody may have all the immediate &amp; physical/emotional/mental support systems others have. Most of us just go through life &amp; cry by ourselves. 

I’m sorry for this being so long."

I don’t text anyone, I don’t talk to anyone at the gym. I’m starting to feel burdened whenever I have to talk to people... not a good sign.

Sure I have some friends around me I can chill with and talk to every once in a while, but I don’t think they’re real friends. I really miss having that close relationship with someone. God I love my friends back home so much we might as well be married. Can’t seem to recreate that here. Really miss having a deep connection with someone. Having someone you trust 100% and feel comfortable around and just dropping your walls around, nothing can top that. :("
lonely,i feel so lonely when it comes to my interests,"i feel so lonely when it comes to my interests - it feels like nobody likes the same things i do. ok like yes of course i have common interests with my friends, but the things that i REALLY like, my all time favorite things... none of my friends like them. they wont even give them a chance, no matter how many times ill either hint at the fact that i want them to check it out, or explicitly tell them ""hey i think you should check this out, i wanna talk about it with someone and you'd probably like it too!""

ive always felt so alone about my interests. its so isolating to have nobody to really talk to about the things i love. its so isolating to basically talk to myself about the things i have a real interest in. yeah, my friends will let me talk about the things i like, its not like theyre explicitly mean about it or tell me to shut up, but its still lonely you know? i cant have a real conversation about things, i cant go in depth or anything, and they cant say anything back other than ""yeah that sounds neat"", if they even respond at all.

the worst is when they promise theyll get around to watching or reading whatever it is i like, and then never do. and when i talk about wanting to have someone to talk to about whatever thing, theyll go ""yeah hopefully you find someone to do that with sometime soon"". its like a slap in the face, almost. it stings.

i also cant help but feel resentment towards my current friends for not making an effort to check out the things i love, which is unreasonable i know, but i do it for them all the time. if one of them talks on and on about a show they love, and tell me that id probably love it too, i almost always watch it for them (and do end up liking it). why cant they do that for me? its just super lonely all the time. and yeah i know i could always try to make friends online, but making friends has always been a huge struggle for me, either online or offline. plus i cant help but feel its not unreasonable for me to want my current friends to take interest in things that i care about, just as i do for them. 

i know its not fair to expect everyone to like exactly what i like, but after so many years of never really having anybody to share my biggest interests with, i cant help but feel so frustrated, upset, and even angry sometimes."

When I was a child, I suddenly stopped receiving hugs. I was only ever hugged by a few family members. Then they just stopped randomly. I never was hugged by any friends (as I never really had any) or a girlfriend since I've been single my whole life. I've never put myself out there because of my social anxiety. And I never brought this up to anyone I know just because I got nobody. And when I'm stressed, I feel physical pain that I can't get any help. And I always thought it was normal as a child to not receive hugs at a certain age until I saw 3 girls my age as a teenager hugging each other. I got very sad and just faked being sick that day to get out of school early to be sad alone in my bedroom. I don't think I'll get a hug anytime soon, especially with having to social distance. I've been doing that for years and it's nothing new. This is just something I'm throwing out there, I'm not really asking for anything. And there's nothing that could be done. I'm throwing this out there because I've never done it before.

The answer is a hard no and it both saddens and angers me.,"I’m constantly the one solving other people’s problems or making them not feel alone. But does anyone ever do the same for me? The answer is a hard no and it both saddens and angers me. - Everybody always comes to me with their problems, they use me as a shoulder to cry on, someone to vent to, a problem solver, ect. Now I’m glad to do those things as it means the person trusts me and I’m grateful that they feel they can open up to me, but honestly the weight of everyone’s pains start to get a little heavy sometimes. I feel as if everyone’s sob story/heartbreak/un happy ending are all starting to pile up in my mind and I’m getting tired of being everyone’s emotional support system. All of my “friends” (even the new ones I make), my mom, my ex, my boss, my coworker the list of people that drop their problems and miseries on me just goes on and on to the point that I don’t know if I can be there for everyone. I’m starting to feel less and less empathy for them and it’s as if I can feel myself just becoming....empty? And then we move on to the fact that I myself do not have an emotion support system of my own. I feel as if nobody is truly there for me. Everybody sees me as being this strong, happy, carefree person but it’s really just my wall of self defense. It’s me putting up a front to hide my weaknesses but I’m slowly starting to feel some cracks form in that wall. When things start to break down you either have to fix them or break them completely, you can’t leave it limbo forever. And I have no one to help repair me so therefore I guess I’ll be left to break, slowly and all alone. Nobody ever asks if I’m truly okay, nobody every cares to hear my true feelings, nobody lets me freely express my emotions, I have no shoulder to cry on, people tell me that crying is for the weak, I don’t want to be weak yet I can only be strong for so long. Who supports the emotional support system???

Edit: I am not suicidal so don’t take it that way. Just feeling some emotions and for once I’ve decided against suppressing them.

Edit #2: holy crap I honestly didn’t expect so many people to read my post or to have so many of you express being in a similar situation as myself. Means a lot that you guys took the time to read my post, helped fill the void a little:)"

lonely,"How the hell do people make, and keep friends?","How the hell do people make, and keep friends? - I haven't had friends at all in over 2 years. In the latter half of 2020, I was determined to make a friend. I started ""hunting"", if you will, all over the internet for people with similar interests. I actually made 1 friend, and it was cool for a month or so, but we just fell apart eventually and now they're pretty much ghosting me. Idk if its because they were my only friend and they had other friends, or because it was online, but it fucking sucks and I'm back where I started.

I just dont get it. It feels like there's some secret trick to making friends that everyone knows except me. There's people in my family who are probably more introverted than I am and they still have friends. 

Also, irl friends are hard as fuck to make but its way more genuine and lasts longer. Online friends are easier (still hard) to find but never stick around.

lonely,One year of pointless optimism,"One year of pointless optimism - About a year ago, I woke up in an emergency room. My parents found me OD’d on anxiety medication and alcohol. I spent two weeks cut off from everything I knew, given better medicine, and then sent back to try and do it all over again. I entered reality with hope. That maybe now, I’d have fixed everything holding me back.

Then covid hit. And I slowly faded out again. I went from optimistic to disinterested. I lost all forward momentum. I found myself wishing I was back in the psych ward with all the other strangers trying to get back on their feet. At least then I was talking to others, seeing their faces and spending time not being alone. 

The problem is now I don’t have the guts to try and die. Now the fear that drove me to near death is gone. But I find myself alone every god damn night and the more I look for help the more I get told to wait... or to give up."

I've been really bad the last weeks. And i know that when im really bad and dunno why, its because i need to introspect to reveal it.That takes me several days but then i saw the light, the reason why im this sad, this blue, this hurt.At 15th of July it will be 10 years since I've been rape.I had 15 years old, i was virgin and a sweet girl, really i was. At these times i use to believe in love so hard, so hard, than i didnt notice that someone could hurt me like this.But, its not that the problem, the problem is that, maybe for u it was obviously o not, dont care how much years pass and happen, it will never stop to be one year more after that, my life is part in two, before rape and after rape in so many ways.I know that, its obviouly that never i will stop to be a girl who was rape, because dont care my age, I always will be that 15 years old girl at this.And i feel useless, because i still dont be sure if i want to report yet, and the years keep passing and passing... And the thing is that maybe that shitty person is still today raping girls, teenagers girls. And I feel so responsable for that, even knowing that in this society its almost imposible that he can go to prison because guys like him always get sure to dont leave evidence... Or maybe more because is not my will he still raping.I only know one thing, i dont want any person who knows me or know about me say that i want it, that it was consensual.Thinking and thinking, I only can realise that this kind of shitty person brokes everyday another life, they take things from people and then here we are, counting the years one by one and call it ""1 year since"", ""5 years since"", ""10 years since"", ""30 years since""... and never it will be just a year because at least one day you will remember how many years pass since that happened..."

lonely,I have no social support system of any sort.,"I have no social support system of any sort. - I find my situation really frustrating. I have 0 friends, 0 acquaintances, 0 family, 0 parters, etc. I literally don’t have anyone. I feel like everyone else just has bouts of loneliness but never actually had to live a decade being alone with nobody. No one cares - really no one cares. If I died today or tomorrow it wouldn’t matter. I’m not saying it out of suicidal ideation/depression; it’s reality in my case. If I died, no one would care. I’ve always been the person to care for others and put in 100% effort. But I always get trashed, defamed, betrayed, sabotaged, neglected, and ostracized in return. I haven’t done anything bad to anyone. But I get treated like this. Even people who have done horrible stuff to me have a strong social support group. I feel like I’m never going to “win” in life or “win” people over - that I’ll always be the “loser”, and people in my life will do everything to make sure I stay as the “loser”. I feel like I’m forever cursed to be a scapegoat that other people use to get ahead/get what they want in life."

lonely,Anyone else literally friendless?,"Anyone else literally friendless? - It recently dawned on me (20M) that I genuinely have no friends nowadays.

When I was younger, I wasn’t very popular but I had a close circle of friends. As the years went on we drifted apart and now I don’t think I could relate to them anymore. I made a few friends in my first year at university, but in the second year my mental health deteriorated and I basically cut myself off from everyone in my life. I failed most of my classes that year, and I’ve taken this year off, but I’ve been allowed to retake them in September. 

At the moment I’m back in my hometown with only my family for company (and I barely leave the house because of the COVID lockdown). I’ve never felt more lonely. I feel so cut off from the outside world, I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to rebuild by social circle or if I’ll just spent the rest of my life as a shut in.

Sorry for the long post. I just wanted to get this off my chest, and thought maybe some people here might relate.

lonely,A message would be nice,"A message would be nice - Over the last week I've made plans with two of my three best friends four times. Three with one and one with the other.

1 - turns up about 2 hours late. 
2 - cancels 30 mins past arranged time
3 - doesn't arrange a time like asked until the very last minute - turns up late.

And 4. Make arrangements 5 days or so prior. Talk about it a couple of days before it, ensure it the night before, gets pushed back because they went to their gf's. Two hours late to their pushed back time, no sign of them.

Lol they messaged me now to say they'll be on in like 2 hours. Not great but its something ig.

Idk to finish the vent, I dont socialise much and i love my friends very much, as awkward as it is for me to admit that about the cheeky cunts, but sometimes I feel like I'm an afterthought to them, and it thoroughly scares me and makes me think dark shit. 

I dont consider myself to be  clingy but there's an element of fear in that I might be left behind by them, who used to be equally as awkward but who have socially blossomed and don't have much time for me these days. 

Power to them, I just wished I wasn't so envious at these times where it feels like I'm being forgotten. I dont have anyone else if they do leave. That scares me almost as much as losing their friendship dies at this point. Just a simple pre-emptive message so I'm not wasting my time then feeling like this all night is all im asking for, and have asked for.

Edit: and again I'm made to feel pathetic because after getting a message saying they'd be there, just late I got excited and again they've not turned up. Irs funny before this week I was never the one to try and organise things with friends because I felt too anxious to actually do it. Thought j was being stupid because I've been friends with them for god knows how many years, so tried, but only with things put on the table in conversation already. But nah fuck me for trying I guess. Wont be happening again. I'm up in 5 fucking hours. 

Oh look again i get a message. Got ""caught up"" watching shit. Cool. Fuck me i guess.

lonely,I'm alone,"I'm alone - I'm so fucking lonely my heart hurts constantly idk what to do this year has been so fucked. I was married for 8 years my wife cheated on me she was constantly verbally abusive and she was physically abusive. She would do this in front of our kids to the point they were afraid to tell her anything. When I decided to leave her I made the mistake of letting her know I was going to see a lawyer. She moved before I could. She called CPS and accused me of abusing our kids, she filed for divorce before my lawyer could serve the divorce papers. She and her mom attacked me in front of our children, she then put a restraining order against me saying o was the aggressor. She stole 20k from my bank accounts. She took everything we owned. I haven't seen my kids in a year. I don't have many friends, maybe 3 who always make excuses as to why they can't meet up. My closest family is 1500 miles away. My uncle who practically raised me just passed away. I'm not suicidal but I sincerely wish I was not around anymore. I am so tired of feeling this way. I just want someone who will actually care about me. I want to know what being in love is supposed to feel like. But I'm terrified of dating im so scared ill find someone like my ex I don't want to be taken advantage of anymore. Sorry for the wall of text..."

lonely,I've realized that I actually don't have any friends,"I've realized that I actually don't have any friends - I've always been bad at keeping friendships. I'm very charismatic, and I can be really funny, so I'm really good at getting new friends, I'm just never able to keep them. 

To be fair I used to be a huge asshole, I struggled with BPD when I was younger which resulted in me getting aggressive and being super dramatic, cutting off friends left and right. I'm not nearly as bad now, and I never cut off friends anymore, but I still suck at maintaining friendships. 

Last year I graduated, all my friends from the other school I used to go to, go to the same school as me. But we're all in different classes and it's a pretty big school so we never really see each other or hang out. I did get friends in my new class, but my depression got really bad so I was held back a year. I'm now in a new class with people a year younger than me. I'm not joking when I say that I genuinely only know the names of 4 students in my class.

I was honestly doing pretty okay about not having friends, but my birthday is coming up which has made me super bummed about it. I'm turning 18 and I've always planned having this big celebration with tons of people. Turning 18 is a huge deal here, and I've been looking forward to it for so long. Sadly I don't have anyone to invite. Inviting my old friends would be weird because I haven't spoken to them in such a long time, and they all have new friendgroups. Inviting people from my old class is the same, I only keep in contact with one of them and we're not close at all. Inviting people from my current class is obviously not going to work considering none of them even know me, and I don't know them (they're also younger than me so drinking would be out of the question).

I don't know what to do at this point. Sometimes I hope the virus gets worse just so I legally can't have a party, but I feel awful for feeling that way. I wish I could just skip my birthday and turn 18 next year instead"

My parents who will pass on before I do, and coworkers that are good people.

I may have a handful of people that I would consider my friends but assuming I outlive them then no one as of now will most likely be at my funeral. 

I’ve always wondered why does dying alone seem to have this stigma as if it would add insult to injury in our final moments. As if being surround by people as you meet death is somehow more soothing. I mean we won’t be there to know who attended lol 

I randomly thought about this yesterday for the first time and genuinely believe that I am okay with this being the outcome.

and I realized today, on why I love ""Personal Attention ASMR"" or ""Lullaby ASMR"" because I never had that, and It's pathetic, It makes me wanna cry on how lonely I feel, I'm surrounded by the wrong people who never get it, and would never get it.

I have my mom, my sister, my step dad, my ONE rl friend who already dealing with issues (we don't talk much cause I don't wanna add to her issues) and my one online friend. He doesn't get it tho, he keeps pushing for a relationship. and I feel like This won't work and I'll end up just hurting him, and I don't want to lose him, but he doesn't get ittttt (specially when he makes fun of my Bulimia which makes me wanna stop talking to him, but if I did that, I'd have no one to talk to lol it's an ugly cycle)

I hate sleeping, whenever I Try to sleep not only that I'm fighting the pain but also the pain from loneliness. it starting to physically hurt and I hateeeee it!!!

I do the same things daily, THE SAME ROUTINE. Wake up - eat - physical therapy - shower - eat again - open your laptop/wait for my friend to text me back and waste the whole day like this.. :(

I just want someone who I Can talk to daily and we can watch things together without pushing for a relationship (which won't work cause of the distance and my panic attacks triggers), is that too much to ask? I guess it's and It can't be fixed or helped lol

(3) - (This next bit I really fucking hate myself for, and I almost want to leave it out because I’m ashamed of myself for these thoughts, and I don’t want to be bitter. I’m not bitter. But in the interest of honesty. Of honesty with myself and telling this story. Of honestly feeling my feelings. I know that’s the way to work through bad feelings. Anyway, don’t judge me for what follows.) It’s getting to a point where even just seeing a beautiful woman can send me into anxiety. Just walking out of the park I pass by a man and two women walking in. Super gorgeous, exactly my type. And I get this sinking shit feeling in my chest of dread and despair knowing I don’t have anyone like that, and it’s anger at myself that I won’t allow myself. Because I don’t talk to people and I don’t make the effort because I’m so shy and anxious and self conscious. And I really hate these thoughts because I can hear how close to incel and nice guy talking points that is, and that’s not who i am. I know that I’m decently attractive, I can be charming and smart, people do like me. I’ve got friends, I’ve made new friends, I’ve built relationships. I know how to, I just don’t. And I know it’s my self confidence, I know it’s my self esteem, and I know the solution is therapy and to talk to someone. But again, I just don’t.. 

I don’t know, the point of this is not so much seeking advice, as I’ve heard it all before and told myself it all before and again, I know what I’m supposed to do. I’m just suffering I guess. I just live in bad feelings, and as anyone else who does suffer from bad feelings, it affects all other aspects of my life. And I guess the point of this is that today just happened to be one of those days where I feel it more than others. And I’m looking ahead to the future, to when is it going to change or get better, and it seems so far away and so dismal, like there is no end point or light. I don’t see it getting better, I don’t see life getting better."

I'm slowly breaking of being a people pleaser who just do everything for everyone, I realized the only times I was contacted by ""friends"" are times they asked for a favor it goes like 
-them asking for a favor
-me doing them the favor because I feel like I have to (I don't)
-them leaving until they need something else

lonely,My boyfriend and I are growing apart from our friend group,"My boyfriend and I are growing apart from our friend group - My boyfriend and I have had the same group of friends for (roughly) 7+ years. Now, he and I are in our mid-twenties and are finding it really hard to relate to most of them anymore. 
They’re more interested in large parties, getting drunk, and watching sports. They can be fun, but are also always yelling and acting over-the-top annoying (pushing/messing up our house/breaking things). They honestly remind me of a bunch of frat guys now.

These days, my boyfriend and I are more interested in being in small groups with more meaningful connections and conversations. We get easily annoyed when our friends come over because they trash our house. And in turn, they’re inviting us less and less to their things, which makes us feel used when they plan things at our place. Don’t get me wrong, my boyfriend and I are very social people and we love to hang out, but I hate feeling annoyed every time we’re going to see these guys.

I get it. It’s harder to ignore that we’re growing apart and losing common ground aside from our shared history. Has anyone else gone through this? It’s hard and it feels like we’re losing people that we really loved for such a long part of our lives. But we don’t have the same mindsets or interests anymore. Can there still be a friendship without those things? I don’t want to lose these people forever, but it looks like that’s where it’s heading. 

I’m also scared about finding new friends if we lose these ones. How do you even make new friends as an adult? Any advice or shared experiences would be helpful. This is a weird transitional phase in our lives and it would help to know that people who have been in this position have come out happier on the other side of it.

TL;DR: We’re losing longtime friendships because we don’t relate to the people very much anymore. Advice for moving on/saving the friendships/meeting new people?"

I go to a park to walk and feel better. And I do feel better, slightly. I enjoy knowing I’m exercising, however minimal, and I really enjoy being in nature. It’s very calming. But then I see all these couples and it just breaks my heart as it’s a reminder of how alone I am. And I am trying so hard to not be bitter about it, because that’s not who I am. I mean, I’m happy for how happy they are, any couple, but it makes me so sad that I don’t have that. It reminds me of all the previous people I had, that loved me and wanted to stick around and take care of me, shitty feelings and all, and how I’ve ruined every one of those and made myself alone again so that I can bitch about it again."

I have nobody to ask for advice anymore because I wouldn't even get any advice back. I remember when we would always speak to each other and now they just don't bother replying or speaking to me at all unless its a situation that involves them.

COVID has isolated all of us, but mainly it’s showed me who my friends are and who was just a causal acquaintance. This led me to the conclusion that I have three IRL friends, one who is technically IRL but we only ever talk online, and two people I’ve never met in person. 
My IRL friends are becoming distanced. One is taking a break from social media, which means barely any contact with him, and one has drastically different polices opinions than me and without our mutual friend all we do is fight. 
I’m getting much closer with my IRL/online friend, but we aren’t close enough to talk like I want to. My two completely online friends come and go.

I dunno. I have discord servers that are fairly active and full of people who enjoy the same things I do, and when they’re all online I feel completely fine, but when it’s just me, and none of my IRL friends are responding, and my kinda IRL friend is offline, and my online friends are in different time zones... I haven’t felt this lonely since sophomore year of high school. My IRL friends say they want to stay close (the guy specifically) but he’s distancing himself from me and it doesn’t feel like he’s putting in the effort for what he wants. Like he thinks he can leave for two months and come back and I’d just be fine with that. He says he still wants to be my friend when I move but I know that’s not going to happen. With the way he’s being right now, there’s just no way we can keep this going across an ocean.

I've been close friends with a buddy of mine for a couple years now, and he/she's a great person and all that - although he rarely gets on anymore. I can completely understand that everyone has a life of their own, but whenever I see them online I attempt to reach out and interact with them.

Most of the time I usually keep quiet for a couple weeks and not bother them, usually in fear that I'll lose a long-time friend. Yet due to Covid and the past lockdown since last year, It's been difficult to not try and reach out to them - mostly because of both sadness and loneliness.

lonely,not that sad just down,not that sad just down - I've hit the point in my life where I realised how fucking lonely I am. I have a decent amount of friends but nobody who is really close with me. I met this girl through my mate who was really chill and made me want to be a better person. I thought I was finding someone who got me and was there for me for once. Im a fucking idiot though because I thought we had something but she drifted and is now dating my friend. Love being the attached middleman :D.
lonely,Anyone else..?,"Anyone else..? - Reading through all of these posts, and comments. It breaks my heart to see the same inescapable feeling of loneliness and being trapped being reciprocated by so many people. I often find myself thinking about the lives of others, and how they go about social interactions and living their lives without ever really thinking about it, and at my lowest point, being green with envy while doing so. I also often think about how many days, and nights I've spent alone, reviewing every mistake and aspect of my life. I am blessed with a beautiful wife and baby boy, and I often feel like somewhere in the cosmos this was the workings of the universe, feeling my suffrage and hoping to deliver me from my isolated, transparent prison. But sometimes, as selfish as it sounds, I crave something more. I crave freedom from this prison. I crave interaction. I crave ignorance that will allow me to ignore my entrapment."
lonely,Trying to cope with lonliness,"Trying to cope with lonliness - I've always been relatively alone I guess. I grew up with a very unhealthy family situation so my siblings feel more like people that just live in my house rather then family. So I would like going to school to hang out with my friends. But now that I'm older they don't feel like friends. I mean I love to hang out with them, they honestly give me highlights at such a low point in my life, but it doesn't always seem that way. Everyone has disagreements and drama, of course thats life ya know? But shit really hurts sometimes. 

I have made a lot of friends at school, I have friends I love to hang out with, but few to zero whom really care and feel like friends. My family has been possibly moving outta California because shits fucked here and hearing that sounds so nice and just being away from all the friends whom made my life what it is sounds oddly refreshing and tranquil. But I fear making new friends will be hard. I now I'm just imagine scenarios but my parents made moving sound likely.

I recently just got out of a depression. Well I feel like I have. I still have the same mind set and feel like shit from time to time. But it's not as worse now. But when I was in it and still now I think of future relationship and finding a girlfriend. Ofc covid has made that almost impossible so it's hard trying to cope. I'm very tired and I want to keep this short anyway so I guess I'll stop here."
lonely,Advice for feeling down when I’m alone,"Advice for feeling down when I’m alone - On the contradictory, I’m an introvert (INFP) that likes to hang out with my friends as often as I like. Too often that whenever I’m free I kind of need a company to be there but I know that everyone has their own lives to lead, nobody can be there for me 24/7. I tried ways to distract myself, (watch a movie, go for a run etc) whatever I can think of but I don’t feel satisfied at all and I get bored easily. I always get advices to get busy and do what makes me happy, pick up a hobby but it seems like nothing is working for me. I don’t feel satisfied or contented entirely like how my friends claimed that they feel happy when they’re doing things they love and that they are okay being alone. To add on, Im 1 month into my weight loss journey, Things have been going smoothly and that’s the only thing that makes me happy (for awhile) and then I get back to feeling down again, you know the feeling stuffy in your chest but you have no idea why you feel this way. Why don’t I feel that same way as them? What’s wrong with me?"

I’m terrified. - I have never felt this alone and scared in my life. I’ve never had a lot of friends, but after my bf and I started dating I was happy I had at least had someone around to talk to. I also ended up unknowingly pushing away the few friends I had while I was dating my boyfriend. I know, stupid. But I had never been in a relationship before and I did it unknowingly. Our relationship was a mess though. Now that it’s ending, I feel more lonely than ever especially now that I know what it’s like to have someone. I forgot how to be alone. I’m absolutely terrified. I don’t know how to even make friends or who to talk to or who to go to. I don’t know what hobbies I have. Who do I go to when I have something to say? Who do I go to when I want to tell someone about my day? How do you be lonely?"

I'm not lacking anything I need to survive. My parents love me, and I have a home and pets. The property I live on is large, and I could literally be alone in a forest anytime I want, which is something I know a lot of people would like to have.

What do I want, then? What is missing?

Every time I try to talk to other people about my problems or life, it's like I'm pulling out a thread from my mass of random tangled knots. If I pull too hard, something might come undone that can't be put back. What's worse, is I can only show the person this one damn thread, this sentence, this tiny drop in the ocean of my life. They can't ever know what it's like to *be* me.

That's what I want... I want someone to know what it's like.

To be me.

I had one online friend on Reddit, and he was my only friend but he found friends irl so he doesn't need me anymore :)

I feel pathetic, disgusting, trashy, used, hopeless, filthy, wumbo, and extra pathetic and I don't want anyone I know seeing me being my stupid dumb useless self lol

I guess hello a new position has opened up for my one and only friend yes or even better just be my virtual boyfriend because that's even more hopeless than me having friends hahaha"

lonely,Friendlessness.,"Friendlessness. - (Sorry this message is maybe rather too unfocussed and rather too analytical to be appropriate for this subreddit. And it is definitely too long! But I’m posting it anyway.)

1

Often people say: “I find it difficult to make friends”. Whenever I hear that I feel like I want to ask: But what does that even mean? Can we explain exactly what we mean by this difficulty. Ideally with detailed examples?

Similarly people say that they “don’t know how to socialise” or they “don’t have any social skills”.

2

Maybe the question means something like that we don’t know the method, the technique. So then the meaning is more: “I don’t know HOW to make friends.” The difficulty is the not knowing how.

(So it would be like the way people say about some magician: “I don’t know how they did that trick!”).

So then the question is: OK so what ARE the effective methods of HOW to make friends?

Most of the methods (tips) I hear about HOW to make friends are pretty worthless. Like: “find people with similar interests”. In my experience this doesn’t work. The reason being that just because someone likes the same things I like doesn’t mean we will get on in the way I would want from a friend. (For example suppose I like talking about politics. But then just because someone else likes that too doesn’t mean I will get on with them. For example it might depend on the way in which they talk. If they talk about politics in an opinionated and boorish way then I won’t get on with them.)

And you could be best friends with someone with whom you share no interests. Sometimes I think that a good friendship isn’t one where you share an interest in other things but where you share an interest in each other.

3

Another thing people say when they want a friend is that they just want someone to talk to. Which would suggest that the method of HOW to make friends is to just find someone to talk to.

But, again, that’s not sufficient. Just because I have someone to talk to that doesn’t mean we will be friends. They might talk to me and say things that are unpleasant or boring and belittling about me. If I was surrounded by such people I might feel MORE lonely than I would if was literally alone.

(Which reminds me of the quote (usually attributed to Robin Williams): “I used to think the the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It’s not. The worst thing is ending up with people who make you feel all alone.” More generally: it is quite easy to feel lonely while in the company of other people.)

4

Thinking about it in the abstract there do seem to be some methods which might work but which would be (socially) unacceptable. For example if you meet someone (or you know of someone) who you decide would be good to have as a friend then you just go up to them and say: “hey, do you want to be my friend?”. This isn’t allowed. (Except maybe if you’re 8 years old.)

5

The above shows that it is not easy to say what you want from a friend.

Someone might say (re the above): “well if you don’t think having the same interests is part of a being friends then what is?”

And then (generally) if you can’t say what you want. If you can’t articulate it (even to yourself) then that’s going to make it harder to get what you want.

6

Another thing is that people say that Internet Forums (like Reddit) are a way to meet people and make friends. And I find myself thinking: no, because the Internet Forum format is not about real-time conversation and, as far as I can tell, this latter is essential for getting to know someone. Which in turn is essential for becoming friends with them.

By real-time interaction I mean, for example, conversation where you can interrupt and get clarification and that sort of thing. It's only in real-time conversation that you can properly engage with someone.

Also: The reason for this post is for me to get to a more than superficial understanding of (other) friendless people’s experiences of friendlessness. But without real-time interaction I don’t think I will get this.

And I don’t know if it’s the done thing (or if it’s safe or advisable) to invite people to message me directly to arrange a time for conversation. I doubt if I’d be deluged with offers anyway!"
lonely,Sips sweet tea...,"Sips sweet tea... - Ah yes. *pokes fire* nothing like fueling my nihilistic outlook on humanity by getting ghosted on the 1st date at a nice restaurant and eating alone because I like the atmosphere and noise, just so I don't feel totally alone.

Dylon, why ever would that girl you've been talking to every day for a month not show up   to a date night to get amazing food for free and go to her place and watch the mandolorian?

Well my fine feathered friend, *props feet up on coffee table*...

I'll never know. Because she blocked me on everything.

Seriously... I'm 20 years old, I'd like to think I'm decent looking, a 7? I'm about to join the air force, and I'm extremely attentive and compassionate, im a good person... But I always, without failure... End up alone. I've been alone for 2 years now... I'm tired of going to bed with out the good night text, or good morning text... I'm tired of thinking I'll end up alone in the end."

Humans have always been like this but now , even more with corona it has changed. So the solution Id say is meet people in these Reddit groups that maybe live near you and also I’d say I’d you overthink or are super scared like omg what am I going to say well you will be stressed and maybe you will say bullshit( or not it depends lol) but I found myself worrying sometimes and then when I met the person chat just flowed 
Also there are very good videos on YouTube on how to carry on a conversation for those of you who struggle with this 
I’d say also If you can afford it get a dog or an animal that will love you unconditionally 
Anyway good luck my friends , the world is brighter than we might think sometimes !!!"

lonely,Me Myself an I,"Me Myself an I - I’m currently in a rehab, my fourth to be exact. i’ve recently turned 22, and although i was happy on my birthday, the coming days have been miserable. This was the first sober birthday i’ve have in 6 years and it’s almost like the experience of Shrooms, it was a great day, and now the negative depression, sadness, and hopelessness has set in. I literally don’t know how to cope with my feelings without drugs. More than anything, i’m lonely. I don’t have anyone to call my friend, i have burned every bridge due to past mistakes. I honestly have friends, but they all are still balls deep in their addiction. i have no positive influences, mentors, or people in my life. i’m homeless, and this rehab is the only thing separating me from the streets. the streets show no love, they never have. i am constantly in my head, i think about suicide more than i should, i contemplate returning to self harm. i don’t see any light at the end of this tunnel. i don’t want feedback, i don’t want to be acknowledged, i just want someone to truly care about me. i’m all alone. i tend to love people more than they love me, i’m manic in the way i communicate, always over sharing because i never had a chance to share in the first place. i lied, i do want to be acknowledged. that’s all i want. attention. not for self ego, just to know that someone sees me, that i’m not invisible. i have nobody to talk to at these hours of night, i literally lay in bed waiting for the sun to rise, then sleep the day away. i feel nocturnal. i quit taking my depression medicine, i honestly feel like i’m comfortable in my depression. it’s what i know. nobody seems to understand that. i’ve struggled with relationships, i truly believe i will die alone. i’m almost to the point of accepting that. i don’t see myself living into old age, i know my cause of death will be due to drugs or my own hands. i constantly think about drugs and relapse because at this point, the only reason i’m not high is probation. i’ve already relapsed in my head. i am not dumb, i understand i can hit the brakes whenever, it’s just not what i want to do. i deserve to feel like this. i don’t deserve to be special, or loved, or anything. i deserve to feel like this. it’s sad. i just wish i had one true connection with anyone. not someone, anyone. i’ve lived a traumatized life and i feel weak for letting myself wallow in my emotions. i push them away so much that they’ve bottled up into a rage of anger. a rage of a million emotions. i am unpredictable, impulsive. i’m so lost..."

We can be homies - I may not be able to help you, but I can be your homie. We can also talk music, social skills, dreams, desires, crushes, whatever. I truly don’t give a fuck because I’ve probably been there. I was lucky enough to move to a school where people were patient and non toxic when I was in my anti social phase. They taught me that I’m good enough and that I can be a goof whenever I want. I’m in first year uni now and I get invited to parties yay ((:

If y’all wanna be friends with me you’re not gonna be my plan B friends. You will be my plan A, because that’s what friends do. There is no frigging hierarchy of people that are in your lane or not. This is no fucking charity work. I remember feeling super lonely and anxious and it sucks so if you’re talking to me you bet your ass I’m gonna care about you. 

I’m on Spotify and I’d like to do some Spotify sessions with y’all. I’m into all types of music and I know that music has helped me in the most lonely times. Crying is allowed. I don’t judge your emotions. Like I said I don’t give a fuck. So this goes out to all the lonely birthday parties. To all the times of chickening out to your crush. All the times you didn’t gather the courage to go talk to this person you wish you were friends with. All the times you were left on read and all the times you wish you could share your popcorn with someone. Pm me and just be yourself.

I try to get out... but when I get home it feels the same. I feel like I don't want or need a girlfriend really - but I would love to have a woman to just hold in my arms and snuggle with and smell her hair and spoon each other - but without sexual expectations or anything - just snuggles. I realize some people would think that's crazy and say that's impossible but I can't help but hope it's possible somehow. I don't want all the weight of a relationship - I can't handle that stress in my life right now - but if there was a woman out there feeling the same way and wanting the same thing - just a friend to cuddle - I wish I could find that. I don't think I'm the only one feeling this way.

I frequently feel as if I am going to die, I've written extensive letters to my family, apologizing for my untimely departure. I can imagine my death, I know I am going to die extremely soon, yet I know that that is entirely untrue, I feel like I am going to die! It is miserable, laid before my very eyes this unreality manipulates my every action. The tides who's tired time abides I cannot conclude that line, did you know that?

feel like I'm caught in like this endless cycle of getting so lonely that turns into getting so depressed   then that turns into anxiety of why I cant find someone or anyone,  you know like my own person. And I keep thinking of so much stuff that's wrong with me to the point where I cant see or think of anything positive and I feel worthless like I cant do anything and who wants to be around anyone who's worthless and always in a bad mood so I shut down and dont bother anyone just hoping someone comes along and just helps pull me out of this false reality that I've come to believe  so much in  I lost all the things that I enjoyed. I know everyone has their own lives and problems why add mine to the mix and create unnecessary worry in their life. I dont want to die and am not suicidal I guess I chose the middle ground, I choose to just plain exist  inside this labyrinth I call my sanity. Instead of live and have a simple conversation with a woman. Sometimes I think God is actually time, and heaven and hell are just States of mind. Heaven:  where positivity, kindness,  understanding, and love  prevail as everyday thoughts whereas hell: where hate, jealousy, self pity, and worthlessness torment you.

lonely,DAE feel like they have so much to say but can't get it out?,"DAE feel like they have so much to say but can't get it out? - I know I'm not a boring person. I have varied interests and in-depth knowledge of a few subjects. Even if I don't know anything about a topic, I will analyze it and be able to come up with questions that further the conversation. Yet... when faced with real-life social interaction I come up blank. I give a canned response or a smile and a laugh. Even when I try to stop myself and verbalize a thought, suddenly nothing comes to mind. By the time I've managed to unfreeze or sort out an appropriate response, the conversation has moved on. 

My coworkers see me as an introverted, hard-working, resilient type of guy. That's really not how I am when alone. I like to have fun, don't take life very seriously, and actually think I am a damaged extrovert (when defined as getting energy from social interaction). I just am unable to express myself. I kind of know why (childhood trauma and drama yadda yadda yadda) but I can't seem to fix it.  I guess what I'm asking is... Does anyone else feel this way? And if so, do you have any clue as to how to get past it???

While not popular, I had friends and didn't have much trouble making friends. Even in college I made friends but none of the friendships lasted because I didn't live on campus and it was kind of hard to maintain the friendships. But as an adult I am completely friendless.

I had a decently sized friend group (around 8 people), but I always felt like the runt. When we would all meet up during meals at an on campus dining center, two conversations would spring up at the same time. A few people would start talking about gaming and the others would talk about something else. I've never felt like I added anything substancial to the conversations. I have limited interests, and find it hard to relate to people that only bond through videogames. I don't have a console or a gaming PC, and I don't plan on getting one anytime soon.

My friends seemed like genuine and kind people and say that I mean a lot to them. I can't help but feel like I used to be the group mascot / comedic relief dude.

It's kind of hard not to feel like shit when there are actual 14 year olds that look older than me.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want a girlfriend, or significant other. I want someone that I can be intimate with and make me feel attractive and desirable. I want someone who actually knows me as a person, and not just how I look. I used to have a few genuine close friends when I was younger, but I feel very distant from them now. I've never had an old friend reach out to me to reconnect.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just really hard for me to reach out to people when I don't feel attractive in the first place. Everyone I talk to treats me like some inmature child and it really kills my self esteem. I never really bothered to seek relationships in high school. I didn't have much of a friend group then, so how could I be capable of being in a relationship."
lonely,"I'm going to lose my mind, I feel so alone","I'm going to lose my mind, I feel so alone - You really do meet people when you least expect it. I've been through so much emotional pain the last few months. I can't even begin to describe how much I've been struggling and hurting from the people I meet and consider close to me. Here I am at one of the lowest points in my life, and I meet someone completely by chance who is good to me. They made me feel like everything is going to be okay, like I am capable of being loved. They turned all of those long sleepless nights that I spend alone, up way too late unable to relax or make my mind stop thinking, and flushed all of it away. I felt at ease for once and at peace, like things were going to get better. They want to leave now too, and I am just feeling completely crushed. I went against my own logic to be vulnerable to a person who made me feel like it was right, like things were looking up for me. I just feel like I'm in some sort of twisted reality where only the worst happens. This doesn't feel right, like it shouldn't be happening AGAIN. Especially not with this person, I had so much faith in them and who they are. I feel like I have no one to turn to when I need someone. I haven't had a friend in person in 10 years, and the one friend I do have who is online is there for me, but I get scared, like what if they were to leave too? I've been alone most of my life, people feel so temporary at this point. All of the strong connections that I make end up hurting me. I hate this. I just need someone. Someone who actually cares about me, someone I can turn to. I can only distract myself so much. I'm alone at my desk right now listening to music and losing my mind. I'll probably just play a game to try to forget things for even just a moment... but it's a constant battle. The thoughts will be back after, and I won't be able to sleep for the majority of the night. Last night I woke up every 30 minutes having nonstop nightmares. I just want to be happy. PLEASE."
lonely,What should you do when you feel scared and alone?,"What should you do when you feel scared and alone? - I feel so still right now. My heart is completely calm. All of my body is so calm right now but I dont feel good at all. 

The loneliness I've held for so long has gotten me so numb that I can barely feel the feeling I associate with loneliness. I can only sense that something is wrong.

I know that I have to go back to doing something that makes me feel scared tomorrow. I have to do it alone again. I will definitely be putting in efforts to try to change that fact but there's nothing I can do about it right now. There is no release for me right now.

What do you do when you feel like this?"

lonely,"Isolation, depression and bad habits","Isolation, depression and bad habits - Hey, this is my first post under this thread so let's see where this will take me.

I have always shown introvert tendencies. Since I was little I have always enjoyed being alone. The problem is that it greatly fuels my ongoing depression for a couple of years now. It's the same dilemma for most of us I guess. The endless cycle of depression, too much smoking of Marihuana, porn, bad food, loneliness etc.. I tried to end my misery literally a million times but never stayed consistent with the goal I was setting. The fact that I got never socialized properly at a young age could be one part of the problem. Plus the fact that I literally live for social media and stupid online games since I was 13-15 yrs old. I'm now 20. I have the feeling that my life won't lead into a good direction if I don't change anything about it. I you want you guys are thinking. This guy's is only 20. Everything is still ahead of him. Yes you might be right at some point. Still consider the fact that these habits of loneliness, playing video games, watching porn and eating bad food exist for a very long time now, if you put it in perspective with my age. So what's the solution? How can I get out of this misery?"

lonely,i just want a man so bad lol,"i just want a man so bad lol -  here. Some might thing that’s still pretty young to have never had a boyfriend before, some may not. I am fairly physically attractive and have no problems getting male attention, though a lot of the time the guys I attract aren’t really my type. The ones that I AM attracted to, for some reason things don’t work. 1st guy just kinda fell off, 2nd guy was extremely horny and probably only wanted sex, and the third guy I guess we’re technically still talking? I gave him my number about a month ago and he did ask me for a date, but to my great displeasure I’m afraid he might be trying to ghost me. 

I fucking hate “talking” stages :( I’m tired of this cycle of really starting to like a guy just for him to ghost me. I’ve never been interested in talking to multiple people at once :( anytime I try I end up ignoring the rest of them to focus on one, until that one ghosts me LOL :)

I just want to feel important to someone lol, I want them to genuinely WANT to talk to me. And I crave intimacy soooooo badly. I’m not even really looking to rush into a relationship but I am so deeply intimacy deprived. I just want to cuddle and kiss and be held by someone, and feel safe enough to open up to them about anything. I want a really deep spiritual connection with someone. But it’s very fucking hard to get to that point when you can’t even make it past the talking stage.

I also have a habit of wasting my time because I create these IDEAS of people in my head and end up disappointed and confused when they don’t come true. Dealing with that last guy definitely helped me realize that. I should’ve immediately noticed and fell back when I saw how he was gradually texting me more slowly but I wanted him to uphold this fantasy so bad that now I’m shellshocked that he disappeared when the signs were all there. 

This is all over the place but moral of the story maybe if I pay attention to reality and snap out of my imagination I will end up finding a man much more quickly instead of wasting my time. The end."

lonely,Just thought I’d add a story of mine because I just need someone else to hear it.,"Just thought I’d add a story of mine because I just need someone else to hear it. - So November of 2019 (feels like forever ago but I’ve never shared this before) was my first time spending the winter season at college and away from home and I was super excited. I hadn’t had much luck finding any friends but for some reason I felt like Christmas season would bring about a change of luck.

Anyway, about two weeks before the end of the semester, some people on my floor decide to do Secret Santa, and they set up most of my floor with people whom they would give and receive gifts from. I didn’t get someone to give a gift to, but I remember the whole floor was busy asking others what they liked or what other people like so they can know what to get. I assumed that I would get assigned someone eventually because both of my roommates, admittedly more extroverted, did some time during the week.

So Friday comes along and everyone gathers in the main common room of the floor to begin the gift giving. I still had not received someone to give a present to but I thought that maybe there was an odd number so I didn’t make much of it. Although I rarely went with the others when they decided to gather and do something, for some unknown reason I thought it would be a good idea to join the fun this time.

The next half hour was one of the worst I have ever experienced.

I spent almost the entire time sitting in the corner of the room silent as the grave as people gave each other gifts, made jokes, laughed, and generally just had a good time together. I tried to start conversation a couple of times with a few others but I barely knew them at this point so it died quickly. So instead I sat and watched as everyone had a great time seemingly without even noticing I was there. At the end of the event I washed everyone was still talking to each other I was still there, alone, as the only person in the room that did not receive a gift.

Afterwards I just felt heavy. Later on I would feel sad as well as extremely angry at the situation as a whole, but at the time I just felt like I was being weighed down by some invisible weight. I knew no one would notice my absence so I just wandered my way out of the room and went back to my own room. I spent the next hour or two lying in bed thinking about what just happened, and when my roommates returned I just pretended to be asleep.

I still don’t know exactly what to make of this. I don’t even know why I wrote this but I felt like I just had to get it off my chest."
lonely,Drifting away from close friends in the past months.,"Drifting away from close friends in the past months. -  [] I’ve been friends with these four people for years now. I’ve known one girl for roughly 15 years, another for around 7. The others, two guys, I’ve known for about 5 years. We’ve were all very close, we all went to school together freshman year of high school, which is how we all became “best friends” of sorts. The five of us were very tight knit and personal with each other. They comforted me after I attempted my own life, and I did likewise when one of the others did. I told them things I wouldn’t dare tell anyone else. 
We truly went through hell together those first years. Often the five of us exchanged “I love you”s and other stuff and tried our best to make everyone feel loved. I started doing full time online school sophomore year due to extreme anxiety/ depression issues, and saw a lot less of my friends daily. We still kept in touch and went out together on occasion. I still loved them to death and enjoyed talking to them. 
Then COVID happened, it wasn’t much of a change for me, as I had already been doing online school, and didn’t go out much. We had a couple of online video calls and game nights, but I never noticed anything out of the ordinary. I was extremely busy most of 2020 due to helping my sister with personal issues along with my own schoolwork. Things were relatively normal with our relationship, until around the end of the year. 

( we live in a pretty small community, few COVID cases, but we still comply with protocol ) I got together with them at the cafe one worked at, to chat and hang out. They mentioned how they often got together without me and something seemed off. Over the next few weeks I saw all of them a couple of times, but I just felt... different. 

It felt like I was talking to strangers, it felt awkward and uncomfortable. They talked and acted differently, and they talked about things that they did without me. 

I do love them, all of them. But I feel incredibly disconnected from all of them. None of them have reached out to me in the past week or so. Most people say something like “high school friends don’t last” which I agree with, I’ve had other high school friends whose come and gone. But I’ve known most for years, since childhood. I don’t think I would be so distraught over this if I had other people in my life. But again, I haven’t gone to a real school in years, and I’ve never been able to keep/ make friends (all of my four friends were people I met thru my childhood friend I’ve known for 15 yrs). 

I’ve never been in a romantic relationship, and I’m struggling with a lot of mental illness and generally don’t think people like me very much at this point. I just feel very alone, as I live in a rough household, and the only people who’ve really liked me are drifting away. Before the past month or so, they never really reached out or consoled me when I was talking about my grief and issues. Then they stopped talking directly to me last week.  Day to day I don’t talk to anyone. I’ve tried to at least get some of the attention I crave from people online through my art, but even then I get little to no response. 

I know I have my whole life ahead to find people to be close with, but being young and alone in such a vulnerable time feels so incredibly suffocating. Thank you for taking time to listen to my nonsense."

So I took a second to write in my car and it really got away from me. To the degree of, I think I may end up making 4 posts just to separate it but get it out. And it’ll still be excessive. Especially this first one. So, I don’t know if anyone will read this, and I really don’t blame you if you don’t. But I guess I felt like sharing. Not even sure if this is the sub to do it, but here I am. 

I don’t think I’ve ever been so lonely in my life. And the internet is not helping. I’d usually try to chat with new people, reach out to old friends, and I’ve done that but it’s not doing as much anymore. I can feel it physically. In my chest. The lack of a person. I have always wanted a person, a proper partner. And the appearance of everyone else around me having one makes it so much worse. And then there’s just nothing I can do about it. I mean, I suppose I could, but I’ll always have these excuses to not what with how I’ve no time to develop a relationship and with this pandemic I can’t very well go out all the time. I want someone to hang around me. 
My old coping methods are no longer viable. I can’t even drink, smoke, or fuck about it anymore. Any other normal time I’d drink myself drunk every night and then end the night smoking to distract myself from the bad feelings. I’d have random women over to have meaningless sex to distract myself from the lack of touch. To make myself feel valuable. But with my dad staying with me I cannot have random women over or drink every night. And trying to get a new job I can’t smoke. And I know, I know this is for the best. That this is healthier cutting out those poor coping methods. And I’m glad for that, truly, I hope I stick with the healthy option after this period of time passes. But the truth is, that it leaves me with nothing to do but feel these feelings and I don’t fucking want them. This feeling sucks and I’d much sooner just do anything to distract from it."

Growing up I had friends, not a lot and I wasn’t a popular kid at all, but I had friends to hangout with all throughout my teenage years. I moved to a different country and that’s when the falling out started to happen. But what hurts me the most is the one closest to me, whom I considered a bestfriend, stopped talking to me. I’ve reached out a few times and we were supposed to meetup when I went back for vacation, and she stopped responding to me. I’ve known her since we were kids and I miss her and her friendship. 

I’m feeling lonely and it sucks to be feeling this way esp in my 30s when I should have my life together, but what is life when there’s no one to share life with, to talk to, to ask for advice, to just be there?

lonely,It’s just me and my dog,"It’s just me and my dog - I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. My head is a mess right now but I just need to spill it out so I sleep a bit better at night.

So first of all I’m 21, I’ve always been “the shy kid”, “the quiet one”. Never really had a lot of friends or someone to hold my hand. It’s really hard for me to actually make friends. But it wasn’t until recently that it downed on me how lonely I actually am. 

My 2 closest friends(known them for 10+ years), hell I even considered them “best”, have a lot more fun without me. I can clearly see that when they leave me out of conversations like I’m not even there, laugh at inside jokes. When I’m not invited to hang out with them. It’s silly but people still make separate group chats. And I happened to find that out the hard way. The audacity to even call it “The Traitors”. 
What hurts me the most is that they know they’re my only friends, they know I have barely anyone else to talk to, and they still choose to not include me in things, to not answer my messages for days but hang out with their other friends instead. 
I don’t want to judge them, I just want to know why? What did I do wrong? Why everyone eventually gets bored of me and just leaves?

In the end it’s just me and my dog. I spend my whole days with him. I’ve talked to him more than I’ve ever talked to anyone. He’s the only one keeping me sane when everything else in my life slowly falls apart. He means the world to me.

(I just don’t like going over there, it can feel toxic sometimes). I don’t have romantic relationships, nor have I ever had one, even though I desperately crave “the one.” I go through life completely alone and it’s very very hard. I have depression and anxiety. The anxiety prevents me from getting too close to people, and the lack of connection to people fuels the depression. I’m so overwhelmed and I have no idea how to escape this. I’m a 29 year old single gay man, I should be having the time of my life but instead I’m suffering in silence miserably at home by myself.

The world isn't perfect, but it would be a little better if we talked to each other, so I'm here if you need to talk and if it feels like there is no one."
lonely,I don't know what to do anymore.,"I don't know what to do anymore. - Hello, my name is Arthur, I used to post a bit here last year. I though I was ""cured"" that I was feeling better.
Thoose times are hard. Not only because of pandemic but because of my stress, family, exams and social relationships.

This year is the year, I'm going to pass my exams.

Firstly, pandemic. Everyone must be living this. Every time I watch TV there is that shit. I know we have to keep up with the news. But here, in France, a lot of people don't know/want to wear masks. This makes me upset (sometimes makes me cry) I stay at home during week ends, wear masks and use disinfectant.
This makes me upset because a lot of people died and a lot more are suffering because of their lack of understanding for others.

My family is pretty much good. They love who they think I am, they try to make me feel happy. But Somehow they are a bit too ""old"" what I mean is that they don't exactly respect LGBT people (I'm not a SJW don't insult me pls) I'm bisexual, I wanted to be a ""trap"" for thoose who knows what it is. Puberty came and fucked everything. I wanted to make my coming out. I was ready to leave all. But with my father calling gay people ""fagots"" ""false men"" I'm just scared.

I'm what you can call an introvert. I only talk on discord (heh) I stutter in real life and Blush when someone talks to me. I imagine many things with them( not horny '-') I imagine all possibilities that can imagine at any time and I think it makes me anxious. Somehow I think i look creepy because of others reactions when they see me.

I'm a stressed boy, emotionally unstable. This stress makes me sick. I work so much for my exams that I can puke. I'm tired but I can't sleep. Tomorrow (the 1st of ferbruary) is Monday, I'm gonna wake up at 5am and come back at 7pm. I'm gonna be alone for all the day like all other days...

I'm used to it...



Sorry if what you read just make you think I'm a stupid weirdo.

If you want to talk with me.. Sure.. Pls do.."

I don't know why but people just seem to drift away from me at a faster rate than they do other people and its kinda hurting my soul."
lonely,"I am not alone per say, but I am very lonely","I am not alone per say, but I am very lonely - I have friends, I have a family, but I'm just always in this state of loneliness that really bothers me. 


Most friends so far have been acting as a profile pictures to tell jokes to. We don't hang out often, if at all, and we don't speak of anything that actually matters. 
I don't message them when I'm down, when I'm sad, which is often, I have no one to talk to


And I'm here, still a teenager, wasting away my time to do stupid shit, here in my room either drawing or playing games, alone as always. 


I would pay everything I have to just pick up a friendship that leads me somewhere


A friend I could message when I'm down, and live actual life experiences with. I want to do what adults can't because they are mature. I want to just start walking with someone for days and see where we end up. 

Want to talk with someone on top of a hill about something that matters a second and then some stupid shit the next. 

And I don't know how much of this Is understandable I'm not gonna double check if what I wrote makes sense because I'm drunk and tired

This is super specific anyway so I doubt it means something to someone."

I spend my entire time in front of my PC playing games, and now playing games isn't fun at all, everything I want ist human social interaction. Since I never learned how to to that, but everyone else has, if seem Impossible to learn now at my age. Do to the lockdown, I have to work from home and I only leave my apartment once a week for grocery shopping. My life hasn't changed that much since the pandemic, but I feel like i will get insane. English isn't my native language, but since I never use my native language I am slowly forgetting words. I spent about 16 hours a day in front of my computer.

I just want to know what its like to have friends, receive a text message or to have a non work related conversation with someone... But I just cant see a way how to achieve that."

I only have a few friends and I'm always the one who has to ask them out, they never ask   me, so I don't know if they even are real friends to me. 

I'm craving  for a  relationship. My depression got much worse when I met this one  girl, we  had something going on for maybe a month until she found  someone better  than me. I don't find anyone else beautiful except her.  She is the only  one who I want to spend my life with, but I guess it'll never happen. I literally can't imagine myself with anyone else.

The thing I want most in life is that one girl, the girl who just ignores me every time I try to contact her.

I have no one else in my life except my parents and these so called ""friends""."

Additionally to pointing out all my life mistakes she NEVER praises me. Never say sorry when SHE is to blame. Last time I have heard ""good job "" from her was when I was like 9, which was very long time ago.

Honestly don't know what the point of this was, maybe I just needed to vent, but just I can't bring myself to keep trying to befriend her because in the end I know I'll mess it up somehow.

lonely,a bit of a reflection on emotions and society,"a bit of a reflection on emotions and society - I might delete this later if I feel like it. Just felt like freeing up some memory for useful thoughts.

When I was a kid I would be a lot more emotional than the average person (based on my observations then, which I still think is approximately true). This caused me to later heavily suppress my emotions. I returned to the 'average' or 'normal' level, but this eventually declined to the point where I was numb - possibly below average. 

Then I guess I learned about the whole thing about society wanting men to express their emotions more freely. I never returned to a level around normal, but following that information it increased somewhat from it's lowest point.

However, I still feel like I was too vulnerable with my emotions. The reason being that anything that I have said can be used as ammunition against me (which is obviously a very bad thing.)

My current position on my emotions (developed within the last year) is that it's alright to express them, but probably not to society - rather someone qualified to deal with this shit. I know the analogy doesn't really hold up here but: Say I had cancer: I wouldn't ask a friend to treat it but I wouldn't let it just sit there and kill me; I would see a specialist. Similarly, I would only trust my emotional state with someone who is qualified, not just any person even if they're a friend - it's too much of a potential risk.

My stance on this may change in the future, but this is the current state. Perhaps some life-changing event will make me think another way.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
lonely,"Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions(??)? Covers age, gender, interests, continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀!","Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up 👥 based on 28 questions(??)? Covers age, gender, interests, continent 🗺️ , willingness to share pictures 📷 or voice calls 📞, studying/working status and more 🚀! - Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people. It's the coolest project I've comeacross in a while (hence my posts).

**How it works:**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* Over 4000 people have joined (probably everyone is from reddit). Imagine how long it'd take you to message 40 people individually.
* Most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky you could expect a bit less.
* It'll save you a bunch of time!

**What are the questions:**

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Sounds sketchy?**

A few people have concerns about the above - but you can (and probably should be anyway) be completely anonymous if you choose - just use throwaway contact info. And also there is a very simple and short privacy policy as well. And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**\*\*Okay woohoo lets do this!\*\***  
The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**\*\*Final tips:\*\***

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* [/u/finder\_of\_the\_humans](https://www.reddit.com/u/finder_of_the_humans/)/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)"

lonely,LDR - bf is DACA and I don't live in the US,"LDR - bf is DACA and I don't live in the US - I'm 25F. I met someone online that I started dating for a bit...we hit it off immediately, and grew extremely close. He was everything that I ever wanted in someone...kind, sweet, caring, and so much fun to be with. I fell hard for him. 

But he's a DACA recipient...and I'm not from the US. Which means he could never come down here. I'm someone who never does well with LDRs and I even told him this. But he was sure we would work it out. But all his solutions of course involved me packing my bags and going over to meet him. 

Now I come from a conservative family where travelling overseas is a tough thing to convince my family of. Not only that, but work schedules don't allow for extended holidays either. Even if I got the chance to travel, it would never be anytime soon. I expressed these concerns to him, and he just flipped on me and said I was selfish. I know it sounds like I'm making excuses...but to me it felt like he was just sitting back and expecting me to do all of the work knowing I have my family and job to handle. 

So I broke up with him as I was hurt and clueless. Did I do the right thing? Is there any other way it could have worked?"

lonely,Looking for someone interested in voice conversation over Skype or TextNow - you can remain anonymous,"Looking for someone interested in voice conversation over Skype or TextNow - you can remain anonymous - I'm not sure I will find what I'm looking for, but I'm basically looking for a friend who enjoys phone/voice conversations.

Most of the friends I know just text me, but never call and I'm too shy to call them.

I'm just a guy in my 20s who graduated from college and now working full time.

I have weekends off, but most people I know are really busy on weekends.

You don't even have to show your face, if you are shy. I just want someone to have meaningful voice conversation with.

Open to men and women of any age, race, nationality, etc...

Just be polite and respectful is all that I am really looking for.

I like talking about movies, music, and books.

I also really like computers/technology and some video games.

I like meaningful conversations (so someone who just replies with ""Ok"" ""Great"" ""Cool"" all the time without saying much else probably won't really work.

I live in Ottawa, Canada so I prefer someone close to my timezone, but I might be open to people in other timezones farther away

We can just talk using Textnow or Skype so your phone number can remain anonymous

I don't expect long conversations, but maybe 15 minutes to 30 minutes.

If anyone is interested, please reply to this post or PM me.

Cheers!"

Well everyone has that one girl in class who doesn't talk a lot or being with her headphones all day... One of them is me.

I'm 17, and I don't have friends. I spend most days by myself. Even though I'm kinda introvert person, I really need that social time at least two hours in a week. I'm not a group person.... I tried to connect with other teens and I found myself out or being out very soon. I know I shouldn't say that I'm weird but I'm actually weird.

I like writing songs, creating worlds and countries and I usually think about the future most of the time. I imagine a lot... It's like I'm living in my own world which is full of weird stuff I created. I even created characters, and I like getting into them. In my free time I write, read books, watch tv shows and imagine.... It made me feel like I'm not living in the here and now, so when I try to go out and talk with people who don't know me, they might think I'm closed/arrogant or cold. You know teenagers judge a lot so I lose a lot in this ""game"". When I found teens and got involved with them, I didn't know what to say or when, my social skills are not developed enough. Teens in my town usually jokes about.... You know.... And love stuff which I don't... When I tried to talk with them in a deeper way they changed the subject. It's all about joking about childish stuff and insulting each other to feel better with themselves, and I don't like playing as a fake friend. All I want are three - four real friends. You know my dream is to be a screenwriter, Christopher Nolan style, I like complicated phycologisy scripts and writing them. I like working hard for my future, but I'd also like to have some friends to talk to, friends with similar hobbies. Even on the internet... I want to feel protected and cared and loved.... I want to feel important to people... I guess that's why I want to be a screenwriter - to be known for what I'm good at but also in the background... Have you ever felt like me? Is it going to change? Cause I lost my intuition... I'm full of feelings and fear about the future... I just want to talk and laugh and have fun with others, without feeling weird or not included. What do you say?

Btw, English is not my native language so sorry about the mistakes...."

I am tired of hoping that maybe one day this will change. I am tired of people telling that it will come for me too without anything ever happening. I was sick before of the fact that no matter where i went there wouldn't be anyone with at least a shred of intelligence, elegance or kindness. I would frantically look for her in the corners of bars, in libraries, in shops, in the streets and even among the mindless masses of mongrels that you would find at your average party or meaningless social event. I searched for the one right for me everywhere until the virus came and even the slightest glimmer of hope was stolen from me. Now i pass my days as an empty husk. Before i didn't know where to look, now i don't even know if i'll ever have the privilege of doing so again.

I don't want to be like this anymore. I want to be happy. I have so much love to give i really do. I know that maybe i am simply not deserving of such things but i just can't even deal with the possibility of having no one by my side. I just want a chance."

lonely,Wanting to forget,"Wanting to forget - Hey everyone, I have never posted on Reddit before but after a while I thought fuck it I need to get it off my chest especially since I don't have a therapist though it's pretty clear I need one. Basically all my life I've always wanted to be popular and like my brother and go to parties and be the centre of attention and all that jazz. I've always wanted to be loved by someone romantically, but no one has ever shown interest and honestly I'm too afraid because I've seen so many relationships crumble in my life, most importantly my parents'.

Anyway, I've never really gotten so much attention until I entered Polytechnic (it's a grade in Singapore, I'm currently doing animation) and that's where I've met a really cool group of people and they all seem to enjoy being around me because I'm loud and unafraid to make jokes or say dumb shit. But there's this girl, I have the same name as her, and for a year I've really gotten close to her because she's showered me with so much love and attention. She's the first in my life to care so much, to validate my feelings, to send me memes daily. She will make sure if I'm ok, we both have Maladaptive Daydreaming, and she's let me be part of her family since mine is so shit sometimes. I've come to realise I see her as a God whose moods affect mine. Whenever she sends a meme I get so excited. But unfortunately she has frequent unannounced mood swings (where she won't talk to me for days), she doesn't like sharing anything that's on her mind, she doesn't regard me as a close friend, and she always says nevermind lol when I ask about something she seems to be concerned about. I always make sure to give her space and ask if she's ok when appropriate, and always send her memes to let her know that I'm there. It just makes me really sad to see that I've ended up falling in love with someone just for them to see me as just another person.

Just to note I'm currently on hormone medication so I may be really out of it, but am I being really selfish? For wanting someone to share about life as much as I have? For someone to just trust me as much as I've trusted them?I've gone weeks being sad about this, and sometimes, also because of family problems, I just want to overdose on something if I could ever get it and never wake up again. I've been really emotional and moody my whole life (idk if it's an underlying mental problem) but I'm not suicidal, I want to achieve lots with my career in art and baking. But I feel like, if that doesn't go well, I may as well just go. But yeah, does anyone feel the same struggle of wanting to just completely forget an experience or just close themselves off completely, so that they don't have to worry about meeting someone, loving them too much, then realising you're just another person to them? And maybe I can talk to anyone here about anything, ya know, try my hand at making new friends cuz I don't usually do this stuff :D"

Just don’t have many people to talk with outside of work.. I’m a shy individual. Don’t wanna scare you away, just giving you a fair warning! I’m blunt and will tell you my thoughts on things if asked. If any of this interests you, or you wanna know more, message me!"
lonely,Disconnected,"Disconnected - I just feel so disconnected and alone in the world at the moment, and I'm not even sure why. It's like I'm just stuck between a rock and a hard place. It's just so hard to make friends or meet people, and create that connection that makes a fulfilling relationship. I dont even know anymore."
