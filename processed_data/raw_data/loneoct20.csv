lonely,Insomnia got me tonite,"Insomnia got me tonite - Fits of insomnia makes me wish I had people to visit and hang out with at the very least, having little to nobody to talk to the last 7 or 8 hours has been quite the drag despite being busy here on reddit.

lonely,Well apparently all my friends left me again :),"Well apparently all my friends left me again :) - I'm going through some tough times and I have moments when I feel like I need to be alone or times that I feel like I can't listen to everyone just complain about everything and tell me how much their life sucks, usually I'm listening to them and being there for them and being positive, but I can't, I just can't do that right now.

I see everyone around me leaving me and I can't do anything about it, I'm just spectating it and suffering without saying anything. Everyone has someone with me, hates me, got bored of me, etc.

Even the closest people around me are leaving me and it hurts.

But I guess I'll go over this someway or another, it's not the first time I've been alone, I'll just focus on myself and I'll be fine, hopefully.

Thanks for listening to my thoughts."

lonely,Hollow,"Hollow - This Is what I became. Oh, and lonely too. Since it's my very First personal reddit post, I'll be long. Sorry about It.

What can I say? I thought I found what they call ""the girl of your Life"". No, She wasn't. It was the only serious relationship I had. We broke, and I've been treated like garbage by everyone related to her. 
The only girl interested in me now lives in Scotland, and here in my country we're basically in lockdown. So this Is very depressing for me, because I fell for her.

But now, here's the worst part. People always define me as ""handsome and very good looking"". I've actually worked as a model too. Now, everyone always would ask as consequence: ""How can you be then Always sad, lonely, single and depressed? YoU arE HoT!1!1!!"". Well, plot twist. Being good looking Is not the golden ticket for acceptance and happiness. At all, especially if you are a boy. You always must be strong and not insecure and surrounded by fake friends. So, add all of my issues with unhuman expectations that people (especially the girls I try to date) have on me and you obtain the paradox I'm living in. 

I only have some good, real friends (and I consider them a privilege I don't even deserve). And anyway, only One of them and my brother (so, 2 persons) ask me if I feel bad or something. All of the remaining people (too many) Always reach me if they need something (both for UNI or not). I always have to be the ""cool looking chad that can't never ever be depressed or sad, because he's super good looking and funny"", but SURPRISE I am depressed and sad. I just want to be myself and find someone sincere that love me for what I am. I don't care about being the number one, I don't even have social like Instagram. I hate how our society is often merely based on looks. 

The only girl I like and that likes me back lives in another country (Scotland) and mine is basically in lockdown (Italy), so this Is making me feel even more lonely and depressed. Sorry for the wall of text..."

lonely,Hollow,"Hollow - This is what I became. Oh, and alone too. I thought I found someone special (my ex) but when we broke, everyone trated me like a pile of garbage. 
Also, my situation is huge paradox. People always define me as ""handsome"", so everyone ask ""how can you be so lonely and shy and very often single?"". Well, plot twist. Being good looking May help, but it's not a golden ticket for acceptance and happiness. At all. Especially if you are a boy. I only have some real friends (and I consider them a HUGE privilege I don't even deserve). All the remaining people only look for me when they need something (both in Uni or not). So I am not only lonely, but I also have unhuman expectations from others (I've noticed It especially when I try to date a girl). And that's depressing to see how this society Is based mainly on the looks.

But still, I'm lonely. Except for my Brother, nobody never ask me if I feel bad. Because I am the cool one, the ""chad that can't never, ever be depressed or sad"". But -SURPRISE- I am. I am not a playboy. I don't even have social (like Instagram). I love to read, and get lost in tales that are not mine (but I wish were). Tales lost in times.. Nowadays Is Always about being labelled. Being the Number One. But I don't want to be the Number one. I want to be myself. Stop. 

Sorry for the wall of text. It's my first post where I write something so personal. Thank you all..."
lonely,i'm lonely on purpose,"i'm lonely on purpose - i despise myself too much to believe that i deserve to have friends, or that other people deserve to have to deal with me, so i don't let myself have friends. i'm not here for sympathy or to try to get someone to change my mind, i'm adamant on this. but being alone all the time still fucking sucks.

it's driving me crazy. i miss my friends. people aren't meant to do this. i want to have friends again. but i just can't bring myself to do it, i don't think it'd be a good idea in the end. i've been trying to numb myself to it and get used to being alone but i can't do it. i've been trying for about a year now but i'm still longing for companionship and connection. i'm gonna be this way for the rest of my fucking life aren't i. god i'm not looking forward to it."

lonely,"Why is that one day you can feel absolute and severe loneliness and emptiness and sadness from being alone in a situation, yet the next day, feel totally normal and even feeling pretty great and chill in the same exact situation?","Why is that one day you can feel absolute and severe loneliness and emptiness and sadness from being alone in a situation, yet the next day, feel totally normal and even feeling pretty great and chill in the same exact situation? - You'll feel like it like once a week or once a month, where it gets pretty bad and takes up your whole emotional state and mood for the day, and then it disappears and you interpret the same situation positively and are even enjoying it once it passes. It comes and goes in waves. Why is it like this?

I experienced this during the come-down of an acid trip, while living alone, and even when my sleep cycle gets messed up while living with others and not seeing them for a while. It'll be severe for like 12-24 hours, and then the next day, I'm back to being happy and even excited and normal. And nothing particular was done to change the situation."
lonely,What is alone?,"What is alone? - My voice right, I'm alone because I chose this. What about those connections that really meant something aren't they real enough to compare the now to the then, is it possible that people just connect with certain people. Would I be lying if I wanted those connections, what if I'm mad that I feel like I can't make that connection with someone I love. I mad because I am not able to manipulate that person to love me the way it should of came naturally. Being introvert has taught me to fake those connections but I can't do it anymore I've lost the care for a fake world. I want the real connections. I want her to love me the way she used to. It was different then not a textbook bond it was my soul on fire and it lived through her eyes. Skeptical of the world but accepted life as precious.i hope she never changes and everyone see her for exactly what she is......"

lonely,Acceptance,"Acceptance - I think I have finally come to accept my loneliness. I am comfortable with being alone and keeping my own company. I tried to put my self out there, I have tried to let people approach me and broaden my perspective. Yet nothing changed, except my self. 

I guess some people are destined to be alone, and not have relationships. Whether it be romantic or not. I am one of those people. I enjoy time to myself almost all the time. I prefer doing things solo. I am in a sense, a lone wolf. I’ll be fine. It’s comforting knowing I tried my best, and succeeded at something."
lonely,Sometimes I miss my abuser.,"Sometimes I miss my abuser. - I left an abusive ex over 2 years ago. I still miss her. I’m still lonely 

My brain is cruel. These negative intrusive thoughts aren’t just self depreciation. They constantly remind me that for a few brief moments in that relationship I was happy.

I tricked myself into loving her and was happy. Now I can’t stop thinking about her smile, her laugh, holding her, hearing about her day. I miss it so much it hurts sometimes. 

Occasionally I can convince myself that the hitting, name calling, emotional turmoil, and suicide threats were worth it to be happy in those brief moments.

God I’m so lonely I’d take abuse over this."

lonely,I really just dislike my personality and have nothing to say to anyone,"I really just dislike my personality and have nothing to say to anyone - Sorta just venting, but I just really hate the fact that I struggle to talk to people or keep up a conversation. I mean I know I can be funny, witty, and kind but what’s the use if no one ever gets to find that out. I’ve probably got anxiety, but I just feel that I’ll never be able to form relationships because I’ll bore everyone I meet, make them uncomfortable, or just not interest them. I’m not sure if I’m just genuinely very uninteresting, or just hesitant in everything I say, but I just can’t help but feel I am god awful at talking to people. I know I lack confidence, but it’s seems impossible to build on if I feel I can’t talk to anyone. Even with friends I feel like I’m in a constant race to be interesting or funny so they won’t leave me or dislike me."
lonely,Insert title here I guess?,"Insert title here I guess? - I’m so tired of feeling like this. My head hurts and I can feel myself wanting to cry. All I want is a friend in real life. Most of the people I thought I could count on have shown zero interest after my reaching out multiple times. These are people I’ve known for years, and most of them even know I have depression which makes it a little more painful when they never reply.

I’m a touchy person and I love physical affection and I am practically dying. It’s happened twice now that I meet someone online, we text, plan to meet up, talk on the phone... and then I get ghosted. It gets harder and harder to convince myself I’m not the problem.

lonely,Guess I’m not any woman’s type huh,"Guess I’m not any woman’s type huh - I’ve never been the best looking or in the best shape either, but I usually always thought that at the end of the day all that would of mattered was what kind of person I was.  To be honest I’m not the most social person, I’m super shy, socially awkward, and am overweight (kinda like a stereotype basically) once you get past all that I consider myself a chill guy, nothing special ya know, I usually kept to myself during my high school years cause I was nervous as hell to initiate a conversation myself.
Anytime any girl at school would talk to me I’d be so nervous that half the time I’d just have single word responses during the conversation, even when prom came around I didn’t have any confidence to ask any girl if they wanted to go with me cause I usually just tell myself “Who’d want to go to prom with someone like me” i didn’t even tell anyone that I was having thoughts like this because then I might get asked out by a girl who felt sorry for me which I honestly didn’t want to deal with.
There were a few girls during my school career that I had crushes on but either they already had boyfriends or girlfriends (yes you read that right) or they were a total slut and wasn’t worth the drama that come with getting involved with them. Even after HighSchool whenever I would go out to hang with my friends there was one time that a few girls walked up to me and talked to me, I don’t know how I was able to keep conversation with them but afterwards one of them gives me her phone number, at the time I didn’t really know what to think but it wouldn’t last as I would come to find out that they wanted to get me to buy them things and swindle me out of a few hundred dollars buying them things at the mall where my friends and I went to hang out.
Don’t even get me started on Online dating, when someone would match with me and I try to start the conversation only for them to unmatch me and it honestly irritates me like if you don’t like what you see on my profile why even match with me in the first place.

You know that saying that people say “There’s someone out there for everyone” well I’m convinced that there’s no one for me and you can’t convince me otherwise as I’m pretty sure I’m not any woman’s type of guy."

I’ve done practically everything I can think of. I don’t even enjoy the things I used to anymore. They’re just boring. A close friend has completely abandoned out relationship for seemingly no reason. Anyone else I talk to eventually stop of course. They have their own lives to worry about. But it goes for months at a time. I could talk to literally nobody if I stopped trying. I don’t want to keep trying honestly. I’m sick of it and to still be so damn alone. And then I try to talk about it to friends but that never gets anywhere. Just the “oh yea I miss you... it’s been so long... sucks cuz I’m busy with x or y”. Life happens. And I’m working on my own just the same. But these people have... people. When they’re down. Or even everyday someone to talk to. Me. I have nothing. I don’t even like myself.

lonely,Not sure if this is the right place for this but here it goes,"Not sure if this is the right place for this but here it goes - Me (M) 26 
Her (F) 20

We met on tinder, and talked for about two weeks before we set up a first initial “date” not really a date, more of an ice breaker. She had told me of her past and how other guys had taken advantage or did things to her without her consent and me being a hopeless romantic, wanted her to be absolutely comfortable with me so I made zero moves the first time we met. We talked for another two weeks, and she came over and stayed the night. I took her on a big fancy date, and we ended up doing things that night. Of course I fall head over heels for her, I mean I felt stuff with this girl I hadn’t felt in years... and I wake up the next day to the dreaded “I’m still in love with my Ex, goodbye.” Text. 

I had never been so depressed in my life because I genuinely thought the world of this girl. She is everything I had ever wanted in a significant other. BUT, I started eating better, hitting the gym 3 times a week, got a new tattoo and have tried looking for the next potential. 

Fast forward to Tuesday this week, she messaged me telling me her ex cheated on her. 
I am trying so hard, to not tell her that I still think she’s the one and that she should give me a real chance. But, a part of me knows that it would be backtracking. I made all this progress and changed so much in my life, to just throw my self worth in the garbage to go back to someone who treated me like an option. I don’t want to be the one to message her, I want her to message me. To admit she’s at fault, that way I could be the so called “goaltender”. You know like, “Well if we try again this, these and those will have to happen.” But I really don’t think she will message me and Im finding myself begging whatever power rules over us to send her a sign to message me. Whether it be a dream, or a random pop up thought. I want her back but I don’t want to be the one to pursue that. Is that toxic? Crazy? What if she never messages me? 

I know I would technically be better off moving on and keep grinding on myself but, damn. I really want to be with this girl. So I’ll just let it eat away at me until I either become numb to it, or find someone else who makes me feel the way she did."

lonely,"""no real close friends""","""no real close friends"" - Someone had recently said that ""[I] seem like a someone who wants to be friends with everyone but in reality, have no real close friends"".

Took a second to set in but that really hurt. That second was me thinking about what had just been said to me and realizing how true it was. Yes, I wish the best for everyone I meet and truly want to be friends with them. Yes, it is also true that I have no one to hit up randomly at any hour of the day/night to talk about things when I'm feeling down. Nor do I have friends who'd call me when they're down, despite the fact that I've always tried my very best to notice when they were sad and then make them feel better. 

But I guess it wasn't good enough and that hurts. That comment is not something that I haven't thought about myself but for someone else to say it, someone who doesn't even know me that well - that hurts, cause when I think about it myself, then there's always the hope that I'm overthinking. But when someone else notices it then that's already reality."

I also selfsabotage without even noticing it at that moment, whenever somebody is interested in me, be it as a friend or dating, i push the person away, which i think is due to me basicallly having the feeling like i have no worth to another person, so in fear of being rejected after the person spends some time with me, i cut them off before it happens. The only person in my life i can somewhat truly open up to is a childhood friend i have known for basically my whole life, and even he doesnt know about me being depressed and having suicidal thoughts for years.

I have a few people i hang out with while at university, but i wouldnt really call them friends, we dont hang out outside of university and again its only ultra surface level conversation that feels robotic and i feel like its only a metter of time before they stop hanging out with me."

lonely,depressing to be around,"depressing to be around - 
just gonna post a brain splurge because I just can’t get my mind off this. 

I’m 14 and I have just started highschool. I’m not very social. I don’t really talk to people, and the only person I know that I would consider a close friend doesn’t have any classes with me in school this year and we don’t live close to each other. so I was eating breakfast with him before class starts in the cafeteria and he was telling me about something and then one of his friends came over that I’ve met before but don’t know very well. she and him start talking and it’s cool but then some weird subjects get brought up, I dunno how to say this the right way but relationships and sex kept getting brung up. I mentioned that we were all like really young to be doing shit like having sex and they pretty much react with “well yeah but like no”

so the conversation continues and they talk about friends, people they know and I’m just sitting here, only knowing the one dude in front of me and at some point we were talking and I mentioned I didn’t really have any friends aside from him. I barely even talk outside of talking to him at breakfast. and his friend looks at me and tells me that I’m super depressing. I just say “yeah, I know.”

I always kinda told myself that, I’m 14, the lack of social life I have is probably normal. but talking to that friend’s friend made me kinda realize just how much I didn’t know about... well, having friends I guess. knowing people. even the one friend, I don’t feel like we’re that close and I don’t feel like I know him that well. I never realized just how isolated I have made myself by being so antisocial. 
she just looked me in the eyes, and straight up told me “dude, you are really fucking depressing.”

lonely,I have no choice but to be alone and feel lonely. How do i cope with this?,"I have no choice but to be alone and feel lonely. How do i cope with this? - Hi!! Thank you for taking the time to read this post. The title covers the point but to elaborate further:

I'm a 19F and i have 4 close friends, I have never been in a romantic relationship ever and i dont see myself finding anyone like that anytime soon. I also can't go to my parents about anything bcz our relationship isn't comfortable enough for me to express my feelings, unfortunately. 

I also dont feel like going to the friends i have with my problems bcz 2 of them are not ppl i can go to with my emotions and feelings. And going to the other 2 makes me feel like I'm bothering them and that I'm wasting their time. Ofc my logical side says otherwise but i just can't stop feeling this way. Not to mention i cant visit them due to covid or even otherwise bcz we live an hour away from each other.

I have tried finding ppl online to date, which brought nothing. I'm currently trying to get friends online but I'm not expecting much and I'm not gonna be forcing anything to happen either. 

I have  realised that all i can do is survive being alone and feeling lonely for the time being. But for the last month, I've been crying myself to sleep almost every single day, and i just want to hug someone or just hold someone's hand to know that I'm not alone and that ppl do care about me. But everytime i want that, i also think i deserve none of that affection from anyone and asking that of someone is extremely selfish. 

So if anyone has any advice on the way they cope with feeling lonely, and having no one else make them feel less lonely, it would be very much appreciated. 

Thank you for making it this far if you did!!"

lonely,Why do everyone have a problem with me even before knowing me???,"Why do everyone have a problem with me even before knowing me??? - Hi. I am 22M from South India and new to reddit. I did not spend much time home. I went a school in North India where I was not accepted among the locals for ‘I dont know what’ reasons. When I asked a guy there he said “South Indians are generally gross and have bad intentions”. I never had a single friend. 

Then I did my college abroad (USA) and people there avoided me. I tried to ask a person there and he told, “Almost 95% of the Indians gross and sick people”. I have seen many people from my country have a great social life anywhere. 

I have never had any experience of friendship or dating with any country people. Just because I am born with a creepy face I am being treated like I am something that makes them vomit.

I wanted to give one last try and landed on reddit. I tried to meet some people on different subs. I made few posts and absolutely no response. Sent out some messages and guess what, “I am not looking for anything with Indians” is the response. Tried to chat with some people without mentioning my origin. One girl chatted with me for a few hours. It was going great. She asked a picture and I sent. She asked “Are you from India?” And I got ghosted. Also I find number of posts saying, “Indians dont bother messaging I wont respond”. 

I give up. I dont want a social life ever."
lonely,I feel so sad.,"I feel so sad. - I’m pretty much always alone. I moved to Idaho from California, where I used to have so many friends, I’d go to concerts/parties, was always in the company of others and I felt loved.

Now I have no friends, I have a roommate but he’s always at his girlfriend’s, he pretty much is there every day and night, so I never see him.

I started this job and a woman I work with is so attractive and I’m in love with her personality. I listen to her when she has issues and give her advice. Her most recent issue involved a guy she was seeing but wasn’t into him. I gave her some advice that she should break up with him sooner than later because it would be harder for both of them if it’s dragged on.

On Sunday she says she’s finally ready to do go through with it, and afterward she invites me out for a drink. We meet up and I decide I’ll buy her some congratulatory drinks because she’s single and not with someone she doesn’t want to be with anymore. We’re having a great time and she says I can go back to her place. 

I’m there for maybe ten minutes then randomly she says she wants to sleep alone just in case her ex pops by as to not look bad, I agree and head home.

Today she asks advice saying someone used her for sex, saying she thought it’d be more but just wasn’t and was let down. I ask when out of curiosity and she says Sunday. So after we have a good time out she kicked me out randomly to have some guy come over.

I sometimes have the feeling she likes me, but that confirmed to me she doesn’t. After finding that out I had an overwhelming feeling of depression, she’s pretty much my only friend and I thought it would become something more, because if it did I thought it would really turn my life around for the better.

I’m always alone, I have no true friends in my life besides her. I have an ex that constantly wants to use me for sex, but nothing beyond that. The mixture of constant loneliness, being used, my family being distant and not talking to me, and the validation that I’m not anything to her caught up to me. 

All I can think about is how I don’t want to live this kind of life anymore."
lonely,True friends and graduations,"True friends and graduations - I have always been afraid of sharing my feelings or being overly trustful of people, to the point where I barely exist in my friendship group. Like I'm kind of the background character to the friendship and that my presense is nothing more than a number. As much as I complain about it, I'm weirdly complacent with my position as I realised that its the only spot left for me.

Besides that though, Inside the group there are 2 people that I feel I can genuinely call them my best friends, where I can talk to them on the regular and goof around with them and what not. Obviously there are other 'friends' but its like we only talk during school and thats it, with the basic small talk and thats all, where we ask eachother for stuff, but never meet up or play games or anything.

But highschool graduation is coming soon and its become well known that all types of relationships in highschools dont last. This just makes me sad that I will lose the only 2 true friends that I have.

PS: I just wanted to get this off my chest. I know this doesnt really fit r/lonely sorry."
lonely,Never had any close friend,"Never had any close friend - I didn’t make a single close friend during my existence. It’s hard to not think there is something wrong with me, that respels people.

I am quite reserved but once I get to know someone, I can talk a lot. I don’t feel really listened to even though I always tried to listen to others.

Like I have some friend, but I feel like I am always a second choice. For example, in a group of friend they almost all text one-on-one but never with me (unless they need something)

The only close friends i have are my brothers and sisters but even though I always thought that we wouldn’t have been friends if we were strangers.

Almost everyone I know is into things I couldn't get into. Anime, K-pop, LoL, sports, youtubers, that sort of stuff. I just couldn't get into those no matter how hard I try and it's getting lonely pretending that I do. I just want someone to sit down with in real life and talk about SCPs and creepypastas or just play Minecraft with.

lonely,Missed my chance,"Missed my chance - A few years ago I took a friend of 5 years out on a day trip. We went to a small town near where we live. When I asked her to go we never said whether or not it was a date. I’m not sure what it was. Or if she liked me back. Maybe I was too scared she didn’t share the same feelings. 

We had a good time. Walked around trails, got ice cream. I took her back to my house and introduced her to my parents. They really liked her. That was maybe the happiest I’ve been. At least in a long time. I was so nervous though, couldn’t even make proper eye contact. 

A few days later she came to my house again. I made her dinner and we watched a movie. After the movie finished she had to go to an eye doctors appointment. I haven’t seen her since then. It’s been almost 2 1/2 years. We still talk sometimes. She seems happy. Moving up in the world at her job. I’m in school, and busy. Our lives are moving in separate directions. Maybe one day we will meet up again. Who knows.

I wouldn’t normally post anything like this but I feel safe to do so because I don’t think she has reddit. Anyways, I guess the point is don’t let things just pass you by."
lonely,Losing all my friends in 2020.,"Losing all my friends in 2020. - 2020 was supposed to be the best year of my life but it turned out being one of the worst... I Lost all my friends, my job and a crap ton of money.

2020 was supposed to be a fantastic year I had a trip to Italy planned with friends for March break and a trip for Greece in the summer. Of course none of those things happened and I actually ended up losing a lot of money for Unrefunded bookings. I’m not normally one to be down in the dumps for long so I tried to pick myself up and look on the bright side... at least I still had a job and friends. Turns out 2020 wasn’t done yet and I lost my job because the company went under, and let me tell you looking for a new job has been a lot harder than expected. I was okay with this because I thought I still had my friends to rely on. 

A few months ago this facade of friendship came crashing down, I never would have imagined, in my wildest nightmares, the way my world of friendship came crashing down.  I always thought These girls were my life long friends, the 4 of us used to spend every possible second together. So as I was saying, everything changed. It was 10:00 at night and i was just about to get in the shower as 2 of my good friends called, H and W. W sounded frantic on the phone, like she was on the brink of tears and they insisted on coming over. So I quickly got dressed and invited them inside. When we sat down W told me that my best friend, let’s call her L had raped her sometime during the summer and that she was going to press charges. I was repulsed by someone who used to be my best friend and i felt horrible that something like that could happen to my friend W. I instantly cut ties with L because I couldn’t even look at her the same knowing what she had done. You would think the story ends here but it doesn’t... and i hate that I’ve managed to feel sorry for myself when W is the victim. 

Over the course of the next few months W and H got a lot closer, and slowly started excluding me from going out with them. At first I thought nothing of it because I was still invited if I was driving somewhere or if I was buying or they needed me to get something from L’s house (I was the only person who had contact with her roommates to get things).... obviously in hindsight I can see that I was being used. I noticed we were drifting apart and after having lost one friend because she turned out to be a horrible person I couldn’t let that happen again. 
So i started to reach out to H and W asking to hang out and go places, but they always had reasons why they couldn’t... I’m swamped with uni, I have work etc. I tried to give them the Benefit of the doubt but when I opened Instagram or Snapchat a few moments later it was loud and clear on their story that they were together, at a place I suggested we hang out.  

This took a while to sink in but I’ve taken the hint and I know that I just don’t fit into the friendship anymore. So with the last of my friends gone, I have no one left. I have no job, I have lost so much money and now I’ve lost my only friends. 

I don’t know what to do... COVID makes it impossible to o just go out and make new friends, not to mention im at a point in my life where it seems like everyone has already found there friends. 

Im really struggling with feeling sad and lonely in these times, I feel worthless, overly dependant and like a terrible friend. open to ANY advice... did I handle this situation wrong? Any tips on making friends while dealing with social distancing measures..."

like dude, i'm literally asking for a yes or a no, not a ""sure."" so i was like okay but do you want to be friends, and he said ""we can be friends but just don't expect to see a whole lot of interaction from me""

No one ever reached out and they all turned out to be bigots (homophobic, racist, etc) except for one. I thought high school would be better but I haven’t had the chance to really talk with anyone, partly because of covid. 

On top of that I used to be a straight A student. But now I’m failing like half of my classes. My mental health is so bad right now and when I realized I felt lonely, like real fuckin lonely, I couldn’t care less about anything. I can’t take school or myself seriously.

lonely,can you hear the howl of a lone wolf? she knows she can walk alone or walk along a pack that help her. she can walks in the moon light. or she can walk in the sands with a pack.,"can you hear the howl of a lone wolf? she knows she can walk alone or walk along a pack that help her. she can walks in the moon light. or she can walk in the sands with a pack. -   She found out years ago, walking alone can be the hardest thing a young girl can do. But she knows that maybe it is the best for her at the time.

She has a hard time trusting people that tend end up hurting her. As, she walks alone, she finds the power that a princess she can be. she walks in with the shadows of her soul. So, she can have daydreams instead of nightmares of darkness.

She is not like every other woman. She is different she can survive on her own. Even when others doubt her, or she even when she doubts herself.   

She has been through death, stabbed hearts, pain, and mistakes. She knows dealing with it herself can turn out to be a lonely life. But what is the point of waiting for people to help her out. Where there is no possibility of getting what she needs. 

But the worst thing is to wait for something/someone that will not come. she does her best to go through life with her shadows. She knows she can climb the mountains that life gave her. She knows moving forward is worth it in the end. Even if she must walk alone for a while. 

She can show the world what she is made. The strength she has in her soul. The right people will show up without her knowing. She always used to be alone and helping herself. Which has been hard for her to let people come in. But sometimes she thinks the “right people” are her friends or lover, but after awhile the relationships or friendships turn into a toxic waste land of hopes and dreams lost. 

She knows there can be people out there that can understand her qualities. There will be people that admire her golden heart. Over the years she has her moments that bring out how strong she is. The strength she can see to herself she can only understand in her own mind. Finding ways to keep her strength that has been stolen by the cruel world.  She knows deep down she can do it even if she must do it alone. 

In her soul she knows she is born to help others, even if it weakest her soul. But she questions is it worth it? Helping everyone she loves and cares for. She has her break downs. It makes her stronger. she has trouble letting people help her out. She is born to LEAD her own wolf pack of misfits like her. She remembers she needs to be the wolf climbing the hill, and she finds the highest level she can take herself. She must learn to stop living in the past, it does not help. It just makes the scars open again. She always tries to live in day by day. 

It is much easier to walk alone in the right direction, then following the heard in the wrong. She figures out now that her destiny is in her own hands. She has to learn to hunt for what she wants no matter how many people tell her “ you can do that, you have epilepsy” or a learning disability which has haunted her for many years. She is loved by many. She things herself as a wolf. Because a wolf can walk in the moon light alone or walk in the sands of a pack."

lonely,Where else can I be vulnerable?,"Where else can I be vulnerable? - It's a bit hard to be open about feeling lonely or sad. Especially when all I can find are social situations where it doesn't make sense to be sad or lonely.  


I haven't had a conversation where it's felt okay to be vulnerable in months. And they were rare even before the pandemic.  


I'm glad spaces like this, but to be very frank: how can this measure to a face-to-face conversation with someone you feel like is listening to you?  


If you're here in this space I hope that you're moving forward and that you're able to find the people and conversations to help lift you out of whatever might be making you feel lonely.  


Good luck."

I’m in bed, probably going to fall asleep in the next 30 minutes (it’s 11:14pm here which is a miracle because I’ve also suffered from insomnia forever). I wanted to share something that i just thought to myself, and it made me so happy and it sounds so small, but made me realize i have made real progress for the first time in my life.

“I’m so grateful to have friends, pets, and a job I love.”

I feel better, comfortable, and less hindered when alone, but I know full well life isn't meant to be lived alone. Broken.

Whenever something happens in my day good or bad she’s the first person I think to tell, and then it hits me like a train. My heart breaks every time.

I try and distract myself with porn or games or something but everything reminds me of her, I can hardly even masturbate anymore because I just end up sad looking at the love I see on my screen and remembering all the memories we had in our short time together through rose tinted glasses.

They say healing takes time but how much time, because I can hardly breathe without her. I miss her so much."

The only women, the total number of which I can count on my hand, who have considered me or even wanted me are either unemployed or can’t hold a job, has kids or wants kids right away, or with the case of one woman, very bipolar and would drive me insane with how much she would flip flop between her stories and feelings.

I’m doing my best to improve myself and hopefully be capable to hold the interest of a woman who I want to be with long term.

lonely,Loneliness is making me angry. Being lonely is storing this aggression within me.,"Loneliness is making me angry. Being lonely is storing this aggression within me. - I have this pent up feeling of anger inside me now, seeing people I tried connecting with at my new school (it's a fresh start, so I've had to make new friends) now hanging out with each other and posting on their social media, makes me feel so fucking left out. It's evident, even after always being friendly, talking to them, having a laugh with them, etc, that they don't give a shit about me and already formed their new batch of friends. It's rude of them, plain rude, a lot of them are purely dicks and show so much passive aggressiveness too.  I feel so alone at school, only one close friend I have and he's from my old school, we get along so well and always hang out, he means the world to me; but man, I still wanna broaden my range of relationships and tried so hard... This group pisses me off, what did I do wrong, did I not vibe with their damn hive mind? Not in any of their chats, left alone in social scenes; loneliness makes me angry, listening to Punk Music, Punk Rap and Industrial keeps me sane but I'm just so pent up with anger. Sorry if my grammar is poor, I'm just writing down my thoughts as I go alone, I didn't intend for this to make much sense. I don't know if anyone feels the same way as me, but I'm so quintessentially lonely even if I'm surrounded by a good family with very few good old friends and the one best friend I still hang out with; but I can't fit in to any social scenes in my new school, a kid from the country going to a city school, I love the school so much and the city is amazing but why can't I vibe with the kids? Am I doing something wrong? I'm always kind, polite, mature and friendly to my peers, always have a laugh and discuss topics, but I don't fit into a group, I get along far better with adults and all the teachers love me, but it's a different story with the students...
Loneliness, causing so much anger inside me, frustration, impatience, insecurity, anxiety. Once an ougoing ambivert with many friends, I've now turned into an absolute introvert, I just want to let all my anger out.
I can manage myself happily lonely, I'm happy alone, always have been, honestly preferred being alone; being happy and being with yourself alone is a sign of intelligence, which is nice. However, human connection is still important, and I lack a social group I could rely on.
I don't know if anyone feels the same way, but being lonely and psychologically isolated makes me feel so fucking angry.
I know I have a psychological condition of some sort, I don't believe I'm mentally well. But I don't know how to define it.

I looove music, pop mostly (i know cringe)
I wouldn’t say im an ‘artist’ but i like to paint and draw, been getting into digital art lately tho.

She won’t help clean the house or anything besides dinner I give her that but she does t work or help with really anything my days off consist of cleaning/ laundry. I just am so tired I have no happiness anymore, no joy, no hobbies. I used to draw, play games, or just watch Twitch and it’s like I don’t have time anymore. The sex is so sporadic that it’s causing me to premature ejaculation with no joy in orgasming. This is why I just feel like cheating to just have 30 minutes or so for someone to just make me feel wanted or attractive in someway"

If no one does though, then I'll just busy myself with new hobbies I've picked up during quarantine. Been practicing how to draw and I've also gotten into online shopping recently (is that weird? I know it's basically been the norm for years now but I just recently started learning how to order and buy things online welp).

Anyway, hope you all are having a fantastic day/night!"
lonely,I'm glad I found this place,"I'm glad I found this place - I'm 22 and have less friends than fingers on one hand. I have a boyfriend but I don't think it would be healthy to rely on him completely for my social inclusion needs. Everytime he shows me conversations from his friend group I get so fucking jealous cause I've only ever had a group once and it all fell to pieces after I finished school.

All my friends are really busy/moved out of town so I've been feeling really isolated. Covid just made things worse. I try to be sociable at work but I just end up being really awkward cause I'm pretty introverted. And besides, everyone is so much older than me so I can't really relate to any of them. 

I sometimes glimpse at their phones while they're texting and I can see they're in group chats sharing memes and stuff. It sucks cause I wish I had that kind of stuff man. I don't even mind not hanging out right now I just wanna feel like I belong somewhere.

But then I found this place, I found you people. And I see that we're all going through the same struggle. After such a long time I finally don't feel as lonely. If anyone is up for some friendly conversation, I'm right here. We're all in this together friends."
lonely,It feels impossible to make friends..,"It feels impossible to make friends.. - Im a 17 year old male and I have literally no friends at all. Mainly because I have really severe social anxiety to the point where I have panic attacks if I’m around too many people or if I’m in a awkward 1 on 1 conversation. I used to have friends but they weren’t really friends at all just toxic people I stuck around with just so I wasn’t alone. They ended up betraying my trust and treated me like garbage so I no longer talk to them.

Now searching for actual friends it’s just impossible. I’m not even gonna try making friends in real life because I’ll quite literally give myself a heart attack. So I’m trying to make friends online through mainly Xbox one and discord. I just want a group of guys my age to socialise with every now and then so it’s not awkward and I can grow to trust and become close to them over time without being in their face too often.

On Xbox I try talking to people in gta v car meets or minecraft survival group posts but everyone’s either like 12, doesn’t have a mic, is like 40 years old or is just absurdly annoying. And it’s basically the same on any discord server. And when I try to talk to people on discord I pretty much get ignored because they’re already talking to friends and don’t want any more.

And I try so hard to push myself to talk and not be awkward and it never pays off because no ones Interested in talking. So I basically have no one at all to talk to besides my girlfriend, my sister who is always grumpy and my dad when he’s not wasted.

And It’s nice to have a girlfriend but in the end you still feel lonely asf without friends and vice versa."

I want to spoil him with love and affection, I want to sit up all night watching corny Netflix romance and cheesy 80’s horror movies. I want it, all of it.

TL;DR - Dropped out in year 10. 2 years of my life goes past, wasted. All my old schoolmates graduated, I feel like shit.."

And I still can not forget the fact that she cheated on me and we are at this point where I have left her again, coz I don't wanna get angry and beat her up or something. I just can't live with the fact that she done this to me... 

What should I do? this is really really hard since I still have some feelings left, but if we gonna get back together she may gonna do same shit in the future. How can somebody live with their bf/gf after they cheated on them right?"

lonely,Not just loneliness,"Not just loneliness - For me, yes, loneliness is a constant unwanted companion (ironic), but the thing that really gets me down is that I once had a great relationship, one I once thought was as near perfect as possible, and yet somehow, I managed to bungle it beyond recognition and repair.  Furthermore, if I had only had realized the extent of my partner's unhappiness, I would done just about anything to fix it.   By the time she told me she was done, it was too late to act.   To me it seemed like the flick of switch but she has stated it was more like the slow erosion of a boulder to grains of sand.  I really wonder how I could have been so unaware.  It literally keeps me up at nights, as it is doing now.  The regret and remorse is utter torture.  I cannot convey this enough.   The only reason I continue my existence is that I cannot abandon the children of this relationship.   It is not their fault, and they are the only connection I have left with their other parent.  I don't want to hurt them or normalize a very abnormal behavior.   I have ideation and I fantasize.

It hurts so much to know there truly isn’t anyone I connected with enough to have as a friend and now after quarantine I have lost contact with those people I knew. I’m so alone, no chances right now of going out or even meeting new people in school since everything is online. What hurts the most is seeing other people still enjoying life carefree and going out with friends. I’ll be at home bored and just watch through social media how fellow classmates are going out with friends, partying and being happy. How I wish I could at least have one friend.

I'm not expecting much because I don't think we have much in common, but I'm still proud of myself. 

I made a Bumble account (I always told myself I would never make a dating app account), and after some chatting I asked the first guy I matched with, who said no — then I asked the second guy who said yes 😆

I understand that I'm lucky to both be getting an actual date from a dating app and also to start dating in my early 20s, because I know lots of people don't start dating until their 30s. And that's okay! 

It's one of those things that is easy to obsess over when you don't have it, and it feels like an eternity without it. 
But once it happens you realise how silly you were to obsess over it, and your time without it doesn't feel even that long anymore. 💙

lonely,Before I turn 26,"Before I turn 26 - In about 2 hours, I’ll be 26 years old. Just four little years away from entering my thirties, and in hindsight, 25 has been pretty shitty to put it gently. 

I thought this was the year I’d hit my stride; the year I’d get back up on my feet after my first encounter with heartbreak, the year I’d find a job and start saving for many dreams and aspirations I want to fulfill, like traveling and buying something nice. 

Instead, this year was the one where I sank to my lowest: Sadness, anxiety, a year-long dry spell (that’s still ongoing), heartbreak, disappointment, unemployed, fear of becoming a failure, not knowing what I’ll do, still in college, putting in weight… and this myriad of misfortune was kicked off with a funeral. The funeral of someone I knew. Someone who wasn’t very close to me, but that I held in high regards. That person and their entire family, who had their lives taken away in a fire. 

I thought things would get better from then on. I went out with my brothers the following week, had a great time and told myself: I’m gonna go out more this year. I’m gonna be the very best version of myself. I’m gonna go out on dates again, and work to make me the man any girl would want. 

Yet here I am. Many months later, sitting before my TV, eating a spaghetti dinner while the hour draws nearer to declare me beyond the halfway point of my 20’s. I’m at an all-time low, and the worst part is: I know I haven’t hit rock bottom yet. 

So, to God or fate or whoever is listening: I don’t want a great, amazing year. The bar’s been set too low, and I don’t want to build up great expectations. I just want 26 to be good. Nothing special, nothing spectacular; just… good. 

I just hope that, a year from today, I won’t find myself drenched in self pity and sorrow asking for words of encouragement, but rather giving them to someone who needs them. I don’t want to be asking for a helping hand, but instead giving it to someone because I now know what it’s like to feel so abandoned, lonely, desperate and heartbroken, and I wouldn’t wish this sensation upon anyone. 

So, 26th year of my life: I don’t ask for finding love, I don’t ask for one-night stands or hookups, I don’t ask for a graduation, I don’t even ask that the Packers win the Super Bowl. 
I just want you to be less tough than 25. 

Thank you for reading my post. Have a great day!"

Contemplate the endless battle between misanthropy and the natural want for social interaction as a human. The loneliness becomes too much again."

lonely,Physically Starved (and ashamed of it),"Physically Starved (and ashamed of it) - I feel really weird posting this, and am actually not sure if it’s the right sub so if it’s not, feel free to let me know. 

I am so starved for physical affection. I’m a 26 year old man and never had a relationship, romantic or sexual. I’ve never even kissed anyone. I feel like a complete freak for never having gone through all of the rites of passage people do when growing up. If it weren’t for strip clubs, I would have had no (sexual) physical contact with anyone in my whole life. I’m both ashamed of this, and ashamed of how much I crave it. Especially lately, It feels like daggers not having that. Like it gives me small anxiety attacks seeing other people be close like that. 

I know sex and physicality isn’t everything, especially what it’s romanticized to be. And believe me, I’m very much craving the emotional side of companionship as well. But I don’t think it’s right to deny the need for physical affection either. It’s just that when I talk about it, that’s all anyone hears. “Oh, you’re just horny.” “You just want to get laid.” It’s not “just” that, but yes, that’s definitely part of what hurts so much."

I want someone to care, to ACTUALLY care how my day is going. I want someone to show up unexpectedly to my place to surprise me. And I don’t even care if this person is a boyfriend, girlfriend or just a friend. I just want someone to value me more than others for once. 

I’m starting to realize that all of my friends are happier without me in their lives. They’re better off without me. They don’t need me. I’m just another ride or the last resort to hang out with. I just want someone to want me. And if that doesn’t happen, I just want the courage to end it now. I’m not important to anybody. My mom loves me but she prefers my brother.

lonely,As I See It,"As I See It - Hey you! 

I know that there's a lot going on in the world right now and I know that you are exhausted from it all. We all are. I know that sometimes (or oftentimes) you just want to shut everyone and everything out and just get the time to catch your breath. If you ever need to do that, please do. Disappear for a while. Call in sick from work, turn off your phone, check in on a hotel by yourself, close your business for a day, sleep for an entire day,  etc. Do whatever gives you peace, even just for a day. Never underestimate the healing powers of rest and never romanticize ""busy"" as being ""productive"" or whatever the corporates call it. 

I know sometimes you just want someone to listen to you vent without judgement, and if you have a close friend or family who you can do that with? Talk to them. If not, there is a huge online community of people who have been through what you're foing through and are willing to give you advice based off on their own experiences if you're open to them. And the best part is that, you don't have to agree with what that say.

The internet is is sometimes a very scary place with very scary people. But if you know where to look, there's also a lot of good people with good intentions out there."

I just want the pain to be over but it never ends. - I really felt like she was the one you know? Like she’s the only person I have truly ever loved. I’m only in high school but that doesn’t make it hurt less. It’s been almost six months she cut me off. The last time we spoke in person I kissed her and held her in my arms. I was so happy and thought all was well. The next morning at 9 I got a text that hurt me. I read it and went fully numb. All it said was “it’s not you, it’s me” “I’m going to block you on everything so that way I don’t feel tempted” she did this because it wasent the first time it happened. We were in and out of a relationship, if you can even call it that, for three years. Something drew me toward her and I’m not sure what it was. I had a crush on her since 6th grade and it never left. Now I’m a jr who still only wants one person. All my friends are hooking up with people but when ever try to meet someone new I can’t, it’s just not her. Recently she unblocked me on Instagram and I don’t know why. Last thing she said was that she was never going to talk to me again. This confuses me so much and just makes me mad but I hate being mad at her. I want to ask her why she did this but I know that won’t help, and even if it did help, I don’t want to do that to her. She said she was done talking to me so I couldn’t do that to her. I want her back so badly but I know if I go back it’ll only make it so much worse. I guess I’m just writing this because I’m so hurt and I haven’t felt happy since that night. Everything seems grey now and I feel so fake too. My depression has never been worse but at least my arms are clean. It’s weird, everything in my life is going right besides that but nothing stops the pain. I just need help getting back to how I was. 

Thanks,

At work, at school... no one.  Even though I am nice and try to make an effort. I wonder if it’ll be like this forever. It’s been like this for 20 years. I just want to give up and take my own life. I don’t want to be alone in this world. Everyday I keep asking myself what is wrong with me. Am I that ugly? Am I that boring and uninteresting? Or am I just not meant to be happy?

Many times they are not happy even when they have someone else and take advantage of the relationship. People that are lonely for long periods of time tend to cherish the person they eventually end up with and appreciate them so much more. Work on yourself during these hard times.

I've went through some dark times in my past about 3 to 4 years ago. Almost ended everything. Literally no one checking in on me either by text or phone call or anything for 6 months. I know I could've reached out to someone but I didn't want to put my burdens on other people in my life so I didn't do that. I was literally at the end on the rope about to end everything until Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu coach of mine said: ""Hey man, haven't heard from you in awhile just checking in on you."" He was a guy, my coach who I did Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with. Didn't really know him that well but he's the one I clicked with the most in class. Came out of nowhere. I called him right after the text vented and balled my eyes out. I got the help I needed though it wasn't on my own I was at the same time. I dug myself out of the darkness. I still feel like I'm still digging but I'm seeing the light. I still feel I have a long way to go and I still feel alone. No one to talk or vent too. Its really hard for me to open up. I'm getting tired of not being able to. It's ruined relationships for me with people that I feel really cared about me. So how do any of you all go about showing love for yourself in order to love someone else?"
lonely,I’m turning sixteen in eight days and I’ve never felt lonelier.,"I’m turning sixteen in eight days and I’ve never felt lonelier. - I apologize as I’m new to this and I’m unaware how to post...

So I’ve always been more “well-known” at my school (I don’t mean that to sound egotistical). I’ve always had strong groups of friends and great connections with people. I maintained straight A’s and participated in a plethora of out of school activities (again sorry, this sounds very strong of me). However during the beginning of quarantine, life just took a turn. I developed a lot of health problems, lost a lot of friends, and just slipped on my grades (and I know grades aren’t that important, but I don’t want to disappoint my parents). I became extremely jealous and insecure and I just lost all of my progress. I developed depression and anxiety and I built a wall around myself so I couldn’t get more hurt (I also deleted all my social media which was the dumbest thing I could possibly do). Anyways, November is soon. Soon I’ll be sixteen and I feel as though I’ve accomplished nothing. I question if I should try and put myself back out there, but I don’t have anybody’s contacts and I just feel so alone. I also question why I make this idealistic birthday experience feel so big. I know people just always overhype turning sixteen and it’s like I’ll get a chance to drive a car, but it seems so necessary? When I was a child I’d always picture myself getting older and having this perfect life, and I just feel like I let my younger self down (I’m also really sorry I’m hopping on different ideas). Anyways, I don’t know if this is a cry for comfort or a small rant since I don’t want to burden my parents, but I appreciate you taking the time reading if you did. I know I’ll regret writing this tomorrow, but shit in this world is way too big so I think I’ll be alright. 

Have a great day."

When here she says
That I'm not right

The air went thin
The room would spin
And all my hopes flew up again

And there was left an empty space
And there, she said, belongs my place"

lonely,I want a boyfriend so bad. a rant.,"I want a boyfriend so bad. a rant. - I’m 21, single since birth and I’m just tired. I’m fine being on my own (okay maybe lately being single has been making me sad, only because I am just tired of life and certain things and feeling like this and I just WISH I had someone to share those things with). there are 0 prospects. I have no friends , it all seems hopeless.

and I have uni online, so even the hope that ‘oh maybe today is the day I meet this person, maybe it’ll be someone I bump into on the train’ is dead. 

I’m tired of staying home, of my life routine of these things in life. I just wish I had a boyfriend so I can spend a whole day at his place and forget about my shitty situations. Okay maybe that kind of thinking is unhealthy, but I’m just tired of so many things. 

I believe there is a time for everything, and maybe I’m too sad for it to be my time. But then there are people who meet the one at the lowest points of their lives and I just think, why can’t that be me? 

I know everyday I’m closer , I hope. But it just seems like another day I am alone. Maybe there’s no one out there for me, it just seems a bit hopeless."

Last night, I felt like crying, but as i said before, I could not (it wasn't my lonely time and I hate having to explain why I cry)., I took my xanax (even with that, i cry a little while taking my daily shower).

I went to sleep, so sad, thinking about when I was happy, finally, I fall asleep.
Usually, I had those dreams where I felt lost, alone, rejected, looking for my joy which always was hard to find, but last night, it wasn't hard to find that moment, I found that happy place right away, it was so real, I can touch it, feel it, knowing that I was there for real, I felt so happy, it made me have some hope that things would be better, that the ""we"" ll be good at some point ""was real, that it have some sense, i didn't feel alone anymore, even when I waked up to face reality."

I get the feeling that *I’m* the problem. There’s something about *ME* that causes these things. But I’m not entirely sure what that is. 

*SOMETHING* is clearly wrong here. Now I think the problem could be my anger issues. I do tend to get angry at people sometimes and that may be what drives people away. But I’m not sure if this is the only reason or if this even is the reason. 

Besides the anger issues the only other thing I can think of that could be causing this is my OCD. My OCD makes me behave in weird ways (not intentionally) that may turn people off. Besides this I really can’t think of what else could be causing this problem. (isolation/no girlfriend)

Maybe someone is smart enough to identify if there’s something about me that’s causing this. Maybe something is wrong with my behavior or my personality."

I'd make acquaintances at school, work, wherever I'd be working in a group, but no one with whom I could have a deep personal conversation or even just hang out with. 

I have a boyfriend, but we usually meet only once every few months, and I haven't seen him for over 8 months because of covid. He's fallen out of love with me, and the only reason why I don't leave him is because other than him or my parents, I really have no one else.

I just feel so shitty and inferior when I'm around other people, I don't want to show them any of my personality or flaws. It's no wonder I have no friends, because I seem very guarded and boring. I'm trying to get help for my anxiety and depression, but I've been like this for more than 10 years, it's gonna take time to get out of it.

I have no problems making friends online, where I'm less inhibited and I don't have the anxieties of interacting in person. We play games together, have good conversations, talk about our lives and feelings, basically everything normal friends would do. But everyone can't be online all the time, and when they're gone or say they are going to meet friends they have in real life, I feel even worse.

I can't focus on work or anything of substance, just because of how alone I feel all the time.

Idk. It just feels bad :("

I made him feel bad so many times but he was such a great friend and didn't leave. But I did it again and he left. I wish he listened to me when I told him I shouldnt be friends with anyone. Now I don't have anything to look forward to during the day. No one else never talks to me. Ill never be friends with anyone. And I don't feel comfortable talking to antes else. I shouldn't feel so bad I knew he would leave someday but I wasn't prepared for that. I'm more sad about the fact that I hurt him. I don't care if I'll never have a friend and ill be all alone again but I hurt my friend. And he's not the first person I have hurt. I'm not allowing myself to talk to anyone ever again
lonely,How do I stop being alone..,How do I stop being alone.. - [removed]
lonely,Please anyone talk to me,Please anyone talk to me - I cannot deal with the pain anymore
lonely,Does anyone just wanna talk or cry with me?,"Does anyone just wanna talk or cry with me? - Just sit here in are own rooms together and just forget the fact that we are 2 strangers and just feel together, maybe even some ily’s to each other?"
lonely,Alone all day: Feeling slightly less lonely,"Alone all day: Feeling slightly less lonely - So, yesterday I had an exchange with someone that basically revealed that she has no interest in spending time with me. It was hard. It was hurtful. Not what I wanted to hear.

But now that it's the day after, and I'm not constantly thinking about how much I want to hang out with her, I feel kind of less lonely. It's almost like... because I knew it was possible and desirable for us to hang out, I would yearn for it all the time and feel lonely when it wasn't happening. But now that I realize she doesn't want to spend time with me, I kind of don't want to spend time with her.

So even though I'm more alone physically, the yearning isn't there. I feel kind of free. Able to do more than I did before. Now I'm not super happy or joyful, but there is a sort of peace. Wrote a letter to a teacher I hadn't seen in 2 years. Read a book for a long time. 

Just thought I'd share, in case someone needs to hear that it's possible to move on, it's possible to be alone but not lonely."
lonely,Forever alone,"Forever alone - I’m 24 M. Never had a significant other. The only date I’ve ever been on was last year and she was a lesbian and used me as a cover up. I’m introverted so it’s hard to even start interacting with people let alone pursue a relationship. Just not sure what to do anymore. Dating apps haven’t worked, and I’m too shy to approach girls irl. Any suggestions?"
lonely,Anybody wanna talk?,"Anybody wanna talk? - If you’re feeling lonely, DM me, I’d LOVE to talk to you. I’m male 18. Thanks."
lonely,Is friendship a real thing?,"Is friendship a real thing? - Hey y'all. This is 9 pm and I just remembered some memories from the past with other people that I've been close to. And I started to questioning myself. ""Is a friendship a real thing?"" Yeah, that just popped up in my head. I mean seriously, how can people bond so tightly with the others even they know that they're not their relatives? Are they know that someday they will got away? Are they even think about this situation that will happen to them? If you know the answer or have been through this kind of situation, please tell me about it. Because at this point of my life, I just keep asking my existence in front of the others. And thank you for reading my post."

lonely,I've usually been really introverted but after everything this year it's almost like I get a high from talking to people,"I've usually been really introverted but after everything this year it's almost like I get a high from talking to people - I think the pandemic actually forcing me to stay away from people and stay in-doors made me really tired of myself and gave me a new appreciation for social interaction. Just any social interaction at all with anybody. Casually greeting people and asking how their day's going or starting conversations doesn't feel nearly as awkward and difficult anymore. I just feel so relieved to get to talk to somebody. I love people y'all. I love y'all, thank you for being here. I hope you all have a great day and a great life."
lonely,"My mom just straight up called me (26m) out for not having atleast one close friend and I don't know how to respond to that, I don't even know if I'm posting in the right sub.","My mom just straight up called me (26m) out for not having atleast one close friend and I don't know how to respond to that, I don't even know if I'm posting in the right sub. - I have many friends for name sake, sure many of them feel, tell me and introduce me as their best friend but I can definitely see that look in their eye that I won't say the same, not even a single person know me for who I am, all they know it's that specific character I play while I'm around them many of my friends are proud of having me as a friend but deep inside I know that I'm a sad little man who can't let anyone in, this is the first time I'm posting this sort of stuff maybe I need self analysis for this type of behavior or maybe I need someone to tell me if this is normal, who ever you are please do respond in the comment."
lonely,How to recover from a prolonged relationship,"How to recover from a prolonged relationship - Any advice on coming back from a 2 year relationship? Feels weird and empty even though it's been about 2-3 months. I have friends that I talk to, they're great friends that seem to genuinely care. Although, the loss of someone I did almost everything with makes me just feel alone with only myself to turn to."

lonely,I just realised I don’t deserve happiness.,"I just realised I don’t deserve happiness. - I do t deserve it because I don’t make a single other living creature in this universe happy, I just make them stressed or sad. My mum has even told me that I cause her stress. All I do is sleep and get yelled at, so why would I ever deserve happiness, I deserve sadness and that’s what I’m getting."
lonely,I wrote this poem about some conflicting emotions https://wordsfrommirrors.wordpress.com/2020/10/09/talk-to-ink-and-paper/,"I wrote this poem about some conflicting emotions https://wordsfrommirrors.wordpress.com/2020/10/09/talk-to-ink-and-paper/ - 
 I have been so lonely for so long now. I have ONE friend and we don’t live near one another and it’s not a completely close friendship either. There are many toxic sides to it but I am always so afraid that if I lose them, I am literally left with nobody. At this point, craving something deep and healthy isn’t even the priority. I am just okay with talking to someone. Anyone. About the weather or the food. It doesn’t even matter if it’s deep or not. Just any words would do. So I can’t think of ending this friendship. My experience with trying to know more people is really bad and every time I start to feel something, I get so worried. I can’t help but be so scared of having any hope because I know I can’t take any more losses. So this poem is supposed to depict that confliction. Of whether to let my heart feel things when it does or to just squish it out immediately incase it leads nowhere."
lonely,Dear Future Partner (Inspired by u/MiloE123's post),"Dear Future Partner (Inspired by u/MiloE123's post) - Most of me believe's you won't exist, I'm gonna hope for the best you do though.

I can't wait to be able to share my life with you and for you to be able to share your life with me.

Maybe we'll live together, I hope you don't mind me having the fan on when we go to bed each night, my tinnitus is quite annoying. I'll be able to make it up to you though since I'm proficient with a coffee machine I'm can make us some mad good coffee every morning, or maybe you like tea instead?

I'm not sure what job you might have, you could be anything from a Supermarket Manager to a pilot. Whatever you want to do ill be sure to support you towards your goals, you can tell me about your day every night and ill tell you about mine, you'll probably hear about my work a lot and how much I love it there. 

we can share our music and just sit and listen together for hours at a time, headbang to Kompany, spit bars to Omar Lynx, chillout to HOME, cry too LuQus. It Doesn't have to be my music either it could be whatever you listen to as well. Share it with me tell me why you love it, I wanna hear what your passionate about and what drives you through life.

I'll always be there for you whenever you need me, I know as well I'll always be able to rely on you for help. I know I struggle to show emotions because of my trauma but I'm confident you'll be smart too enough to see through that.

lonely,Why Do People Leave Without Warning?,"Why Do People Leave Without Warning? - I had made a friend in 2018 at an old job. She was always very kind to me and fun to work with. We would hang out like friends usually do. She introduced me to her family and talked to me about things she wanted to get off her chest sometimes. We developed a pretty tight knit friendship over time. I felt included in her personal life in a way. The last time we spoke was earlier this Summer. I had disabled all my social medias except for snapchat. When she posted a story last week, I was surprised and happy to see her. I messaged her welcoming her back and she immediately blocked me. I was dumbfounded to say the least. I had no idea how to process this friendship that I thought I had, end like that. Many people have done this to me in the past. I don’t take it personally from people I’m usually not close with but this definitely made me feel sad."
lonely,Self hurting and guilt,"Self hurting and guilt - Seems like there is alot of self roasting on here guys, I get you're reaching out for help but god damn some of you guys are rough, If I can give anyone just a little advice is to start believing in your self it doesn't matter what you make it about just believe a little bit :)

lonely,Mid 30s male looking for friendly chat,"Mid 30s male looking for friendly chat - Hi, I'm new to the Reddit community. Recently, I have signed myself up to a local support program to help with my possible depression. I'm trying to find ways outside of this particular class to keep myself positive. I have a partner and very few friends, all of which are mutual with my partner, so I feel I have no true one on one connection with any of them. I am basically just here to either post for my own kind of diary entry kind of thing, but ideally, hoping someone is in a like minded situation and just wants to chat. I'm not looking for a relationship, just equal minded friendly chat. I have a full time job so can not commit to replying straight away if I do get any responses, and hope this is not a problem. Thanks in advance."
lonely,"I've been all alone for 4-years. Friendless, no partner, no family. My life has been like this since I was 19, now I'm 21 (F).","I've been all alone for 4-years. Friendless, no partner, no family. My life has been like this since I was 19, now I'm 21 (F). - My life will never get better. It will never turn around. At 21, I'm going no where. I have no direction, and have no clue what to do with myself. Every former peer I *use* to know are on their way to success, and there's me, living at home like the loser I am, no money, no job. No accomplishments. Nothing. I don't go to school, afraid of debt and have no sense of direction on what to actually do. Don't want to take a student loan when I'm directionless. 

What's even more yikes is the fact that I've never had a boyfriend, not even a first kiss. I don't think anyone has actually been attracted to me. I was the ""weird girl"" in High School nobody liked. Mainly because I didn't talk much due to awful social anxiety. Besides, I was never attractive, so I was written off, and just treated poorly.

I'm so fucking lonely. I have *no friends* zero. There are no phone contacts in my phone. I barely have any Instagram followers. 3-years of living my life with no human contact. All my former friends either hate me, and the bridges is too burnt to fix, or left. That's how much of a loser I am.

I see them live their life, they're all thriving, tons of Instagram followers, friends (whom, I introduced to one another). Living their lives in their early 20's, have their careers ahead of them, they're happy.

Then here's me, the dumb loser, rotting away. I'm forever the laughing stock, and losing my mental sanity because I am all alone. There's no way for me to make friends at this point either. My life is far too gone to even fix."
lonely,I kinda feel like I just live for everyone else.,"I kinda feel like I just live for everyone else. - A bit of an explanation. 

I’m thirty years old. I’m a divorced father of four. I’m an EMT. That’s about it. 

I work an insane amount of hours. EMS doesn’t exactly pay well, and, children, so I work probably more than I should. But I feel like I’m just living my life for other people. My job is taking care of people, and most days when I’m not working, I get my children. 

Typing that out makes it sound so incredibly selfish. I chose this career, and I chose to have children. I do like my job. It has its rewards. And I love my children. They’re the light of my life. But it gets to be pretty isolating. I have a couple of friends with varying degrees of closeness, but nothing especially great. It’s difficult enough to maintain friendships when you start reaching this age. Add the other extenuating circumstances, and it makes it all the more strenuous. And I have my partner, but that’s all he is. My partner. 

Aside from that, that’s it. So I spend most of my night when I’m not on a run just cycling through the same three dating apps, which honestly feels like a waste of time. Even at thirty, it seems hard to escape hookup culture. I thought all this was left behind in my mid twenties but I suppose not. But alright, let’s say for the benefit of the doubt, there was that one person out there that was on the same wave length as me. I don’t feel like I could make anything come from it. I work too much, and I have my girls. Quite frankly, it feels almost better that I can’t find my person. Would it be better to find them and watch it fail, or just not find them at all?

It feels like I’m going to be stuck in this loop perpetually. I go to work. I get my children. I have that one day few and far between that I can do things, and when that comes, there’s not anyone there. In the meantime I just get to watch more and more people on my fb start dating or get married, while I have to respond to another run. 

Maybe it would get better when my children are grown? I mean then I would have a bit more money to do things with, and wouldn’t have to work nearly as much. But at the same time, I feel so guilty thinking that way. It feels like I’m wishing my children’s childhoods away just so I’m not alone."
lonely,Some advice for all you lonely guys and gals,"Some advice for all you lonely guys and gals - I used to be lonely too. I used to spend hours thinking about it. I would cry about how lonely my future would be. And then life happened as it does. 

I stop focusing on that and thought about what I wanted to do in life and went for it. Now I’m working basically three days straight (going to start a second job soon), taking online classes, volunteering, and the rest I spend running errands and knitting which is my current favorite hobby which I have several projects lined up for and can also watch tv or YouTube while doing. I don’t have time to think about how lonely things are or will be. 

This not only will make the lonely go away but it’ll make you a more well rounded, busy individual with an interesting life. And fun fact, people seem to be more drawn to those who have stuff going on and obligations. Just something to think about. Do it for you though not anyone else."
lonely,Does anyone relate?,Does anyone relate? - [removed]
lonely,Going through breakup and feel so alone and overwhelmed.,"Going through breakup and feel so alone and overwhelmed. - Long story short I’m(21M) going through a breakup of what was a 3 year relationship, however most of my friends were mutuals with my ex and they basically all distanced themselves from me but still hang out with her. So I no longer have friends at the moment and my mind has felt a weird feeling of panic for some reason. I haven’t had any social media aside from Reddit for the duration of the relationship because it made my ex uncomfortable so I basically feel like I’m starting at square 1 with just EVERYTHING."
lonely,I don't think I should even get a relationship,"I don't think I should even get a relationship - On one hand I really want one, to feel the warmth of a hug, to be able to hold hands, cuddle in bed and watch anime together, but I feel like I don't deserve it, I would be a burden, having trust issues and paranoia that it's all an act. It feels like because of that any woman would leave me, I would be too dependent and paranoid about it and so scared of loosing her at the same time that after some time she would have enough of me, and  how shitty and pathetic of a human I am."
lonely,Am I the only one who does this?,Am I the only one who does this? - About a year ago I’ve started to wrap my pillows in a blanket and hug it as if it were a person. Do other people do this or am I just weird?
lonely,EMPTY HEART,"EMPTY HEART - I've made the horrible mistake of joining a girls friends groupe on Whatsapp because all they are sharing are pictures of their relationship, boyfriends, marriage... And it reminded me of my empty boring life with nothing in it."
lonely,Gaming Streams &amp; Loneliness,"Gaming Streams &amp; Loneliness - Does anyone else really enjoy watching gaming streams (particularly the group kind popular now with among us) because it sort of feels like you’re part of the conversation? Not like I sit there and respond when someone says something, but just hearing people joke and be comfortable around each other. It sort of feels like you’re there having a good time too. Especially when you consistently watch the same people and you start understanding inside jokes or references they make. It just makes my heart feel a little less lonely. Okay I’m done being pathetic, but I just wanted to know if this is a shared experience? And if so, who are your comfort streamers?"
lonely,To my future girlfriend,"To my future girlfriend - I really hope I’ll meet you someday or anytime soon...it’s been really lonely lately...just know I love you...I’m always here for you, and I’ll always be here to listen to your problems...if you need me or just wNt some cuddles or a hug and I’m sleeping...don’t be afraid to wake me up no matter how late it is, and if you need me I’ll always be there, and I also hope you’re loyal, trusting, and caring just like me, and I hope you love me as much as I love you, I’ll wake you up with kisses every morning and I’ll cuddle you to sleep every night...I’ll take you on many date nights and I’ll spoil you with everything, I hope make really good memories with you and I can’t wait till it comes to that time where I can share those moments with you, I’m here waiting for you and looking for you and I really hope I’ll meet you and be with you soon 

(sorry if this is weird or anything just felt like writing this...might delete later)"
lonely,I just want someone to accept me and help me,"I just want someone to accept me and help me - I hope this post will make since, I had a drink earlier and just want to bare my soul about this to someone. I'm a virgin in my 20's. I want to embrace my sexuality. I have a lot of shame about it due to how I was raised and while I don't beleive there is anything wrong with it anymore I still have these weird moments.

Like most guys I masturbate and watch porn, I wish I just didn't have to hide it (especially from women). Like I wish I could get to know a woman in the safety of the internet and explore sexually and not have to hide it. I wish I could get to know someone where we could just hang out in a voice chat together and watch porn or talk about stuff. The thought of doing that terrifies me but at the same time I want it. Does that make me a creep? I mean, I try to be a respectful person, I wouldn't want to make anyone uncomfortable or anything, and I would want to be talking to someone who understands that I'm GOING to be uncomfortable before I get comfortable. Thats just how it is, and I'm going to be nervious and stuff.

I wish I had a friend who was promiscuous or something who I could talk openly with about this. I feel like a freak for even having sexual desires despite mentally knowing that they are normal."
lonely,Going to miss a friend I wasn’t even close with,Going to miss a friend I wasn’t even close with - Me and my friends got in a group and asked girls to homecoming. The girl I asked is one of the nicest people I know. I’m not that close with her but I really enjoyed having her as a friend for this short time.  If I’m being honest I don’t think she likes me though and it hurts to know that I’ll probably won’t hangout with her again now that it’s over.
lonely,Why are the worst people in relationships?,Why are the worst people in relationships? - This is def a shitty thing to say lol. But it’s true - it hurts to see someone inconsiderate or ignorant in a relationship with someone else while you’re being nice to everyone and still feeling lonely at the end of the day.
lonely,"I had enough problems finding a date before coronavirus, but now it seems impossible.","I had enough problems finding a date before coronavirus, but now it seems impossible. - I've had a lifetime of issues with women, weather it's being lonely for long stretches of time (usually years), or being in one of a few relationships that were full of my partner lying, cheating, and gaslighting me.  I'm 35 years old, a full time professional tattoo artist (and a DJ on the side as a hobby).  I feel like I'm a pretty good looking guy when I look in the mirror, but who knows what people think.  I'm just a few inches under 7 feet tall (I don't want to get too specific here), and sometimes I wonder if that scares girls off or something.  I'm a friendly guy and make fast friends with many people.  I haven't had sex for about 1.5 years, and that was just my ex coming up to visit for one evening. Before that was about another 1.5 years, give or take.  I just look around and feel like there's no light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to love and dating.  I haven't even met a girl that I've liked in a long long time, especially now that the coronavirus keeps people home more.  I feel like I live in a town of like 50 people, since I don't see anyone too often anymore.  It's like a ghost town.

I've been learning online lately something that could explain my lack of success:  It's that (I've recently found out) women take someone being friendly or ""nice"" in an introduction or a conversation as disingenuous and needy to them.  So that essentially means that, if I ever want to find a girlfriend or date, that I'll actually have to NOT be my friendly self (that so many friends seem to like about me btw), and become some faker who pretends to not like a girl that I'm interested in.  I have to admit, upon that realization I have built up a lot of resentment toward women who would do this, because they're demanding that I be someone else, because who I am isn't good enough.  How is that supposed to make me feel?  Because it doesn't feel good.  TBH, if they want someone to not be nice to them then I can supply that, because i'm full of resentment and if they're wanting me to not be nice then I can be super not nice.  I feel that if I have to go through that to get the positive attention of a woman, then I could never respect her, because I would know that she just likes the persona I've put on and not the real me.  TBH, it breaks my heart.  I was having a lot of s\*\*\*idal thoughts for the past few years due to my loneliness but I feel like me finding out about the above info will give me a new lease on life, or at least I hope so.

Also, please don't say:  You aren't having luck with women because you're treating them bad, because all I've done is treat these women good and with respect, and got nothing but ignored and/or walked on.  Don't they say that doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results is the definition of insanity?  I've been nice and respectful for this whole time and get brushed aside, how am I not supposed to find an answer to try to fix that?  And the people who I hear are having success with women are handling it that way.  You can even find youtube videos where women say how they feel about a ""nice guy"" and they have only negative things to say.  I feel like I've been lied to my whole life, and I feel like this situation is going to turn me into a heartless monster, because apparently that's the definition of being a man to these women.  So I feel backed into a corner and have not other way out than to become ""not nice"" at all, which to me means: be shitty and disrespectful to them, also never show them your true nice self, because it's showing weakness.  :(

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I live in a town of about 100,000 people and when I go out I hardly ever seen any new people out, and when I do it usually like some obvious couple holding hands or something.   I just feel like I never see any single girls out.  And yes, I'm going to bars to see if I can meet someone, but I've NEVER heard of an actual better option than that.  People say stuff like:  go to the grocery store and talk to a girl about broccoli or something.  Start doing some volunteer work (I have no time for that after my work schedule).  Plus, who the heck has actual time for that after working full time.  Like do they have 2 days off a week and use one of them doing volunteer work?  I usually have one day to work on my house and do chores and one day to relax, so volunteer work is ridiculous to recommend to any normal working person imo.  Oh yeah, don't forget to get a dog and go to the dog park.  I work full time and live alone.  That's not a fair schedule for a dog.  I wouldn't leave a poor animal alone for that long just to have a girl magnet.   And there's always work where I see lots of girls, but I feel like it's not right to try to hit on a girl while I'm working on their tattoo, so I've never done it."
lonely,I feel mentally and physically drained,"I feel mentally and physically drained - It's been forever since I've felt ”happy” and I honestly do not believe that I will ever escape this loneliness I'm trapped in.
 I only have a small group of friends and I feel like they are slowly separating from me. Every time I see a happy couple while I'm at work or just in public, I fall into a deep sadness knowing that I'll probably never achieve that happiness others feel. I try to talk to new people but they usually end up ignoring me and moving on. I just wish I had somebody that I could hold and let the weight fall off of my shoulders for just a second."
lonely,I can’t take another day,"I can’t take another day - Making post that no one sees, and it’s just shows how much of a nobody I am... I’m so lonely. My god, can you please if your real just take life damn life. I’m tired, I can’t even wake up in the morning to get up for work. 

Everything and everyone is so far away, I feel sick. Please please please please please please PLEASE take it away"
lonely,Feeling lonely,"Feeling lonely - Tonight is tough, just feeling lonely. I wish I had friends close by but it seems like most my friends are either in the same state but far away or in another state or in another country. Just me ranting here, if you want to talk shoot me a message I can never have enough friends even if y’all don’t live near me."
lonely,Is it just me,Is it just me - I can't do anything right anymore and everyone has gave up on me. I don't have anyone left anymore I'm lost. I don't have many people to talk to and I'm always getting made fun of by family and friends for being bad at literally everything. I'm truly alone I have nothing left.
lonely,It didn't happend,"It didn't happend - I keep waiting for that surprise that could made me recover my soul, but it didn't happen, I feel like is time to cry again, but in reality, it isn't because don't the privacy to feel my pain alone. I feel lonely but I can't be alone."
lonely,"Tonight is difficult, it’s 4am and I can’t sleep","Tonight is difficult, it’s 4am and I can’t sleep - I’ve been feeling so empty tonight. I lost a dear and close friend today. We both decided we needed space to clear up our own difficulties with depression but I don’t know how to cope with the pain of losing them. I have nobody else to talk to anymore."
lonely,When will the loneliness end?,"When will the loneliness end? - So fucking lonely.  When does it stop? Even after kids and marriage, I’m still lonely."
lonely,It happened again,"It happened again - So yesterday this girl and I() were talking and flirting at school, she added herself on my Snapchat so we could talk. After school, we talk, she shows me how long her tongue is and flirt with me. Later into the day she takes longer and longer to respond to my messages. Today she barely answer me today and I sent her a text an hour ago and she hasn’t opened it but posted on her story. Why even put your on my sc friend list,why say I was cute, why flirt with me? I don’t get it. I’m so done honestly this happens to me so much."
lonely,What I'd give for a hug.,"What I'd give for a hug. - Between all of the life things happening before March (lost my job, on the verge of bankruptcy, been single far too long, several family deaths), the last 7 months or so have been brutal. I have decent friends, and we talk. But there's so much less connection over Skype or Zoom or from 6' away.

And with winter setting in soon... it'll only amplify it.

I'd give just about anything for a hug. Just to be held and felt like someone cared. Just for a minute. Just for a second."

It lasted about 30 seconds before I started crying. - All I want is for someone to hold me and tell me it'll be okay. I want little kisses and back rubs.

Or meet in public for some pet therapy (not real therapy pets, just really cuddly cat or dog) if you're within an hour drive or so. Or someone to recognize your birthday. 

Not sure how weird of an idea this is, but I'm okay with being a bit out there."

If your best friend was going through a similar situation as you...what would you say to her. What would be the best way to support her?

(You can share a link to your thread if you've already started one or share a bit of your situation then your advice on handling a situation for someone who is in a similar situation as you. How can we support that person? What's the best way to talk to him?)

lonely,What is wrong with our generation??,"What is wrong with our generation?? - This generation suckss when it comes to relationships. It is mostly a hookup generation, where everything is one night stands and just all about sex. It seems like there is a majority that had done everything when it comes sexual part in relationships and then there is a small minority that has done nothing and is genuinely looking for someone to spend their life with.
 
As part of that minority it is hard... nah actually impossible to find other people looking for a relationship. I want someone to go through life with; the up’s and down’s, the good and the bad.   Sure I’d like to have the sex part too but I just want a best friend, someone that I can hold hands with, talk about whatever, hug whenever it hasn’t been my day and just really be myself. We could go for a drive, windows down jamming to music to go watch the sun set and watch the stars move across the sky... 

I’m convinced I’m never going to find someone and tbh I’m tired of trying... all I do is seem to get hurt and I’m just tired... anyways, I hope your day was good, and that you have better luck finding a relationship than me"

Dating apps have become a hub of women trying to sell their ‘premium’ Snapchat or their onlyfans. Most of my friend group is married or committed enough that they don’t know anyone else who is single except me. I’m not quite the last person to find someone but I’m so over it I might as well be.

I haven’t been in a real relationship since I was 22, now 7 years later I can’t remember what that all felt like, to care about someone else like that. I’m lucky I have a roommate, especially rn but jeez I can tell once they move out or I move out or life happens and I’m on my own, I’m fucked. I don’t like meeting people out in public because it’s just not me, and I’m getting to a point where I’m more set in my ways than before.

Maybe worse is I feel like every time I start talking to someone and get ghosted or asked to send them money it’s like a little more trust is destroyed in the whole process. Aside from people I know I don’t trust anyone, and I particularly don’t trust anyone who shows me anything remotely close to interest. Then I just get myself down for not believing the next person, then bam! I get a message, we flirt and just as I’m beginning to believe this girl is genuine, there comes the “my personal Snapchat is for folks who know what it costs to have a good time.”

I tell them I feel the same way, even though I don’t. I completely get when people aren’t in the right mindset to give part of their time to someone else, it’s just sucky to have it happen constantly.

And even though I'm happy I'm not with him now I feel such an impending sense of loneliness that I don't know how to deal with. When I'm on my own I feel really empty and I don't know how to fill that void. I know that it's not him that I'm missing i think its just the realisation that I'm now on my own. I don't really know how to describe it because for the last four years I've always had someone. Now I just feel lost and on my own.

Fuck man, I’ve never been so lonely and nobody even knows it. Everyone around me just assumes I have friends. Even when I did, I was never the one who got checked up on or was asked how was I doing, I care so much about everyone I come across and they never feel the same, I just want it returned. I’m 15(F), I lit have no excuse for my loneliness other than the fact my anxiety gets in the way of me ever going out, I try to hard in all the relationships I make and I don’t really fit in with the ones in my town, considering all they want to do is get pissed in the forests (Northern Ireland btw). I just want a normal teenage experience but I romanticise life so much I never live up to my expectations so I just beat myself down even further.

I got out when I was 18 but that shit sticks with you even when you stop believing. I was never given the chance to be socialized as a kid so it wasn't until I was in my 20s that I learned to socialize but anxiety and distrust makes me keep everyone at arm's length and even if I try I just come off as ""weird"" or ""creepy"" and repel people quickly.

I guess I’m just here to ask, does anyone out there love me? I know that sounds bad and self centered to ask, but I truly need to know. But I guess how can I expect any of you to have a say in that, none of you know me. 

I’m 16 and male. My birthday is coming up soon, and the only thing I’ve discovered leading up to is that no one loves me. I hate my birthday anyway, it’s never a good day when you don’t have friends to even celebrate it with. I’ve hated it for a long time I guess.

I've been living with my 2 best friends and their families for about 6 months now and there are 7 of us total. About 5 months ago I became the only person with both a license and a vehicle so I picked up the slack. 2 months ago i had an argument with one of my friends about asking permission instead of forgiveness when she needs my car. Nothing changed for a while but then 2 months ago her daughter, who's a couple months shy of 18 and full of bad attitude, got a job a town away and I was expected to take her and pick her up every day now without any discussion. 
Skip forward. Shes still acting like she owns my car AND my time on a regular basis, but now shes making me take her daughter to get food after work ""so she doesnt have to reheat what we had for dinner"" and now doesnt even acknowledge me unless she is trying to get something out of me. 
So today I woke up to a text saying we have to go two towns over after dropping her daughter off 1 town over. And I responded to her asking her to ""be more gentle"" when she makes a request and she told me ""nvm I'll figure it out "" so I asked if she was gonna figure out her daughter too and she responded with ""fuck off"" and launched into calling me a child and telling me I do nothing for anyone around there. This woman has a history of abusive patterns, especially with me and nobody else in the house wanted to help mediate so now I'm trying to find a place to store my possessions while my grandparents graciously invite me to stay with them. 
How are people so rotten and entitled that asking them to respect the fact that that car is my car got me expelled from a group of people claiming to be my adoptive family."
lonely,16 SIGNS HE LIKES YOU MORE THAN YOU THINK,"16 SIGNS HE LIKES YOU MORE THAN YOU THINK - *He teases you playfully* 

This is often the case when a man likes a girl. He can tell jokes, get nervous, and make her laugh. The main thing is that he tries to make you laugh. He should never be mean or hurtful. If he likes you, the last thing he wants is to make you angry or hurt you. 

*He acts protective* 

This is one of the signs he is really interested in because he will do everything to protect you from something negative. Maybe he is defending your feelings and opinions or just looking out for your safety. He may be a nice, polite person, but if you add this sign to some others, chances are he likes you more than a friend. 

*He asks you personal questions* 

I am not saying that he will ask intimate, uncomfortable questions, but only that he is trying to get to know you. What do you like about him? What are your hobbies? What is your favorite movie? etc. 

Men do not waste time trying to meet someone they are not interested in. He may be content to make polite small talk, but one of the signs of someone who likes you is that he continues to be interested in you. When you are together, does he ask you questions about yourself and really listen to your answers?

I'm not sure if I should tell her my feelings, because I'm sure that she will make fun of me because people see me as the ""funny kid"" who always makes puns and doesn't care.

During the warmer seasons, I get SO excited about the festivities that are to come later in the year. I think about the good vibes, warm-colored lights, COMFY FOOD, decked out malls, and just the overall cheeriness of the season.

But then I start to think about the idea of coziness, finding warmth on a cold day, sharing laughter, sharing memories; but when it's the 24th of December and I'm driving alone at night listening to melancholic Christmas music like a melodramatic dum dum, I realize I've never been able to experience THAT part of Christmas. Y'know, the part you spend with another person or a close group of people. Obviously I don't want to drive too far down the path of self-pity, but I just find it odd that I was looking forward to this season SO excitedly this year, but now I'm left feeling a bit cold.

I've been unemployed since March and spending most of my time at my mom's house. I see people like once a week (still have a room in an apartment), but overall as soon as I leave people I drop into an insanely negative headspace. Most of my mental energy is dominated by an ex that things ended with over a year ago, something I have a lot of resentment over that I don't know how to handle still. Most days I spend in my head either missing her or being extremely upset with her. Even after doing everything I can to process, the pain doesn't go away and I am incredibly afraid of getting in a relationship again even though at this point I really miss one. I am passionate about music and have projects going but the depression is often debilitating and leaves me with zero energy. This makes it incredibly hard to apply for work, as I have little self confidence. How do I get out of this rut?"
lonely,Hello there 👋🏻,"Hello there 👋🏻 - Hello, I'm new to this sub, and eventhough the topic of this subreddit isn't that uplifting, I'm glad I joined. In hope of relieving some of that lonelieness.

Usually, when I'm feeling fine and comfortable, I'm more of an extrovert, entertainer kind of guy. I love making jokes, telling stories, and I'm not afraid to say I'm kinda good at it. Sadly, it's the only thing I got going for me.

For four years now I'm feeling desperately lonely. I've had a bunch of good and close friends when I left school but it all quickly spiraled downwards. I don't exactly remember how it all started, but I've gotten into smoking pot. Like, a lot. Like, snoop dogg amounts. For some time, I smoked 100 bucks worth in 2, maybe 3 days tops.

I feel like I don't have to mention what this brought upon my social life. I started feeling bad and like incompetent for ever longer lasting time periods. During which I started isolating myself. I used to meet my friends everyday, now it's one friend I talk to every two or three weeks.

I've had met a girl some months ago, we were chatting a bit, she was super sweet and also into me and I was on cloud 9. The need to smoke pot was gone completely. Like a switch that got pulled as soon as I could feel worth it again. Eventually we talked about pot. Because of corona, we couldn't meet yet, but she had this idea of talking on the phone while we both were smoking a blunt, enjoying it together, over the distance. I've hadn't wasted a thought on pot upto this point and my sky high mood made me think ""yeah, it's gonna be fine""....welp, it wasn't.

I kinda started panicking and because of the early stage of getting to know one another, it was a big deal. She wanted someone stable, I wasn't. Still am not.

I just know that as soon as I find a girl I'm interested in, I don't need it anymore. I get the strongest urges when I'm feeling the most lonely.

I was being told throughout my youth that I'm such a smart, talkative person, who everyone likes, but I feel like noone loves.

Also I'm pretty empathic. I'd say I'm very good in interpreting emotions of others and I'm good at helping them. Ironically, I'm very bad at handling my own emotions. I don't get angry or loud though, when something comes up, I shut up and isolate myself because throwing accusations doesn't help the situation either. It's really hard to talk about my emotions in person. And emotions I got a lot. Im the type of person who cries about a sit-com (the alternative...better...ending of himym finished me back then)

Now, two weeks ago I got fired for some dumb shit reason. I left school with good grades, went to college, maybe even could've went to university, but as soon as I started smoking pot, my grades plummeted, I cancelled college (Abitur, im from germany), got some annoying job, cancelled it, had to agree to an even worse job I now got fired from.

I don't know what I try to achieve with this post, I'm already getting the feeling of ""Stop bothering people with your problems"" while writing this. 

Anyways, thanks for hearing me out. I guess I'll just hold on, it's gotta be better *eventually* ."
lonely,My friends don't even try anymore.,"My friends don't even try anymore. - My friends don't even try hiding the fact that they are ignoring me,they actually show it purposfuly. For example,my online friends, if i join a game with them they either switch it or say i gtg. Then if i join the other game they switch back. Then there's my irl friends that don't even acknowledge my existance.I'd rather have them tell me that they don't enjoy being around me rather being my friend out of pity."

But now, I'm done with my stuff and I have nothing else to do. I just want to relax with someone and enjoy the rest of the day with each other.

But no, I don't get to. I only have the option of sitting in this damned dark room trying to force myself to sleep or playing video games or watching something. But I'm so damned burnt out of that stuff.

I want to do something with someone else. Not just be by myself, every fucking day. I feel like this is all it. And it just sucks."
lonely,This won't work,"This won't work - I'm 21 yr old male from the USA. I've been having a really tough time right now with the pandemic, and like a lot of people I am very lonely. I broke up with my boyfriend in January and have felt starved of physical affection to the point of psychological pain since start of September. Jesus that sounds dark reading it back but it feels good to express. I can't do the whole in-person dating thing currently because my grandmother lives with us and is very high risk as she's battling cancer. 

My subconscious has been torturing me every night for the past week or so with dreams where I'm forming a connection with usually a girl (I'm pan) but being unable to touch her or show her affection due to a wide variety of absurd obstacles. Last night she kinda resembled Freaks and Geeks era Linda Cardellini for some reason. It's really scary to me that my soul is suffering so much that it needs to remind me on a nightly basis in such a straightforward manner what I am lacking. I'm generally doing okay mood wise, but these constant messages from my psyche are adding up and thwarting my efforts to distract myself by keeping busy on school work and hobbies. 

I figured this sub could be a good place place to find people who I may relate to in this capacity. I'm not familiar with how this works, I'm assuming a lot of people post things like this on here and it probably doesn't work, but I'm sad to admit I'm feeling pretty desperate for anything lately. It isn't a good look, but what're ya gonna do. 

I'm a respectful and empathetic person. Doesnt have be a romantic thing at all, just looking for someone to talk to. Any gender, race, body type, don't care about anything like that. I'm in school full time currently. I make music, write poetry and read when in my free time. Love talking about art, philosophy, and other pseudo intellectual pursuits. I'm 6'4. I know that doesn't rlly matter but I gotta use any angle I got I guess. If ur interested just pm me. Thanks."

People wanted to enjoy other peoples company. People wanted to have physical hugs, physical kisses, and physical sex and it wasn't looked down upon. It wasn't seen as disgusting. It wasn't seen as a way to manipulate someone. Love wasn't a game. It was a longing for the person you truly cared about.

&amp;#x200B;

It was beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now love is a wall of text.

""Why are you always negative?""

""Why do you care about what others think?""

""Smile more""

""You don't need a relationship""

""Sex isn't everything""

""Love yourself only""

lonely,why I believe I'm alone,why I believe I'm alone - I am very emotionally and empathetically stunted so it is very difficult for me to form genuine connections with others. the lack of connection inside myself extends outwards making me very indifferent to not only people but most things in life. inside I am a empty void so I create masks to cover it up and function in society to the best of my ability. I isolate myself and never leave my home unless it's necessary. sometimes I think the complex empathetic world people take part in is not real since I can not experience it myself but I know it is. I crave social interaction but I have no friends and nobody to talk to or message so I am turning to reddit I suppose.

lonely,I'm having a birthday party and I'm a loner.,"I'm having a birthday party and I'm a loner. - This is actually my first Reddit post. I have never had a Reddit account and made this one to confess my thoughts which are eating my soul. I'm having a birthday party in a few weeks, and I've invited only 2 friends. Those 2 are my closest, bestest friends and we've been together for almost 2-3 years, but it seems like 30. I gave my mom the excuse of the pandemic and how we're back at stage 2 again, I also told her everyone might be too scared to come, but in reality, I'm scared of inviting others. You see, ever since the pandemic happened I haven't seen most people from school, so I can't just come up to them and ask them to come after months of not texting or seeing them. There one girl I knew for 2 years because we rode on the same bus. We never shared classes though. We haven't talked in months, not even a text. Plus I think my other 2 friends would feel awkward around her. My mom thinks it's a good idea to invite at least 1 more but I can't bring myself to tell her I only have 2 good friends. I'm scared of talking to people. It's a small phobia I have because of my anxiety disorder. I don't know what to do. I rarely even go to school because of the pandemic. I want to tell my 2 friends about my fears and glossophobia but as sweet as they are I can't bring myself to because of how embarrassing it is. 

I get that this is a stupid reason to be upset and anxious, but imagine only inviting 2 people for your birthday because you have no other close friends. I'm also older than you might think. Any advice maybe?"

I should be in college this year but nope, I have about 7 and a half months left of school until I finally get to leave. I have no friends at school. Not even one. Nobody talks to me all day and it’s starting to really get to me. The kids there already have their own friends and they aren’t particularly nice people anyway. I’m at a small private school so there isn’t much choice for making friends. I’ve tried with everyone in my year and none of them really like me. 

I have some friends outside of school but they all live quite far away and I only get to see them like once every 2 weeks. And my old best friend from primary school lives over an hour away and I only get to see her every 2-3 months. I just want someone to help me get through every day. I know I’ll very likely make some really close friends in college but that’s 10 and a half months away. How do I just stop worrying about this and learn how to wait?"

I beg and crave for it like an addiction. I unreligiously pray for anyone out there to tilt the scale of luck in my favor. But, when I hit the darkest point of my day/night. I throw all my hard work away. I feel angry, frustrated, and no matter how cliche it sounds, I feel like turning to a monster. All my past relationships I've been told I'll find better. But the truth was I only wanted someone to stay, to be with me when I needed them most. At first I would blame myself, but thinking back I never did wrong. I always placed them above myself and here I am watching them grow happy after being used. The sponge that I became, absorbed their dark consciousness and became their light. Once they grew, they abandoned me, some even cheated. Don't they know that morally breaks me? Am I even worth it?"

Less than an hour later, we both get invited to hang out with some friends who live an hour away. She wants to go and asks me. Something in me wanted to say ""yes"", but I had to be reasonable: 

She literally just told me she didn't have time to eat lunch with me. Now she wants to drive an hour away, hang out for an indefinite period, and then drive an hour back? I had to be real and admit to myself that she doesn't want to spend time with *me*, so I would be a fool to jump on this.

So I said ""no"". I didn't explain my logic, but I would have if she had asked. All she said was ""Are you sure?"" like 5 times. Yep, I'm sure.

A tough call because I was feeling super lonely, but I had to be honest and recognize I would still feel lonely spending time with someone who obviously did not want to spend time with me.

Kind of wishes I could have explained how I felt, but she's gone now. Maybe it will come up later."

lonely,Nothing’s lonelier than a party,"Nothing’s lonelier than a party - Quote from bojack horseman that hit a little too deep. 
Anyone else feel that being amongst a crowd of people is even lonelier than being by yourself? 
It’s kind of like an incessant reminder of how I’m not as close with any of these people as they all are to each other.
That lonely empty feeling I get at parties is almost nostalgic for me, I’ve felt it ever since I was little when I would go to my parents’ dinner parties.
Locking yourself in the bathroom just to have a second to yourself, to breathe, look at yourself in the mirror and sometimes even hold back tears. 
That’s what parties are for me.
Going back out into the war zone that is that dreaded crowd of people and trying to force a believable smile.
Keeping small talk with that one other person who seems like they hate parties as much as you do.
Or constantly following that one friend of yours who seems to know everyone because you don’t wanna be left alone. 
Standing by the snacks table like an idiot trying not to draw any attention to yourself.
Going on your phone just to act like you’re doing something, when in reality you’re just opening and closing the same apps over and over again.
That’s what parties are for me.
I hope someone else can relate"

lonely,I feel so lonely after breaking up with my gf,"I feel so lonely after breaking up with my gf - It was my fault that I broke up with her over a small joke. It wasn't even a big deal but I was being immature and I blame myself for it. She's never coming back (she told me this before blocking me from all social medias). This brings an end to our 8 month long relationship. It's only been a week but I never knew how much I loved her until we broke up. 

Every girl I have dated ended up becoming my everything and I always felt lonely and depressed once I broke up with them. This feeling lasts anywhere between a month to a few months or even a little more than a year. But this time I feel just as hurt as I did in 2016 when I used to cry myself to sleep over the girl who had left me. Except now I'm a grown man who hasn't cried in years but this time I really feel like letting it out.

During the 8 months of my relationship with the girl I broke up with a week ago, I started becoming distant from my best friend and other friends. I used to message my best friend everyday but not as much as I used to before I got into the relationship. He is now happy to see me messaging him more and more but I still feel lonely for some reason. I have other friends who are busy. I also lost my job yesterday so I don't really know what to do anymore. Even when I had work, I used to think about her all the time. Now that I'm free, it's worse. I just can't stop thinking about her. I want to move on but I'm not able to. They say time will heal but I can't wait for time to heal me. I really want to get over her. 

Everything I do reminds me of her and it makes me feel like shit. I love my best friend who also lost his job during the Pandemic. I told him we should start going out again but he said he'll be busy for the next two weeks so I really don't know what to do. I feel like punching myself for breaking up with her. But after the break up I started messaging my friends whom I became distant from. Turns out they're all busy.

lonely,The Look,"The Look - NO LONGER


No longer do I wish to love.
It throws your life to the winds,
messes with your digestion,
ruins your sleep and befuddles the mind.


Yet once again I find the race of my heart outstepping my mind.
What I chose to lock away, comes rushing out to drive me head long into love.


Hope for a life lived alone.
A life led in quiet desperation.
Devoid of a companionship.
Shattered by her.


A single look from her,
laid bare my soul.
A single look from her,
she knew my deepest pain.


A single look from her said,
give me your pain.
Let me take it away,
that you may suffer no longer.


A single look from her,
let me in, it said.


NO, it's my pain.
It's not for sharing.
How dare you heal me!


It's not fair of you to ask.
Leave me alone to suffer,
that which belongs to me."

lonely,"In 2 weeks, I get to go be a pathetic loser in front of the woman that rejected me, again...","In 2 weeks, I get to go be a pathetic loser in front of the woman that rejected me, again... - I asked out the sister of a best friend's wife. For months, I resisted, because shitting where you eat is a bad idea.

But my best friend's wife kept pestering me to ask out her sister. So, I thought she must know something I don't! And her sister seemed to always enjoy being around me, and asked me to dance! 

But, when I finally relented and did, she told me she didn't want to date in the friend group.

Okay. I knew it was a bad idea, and my friend's wife is an idiot. I never should have listened to someone other than myself. 

Well, the sister got a boyfriend and engaged. Even to the point that my best friend's wife said, ""Wow, if my sister didn't reject you, you'd be hanging out all the time with us instead of them."" Some friend, right? My buddy sure knows how to pick them.

But in 2 weeks there's a gender reveal for the wife's baby. I have to hang out with her again my. Unless I just dip on my best friend's celebration. It's been 6 months since, and in that time the sister found a taller, better looking, *race car driver* that she's now engaged to. Literally a *race car driver*! How the fuck can I compete with that?! I'm still in graduate school to try and be a librarian! I'm a fucking loser cashier! 

And I'm still single. I've dated, but haven't found anything long term. And lately, Coronavirus has stopped me from dating at all. So, for the last 4 months I've felt like a giant loser.

Basically, I have to go hang out with the woman that rejected me, and her race car driver fiance, at my best friend's baby gender reveal party. He's literally the only friend I have, and I almost never see them anymore. I'm amazed they invited me to this. 

I wish I could just move to somewhere new in life where nobody knew me anymore. It really wouldn't be any different than now.

lonely,Why am I always just the third wheel?,"Why am I always just the third wheel? - Hello everyone,

Ever since high school I was pretty much always the third wheel among friends. I always had lots of friends but never really a best friend. I remember it made me sad a lot of times and this story just continues all my life. Even during college I had situations when friends didn't call me when they went out but luckily I had many other friends there so somebody did call me or I called them.

Now I am 289 and working for the past 6 years. I used to live for a few years with two of my best friends from college and even then I had instances where I felt left out. I have cried many times when I felt like this. Then I found my first real boyfriend but I still spent lots of time with my friends. I always tell everyone to not forget about their friends when they find a relationship. 

2 years ago I bought an apartment and we live here. Ever since then it's been even worse because most of my friends live a bit distant from me but it's manageable, and on the other hand they live very close by to each other which I am jealous of. I don't have anyone close to me and I didn't make any new friends in my area. I always tell my friends that if I have a boyfriend that doesnt mean I dont want to spend time with them anymore I cannot even count how many times I told them that I want to be with them , I have plenty of time to be with my BF for the rest of my life. But pretty much every time I am part of something happening its because I messaged them asking what are their plans for the weekend and if we can go biking or organize a BBQ, play beach volleyball or something. Of course they invite me for birthdays and the regular stuff but still. 

I even wanted to go to Croatia in July when the situation there was pretty good and one of my friends didnt want to go because of corona which is funny because she is one of those - its just a flu. And then I found out that she went with three other friends in end of August when the situation in Croatia was becoming pretty bad. And these are the types of things basically. In this instance I wouldn't be able to go with them even if they called me because my dad was celebrating birthday at that time,  but they didn't know that.

Recently I messaged one of my friends for her plans for the weekend and she told me she just discussed with other friend that they might go for some hiking maybe even with a sleepover somewhere. So I jokingly (but in reality sadly) responded - and again nobody invited me (I usually dont even say this but I couldn't resist this time) and she said well we still dont know the specifics we just talked about it. These are those typical replies when you dont want to hurt someone's feelings so you say something like this. 

Or this last weekend I suggested grilling in the woods and the response was - it's too cold for that and then two of my friends went biking. So I just find that funny because when you have a fire set up it's much warmer than biking where the wind makes you very cold in autumn. And of course they didn't invite me.

I dont even know why am I posting, I just wish I could find out why has this been my destiny? I am very easy going and can make friends easily if I meet some new people, during parties I am usually the one being the funny one people laugh at , I even joke about myself a lot and people seem to be enjoying it , I never insult people and when we have some serious discussions that can sometimes get heated (you know how it is sometimes, politics or other sensitive topics) I always make sure not to insult someone I try to keep it calm and never start those topics. 

Overall I consider myself a nice person that would do a lot for my closest friends but it seems it's not the same the other way and its making me very sad. My BF is a very passive person and I am trying to be very active I dont want to sit at home during weekends and even though he goes with me of course I cannot be only with him all the time. It's not even good for the relationship to be with someone all the time and I told that to my friends so many times that I love being around them and they dont need to assume I just want to be with my BF.

TLDR : I have always felt like a third wheel, made lots of friends during my life but never really had a best friend. I consider myself to be nice and usually being the funny one at parties, yet friends usually dont invite me when they go somewhere during the weekend. If I am with them, its mostly because I messaged them and organized it."

I fucking cry when they dry my hair in a hair salon. Because that's the most intimate thing I've felt in my lifetime. 

But now, I don't even care to look at those dating sites let alone posting there. I don't bother to build a connection with people online. If you talk, I will talk. If you stop, I'll stop. I don't even think about why you stopped, did I do something bad, etc. Because I'm so used to people leaving me and I don't give a flying fuck anymore. I don't even fantasize about love life anymore. I don't even have crushes. I don't think twice before saying anything, even if it would make them angry, I say what I feel. 

And this is so liberating. I won't lie that I'm happy. I'm not happy and yes I'm lonely. But I'm not devastated either. This is fine. This is peaceful. I started to like this. 

Have a good day y'all :)"
lonely,At what point should you okay with being lonely,"At what point should you okay with being lonely - Don’t know how I came across this page but I did and Decided to make a throwaway and well vent I guess. 

Honestly I don’t know where to start but here we go my question is as the title says at what point should you be okay with being lonely? For the most part I don’t really care but then it’s days when I wish I had friends. Now I do have a GF and family that I talk to and do stuff with but it’s just I’m tired of talking to the same people all I do is talk to my mom, brother ,cousin and girlfriend everyday which I’m great full for but it’s just like I see my brother texting and talking and hanging out with multiple different people that care about him and I kinda want that too. I wouldn’t say im a shy person it’s just that I’m not very good at starting conversations with people I’m more so interested in tech and things of that nature so when it comes to keeping a conversation or when people are having discussions about sports and different things like that for the most part I sit out of the conversation cause I don’t know much about it and honestly don’t be that interested in it. I see people I went to school with posting videos and pictures of them going out places and tagging people they were out with in stuff and I just sit back and think that I want that sometimes. Idk what it is but I feel like having someone to talk to and even hang out with that’s not family is a great feeling it’s just one I unfortunately don’t get and as of right now I think fuck it I’m okay with it and at some point in my life I’ll start making friends or not and I’ll still talk to the same people I do with now but either way I’m okay with it 

Thanks for listening to me vent for 2 minutes"

I am a 23F and have a masters degree in mathematics. I read a lot (a lot) of marvel and Harry Potter fanfiction. I currently live in the india but I am actively looking for a job so it may change. I also have a healthy interest in fashion. 

I am not a clingy person. I just want simple conversation. So is anyone up?"
lonely,Why cant I be happy kn my birthday?,"Why cant I be happy kn my birthday? - Um so hey guys this is my 2nd time prolly posting so basically my birthday was last week I um am never really excited on my birthday..
What is the most important thing on your birthday ?
You have high expectations of people wishing you talking to you and ofc bringing presents um my parents never really bought me a present whenever I ask them why they didnt they would be like dont be selfish we bought you a dress that is your gift and I would be like ok..on my sis bday I planned hell lot and my parents gifted her a Phone ! And on my birthday they asked me once and guys when someone asks you what you want for your birthday the reflex reply would be ""um hehe I dont know I mean I dont want anything "" so I said this and my mum's like huh tell fast what you want if you dont then leave ...it hurt me so bad till now they haven't given anything well I dont expect anything anymore;'("

I was meeting a friend who lives there but she can't hang out anymore. I really don't want to be alone for the week as my mom's b'day falls towards the end of the week (she passed away in 92.)  So I you live in South Lake Tahoe and would like another friend hit me up. Maybe we can get to know each other over text/voice/video, and then maybe hang out when I'm there for the week!  Maybe we could watch TV and get ice cream or something. I'm making cookies and brownies that I'm taking with me!"
lonely,I'm here for same reasons you all are,"I'm here for same reasons you all are - I'm alone most of the time these days. My ex was also my best friend long before we dated. 
Since our breakup I've been alone. I see a handful of other adults on occasion. My children's mother and her husband and my kids. 
I see no one else anymore. It's been literally a year and I could count on one hand how many times I've seen others outside of that small circle of people.

I'm so tired of being alone. I'm so tired of being lonely. I would love to make some genuine long term connections. But it seems impossible. 

I think I'm hitting the end of my rope. I want to move cities to be closer to family but I can't without abandoning my kids and that's not an option.

So I'm stuck in lonely limbo with no friends and no one that cares about me. 

I could literally disappear and only my kids would notice. No one else would care"
lonely,i miss having someone,"i miss having someone - i miss having someone i could call a close friend. i have friends, and i love them very much. but the last time i really had someone i could call a close friend, someone i could talk to for hours, we would spend hours calling each others and doing nothing, it was too many years ago. i miss waking up and looking foward to talk to someone, knowing i could never annoy them because they look foward to talking with me too."
lonely,Seeing my roommate unpacking his birthday presents from friends broke something inside of me,"Seeing my roommate unpacking his birthday presents from friends broke something inside of me - It was so weird. I just stood there in the same room and you could really feel the happiness from both sides. The giving and the recieving end. Those weren't expensive gifts but they were so thought out.

This isn't about the materialistic character but more about friends actually caring for your birthday. One friend couldn't make it this evening and he wanted to see the reactions of my roommate unpacking so badly, he wanted to facetime.  

Its so selfish to be that envious but in that moment I really felt something dying in me because I know, nobody would do something similar for me.  

It felt so bad just standing there watching. And it feels even worse to write this but I just had to get this off my chest."
lonely,Alone with my thoughts,"Alone with my thoughts - I honestly don't know where to start. I am going to force myself to sleep here in a minute but I guess I'm just reaching out to talk with anyone.
It has been a few weeks since I got a divorce and got out of a mentally manipulative relationship. The thing is, I still love her deep down and it really sucks. I lost my home, job and my dog out of all this. The worst part is, she drilled into my head that my hobbies are a waste of time and I cant get myself to dive into them. So I just sit there and look at my phone until a friend wants to hangout. 
I have to put on a smile and just keep going because they've heard my story already and I dont want to push them away. I just hate being alone with my own thoughts and no distractions. No, suicide is never an option. I make sure of that. I just wish I didn't feel alone is all. Honestly, im not sure if I'm typing this to vent out and get my thoughts down, or if I am typing this to see if anyone wants to talk."
lonely,Miss having someone I could wake up and send a good morning message,"Miss having someone I could wake up and send a good morning message - I really miss having someone that I could wake up and every single day send a good morning message. Then talking all day long with both of us sharing everything that happened, sending pics, relying on one another for support and having a laugh and being playful on the good moments and having sweet talks, and at the end of the day sending a good night message knowing the next day we would be there for each other again.
And now I just feel empty, lonely and heartbroken."

lonely,Lonelyness is that painful comfort,"Lonelyness is that painful comfort - We're all on this sub we're all lonely, you don't need to hear about how long it's been since I've had any intemacy or lack of relationships, we all share that common struggle. Something I've noticed about lonelyness and the pain of it for so long is just how familiar and comfortable it has become in a certain sense. For all intensive purposes being lonely is being in pain, but that pain has been so ingrained into my existence that anything else is horrifying. It's scary, unfamiliar, and almost unknown not to feel it. It is the constant in life, the only thing you know is going to be there when nothing else is. Then there's those faint times of hope where maybe I won't be lonely for the rest of my life. The lack of that pain makes me suspicious of everything and just plan that it will be back in full force in due time, that anything else is temporary. That pain has a weird comfort, equivalent to that toxic person or drug that you only know will hurt you but you go back to anyway because it's familiar."
lonely,Late night thoughts,"Late night thoughts - Does anyone else ever feel like they just weren’t meant to have relationships in life. My friendships are circumstantial, superficial. All of them are in long term relationships. I’ve always been the single one. To be honest I couldn’t even imagine being in love. I keep thinking it’d be easier if I just accept I’m supposed to be alone. Maybe then it would stop bugging me every hour of the day. It just boggles me that people can meet and decide to spend their life with one another. And I don’t see it happening to me."
lonely,Being a social outcast really sucks,Being a social outcast really sucks - Ive almost always been the outcast in school or rhe unpopular friend. It was the worst in college. No one ever talked to me unless I did first. No one ever initiated contact unless I did. Everyone else was super friendly to each  other and almost always ignored me. I heard about many get togethers where they had fun together but I wasn't invited. Everyone follows each other on Instagram except for me. The department Instagram account follows every student except for me. This summer several students had a  fun road trip together but zi wasn't invited. Most of my other friends ignore me unless I do so first.

lonely,Things I find in my note app,"Things I find in my note app - I’m having a hard time being happy lately with myself. I’m not the person I thought I would be at this point. Saying grow and change sounds simple but it feels deeper than that. The past will never be erased no matter how much I try to forget no matter how long ago it was itll always be there in history. And that makes it hard for me to be happy. So I don’t think I’ll ever be 100% happy in life and right now I’m not happy at all. There are moments that feel amazing but overall I’m sad, I’m depressed, I feel alone no matter what anyone says or does, I’m the friend looking out for everyone, I’m always putting everyone else first because I think gratitude is validation but it kinda just hurts when I think about it alone at night. Honestly I feel like a burden and I just want to be left alone most days because I feel like that’s the only thing that’ll bring me peace. Maybe being stuck alone having to face who I am will help me learn who I am and my purpose. I’m just sad and I don’t want help and I don’t want to talk about it I just want to be alone"
lonely,What do I do,What do I do - When I try to tell my SO how I feel when I’m feeling bad or down all she does is raise her voice at me and yell at me. She doesn’t listen to what I have to say or care about what I feel. She immediately turns it around on me and tells me how shitty I am and how I bring her down. Sometimes someone just needs reassurances on little things. But I can’t even get that. I feel trapped and not cared for...

My mom and stepdad probably think I’m gay because I never bring any girls home, but the truth is that I’m just so ugly and worthless that no woman would ever want to be with me. I’m thinking of offing myself but idk. A lot of shit weighs on a man and not having anyone to love or confide in it makes it worse."

lonely,Not really sure what to do anymore,"Not really sure what to do anymore - I’m a 21 year old male, almost 22 and I’m getting so frustrated and unhappy with my love life. For starters, I’ve never been in any kind of relationship. I’ve always wanted to be in a relationship with someone. It seems no matter what I do, the girls I get close to always push me aside for someone else. People always tell me that “being in a relationship isn’t that great” or “you need to be happy with yourself being single before you start looking for a relationship”. But I’ve never had the chance to experience any kind of relationship and I’m sick and tired of being told the same things when I face rejection. 

I got really close to a girl I liked a couple years ago and we both liked each other, but eventually, she ended up going back to her ex boyfriend and nothing ended up happening between us. She just told me I’d make a great boyfriend for another lucky girl somewhere out there. But that’s not the first time that’s happened to me, that’s the third time. With 3 different girls. I have to sit and watch from Facebook or Instagram how happy they are with the person they chose over me, while I struggle to comprehend why I always come second. 

I hate dating apps because I barely get any responses or matches and it just destroys my self confidence. It’s hard to meet new people nowadays because people just judge you based on looks. I wouldn’t consider myself unattractive. I’m fit and healthy, but now I have to second guess myself and question if I am actually attractive or not.

I’m really just stuck, because everything I try seems to backfire on me. I’m sick of coming second to some other guy who doesn’t even give a damn about anyone else besides himself. I’m sick of trying to put effort into finding someone and I’ve been patient for too long. Either way, I always seem to be the second choice whether or not I’m patient or trying to make an effort.

I’m losing all hope right now and it’s effecting all aspects in my life that make me happy. What do I do?

lonely,why can someone care about how i feel?,"why can someone care about how i feel? - they all think im lazy, useless, an idiot, i just...why cant someone just care?

im trying

i just wish i had someone to hug, someone that cared and made me feel like maybe everything's not so bad...and even if he wasnt here, at least maybe someone to talk to? someone that sent me messages? just...someone that cared about me...

no one has ever even tried to care...what should i do for someone to do so? what do i have to change? who do i have to be? What the fuck do i do?!

Why am i so fucking unlovable for everyone? What is wrong with me?...well, many things actually

and even if someone did care, maybe i wouldnt want them to do so without me being fine first...but well, at the same time, i dont think i can actually be fine by myself either...yeah, im stuck, i know

it wasnt supposed to be like this...i was supposed yo be beside someone, to meet some artists, make friends, study in a beautiful place, stay as far away from my home as i could

instead im stuck here...im alone, everyone's insulting and yelling at me, treating me like a moron...i dont even have anyone to call so i dont feel as lonely as i do. im up to the neck with school and exams and all that, im just...im tired

there's no future and im tired...

sometimes i wish i could sleep forever...in there, i have many people that care about me, they all like me, there i have someone that cares about me, we have a wonderful life...in there, im not alone, i dont really have to be, its just us two, and that's more than enough

in there, no one makes fun of me, no one yells at me...i have someone to talk to, someone to sing with, someone to watch movies or play videogames with...someone to hug when im sad and...yeah, but...well, i dont really feel sad, i mean, in there, why would i be? i wouldnt be alone anymore, i'd have no reason to

look at me, speaking of a place that doesnt exist, of a life that isnt really mine, and about a person that in reality, would never care about me...

but i always wish i woke up there, or maybe just, never doing it, cause then, it'd be reality...then i'd have someone that cares, and a nice place to live, in peace and quiet, just, a happy life

maybe i could finally be happy again

i wish i was happy again"

lonely,The news the eye doc gave me today also reminded me how much loneliness bites,"The news the eye doc gave me today also reminded me how much loneliness bites - Apparently, I have retinal detachment in my left eye that I’m gonna need surgery for, and as badly as I felt about that (Because I have a bit of a fear of any sort of sustained eye trauma), what felt worse was my reflection later on in the day that I didn’t have anybody to confide this to, Nobody to show me what a cinch it’ll be and how good it’ll feel to get it fixed. But I also can’t share my good news that I picked out new frames for my glasses and how excited that makes me.

everything has seemed fine. We laughed and played and had great time on and off Xbox It seemed perfect. Except the past 6 months they always have been avoiding me and making plans without me while I’m right there or just straight not telling me what they’re doing with everyone else. I thought these people would be the siblings I couldn’t have. They say they care and call me part of the family but it doesn’t seem like it. Sometimes I wanna leave them all behind and forget but then I’d have no one. I don’t what to do."
lonely,What I hope will happen,"What I hope will happen - I believe that love is unconditional, and I personally accept everyone's personality (friends, family etc.)since everyone has something lovely about them. That doesn't mean I fall for everyone, but I imagine how I would be for that special someone. 

Then the thoughts of why I'm not good enough arises and I convinced myself that in the end, no one would find MY personality, quirks, grossness, body, etc. Very enticing. 

On top of that, if someone does come to me and asks for a number or intends for a relationship, my hand shake and I panic. It's the kind of panic that makes me draw blanks and I feel as if I'm being tested for my life. I then clumsily explain why their efforts make me so glad to hear them (that kind of thing isn't an every day occurence for me; it's like seeing a unicorn) but we wouldn't work out and should find someone who better fits them.

I feel like by telling them this, I'm doing them and myself a favor and not waste time for what (I feel) is the inevitable. 

It hurts when I do this to myself. I'm trying to love myself better, but that panic always sets in if someone gets near. 

As I day dream though, I hope to be married (and stayed married, no divorce) have children, feel the actual weight of a person on me instead of a pillow, and generally create a little life where we, in the end, enjoy being loved by one another. In no ways do I think there wouldn't be problems or obstacles, but I want to be strong enough to face them together. 

I just wished I could just stop the shaking."

Why do people treat me so badly? Is it because I'm not pretty? I've never been able to compete with other girls because I was never beautiful. I'm 250lbs (losing weight) but even when I was skinny no one liked me or wanted me. Why even continue living? I'm always friendly, always warm, inviting, kind...and it's like no one cares.

lonely,Life Is A Prison,"Life Is A Prison - There is no acceptable way to escape life. Doomed to wake up to our smart phone overlords that we use to oh so desperately meet someone but inevitability end up with no one. Sinking deeper and deeper into the hole of insanity with no one to pull you out and the harder you try to make things better only makes things much worse.

 I try to be myself and it makes people uncomfortable. My ability to interact has almost vanished completely. My few friends are less willing to understand. I see no light, only darkness surrounds me in the basement I'm currently living in. I watch as people I know achieve success and are easily loved. They have pets, nice living situations, family, so's... I have to wonder how long before I finally get something nice or feel loved to any sort of degree. And even once I hit the milestones, will I even feel any better at all?

I'm now starting to feel bitter towards people. I get very anxious when I'm near them. I start to feel bugs crawling on me the closer these strangers get to me. They want to ridicule me for being lazy and weak. A social outcast and a lazy bum has no good place in the great wheel of society. Now, I start to love being alone where there is no noise but the chatter in my own head. But the loneliness is still somehow there. The craving for intimacy calls out to me while I lay in bed in the dark. I imagine her hand on my face while touching my hair. I quickly chase the thoughts away, remembering that this imaginary tale I've created in my own head no longer exists for me. I'm too far gone.

23M, if anyone made it this far. I'm reading this back and feel awful. This is so terrible, I sound like a shitty 1600's shakespearian drama artist. Not sure why I'm putting it here but, going to post anyway cause I'm sad. Probably will delete later 👍"
lonely,"I never thought it would happen, but I think I made friends tonight. (17/m)","I never thought it would happen, but I think I made friends tonight. (17/m) -  Before I begin let me give some context as to why this feels so good, and please don’t assume I am trying to make anyone feel bad about themselves, I really know what it’s like to feel lonely all the time, regardless of how many people are around me. I merely want to give hope to people wanting to make friends but not having much success. I have tried and tried many times and failed, but tonight my luck seems to have changed, so please believe your luck can change too. 
 I am decent friends with a lot of people, but struggle to feel ‘close’ to people often. I am lucky enough to have a ‘friend group’ as such, and we commonly hang out and drink or play games and whatnot, but I usually feel like one of the friends who, if they weren’t there, nobody would notice/there wouldn’t be any difference. 
 I live in a country where people are always coming and going, and one of my friends, who has lived here about a year now, introduced some of our group (the ones that commonly play games together on discord) to some of his friends from where he came from who also play games. 
 We have played quite a lot since we first met them over the past week or two, and the last three nights a few of us have stayed up late to chat and chill on discord. Bare in mind I am still at school and wake up at 6am to do so, and the last three nights I’ve gone to bed at 2am, 230am, and as I write this, 4am. I have never stayed up this late either, hence why this feels so big to me.
 Tonight, two of the people who I’ve recently met and I stayed up and chatted to each other for about 4 hours. The two of them have known each other sometime, so we spent our time just chilling and making jokes and getting to know one another. I didn’t think I was capable of making friends who, when talking to them, really felt like I was their friend, or that they wanted to talk to me. With these new guys however, they make me feel like they want to talk to me. 
 Whether they do actually want to talk to me or not, the feeling is amazing and I really appreciated the time that they gave to talk to me. Obviously, based off of the fact I’m writing this, I enjoyed talking and getting to know them, and definitely look forward to spending more time chilling with them, regardless of the fact we’re on different sides of the planet. They made me feel welcome and relevant and for the first time in a VERY long time, especially during the given circumstances, I didn’t feel lonely. 
 To the two of you who stayed up with me, even though you’ll likely never read this, thank you. You cheered up someone who thought they couldn’t be cheered up by people, and made someone happier than they have been in a really long time. 
:)"

I havent been on a date, or even really socialized with anyone my age, for like 6 months now. I live in my parents basement and they're basically the only people I'm in contact with.

I have a few family members with whom I have a complicated relationship and I have a few friends but we're not particularly close. I know these people care about me but I'm not anyone's priority. I've been really struggling lately and sometimes I just need to talk to someone but I can't because everyone is busy with their own families and lives. If I need to call someone in the middle of the night because of a crisis, there is no one I can call. I know it's natural for everyone to focus on their partners and families and I am not blaming them for anything but as someone who is single I find it really difficult to deal with the fact that aanot the end of the day no one is really there for me. I live in a very individualistic western society that centers around the nuclear family and it seems it's very easy to become isolated if you don't have a family of your own. I know this won't change so I'm mostly looking for any tips on how to accept this and not let it bother me as much as it does now."

Feeling like a burden to anyone I speak to and know that I just come across as annoying and slowly push everyone away. 

It’s like alcohol numbs the pain of my own thoughts but I don’t have anyone to share it with so I just suffer in the glass as I pour another gin. Ghosted again by a stranger on the internet why does it hurt like that.

Loneliness is a pain in the ass, it take ALL the energy away from you, makes you feel bad, is bad for your health, makes you feel more suspicious of other people and more desperate at the same time.

But when I began playing among us and talking with the players on discord, I finally feel happy.

I have what is probably a kidney infection and stones, this afternoon I was in extreme pain, and there was absolutely no one I felt like calling. My family is too far away to be able to do anything but worry, so I don't like to do so in this kind of situation, it just makes them feel helpless. 

My husband just goes straight into ""I need to fix this"" mode, and even though that's helpful sometimes, sometimes it's just downright aggravating, this was one of them. I knew that if I called him about it it would only make me feel worse, not better, but after crying from the pain for a bit, I decided to give it a go.

My girlfriend of around 10 months just cut contact with me entirely while I’m on a month long trip for work, I don’t have any close friends &amp; the ones I have are only still here because they’ve kept me at an arm’s length, and I’ve done plenty of unsavory &amp; shitty things to my family members that are still around as well.

I'll try to summarize it as best as I can because my English is not the best one and I'm still learning even after the 5 years of practise I had from school, videogames and Youtube. If you'll have any questions, please do ask in the comments and I'll reply as quickly as possible.*

Trough my 18 years of existence, people around me always put in my mind that everyone is special and different, which is a good thing because by that everyone has a different purpose in life and fit in the group they're intended to be in. I did not really understand it until I was 8 years old. In that time, I just used my imagination of the world around me, which led to me being lonely, because nobody (even my mom) didn't understand what my intentions were. Even I don't really know what were the things I did as a kid were for, but none the less, because of that I am a person I am today.

I didn't really have any friends until I finally got to high school I am currently in. I am studying a graphic design, which makes me use my imagination pretty often thankfully. But even tho I finally have some people to talk to from school, it just doesn't really feel like I have connections to these people. These people don't really know my whole story, even tho they act as they do.

I'm not saying that my friends are bad people, they definitely aren't and I'm glad I got to meet them in my timeline of events! The problem I have with them is that they just cannot see what I see and they can't hear what I hear. The jokes I make are only funny to me, not to anybody else. When I do art and show it to someone, their only reply is ""Wow, that is cool"" and ""Wow, that is nice,"" but I know for a fact that they don't understand that thought behind it and what I tried to say. I can try so much to put my vision into my drawings, but It just seems like I fail at it every single time.

The only thing I hear most of the time is that my art is nice, which I know already. I'm not trying to sound cocky or anything, but do they think that if I would make something I disliked that I would even show it to someone? My art is the art I like and I enjoy making it, but if people around me don't really see the point of it, then what's the point of making anything? What do you do, when people cannot understand what you're trying to say?

People are different, but I wish the exact opposite. I'm tired of being that dude who's alone even in a room full of thousands of people. I know I'll never find the love of my life, even if people tell me it just takes time, but I am already tired of waiting because I know that nobody is perfect for me. I have many problems and I would just be another problem but for my partner.

I'm not ready for this world. I know I am not. But I finally have to do something about it. Tomorrow I'll contact a psychiatrist from my town to see if I can do something about myself. I don't see any other possibility, so I just have to believe this one will do."

It's like the universe is laughing at me for being such a naive idiot that someone like me can actually find another person who can be my other half. As cheesy as that sounds. 

I just want to have someone to talk to after or during work. Someone to celebrate all these upcoming holidays with. Someone to cook with and someone who doesn't mind warm hugs. 

I look all around me and everyone seems so happy with their person and I'm just sitting alone on a bench feeding a bunch of loud ass birds and occasional furry friend. 

I mean, I'm okay with being alone sometimes, because I do have to recharge after I've done a lot in a day, but it's like a quiet yearning for something or someone who can, I dunno, smile at me and give me some warmth to my cold.

I’ve reached peak loneliness. Since leaving my job and lockdown I’ve found myself with more time to get lost in my thoughts and it hurts. I have a few friends offline I can talk to but they have their own group of friends, I’m more of ‘invite out to party friend’ rather than a ‘friend’ friend if that makes sense. Friendships I’ve made with co-workers in my previous jobs have all sadly fizzled out. I feel like I’m an acquaintance friend, fun to have around but not meaningful friendship material. I know I’ve past the age of making genuine friends and It’s eating me up inside. I’ve gone weeks and months without speaking to anyone other than my family throughout lockdown. I’m unsure what to do with myself, I feel empty. I feel like I’m not good enough for anyone, like this is going to be my life forever.

Sorry this rant has been all over the place and I feel stupid when I vent but I’m open to talking to anyone :)"

lonely,Silly me for thinking three good days meant things are looking up,"Silly me for thinking three good days meant things are looking up - This entire year I’ve been really anxious and anti social at school. Yesterday I thought I’d be better and try talk to people, since the past two days I did it at work and it felt nice (as opposed to keeping my head down and just working). I can’t say I didn’t have a good day—I talked to people I don’t usually talk to and saw people I’ve been meaning to talk to.

When I woke up I got hit with a truck load of emotion. I can’t seem to shake things that have happened. The smallest memories always stay with me; like once my friend didn’t stop to have a conversation once and it seemed like she didn’t want to talk to me, and to this day that crushes me. 

I just want people to care. I want someone to acknowledge that I am capable of having these feelings. My parents don’t understand. My closest friend won’t let me break that barrier in our friendship where we acknowledge our feelings and really listen to each other. 

People think I’m well off because I’m introverted, I seem confident, I have a boyfriend and know people who have lots of friends. They would never believe I envy almost anyone.

I’m kinda talking to this guy I like, we don’t talk all the time and usually he starts the conversation. Right now we’re not talking and I’ve been hesitating for hours if I should text him. I think that if he’s not talking to me is because he doesn’t want to and I don’t want to bother. And so it goes with everyone I know. It’s definitely a part of my social anxiety but sigh...

lonely,just want a soulmate,"just want a soulmate - it’s my first time posting on this sub, and i’ve read many other posts in this sub which i can relate to very much.

recently i’ve been feeling lonelier than ever. i have a few close friends and caring family who love me, but somehow i still feel empty and lonely inside. for some context, i’m a freshman in university and because of covid, i haven’t made a single friend since the semester started. my group mates are nice but i wouldn’t consider them people that i can sustain long conversations with. apart from that, i’ve never dated in my entire life. i’m not saying i’m actively looking for a partner, because i feel that i should learn to love myself first before loving someone else; and i shouldn’t date because i am lonely, but date when i am ready. i am also an only child, both my parents are busy and tired from work on weekdays. hence, i’m mostly alone at home most of the time since my classes are mostly online. this has kind of intensified the feelings of loneliness although i have become used to it.

instead, what i really need is a soulmate. not a best friend, lover or family member but a soulmate. i’m not sure how to put this into words but i just want someone i can share my interests with, have late night heart to heart talks with, hang out and go on adventures with. whenever i watch movies or go out shopping or eating alone, i wish for someone to be there to share my experiences and feelings, just as i would share theirs. i do hang out with my close friends once every few months (they are all busy and we live far apart) so what i really wish for now is a soulmate that can truly understand me. 

i really do hope to find a soulmate in my lifetime, and with that i would be satisfied with my life. am i the only one who is feeling this way?"

lonely,Deep longing for love and intimacy.,"Deep longing for love and intimacy. - Its not easy being single when you have a deep, burning desire for love and intimacy, someone to share your life with.
Especially when you have had this desire for many years and you feel your emotional needs are unmet all the time.
It just feels unreachable to me right now.
People around me often asked me why I am still single. Because apparently you can’t be single when you have good looks.💁🏻‍♂️
Well it has nothing to do with my looks OR my personality but more with my traumatic past (including years of bullying and growing up with a narcissistic parent).
To cope with with this emptiness, I had to teach myself to find happiness from within.
Because I never learned how to love myself so how can I share that with someone which I don’t have myself?
I certainly grew during this progress, since I sort of healed from my codependency and learned to accept myself for who I am (my father never truly did), but my desire for love and intimacy is still there, waiting to be fulfilled. 
I am not giving up on love since I know I have a lot to offer. I just try to accept my life how it is now and focus on healing my childhood wounds through therapy."
lonely,Moved half way across the country with my partner and struggling to make friends,"Moved half way across the country with my partner and struggling to make friends - I moved half way across the country with my partner for his job and I just realised this weekend I feel really lonely. We were suppose to do an online Halloween day thing with our shared group of friends but then last minute they’ve changed their plans to see each other instead which automatically excludes us because of the distance and lockdown restrictions.  Then we were going to do something different online with one of them who weren’t going to meet the group but he’s cancelled on us too to join the friendship group face to face.  He said he wants to make time for everyone but it just feels like a slap in the face tbh because they see each other every single week but don’t want to stick to the original online plan so that we can ‘see’ them for the day. 

I’ve only been at this job for a month and I’ve not really got any friends from work who I’d feel comfortable asking to hang out or do anything outside of work. I’ve not been able to make any friendships from anyone at uni because I don’t attend the same lectures as them since I’m part time uni.  And most of its online now anyway. I literally don’t know anyone in the area and COVID means I can’t go join a sports or hobby group. 

My partner is amazing and supportive but there’s not a lot he can do to stop me feeling so isolated. It makes me want to cry.  I’m jealous of him in honesty because he’s got friends from work and people he can go to the pub with if he wanted to.  He knows this but I don’t blame him for it. I’m really happy for him and it’d suck even more if he felt as lonely as me too. 

I know once COVID settles I’ll find it easier hopefully to find a friend or two to hang out with. But it still sucks. I feel like our shared friendship group have just not bothered to keep in touch even though we both make an effort to try and contact them."
lonely,A stupid vent about my life. Not worthy reading to be honest..,"A stupid vent about my life. Not worthy reading to be honest.. - I’ve always been a lonely person. Typical loner, not a lot of drama. But one thing I’ve learned is not that I’m replaceable, but rather I don’t need a substitute at all. It’s a spot no one wants, everyone is happy when it’s empty because I’m never a love interest, a best friend or a loved one. Not a kind of person someone would need to replace. I just exist for people to make fun of. 
I graduate in 3 months. But my grades suffer due to my social situation at school. I don’t have a single friend or someone to talk to, they rather make fun of it belittle me for being neurodiverse, an immigrant and being „overly interested“ in basically every topic, History, Politics, Physics etc.. they already voted me top one „nerd“ for the senior yearbook ranking and this again showed me how ridiculous I must be to everyone. I try my best, I want to share love with people, I’m always as nice as I can be, help where I can. I like making people happy and comfortable and try to not seem pushy. The response is always people taking advantage of me and leaving me behind after only a few weeks. I’m just down. I can’t go back to school, it’s literal hell for me. I just want someone to talk to and not feel like having to watch my every word because I know it will be gossiped about and be used against me."

lonely,Stuck 300 miles from home. Really homesick,"Stuck 300 miles from home. Really homesick - Hi I’m sorry I’m advance for how long this is going to be. I’m 17 and this half term I decided to make a motorbike trip up from Norwich to Cumbria. Camping for 5 nights and staying in a hostel for 2. As i am riding a 125cc on L plates I can’t use motorways. Because of this The fastest route takes roughly 8 hours with no stops and is about 300 miles. I am doing it with 4 other friends who are travelling in the car. On the first day I made it to lake Windermere when it was already dark. This was around an two hours ride still to my campsite and I couldn’t feel my fingers or toes any more and I was soaked though even with my full body waterproofs on. I gave up and checked into a hotel for the night. In the morning I had to drive over the hard knot pass to meet my friends at the campsite. My friends wanted to go on a three night wild. Camping hike before staying in the hostel. Usually I would be really down for this but I still feel really downtrodden after the long ride up here. Instead I have booked myself into a bed and breakfast place near Wasdale head for the next three nights. I spent last night in the campsite and it rained and hailed all night absolutely soaking my cheap tent. My friends just left to start their hike and I am sitting in the only pup for miles, regretting leaving home. I don’t really want to do anything as it is so wet and cold and going anywhere in the nicer parts of the lakes like Grasmere or Ambleside would mean going back over the hard knot pass.

I don’t have many friends and the ones I consider my friends I feel like I have to reach out to. Sometimes when my thoughts snowball and I think who would care if I was gone. I try not to go on Instagram because I know I will see pictures of people from my high school who are popping out babies, getting engaged, preparing for their wedding or just coupled up. I feel a joint of jealousy because I know I’m no where near where I wish I was. Loosing friends over the years has taken a toll on me. Now I feel like I won’t have that strong group of friends and I really miss that feeling. I’m 24 now nearly 25 and I wish I had a boyfriend someone to love and who loves me.

Even with the girl I tought i liked most, we never got realy close.

Now, I’m sitting in my house alone, the silence is deafening. I’ll see my friend online playing our favorite game, she doesn’t reach out or try to invite me anymore. We used to play for hours and then talk. I think I annoyed her and others around me just by taking an interest in them and opening up. It’s made me think I will always be alone no matter how hard I’ll try."
lonely,"I really need a friend right now, so I'm going to pour my heart out to you","I really need a friend right now, so I'm going to pour my heart out to you - Hai reddit, I've managed to make friends here in the past who ended up being really big aspects of my life. Honestly I'm here right now, because a friend I made a few months ago here, ended up being one of the best friends I feel like I've ever had. I grew really strong feelings for them and I was so sure that they felt the same, but they ended up confiding in me that they like somebody else, so I admitted my feelings. We went from talking and hanging out every single day, to just not doing that anymore. I feel like I've been replaced, and like I'm just not as important anymore. I really did love them a lot, I have been a complete and total mess. I spent the entire day yesterday crying, but I've tried being more productive. I would really just like a new friend. Someone who gives me their time because they enjoy my company and I do the same for them.

Some things I like to do and what you should know about me:

    I have extremely bad anxiety. I suffer agoraphobia and AvPD. I find it really hard to handle talking to people. One on one I can kind of manage it but in a group form it becomes really difficult for me. I basically shut down from the anxiety. I also find it difficult to open up to people, it takes me some time. I like patient and understanding friends who let me go at my own pace.

    Video games! It's the best way to spend time with someone imo. I would play pretty much anything with a friend. On my own time I tend to play single player games. My favorite genre's are metroidvania and hack &amp; slash games, and I love a good story. I tend to tackle difficult challenges in games because it is fun and a good time waster.

    Art! I love anything creative really. I love polymer clay and want to learn how to cross stitch. Doing smithing and making jewelry would be a dream for me to try. I make pixel art myself.

    Podcasts and Music! I mainly listen to gaming, true crime, and paranormal podcasts. It's a good way to distract myself and feel like someone is talking to me, so I don't feel so alone. I love all kinds of music but I mainly listen to synthpop, dreampop, chiptune, lofi, anime OP/EP. I'm also trying to learn piano right now, and make my own music. I just started so it's a journey.

    Movies/Anime! I love horror movies. 2000 era is the best but I'd watch anything once, unless it bores me to death. I haven't watched anime in awhile but it's something I do like to do. I'd love watching stuff together if we get along.

Honestly, I'm just really lonely, and very sad. I miss my friend, they were the light in my life and made me so happy. I'm scared I won't be able to find something like that again. I guess this is my attempt to scream into the void and hope something good comes out of it. I've had my fair share of toxic friendships, and the really good, special connections seem to happen literally out of nowhere, when you're not even looking for it. Yes I need a distraction right now, but if we become close you'd be so much more than that to me. I really love and care about my friends.

Please message me if anything I said resonated with you... I feel so alone right now. Tell me a joke or something if you read this far so I know you didn't just skim my wall of text. Sending good vibes, and thank you. c: &lt;3

EDIT: I forgot to add, please just be 18+"
lonely,Her own mirror of pain and sorrow. Of her own life. 💔,"Her own mirror of pain and sorrow. Of her own life. 💔 - One rainy day while hearing the drops falling. She looked into the cracked mirror.  she looked at her damaged, broken deep brown eyes. She always thought she was cursed because of all the pain in her past. All she thought was a fallen angel. 

She looked at her tears in the sink. Someone told her to look back up. It was magic the cracks were fixed. 

She saw what everyone told her a beautiful, strong woman my dad wanted me to be. 

There will always be shards will always be there in her memories. Sadly sometimes she finds the cracks coming back, she always finds a way. 

She is a Survivor!! ♥️ Will always be that won't change"

lonely,Should be over the moon but never felt so lonely and depressed.,"Should be over the moon but never felt so lonely and depressed. - Last spring, after a family crisis I (25f) made the decision to move 3000 miles away with my daughter and move in with my boyfriend (not an internet boyfriend, we're from the same place and I've known him for 10 years) I still stand by my decision as its what was best for my daughter and I. 

Thanks to the current pandemic I haven't made any friends or even mom friends. The women I work with are my only real interaction and they all have children my age. My boyfriend is a field tech so he travels for work. He started last Monday at a new company and is gone for 2 weeks, home next weekend then gone for two more.

 Well I found out I was pregnant Monday afternoon. We were trying for a baby but didn't expect it to happen in the first month. I was so excited at first. But I dont even have someone to share my excitement with. I've told my best friend but she's across the country and it's not the same. I'm not ready to tell my family and have a hard time believing my mother with be very congratulatory. 

Over the course of this week my feeling of loneliness has multiplied exponentially. I didnt have much support from my daughter's father when I was pregnant at 18 and this is bringing me back to that. I at least had my family and my father (passed away in March from late stage cancer). Here I have no one. I'm in a better place to have a child but I feel like I'm gonna be doing this by myself and that makes me really fucking sad. I've cried more times this week than not. My boyfriend doesn't get home for another week then he basically turns back around for another two weeks. 

I'm so afraid I'm going to be doing this alone: pregnancy, all the appointments, finding out the gender, giving birth, God forbid anything goes wrong, all the ups or downs, raising two kids and a dog and working and trying to be a good mom. 

 I really just need a hug right now but the only person I have is my daughter and I love her hugs but she's 6 and clueless to everything going on (for the best till I'm farther along)"

People from all walks of life can feel lonely to varying degrees and in different ways, but this subreddit has shown me that while my problems may not be particularly common, there are many out there who have similar experiences, and a few who are uncannily similar.

Whether you're married, single, 16 or 70, man or woman, I can relate to people here, and to me that means the world. I've always felt a bit of an oddball, but in the end we're all in this together, lonely, but together."

Feels like I am going to get over this hill, and get rid of all my useless emotional baggage that makes me want to off myself so much. I have not achieved nothing in my life.

I got bored at 1:00 AM and randomly stumbled upon this subreddit. I was viewing the feed without an account and made the decision to make a Reddit account just to join. Now if that's not dedication, I don't know what is. So yeah, with COVID going on my days have been pretty boring. All I do mostly is schoolwork and talk to the few people I still talk to on Discord. I just stopped talking to someone that I'd consider a close friend for about 3 years. It's been hard, but I think I'm managing all right. If you want to start up a conversation, send me a message. If things seem to be going well, I'll consider providing my Discord to select individuals.

lonely,I feel...,"I feel... - Idk if this is the place for this or not. I’ve never shared anything on here before. 
I feel so alone. I know I’m depressed and that makes me isolate, which in turn makes me push away the few people I have and fuels the fire of feeling alone. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not actually alone. My family has my back. But I hate being a burden, I don’t want it to drag them down. And they aren’t near. There’s only so much comfort to be had over a call. 
I’m so overwhelmed with school and the environment I live in. I can’t focus on anything and I feel like a failure for not being able to do enough. I feel like no one understands me. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere and no one wants to be around me, like everyone has someone they’d rather be around. And who can blame them? I’m a dark cloud right now and lately every semblance of “I’m okay” is just a lie, a mask of how I really feel. Some days I’m proud that I can do it mostly all on my own, and other days I just want someone to hold me and tell me it will be okay. I’m so tired of feeling like I have to fight for everything. I feel like I’m not even in control anymore. I’m just hanging on for the ride that is life.  
I question if my loneliness is because people don’t like me or if I do something wrong. I know I push people away. 
I’m scared to be real, to get hurt. I often wonder if I’ll always feel alone. I’ve only ever had one relationship and it left me feeling so broken, even after all this time. It ending made me feel like it was my fault. That I didn’t work hard enough to make it work, or I wasn’t good enough. It’s hard for me to imagine anyone ever wanting me or loving me romantically again because I don’t feel like I’ll ever be enough. 
As you can see, there is a lot of different levels of lonely here. And at times like this it feels like I will never escape it."

Nobody cares about me nor i don't have anybody real - personal relationship - so i can meet him

I hate my self more when i go to restureaunt and set with my self on the table, every customer there they came with a group either friends or family.

I feel the waiting time is very long 

I don't have any cousins nor brother nor sister care to come with me

My brothers only talking to me on wasting time material like video games and anime and i didn't remember they are stand with me on any social events like graduating from high school , my sisters only talking to me of they need something, and my co workers only about work

Nobody in my circle of acquaintances talk to me about life, when i go every day to bed  i'm thinking every time when i will have friends? Why i'm wasting my time on playing video games and watching? Is it because i have nothing to do and the whole day i have a free time?

On December i have my annual leave but i'm not exciting because i know i will not have any social activities and will stay home .

I didn't feel my presence at all, if the sucide is not haram and sin then i will commit it.

I feel like when I’m doing things alone (besides those things), I’m just so entirely bored no matter what it is. But if I’m doing any activity with at least just one other person, I have a great time. 

I literally have no local friends so the past few months, I’ve literally been flying to people that I’ve been meeting online to hang out with....it’s absolutely pathetic. So when I say “I have no one,” I legitimately have nobody around me. I go to restaurants by myself, social events by myself, driving trips by myself....always by myself. 

The only social interaction I ever get is when I go out to bars and stuff, but nothing ever comes from it.

I recently bought a kayak, a spacious tent, and things like that, but as I said, I just get bored after about an hour or so if I’m solo.....I hate it.

lonely,Came to the realisation of how lonely i actually am,"Came to the realisation of how lonely i actually am - I sleep with my pillows arranged in a specific way, with one upright on my side so it can feel like my head is on someone’s chest. Or sometimes i’d hold it on top of me to feel like i’m hugging them. Whenever a nice song comes on I grab a pillow and slow dance with it. or i’d hug my jacket that i’ve just used and i imagine it’s the warmth of another person. Id talk to my stuffed animals and with myself almost 24/7. Id have conversations with the air and i turn my head and move my eyes to where i think the person i’m talking to is, to make it more realistic. I’m pretty sure i have a problem with physical touch now since i’ve been deprived of it for so long...whenever someone tries to hug me i tense up and don’t hug back and if they touch me in any way like rubbing my back or anything like that i twitch and get really uncomfortable. Sometimes i feel so lonely, i don’t feel like interacting with people at all. Like i know i’m not able to form connections, and when i try, and fail, it makes me feel worse. So i just stop trying. Yet there’s still a huge part of me that craves it too. I refuse love and i hate the fact that i’m acting like this because it makes me sick. 

But, i think until you’ve really been in the depths of loneliness, it’s so hard to describe the lengths that you go,  and the things that you do to combat it. Loneliness is something you can drown in, it’s something that can overcome you. And i think if talking to yourself or your toys brings you some comfort, then do it."

It sucks to be single already but it just hurts when people are constantly reminding you of it and society keeps shining light on this perfect lifestyle that is working towards having an own family
lonely,So fkin lonely and miserable,"So fkin lonely and miserable - Literally just made this account so I can find a place to vent about my shit life. I’m so fucking lonely and miserable. I’ve felt like this for as long as I can remember. In addition with my depression, it makes it a million times worse. It’s to the point where it physically hurts almost, as if your heart is being crushed into bits. As a 20 y/o male, I’ve never been in an actual relationship and have never had any luck with girls since I’ve been rejected countless times. I’ve tried so many fucking times but it’s like not a single person in the world wants me. I don’t know why I just feel like if I were to get into a healthy relationship, I would feel less shitty as I know that there would be someone by my side all the time to help me get through my problems and have a shoulder to lean on. 

Every time I see a couple, I ask myself “will I ever get this?” But I already know the answer is no. Even when I’m out with friends and family, I still feel lonely as fuck which leads to other depressing thoughts which makes me wanna go home and be depressed alone. I can’t and don’t want to even inform my friends or family about my depression because I know I’ll get the same old “it’ll be okay” answer. I hate being alone and depressed. I just want someone to talk to, heart to heart."
lonely,I feel like I have to cut my family out a bit,"I feel like I have to cut my family out a bit - I have a best friend to whom I am very close. other than my family he is the only one who knows how truly broken and obnoxious I am. He can be a jerk sometimes but he is a really good friend who listens to my high anxiety bipolar rants about work and other people. I have no one else. I have a texting acquaintance who I used to work with but we don't hang out or talk on the phone and yeah, I literally have no other friends. Because as I mentioned I have mental health issues and high anxiety I cling to my parents although I live alone and in a different city. I call them way too many times a day and they are at the point after years of this that they just don't want to hear from me anymore. my dad was never a big talker but I used to be able to sit and chat with my mom about what was troubling me and my thoughts. Now she just doesn't want to talk to me she is rude to me and that's that. by the way my mental health issues are largely resolved by medication my only symptom is being intense and having high anxiety. I work, shop, workout and have a normal life. No one but the people who know me intimately know what a crazy person I am, not even my coworkers. I'm writing this post to let anyone and everyone reading to know that if you want to chat send me a DM. I realized after my parents have been getting ruder and ruder to me over the phone and in person over the last month that it's time to take a little break from them and that little break is going to leave me very lonely. My best friend gets sick of me too and I can't rely on him for 100% emotional support. I feel of physical pain in my chest that feels like a void and it just feels like emotional pain that I can't really describe other than saying a void. if anyone else experiences the physical ache of the void please message me so I know I'm not all alone."
lonely,I feel tired today,"I feel tired today - I fall in love with people who show me even a shred of human decency, then get heartbroken when they aren't interested. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm far too sensitive to develop a romantic relationship with someone. It terrifies me that I might never learn how to do this. I've felt this fear so many times that I'm growing very frustrated with myself, and very tired of other people's disinterest. Can anybody relate to this feeling? How do you cope?"

lonely,I have no friends at 24.,"I have no friends at 24. - I just want someone that I can consider a friend. 

I haven't had a friend in so long. It hurts so much knowing that there's absolutely no one that truly cherishes me as a person. There are so many people out there that take their friendships for granted, but if I had even a single friend I'd consider myself the luckiest person in the world. 

I don't know what I did wrong, honestly. Ever since I was little, people ignored me, made fun of me, and actively bullied me. I didn't deserve any of it, but maybe I did? There must be a reason, right? Can people be born unlovable? 

I don't know. I carried all that baggage through high school, and the personality problems that developed as a result of my earlier experiences just made me isolated and lonely. No one gave a fuck about me, and I made no effort to make them care. I would just retreat into a corner and be alone. I didn't belong there. The bullying continued, because I was too ""weird"", I guess. 

Even in college, where I suddenly transformed into a more social and outspoken person, I couldn't forge any long-lasting relationships. I was too afraid to fuck it up because people like me always fuck it up somehow. I was never gonna make friends there or anywhere, because I never made friends in high school or elementary because there is something fundamentally wrong with me, so why even try, right? Some people are meant to be alone and, no matter how hard they try, they will always be alone. 

I'm so sorry for the long rant. I'm just tired of being myself right now. I don't even want to be near me."

lonely,Ghosted by my favorite singer. Left me feel extremely lonely.,"Ghosted by my favorite singer. Left me feel extremely lonely. - Hi everyone. I posted this in a similar way to another subreddit. But the situation left me feeling empty and lonely. I’m sorry if this doesn’t count for this subreddit; I don’t have anyone else to really talk to and I’m stuck in lockdown still. 


A year ago I met my favorite singer. We hit it off and added each other on Instagram. I gave them art and we talked on and off nearly everyday and week. I was mutual friends with people they knew and friends with the people in the community built around the music. Everything seemed fine. This person would open up to me, send voice messages, and things like that (even when they were touring). 

Fast forward to about a year later and they start drifting. Sometimes I’m left on read, I politely ask and I’m told I’ve done nothing wrong, they’re busy etc. and I’m like sure. Makes sense: I don’t expect this person to spend lots of time on me, they are busy with a career after all. (They’re not in a relationship as another possible explanation)

In May they ask for concept album art. I say sure, I don’t do any of the regular comission safe guards because they’re my friend: they’re verified and I trust them after all. Even their guitarist talks to me and follows me. 

I have to make a new account because of certain issues and re add them. I’ve done everything I can to make sure they know it’s really me and everything is cool: everyone else adds me back including the guitarist. 

The singer, however, won’t add me back. And it’s been months since he will reply to me. He has seen my new account story and art. He’s even immediately responded to my friends and even a spam account I tried.  But he won’t have anything to do with me suddenly. 

No message, tag, or anything gets him to reply while he’s openly replying to nearly everyone else. 

I don’t know what I did wrong. If anything. 
I feel completely ignored and ghosted but I can’t even have this conversation with the singer because they do not answer. I know I need to move on, but this has never happened to me before. I could ask the guitarist but I don’t want to start drama. And it hurts so much. 
Thanks for reading.

TL;DR was(is?) friends with favorite singer for over a year and I’m suddenly ghosted even though they talk to mutual friends and strangers. Guitarist is super friendly with me too. But I feel so lonely after this significant friendship just disappeared."
lonely,Not sure if my friends are actually my friends...,Not sure if my friends are actually my friends... - I honestly feel like my 'friends' aren't really there anymore. Before this whole Pandemic situation I used to see my friends pretty much everyday in school but now since we go for 3 days a week we don't see each other as much. So I've tried to stay in touch but I feel like they don't really care. Whenever I try to start a conversation over text  end up getting a reply the next day or a few days later. They say it's because they've been busy but it's evident that I'm being ignored.

lonely,I read something the other day that really stuck with me: being a man is a lesson in depravity.,"I read something the other day that really stuck with me: being a man is a lesson in depravity. - As I sat back to think about that, it didn’t take long at all to see how it applied to my life. I have many acquaintances, and a handful of very close friends.

Disclaimer: I am aware that what I mentioned above is more than what most people have here. I’m not making this post to get into a pissing match about who has it worse. Dating and relationships are tough for both sexes, this post will be about the struggles of dating as a male, simply because I am a male.

So, back to the point. It is a common assumption and most of the time it turns out to be true that a man’s girlfriend is his sole source of emotional support and as such it’s possible for him to dump a massive amount of emotional baggage on her at once.

This isn’t the case with my friends though, we are each other’s emotional support systems, and we have deep meaningful conversations often so if I ever do enter into a relationship at least it won’t be with emotional baggage.

Here’s where the “lesson in depravity” comes in. No matter how many friends I have, they will never take the place of romantic affection from someone that is interested in me as more than a friend. 

I’m so touch starved and deprived from affection in general, but there’s nothing I can do to fix it, that requires a woman who wants to be affectionate with me. I can count on one hand the amount of compliments I’ve received from women-7. 25 years old and I received 7 compliments from women, each one I can remember like it was yesterday, I remember what I was wearing, what she was wearing, what the weather was like lol. 

Growing up as a man you learn to live without affection on a regular basis (at least I have anyway) but that doesn’t lessen my internal need and longing for it. Maybe someday my body won’t feel like it’s on fire every time I see PDA, because the PDA will be happening to me too."
lonely,Taking a break from social media,"Taking a break from social media - So, this will actually be my first og post ever on Reddit and I just felt like getting this off my chest after being a lurker for so long.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that I have great friends who always look out for me. My family can be a pain to deal with but I do honestly believe they love me and would do anything for me but as any kid brought up in a very strict household knows, that you hide and bottle up your feelings as much as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized this was a terrible thing to do during my university years as you became really closed off from everyone. Cannabis was an opener for me and I started to become a lot more social and out-going.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this, I still feel incredibly lonely. I think it is because of the fact that I have never had a meaningful relationship that has lasted more than a couple of months. I never talk to anyone about my traumas as I believe what happened in the past, should be left in the past. As of late, this has been weighing me down as I look at social media and see all these couples related posts or stories. Previously, I would just ignore it and would think ""my time will come"" but as time goes on, I just started feeling more and more restless and depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I watched ""the social dilemma"" and while I think I was always subconsciously knew how social media would track us and gives us posts where we would engage more, I was never aware of the phycological effects it can have. As such, I have to come to believe that social media may be the cause of my depressing attitude and have decided to take a minimum 2 week hiatus from it. Everything but reddit, since I don't really consider it to be social media. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am hoping that I bounce back from this and come out a lot better. I am not sure if this will help anyone or if anyone even has the same thought process but it is just something I want to share. Thank you for coming to my ted talk :)"

lonely,Incase someone else feels as overwhelmed by life and the uncertainty of their future as I do.,"Incase someone else feels as overwhelmed by life and the uncertainty of their future as I do. - Like most people, I’ve been through a lot in my life. The worst of the things all happened before I turned 26. 8-10 traumatic memories/events whatever of varying degree. No support from my family when I very clearly needed to be in therapy, I was told you are just sad - you’ve been through hard things it’s normal to be sad. 

I wasn’t just sad. I was deeply depressed. My depression over time was kind of shaped like a W. Two deep deep bottoms, the ways down and back up and down and back up again. I’m back up after my second deep bottom. But I’m struggling. 

I ended a relationship that was not good for me. I am proud of that. I have my own place. I am proud of that. I have a pet who keeps my company. I’m proud of that. I have a full time job even in this crazy time. I’m proud of that. 

However. I don’t have many family members left. And I’m an adult, they all have their own lives, and I don’t want to burden them. I’ve expressed before how I am not doing great mentally and they gave support but maybe we check in with each other every 2-3 months. I don’t have parents. 

I know I am not ready for another relationship again yet and I already made the decision to take time to myself. But this has been made difficult by me feeling very unmotivated and very very lonely and sad. No one reaches out much. Most of it is light chit chat. I am on a strict budget and it would make me too nervous to pay for a therapist, what if I need emergency funds? What if I lose my job (the way the world is going makes me too damn nervous so take on any extra payments even if I know it would benefit me). 

So I am posting here. I’m very lonely. When I’m alone which is most of the time if I’m not at work, I’m in my head. I read sad or messed up stories on here and think “well at least I didn’t have to deal with that”. But if I put everything I’ve experienced. Well, people would know who I am because my wide array of events is not common, just the one thing specifically is not common. 

I don’t want to burden my friends or family. But I don’t want to get back down to the deep darkness where I push everyone away and can’t get out of bed. I’m ashamed I let myself get that bad before. I don’t want to again. And so far I’m holding out but I am seeing a worrying amount of my bad cooping mechanisms all front and center. 

Mostly just wanted to write that out. I don’t need sympathy. I’m tired of hearing I’m sorry. Advice is better tho, we know some things are easier said than done. 

I more just want people to know, not everyone you think is happy, actually is. Or you think they are “normal” or well-adjusted. People in my life know what I’ve been through, but I put on a mask and say I’m fine and I would never speak about how bleak and hopeless I feel to them. So I suffer in silence."

lonely,I'm tired of being anxious and depressed,"I'm tired of being anxious and depressed - 

Being an 19 year old Eastern European male who just graduated from school I never had a romantic relatioship while trying multiple times but miserably failing because of my social awkwardness. Since the beginning of the quarantine my life only got worse. I'm not planning to go to a college and my parents earn a decent amount of money at their jobs, so they are not pushing me to go get one myself. For the last 5 months I was practically isolated in my room just staring at my monitor.

I realised a long time ago that all I need is a simple human interaction, but I'm too anxious and self conscious to reach out to people outside my family (even now, when I'm writing this while walking down the street after going out to the grocery store, I can't stop thinking about what other people think of me).That realisation doesn't give me anything. Only people that I have in my life are my parents, that are both depressed from their work, I don't know how to talk to them and they never talk to me; one good friend, that doesn't really care about anything I say to him when I try to reach out and instead he gives me a bunch of motivational quotes and ""lol, same"" type of answer; and my sister of the same age that I'm really close to, but even being that close to her and confessing about my depression not so long ago, it never did change anything, and it feels like I never told her anything at all. 

Even when I want to, I can't interact with people outside my family, because the single thought of trying to talk to a strangere is giving me a panic attack, and it makes me feel so disappointed and sad in my own existence.

I don't know for how long I'll be able to go on. Suicidal thoughts have been a daily occurrence for me. It feels like I'm going insane and it's destroying me from the inside."

lonely,I've given up on being happy.,"I've given up on being happy. - Ever since I was a kid I've been massively depressed. I have always been the super-smart kid that has struggled to form meaningful relationships with others. No women have ever cared about me as I'm still a virgin at 21 years old. 

What's the point of even going on anymore? I've hated the person I am since I was a kid and now I'm at a point that I can't even be proud of going to med school because I'm so alone. I don't know why everything was so much harder for me to figure out. I don't know why everyone around me has so many memories and so many great social experiences while I'm so alone and miserable. I just want my pain to end. It's lasted my entire life and all I've wanted is to be loved and accepted. Too bad people care more about the fact that I'm a virgin than they do the fact I want to help others."

But i changed schools before the quarantine started,  and now i feel lonelier than i have ever felt before. Online school and interacting with new people on social media is really difficult for me due to my anxiety. I tried calling my friends several times but they make no effort from their side to talk to me .
As a whole, i need some advice because i have no clue what to do"
lonely,just realized my friends don't like me,"just realized my friends don't like me - I met this small group of people online back in July and I had a really really great time with them. We were always in voice chat together on discord, it was so much fun. Before that I was in a really lonely period and they really helped me get better, happier.

September comes, back to school, and I began to see that they were becoming more and more distant from me, we weren't talking as often. Realising that made me feel a little bit sad but I thought ""well it's normal it's just because we aren't on vacation anymore"" and I didn't worry about it that much. 

Now we are one week into autumn holidays, and in the past few days I had a depressive episode. None of them contacted me. None of them asked me to do anything with them. We just exchanged some text messages on some public discord conversations. I asked one of them ""why are we so distant ?"". 

Apparently I said some thing he didn't like but he didn't want to tell me about it. ""I still want to be your friend tho"". I also learned that they did exactly what we were doing back in summer (always being together in voice chat, doing the same stuff together) since the start of the week. Just without me. 

I asked another one if there was a problem. 
""bro you're annoying and I really mean it. Like the way you talk about people""

I don't have a clue what he's talking about. Why didn't he told me before ? 

This is a f***** nightmare. Why didn't I realized it sooner. They just don't give a f*** about me. I thought they were my friends. They were essentially the only ones I had. I loved them."

lonely,Anyone have successes reaching out to people?,"Anyone have successes reaching out to people? - I need to reach out to people. Part of my loneliness is on me. There's a woman I'm facebook friends with that constantly posts about how depressed she is and I tried to say ""omg adorable dog"" on her posts or just leave random comments but she never replies or comments on anything of mine so I stopped, maybe we just dont vibe. 


Anyways I've also stopped going out to places, it got too depressing. I remember going to this outdoor botanical garden and noticed I was literally the only person there by myself. It was somehow way more horrible and depressing than staying home. I wanted to cry. I've been lazy like I said and just depended on my ex for everything social. That's bad and unhealthy and I was miserable anyways with him because he literally never wanted to go anywhere or do anything and we hung out like once or twice a week anyways so whatever. Steps I am taking are going to a mental health support group tuesday. I was crossing my fingers and praying it was in person around other people but it isn't. Like fuck I've been contemplating just going to an AA meeting since all the other in person group things I vastly prefer are canceled. I'm surprised how big of a difference going to one yoga class and one guided meditation group meeting made so much difference in loneliness levels. 


Also there seems to be this paradox in mental health communities or support communities. Where half of the posts and just horrible things happening and horribly depressed people and been thinking of quitting reddit because of how negative everyone in general is. I need to stop the habit of complaining about things and being in a bad mood. Ok since it's relevant one last complaint, I had to read 5 different pages online for help with something like self love or exercises for social isolation and they were all only ""what is social isolation. An example of it. The end. Call therapist"" or also everything in literally the world is self care. Drink a warm cup of tea! Put on lipgloss! Specifically eat a peach. Stand outside and loudly scream. Like it just seems to list what that specific person just personally likes or literally anything in the world."
lonely,i feel so hopeless,"i feel so hopeless - just started college this year. all my friends from high school are now scattered across the country and i’m at home doing community college. didn’t even get to properly say goodbye to most of them because of corona, and i’ll probably never see most of them again. the few i’ve kept in touch with are slowly drifting away as they make new friends at college, and i have no clue how to make new friends. it just feels like a ticking time bomb until they never talk to me again and forget about me, and then i’ll be completely alone."
lonely,I don't know what to do,"I don't know what to do - Lately I've been remembering my time with this friend group I met online, it's been a few months since we all separated after a core person who I really loved left and the rest followed suit, she kept us all together with her kindness and well, just general support because she was that nice. 

I know many people don't think friends on the internet aren't real because you're basically just talking to their persona, but I knew they real. I met my first friend on a social app few years ago and then we began making more friends through a roleplay chat, building up friendships over the next four years, me being the very antisocial type took a while before i actually talked to most of them and became real friends. I was happy for once, my home life wasn't that good and it's better now, but they were what kept me wanting to go on, believing we'll see each other one day. 

Few months ago she broke, she said she didn't want to deal with everything going on, the drama and fighting within our group which happens a lot because some of us have clashing personalities and unfortunately some past stuff. I guess i was heartbroken the most because I was one of the people that made her leave, I never liked telling my family my problems because I didn't want them to worry about my health. So i would rant and talk to her, I admit there were times I lost control and said things I didn't mean to because my emotions were hard to control, jealousy because I loved her.

Now I've been trying to move on, but I keep remembering her, the love I felt for her, knowing it'll never happen and that I lost one of my bestest friends I'll probably ever have. I check up on her social media, she blocked me but I have alts, she seems happy again and im glad, I'm sad I couldn't be there with her. I don't know what to do now, I didn't mention the others in the friend group because after they all stopped talking to me, seems like they knew I was the problem and didn't want to deal with me anymore. I'm lost, I don't know what to do next, I just wanted to rant to someone, I have no one to anymore or who'll understand.

Thanks for reading, hope you have a good day."
lonely,Monthly accountability challenge.,"Monthly accountability challenge. - Hello reddit,

we are starting  ""Monthly Accountability Challenge"" - M.A.C for short.

The event will take place on this discord server starting from 28 of October.  
DISCORD: [https://discord.gg/Ntb6ZQP](https://discord.gg/Ntb6ZQP)

If you want to form a new habit, start to wake up early or put your life in order this is probably for you.

We  organize it for free because it makes us happier and brings some  meaning to our lives. And to be honest because we need your  accountability, sometimes we get lazy too ;)

""Monthly Accountability Challenge"" - M.A.C. will focus on four aspects.

1. Habits
2. Public accountability &amp; support
3. Consistency
4. Action plan  


Why I think it is the right channel to share this information is because in my opinion being supported by people when your are lonely is very important and our accountability group is about it. We also do weekly and monthly calls to check on each other. That's the reason we use discord, we can chat and do calls there.  


Let me know if you have any questions!"
lonely,Feel like I´m driven into a corner and no matter what It´ll end up bad,"Feel like I´m driven into a corner and no matter what It´ll end up bad - Hey there I found this subreddit full of nice people so somebody may help me too cheer up a bit... but I want to apologize for my english first, since it´s not my native language  


So this thing happened to me at new work and I know I´ve made huge mistake but it´s too late.   
They hired me along with 6 people and 1 of them (girl) been very nice and friendly with me, we spent lot of time chatting, calling and she even called me out for full day trip, she was talking about how we gonna spent christmas by shopping and in same christmas clothing etc. things like that and I´ve attached to her, thinking it may be something more than just friendship, now she is telling me that we are gonna be going for some trip every weekend  
But now I don´t know why, my brain decided to think we are only gonna be friends (happened to me and it was terrible feeling) and I know that as colleagues I´m gonna be seeing her everyday so I can´t make step forward since it might destroy my career at my new job and I also can´t step back since we are colleagues and seeing each other almost every day and I don´t have anybody to talk about this  
So I feel like that no matter what I´m just gonna end up at very bad spot, so I just spent these days thinking why the f\*ck this thing happened to me...   I really don´t know what to do so I´m at least trying to speak out and it may help me a bit.  


Thank you for any  motivation through this dark times for me"

I'm a man in my early 20's and I know many would think that sex is what I would miss the most but its just not. Don't get me wrong, I do certainly miss that but nowhere near as much as being in bed with a girl I love deeply just holding her, my arm under her head with that hand coming back up to hold one of her boobs and the other arm wrapped around her stomach with my face buried in her hair while she hugs my arm and clings on tightly 

I think about this everyday when I am lying in bed. I bunch my blanket up to be next to me so I can wrap myself around it similarly to how I described in the last paragraph . 

I really don't miss the kissing or talking, joking or even the sex just as much as I miss cuddling, there's just something so innocent and loving about it nothing else even comes close to for me, I feel very sad that I don't have that in my life right now"
lonely,Just a thought,"Just a thought - Ever since I was old enough to have memories, I’ve had shitty people in my life that seem to only exist to cause others pain.

I have been hurt enough times that I no longer have faith in anyone. And I have TRIED. I’ve tried to find the positive, and I’ve tried to tell myself...”maybe this person is different”. I have hit a point though...that I have not felt that hopeful spark in years.  So I’m left, with this loneliness that in certain moments, feels crippling....yet...no spark of hope. And tonight I’m sitting here wondering...is this it? Is this all there is to look forward too?"

Im the one who should be blamed. its always my fault. im mad. im so mad at myself coz all my life choices are bad.

lonely,I'm lonely.,"I'm lonely. - Warning: long post

I uprooted my life and moved across the country for a relationship that didn't last because I never in a million years thought anyone would like me and I jumped at the chance (yes I realize how stupid it was). I'm more of an introvert so I don't mind being by myself most of the time, but I would like to make friends. I work the night shift (decent job actually) so I'm not awake during the day to go out to do things and meet people. Though I can't even do that because of you know what that ruined this entire fucking year. But even if I could go out, I'm too socially awkward to make friends. I don't smoke anything or drink (meaning I'm not the type of person to go to a bar or club) or use any of the popular social media apps that people always connect on, which all of that combined eliminates seemingly 99% of the population for both friendships and relationships. On top of that I don't even know where to go to meet people around my age that isn't school, a bar, or a club. All 3 of which are great places to meet people and all three of which I don't go to.

People always joke or are sometimes serious about not getting into a relationship, but I fucking miss it. I can't even describe how much or what I miss, but I'm not made to be alone like this. At the risk of sounding absolutely ridiculous, I feel like I'm the type of person that's meant to love someone. That's when I was at my happiest anyways. Even if I could meet someone however, not only am I too inexperienced to make something out of it, but I'm also screwed by my looks. I don't think I'm ugly, but I'm in my mid 20's and I look like I'm 12 and that is absolutely not an exaggeration (not just my opinion, but literally everyone else's too). Nobody wants to think of someone who looks like me in a romantic way. I never even get the opportunity to try to form a relationship. People always tell me that I'm lucky because when I'm old I'll look young, and that's all well and good, but I'd like to be in a relationship while I'm still young and hopefully grow up together. 

All of that brings us to why I feel lonely. I'm normally a pretty content person, but I'm on the other side of the country from my parents, I have no friends, I have no girlfriend. All I do is stay in my empty apartment and go to work where I sit in the same room for 8-12 hours depending on the day and do largely the same damn thing I do at home. I don't have any friends, I don't have a relationship, I'm by myself whenever I'm not at work and even when I'm at work I feel like I'm by myself. Like I said I'm normally content, but all the loneliness finally got to me tonight and I needed to get it off my chest. I wish I could be not lonely but I can't do anything about it because of both the pandemic and my personality, which is a horrible double-whammy. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to be alone forever and even though I'd find a way to cope with it, I don't want to end up like that.

I'm not expecting anyone to even reply to this or anything else, I just needed to get it out there. I'm normally fine being alone and even relatively happy doing it, but these last two weeks have really been rough-going. I never open up about this stuff at all, in fact I hate doing it, but everything compounded and I guess I've kept it bottled up too long. I feel a bit better now though, so that's something."

So I guess that I am here because I need to talk to someone, and I need a place to vent. 

After a couple of shitty years, I finally took a hard look at my life and mustered up the courage to make some serious changes. I left a job that I honestly can say I hated. (I literally cried when I got a promotion because I felt like it was a trap.) Left behind a situation that wasn't toxic, wasn't good either, and was stagnating my growth both in life and as a person. Land a dream job in a stable sector (that has been a blessing.) with a significant bump in pay and moved into a beautiful apartment in a very nice and single friendly part of my city. At the beginning of 2020, life was looking good, and I can honestly say that I was very happy, and to this day, I do not regret any of the choices I made to change my life. 


But then the pandemic hit, and well, I have been feeling very isolated and lonely since. I have two people I know pass away from COVID-19 and recently had a parent diagnosed with cancer. I understand that I have a lot to process, and I accept that sadness and maybe even a bit of loneliness while going through changes is par for the course. 

But I also feel like the loneliness that I had felt that had sparked me to make so many of the changes need to get me to this place has compounded or maybe is more present because there is less noise in the background. Plus, losing people and having a sick parent who probably wouldn't survive contracting COVID has made me super cautious, which probably hasn't helped me want to meet people. So I am wondering how is everyone else handling the shocks of this year. Has anyone else moved to a new city to start a new life and struggle to find a community or group to belong to? What has worked for you what hasn't worked for you? Any of you been lucky enough to find love? 

I am here to talk, learn, or just listen."

lonely,I just realized how clingy I am. I need physical interaction. In both friendship and love.,"I just realized how clingy I am. I need physical interaction. In both friendship and love. - It has been almost a year since the pandemic started, a little over a year since I entered college, and and about a year and a half since I graduated from highschool.

On highschool I had pretty solid friend circle. Not big, but so very perfectly small and fit. We were pretty tight, but it changed when we graduated.

We all went to different colleges, and I went to the one with the least number of the type of person I would be friends with. Sure, we were and still are friends, and we went out together everytime we got s chance but with the pandemic going on, we recently went from having a game night once every two months to texts on whatsapp. Sometimes I get stupid shit, and it get laughs out of everyone, or sparks an interesting debate. You would think that would be directly translated into text, but the truth is that sometimes my texts get ignored and I understand that they're not obligated to answer. Once, I was alone.

But everything changed for the better, as I found a dude that I made my friend. Pretty cool guy. Sure, he swept the floor with me everytime we played smash and me, being just a below average player always felt my serotonin hit rock bottom whenever that happened, but I was hsppy because I had him. He was my emotional anchor during my first and second semester.

But my useless peepee poopoo ape brain got too atsched to this emotional anchor, as I started to pay less and less atention to classes. Thus, I ended up having to withdraw the whole semester, while he, who is not an awful student, pass onto the next semester. I mean, sure, we were and are still friends, but now that we have no classes together, our relstionship has been reduced from going to get donuts after class and walk home together, to texts on whatsapp saying ""hey"" ""hi, what up?"" ""meh, h b u?"" ""meh"". The next semester comes in, being surrounded by strangers again, I was Once again, alone.

And it is now that I relize how clingy I am. People sre not forever, peopoe change, circumstances change, and one is suppoused to know how to yourself without the others, and I thought I learnt this lesson, but apparently I just said it out loud with my trusty friends at my back, not knowing how empty would I feel without them.

And it's not that they're dead or something, they're alive and well. But not seeing them physically for almost a year now just feels so... Lonely. I cansend them a text and they would reply, and many would argue that friendship goes over the boundaries of distances but the thing that as long as I don't see them physically, as long as we're only together by these screens, to me they're just that. Screens. Words. Meaningless visual noise.

I once had a friend that ina depressed state, when he moved permanently to another country, he decided to delete all of his contacts and block everyone he oncce knew. Everyone that knew him collectively thought ""Wow, what an asshole, after all we've been through he just deleted us like if we didn't exist"". I on the other hand remained quiet about the subject, as in my head, I understood his reasons. They wanted to still have a conection to him just by text and skype. He just wanted to move on because he knew that he would never see them again anyway, might as well be strangers again. I myself wonder, is there any difference?"

The thing is, I feel like people and my friends don’t really know me. I feel like I don’t talk about myself because I know no one cares and no one bothers to ask about me anyways. I wish I had someone who really knew me. I feel like I’m my own best friend because I’m the only one who actually knows me. Why don’t I open up to anyone?"

She tried to pull me back—out of regret I think, not malice—but I didn’t want to do that to myself. Now she’s about to move to another city and covid’s got me feeling lonely. Would be nice to see her one more time before she goes. But that’s selfish. I’ll go to bed instead."

lonely,Losing Will to Try and Make Friends,"Losing Will to Try and Make Friends - I feel whiny for posting this cause I have a boyfriend but I guess I still need to vent and ask for advice.

I used to be a super intense person, romantically or not. I would get attached to people, try to talk every day, just genuinely care a lot to the point it hurt. But, of course, I was always the initiator, on the outside of the friend group and tolerated but never wanted around.

Over and over again I'd just disappear. No one would care, and I'd hold on to thst fact that no one cares I'm gone despite being around every day.

I have online friendships that have carried on decently and checked in more often. The most persistent of which, who is lonely and clingy like me, moved to town and we're now dating. The others... They've still let me go months without checking in, but they eventually came back, albeit the relationships getting less close over time.

The only person I'm genuinely connected to is my partner, and I miss even the fascimile of friendship I had before I've drifted away.

But... It seems like I can't even manage that anymore. Quarantine aside, I feel incapable of devoting personal energy to someone. I'm glad I'm not as obsessive or attached as before, but I'm the extreme opposite now. I'm the friend others were to me. I always forget to reply, I never get personal, I disappear for days or vanish mid conversation. I don't know why but it doesn't happen anymore, I can't well up that friendly admiration and I can't find the energy to even join a group call or something.

I used to basically live off of the chance to have fun and be friendly with another even if they didn't care.

Now it's just empty. Maybe people only tolerated cause I would approach, I'm someone that no one else cares to put effort on to keep up with, so I'm alone if I don't do it myself. Maybe I'm spoiled from having a partner that genuinely cares and I'm acting like a brat that's not appreciative, of what I have.

Idk. I'm just loss. I want to feel something for people"

lonely,How I feel just now,"How I feel just now - 

Sorry if I fuck up my grammar or that because I’m just going to vent how I feel just now. 

I’m nearly 27 years old, I don’t know what I’m doing anymore, I don’t feel suicidal or anything I’m just fed up. I’ve lived on my own basically since I was 19 and it’s lonely as fuck recently, usually I do love my own space but at times you just want human contact. I’ve had girlfriends and stuff but it’s always ended just completely shit for me in the end, I literally haven’t touched a woman since March 2019 so that sucks, plus most woman only care about being fucked or money now days, it’s to hard to find something meaningful because everyone craves that attention. I do have a friend that I get a drink with and always chat to on the phone with etc but due to the problems in the world plus he has a kid also, it makes it quite hard to arrange something now days. So usually if I’m in a situation like this I would always go and try speak to woman try to fuck them and what not, but I can’t even do that anymore because I’ve put on so much weight since corona started and have 0 confidence. Another thing I wish I could do would be to speak to my family, I have a mum and a few brothers and sisters but my mum has just never been interested in me which is obviously shit but I never let it affect me until it gets to times like this and I feel so small. I’ve never wrote anything on the internet like this and I’ve never once in my life opened up because sadly I don’t like it, it’s just not me. I brought myself up and always feel like I should just act like a man and get on with it. I don’t have motivation because I’m only motivated when it’s something right in front of my eyes if you understand what I mean? I just don’t know what to do. I don’t even want to read this back to check for mistakes or anything because I know for a fact I just wouldn’t post it, so sorry if there’s grammar or something wrong. I’m just going to post it."

In fact, I've been incredibly isolated since I still have trouble with the native language. The distance I have from my family and friends back home has maybe alienated them from me. Not to mention my partner has become busy with work and school so I spend a lot of time in my own head. I mean I do at least have some simulation from the small business I've created. I just can spend so much time not even saying anything, doing somewhat menial or repetitive work, and chores. I type all this out and it seems so trivial, but I just keep having intrusive suicidal thoughts. I keep reaching out but I just can't seem to get anyone to care, which I know is my own fault. I had a pretty bad drug habit that I was hiding that lead to some pretty dark moments. So in a way, I'm a social pariah in the city I live currently in. 

Somehow, this helped I guess? So I'll post it."

lonely,I feel so empty,"I feel so empty - I have a friend that I've spent all of my time with the last few months. I care about them a lot, and developed feelings for them. I felt like they liked me too. I felt really alone before I met them, like I haven't found someone who actually cared about me yet. We do literally everything together... I don't think there has been a day that we didn't talk since we met. They started talking to a friend they lost contact with, and that person told my friend they like them. My friend confided in me asking for advice and said they feel the feelings coming back too but they're kind of scared. I just feel completely broken. I thought they liked me too, like I finally found someone who would choose me and actually truly loved me. I kind of shut down and just told them how I feel and they gave me some space and said they only thought of me as a friend.

I know this is something people deal with all of the time... I'm just in so much pain. I feel like I lost a friend I guess? Like I don't even know what to do... I've always felt so by myself and they made me feel like I was special. They gave me their time and we were always on the phone (something very hard for me). I feel like I will always be alone.

I think I’m sad today for a few reasons. I turned a year older and still feel like I haven’t accomplished anything in my life. I feel like I’ve wasted so much time doing nothing and not achieving anything. I feel this type of loneliness today because it really shows how little people I have in my life that care about me. Literally my only friend is my best friend from high school. And I feel guilty for the attention. I feel guilty because she is probably only hanging out with me because she knows I don’t have anyone else. I find myself comparing my situation to others. Other people have lots of friends and have these big fun exciting birthday parties and I can count on one hand the amount of people that wished me a happy birthday. Idk. Apart of me doesn’t even want to celebrate. A part of me just wants to bail and lay in bed all day instead.

lonely,How it feels to be me..,"How it feels to be me.. - Everything is fine when I wake up. I feel happy waking up next to my fiancé, I feel happy being in my safe space, under my blankets, with his arms around me and the door closed. Everything is perfect every morning, we kiss and hug until we have enough energy to get up. Still, I feel fine.. maybe a little nausea sometimes but that’s ok. I can deal with that. Then comes the part of the day that I dread the most, about 2-3 hours after I wake up.. which is going outside. As soon as I start looking for clothes, I have an idea of what I want to wear. Sometimes I get lucky and find a nice outfit right away and I look cute with my hair up.. other days, well, most days, I can’t find anything to wear. I try on 30 different things, and everything all of a sudden starts to feel like it’s going wrong. My pants have holes in them, my shirts are too tight, my shirts are too loose, I’m too fat, I’m too ugly, my hair is ugly, I can’t fix anything, I can’t help anything. I’m useless, I’m worthless, I hate myself. I hate myself. What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I get dressed like a normal person? Why can’t I just do a bun with my hair and be satisfied with it like a NORMAL GIRL?! “You need to get over it” that’s what everyone says.. nobody understands. I have the energy to go outside yet I don’t. What will people think of me if I decide to wear anything I wanted? “She’s fat, she’s ugly asf, she looks stupid” Will even my own fiancé think that? I’m pretty sure he does but he lies to my face all the time. Maybe I am kind of pretty? Maybe I’m not. Maybe I’m just ugly as fuck. As I’m looking for what to wear everything starts to fall on me... I’m gonna miss work, I’m not gonna be there on time, I’m gonna get fired, Everybody is going to hate me because IM THE PROBLEM.. why can’t I just be normal? After looking and looking I give up, I cry, I feel useless. Nobody can help me, nobody cares and nobody understands. I’m alone. And I push and push people away, I slowly start to isolate myself when I do manage to get myself outside and slowly I become more anti social, I start to lose weight by doing nothing, I start to lose my apetite. The only time I feel hungry is when I’m intoxicated, the only time I feel good is when I can’t see straight. And everyday I cry, for everything, I cry. Why? I wanna stop being a whiny little bitch and be the badass girl I used to be before.. but something has changed and I don’t know what. Doctors tell me I need to speak to a therapist, therapists don’t do anything for me. My anxiety and depression starts to take a toll on my health, with spasms and pains and anxiety attacks because I’m worrying too much, yet worrying too little about the worth of my life.. I know it’s wrong, but do people really care? No. They don’t. So why should I? But I want to live.. I want to have my own kids, I want to live a better life.. BUT FUCK I CANT. I don’t want to live at the same fucking time. I’m tired of life, I’m tired of everything. I’m only 21, why am I feeling this way?  I try my fucking best to get out of this loop. But nothing is working. I can’t control it anymore, it’s gotten too bad. I drowned myself in ways to ignore the pain, but now it’s all here at once. Idk what to do.... I’m sorry for taking up space. I’m sorry for being useless. I’m sorry that I let everyone down. I will never be the same again. I know I get annoying, I know people are tired of dealing with my sadness, anxiety and bullshit. I know my fiancé doesn’t wanna be with me anymore, I know he rather be with a girl who doesn’t have these issues. I can’t give him what he wants, I can’t give anybody what they want. I’m a horrible person. My end feels like it’s coming soon. I’m sorry vivica, I let you down."

lonely,Why?,"Why? - I don’t know what happened to me but it is super weird. I got rid of a poison relationship around this July. After that I was quite down for a while but then I had a really amazing summer with my friends. 
Another guy asked me to hang out and we probably had a nice date, and he asked me to another date again. I admit I do crush on his in some way, because I know myself, if I kiss someone I like, I will forget to use my nose to breathe. That happened when he kissed me.  But, before the second date, I received another message that he said we shouldn’t continue dating.    
I don’t know why but after that I am under a desperate loneliness. I mean I feel lonely sometimes before the dating but it was for really short time and easy to deal with.  Things become really tough this time, I don’t
know how should I do.  
I meet him in our workplace sometimes, and even I say many “F you” inside, I know I still miss the kisses and the snuggling from him. 
I hate myself now. And I feel much down when my friend say “you should move on” “behave like an adult, you can still be colleague” “you should find you hobby and then you will forget all of this sucks”"
lonely,Lonely yet quite peaceful.,"Lonely yet quite peaceful. - Nights don't change 
They stay dark,
Empty yet full of pain,
Lonely yet clouded with happy memories,
Hopeless yet filled with wishes

And that makes me love it
Because days pass and
Things happen, either
They begin or end

But nights stay like this 
Peacefully chaotic,
Full of emptiness,
Happy pain,
And dark lights . . .

Always."

She recently broke up with her boyfriend (surprisingly a week after I had messaged her out of loneliness seeking advice)   


We're like friends now, but I don't know what to do. I know for a fact I'm not over what she had done to me even if we say to each other that it's the past now (It has been almost a couple of years)  
she says she's feeling lonely and I am alone as well but something in my mind is telling me this is really stupid what I'm doing...  


I just don't know what to do.. I feel isolated and the only people I could even remotely relate to are people who have deeply hurt me.. and I'm just afraid of staying alone and for some intrusive thoughts turn into serious ones and I start considering making very stupid decisions."
lonely,Memories fade,"Memories fade - The ruins remained untouched
Like an amusement park
That was slowly forgotten
By the ones who once loved it,
Like a carousel with no horse
Or bump cars without cars
Or Ferris wheel with no cabins

The noise it once had,
The laughter that once heard,
The happiness that once felt,
All remained in one place

Like a lost treasure
Or an almost lover
Who chose to leave,
Some things remained
While others were swept away
By time and changes

The cars left but the happiness didn't
Like how you walked away
While my feelings remained

In an amusement park
Or in my heart

They are both empty
And full at the same time."

The incident left me so badly wound up i stayed offline for a day after tensions calmed down.

I’m 33 and take care of my Dad full time since my Mom passed away. He’s a disabled veteran. And I love doing it more than anything in the world because he deserves it. But I don’t get to ever go out and it’s just tough wanting to meet people to talk to in person or online."

I met this girl last year and we just instantly clicked. We had so many things in common and it was surprising that we never spoke before as we had mutual friends and had seen each other before. We started texting and talking and I fell for her. Asked her out, she said no. We've been good friends but I still have feelings. I am too clingy and recently realised that I'm better off alone. I just force conversations and meetups. I feel she meets/talks to me because she knows I have no other friends. I am pathetic and I don't think anything is going to change. I'm doomed to be alone and miserable"
lonely,Something I never thought I would deal with,"Something I never thought I would deal with - My whole life I've never fit in rather it was at school, work or just plain oh anywhere. I've always had very few friends my whole life. I feel like even though im a nice person who has a great character and would make a great friend very few people want to deal with me. Whenever I'm around people and we are all talking I know eventually i will get drowned out and the people would start talking to each other and nobody will listen or respond to me. I feel like i sometimes push people away because I know eventually i will be the forgotten one so to avoid it i subconsciously respond this way. I've spend a lot of years in college and only made one friend. Whenever i walk the halls no one would My whole life I've never fit in rather it was school, work or just plain oh anywhere. I've always had very few friends my whole lie. I feel like even though im a nice person who has a great character and would make a great friend very few people want to deal with me. Whenever I'm around people and we and ask me to join their club or frat and i would think maybe that even though i think i seem approachable that might not be what others think.  However, when someone needs me to donate money or sign a petition im approachable. I started grad school last year and i knew exactly what would happen and that was eventually people could get to know each other and they would form their own social groups (this out of a class of 62 students) and group chats and i wouldn't be apart of any of the groups. I've had my bouts with depressions. Anxiety is just something that can't be turned off. It can be better depending on the environment. I remember always having anxiety even as a kid and I hates the feeling it gives you but i think it was made worst by the fact that i was made fun of all my whole life for having a lazy eye. People would make fun of me just a few feet away from me as if I didn't know what was going on. I've always had people just look at me and laugh which is the worst because i don't know why everyone feels the need to laugh at me but they do. I've even went to an job interview one time and the lady (interviewer) kind of giggled at me. So for the last year its been weighing on me that its hard for me to make friends and i have  no girlfriend. If im not at school or work i have no one to talk to or hangout with and just spend all my time at home. That's why i always says just because someone isn't doing something or doesn't have something doesn't mean its because they want it that way. Anyway i started doing bad in grad school and not being able to focus or put the effort because my thinking was what's the point of being successful if i have no one to share it with. If I wanted to go on vacation or just out in general i have nobody to do that with. Only being in my late 20's i sometimes, and this is not an over exaggerate, rather be dead than to wake up every day and face depression, anxiety and loneliness face on. I often wonder how similar people with the same traits can get treated differently by the same people. Case in point michael Jackson was a charitable person and people praise and call him an angel for that. But there are many good-hearted people out there that are just as charitable as michael Jackson and do for others but they will never get that type of praise or be called an angel. I think im a good-hearted person who would make a great friend and boyfriend but yet here I am friendless with no girlfriend and someone who is always getting left out. Now I must admit even though i stated i have no friends i do have one friend but because we barely talk or hang out because as you know as you get older life changes and you don't have amount of free time you use to have it hard to match schedules up. So from a day to day prospective i pretty much have no one and its just me. The thing about loneliness is that you'll always reminded of it. When you go to school, work, etc. You see people constantly texting and their phones are filled with conversations(texts from multiple people). I can turn my phone off for a month and the only miss call ill have is from scam likely. I see and hear about about people vacationing with their friends and partners all the time. I do enjoy my me time but being able to say ok now i want friends around would be great. Sometimes i think if people know that being likeable and having friends is something of great value and shouldn't be taken for granted or if because that how their life is its just seen as life and its nothing that ever crosses their minds. Sorry for the long story. Im a private person and probably would never tell anybody this in person but i just needed to get this off my chest."

I'm going through depression right now and I need someone to talk to in order to feel better/not burst into tears. I called my friend, who (as I would always call my best friend, someone who I can rely on no matter what) and asked if she wants to come over, so we can watch a movie or just generally hang out. What does she answer? ""I'd love to, but my cat is laying on me."" Like... what???? Why do you think it's a legitimate reason to ditch me like that? Just say that you're lazy. I'm frustrated, because people who'd constantly support me emotionally and vice versa, now simply ignore me."

We’ve been talking to each like every day recently ether over text or in person so that was nice and I was starting to give up on flirting with her and trying because she has a bf but then the other day she tells me that her and her bf were arguing a bit because when they first started going out he had trust issues because of his past relationship so she let him go through her messages now and again which is weird anyway but she said hadn’t done it in ages and suddenly he messaged her saying he went through her phone last night. btw this was like week ago and saw an apparently flirty message to someone from like a couple months ago they fell out but then made up but I dunno whether to keep trying because if that happens I don’t think she gonna give him many more chances or just move on but I really love this girl and I think I’d really struggle to move on knowing I loved her

lonely,Worse,"Worse - Discord, Omegle, and Reddit made me feel worse. I liked myself and I was confident in myself before I tried to find companionship in these places. 

I started questioning my beauty because racist assholes cant leave the societal/media programming that only white is attractive.

I feel so sad and guys would literally not give a fuck, they’d jerk off while on the phone with me (some made it obvious, others would do it thinking I was unaware), ask sexual questions, make suggestive comments, ask me to send pictures of myself, put me down with rude and demeaning comments, or laugh in my face and make fun of me. 

I’m tired of people automatically assuming I’m white because of my voice. Like, wtf does that even mean?? It just sounds stupid and ignorant, but mainly incredibly annoying. That is so racist to assume and think people have to speak a certain way to belong to a certain group.  

Tired of the pedos. Nuff said. I’ve been on the internet since I was 12 and have a long list of those experiences, most I try not to think about and buried deep down in my brain. 

I’m just so tired. I’m tired of it all. I’m tired of the disrespect. I’m tired of the abuse.

lonely,25m,"25m - I feel extremley lonely every other day and don't know how to resolve it. I have alot of genuine friendships that I value alot but they don't prevent me from feeling this void.

I'm very passionate and generally optimistic but when I put myself out there, I always have minimal success with people that I want to spend my time with. I'm starting to feel more and more hopeless even though I know I'm probably just being impatient. While im not sure, part of me wants to chalk it up coronavirus becahse this is a new feeling that I have'nt had to deal with before.. the other half of me feels like that idea is just a coping mechanism. While im greatful that i've never had to deal with this in my past, I also don't know how to as a result.

I am essentially an introvert. I am writing this to pen my thoughts down in a coherent manner and also as a shoutout to those who share my feelings. Over the last few years I have grown increasingly reclusive. It is not that I don’t have friends. I have a few of them and I believe they are genuinely concerned about me. However there is this sinking feeling of being alone that I find to be very overwhelming. My anxiety makes things worse for me often. I am super anxious all the time, almost always invariably ending up over analysing a said situation making it only worse in the long run. I often feel like I have not achieved anything of note in my life and that I have only disappointed my near and dear ones. I know that is not true. However I am unable to drive this feeling away. I have been single all my life and there are times, more frequent now than ever, that I yearn for that special someone in my life. I wish I had someone to talk to, someone who I could bare myself out to. I wish I could fall in love with someone and hope for them to love me back. Being introverted and shy don’t help my cause either. I find it so difficult to initiate conversations with people from the opposite sex. I can only hope for things to look up and hope is the only thing I am clinging on to at the moment."

Now that I just graduated I feel like it’s going to be impossible meeting new people that are worth actually connecting with. Every time I would get close to someone they either leave me for other friends or just get distant over time. And I also feel like I’m never going to find love. The last girl I talked to chose her ex over me when she told me she loved me. Now when I try to get close to someone I feel like I can’t trust them or get close bc I’m afraid they are just going to hurt me the same way all of my other friends did. I don’t know what to do. I decided to join the navy to restart my life but damn I feel so fucking lonely right Now it’s depressing as shit. It’s like a hole in my heart that can’t seem to be fixed. I feel as I’m numb to all emotions now. And no I don’t have suicidal thoughts but I just feel like I’m not meant to be with anyone in this world.

I just miss the feeling of another persons body and touch on mine. Even the simplest act of a hug or a high five... it feels like i haven't touched anyone in so long and its sad.

lonely,Still lonely even though I’m engaging and interacting,"Still lonely even though I’m engaging and interacting - I went downstairs to interact with my family and their friends, we played head ups. It was fun but I’m still missing something. I’ve always been lonely, but I guess today I realized that I genuinely can’t make connections. 

I’m very disconnected from my family and others, only because they don’t respect me. I really don’t have friends. Every person I texted either stopped texting me or dissed me. 

I’ve only ever learned to focus on myself but it’s becoming such a drag, I guess the only thing I can focus on is my money. I’m trying to be happier but how can I when everyone starts to annoy you. 

I wish I had more friends, I wish I could engage and be apart of things more, but it’s like when I leave it’s like I was never there. I try to make myself known but I’m again realizing my efforts are pointless. I’ve gotten no where in the past 19 years. I’ve felt more pain than I did healing. 

When I do “connect” with a person, they wind up leaving.. I only meet people through my siblings, and no one else. They are very extroverted, I’m an ambivert which means I can switch to extroverted and introverted. 

Sad thing is I could be dead for 24 hours and no one would notice... crazy how quiet people make a group of friends in minutes. I’ve met people who barely talk and have people swarming behind them. But I can’t even get a text back, or I’m constantly ghosted. 

I tried, already called a quits but what can you do now? I’ll always be in my family’s shadow, I’ll always will be a last choice, I always be replaceable, traded, I am forgotten."

lonely,Perpetually single.,"Perpetually single. - 27F. I know I’m “still young” but it just doesn’t seem like it’ll ever happen for me. I have a lot of love to give and nobody to give it to. I get ghosted by every. single. guy. and that will probably never change. It always goes a little something like this— I meet a guy. We talk and get to know each other. I finally feel comfortable being myself and he seems so into me and I let my walls down and open up and this is seemingly headed in the right direction and boom. They drop me like I never existed, I blame myself and then I’m back to square one. It’s a vicious cycle. And it’s done a fucking number on my mental health. Loneliness is one of the worst feelings in the world next to not feeling good enough. I just want someone to want me back."

lonely,I absolutely hate the art of ghosting,"I absolutely hate the art of ghosting - This never fails. I meet someone on here or another social media platform, they size me up and feel me out...then when they come to the conclusion that I don't fit their personal criteria - or I don't meet their wants and needs...I get ghosted.

I totally understand that I'm not always gonna fill in a person's empty gaps in life but why oh why does this always have to end with me being ghosted?? I'd much rather know the truth instead of always wondering what the hell happened.

I would never ghost anybody because my mindset allows me to have the common courtesy and decency to end the encounter on a friendly note by wishing them well and saying goodbye. What I always get every single fucking time is some bullshit excuse to mask their real intention like....""I'm busy right now, ttyl"" or ""I gotta do this or that, we'll talk tomorrow"".

It's like a sledgehammer to the heart and I doubt they realize the hurt they place onto people like me. I speak for everyone who feels like shit from being ghosted. Sometimes all I want is a friend but this must be equivalent to winning the lottery. Or heck, maybe I'm the one that's weird because I get attached to people whenever they say hi. That's how lonely I am."

I even had one night where I couldn't fall asleep because a friend didn't text me for 2 days and I really missed her. It's not like I'm desperate or something, I don't know myself what was happening there.

Ironic thing is... I don't lack people to talk to. But I lack trustable people. I never understood when people said they're not alone but lonely, I just did few weeks ago.

I don't plan in using this account in the future, I just created it for this sub, I'd like to tell you this, maybe there's someone feeling the same as me. I'm actually involved in some stuff, not law-abiding

Thing is, as good as it seems, problem is, I can't tell anyone. There's only one person alive who knows me in real life and knows about it all, a few weeks ago it was quite difficult for me, because I couldn't talk to anyone about it.

I don't have to talk about it anymore as I took a break in order to feel better, but I'll tell you this, if you're also feeling lonely, need someone to talk to, we can. Whether it's because of this lifestyle you can't tell anyone, or can't tell anyone about what's going through your mind. Maybe you're reading these words I've just written and think you need someone.

I don’t know how to feel &amp; I don’t know what to think or what to say, I’ve got tests coming up &amp; I can’t even study for that, all I wanna do is play her favorite songs, cry, look at her pictures and sleep.

I do have a very supportive friend who’s helping me through the whole thing but I still feel empty inside, I desperately want to go hiking so I can clear my mind, but I’m afraid that I’ll get to a cliff and want to end it all because in all honesty, it’s a lot, no amount of formal education &amp; mentors would’ve prepared me for this, I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what to say, I am lost..."

I tried dealing with that by working more but I feel like the best course of action would be to try my best to have a more active social life.   


Some facts about me: 

I love learning about new things, be it anything. I also enjoy long discussions on art, films, anime, tv shows, games, comics where we dissect scenes or symbolism, easter eggs and the likes. We could also decide on watching a movie or show or anything and have discussions appreciating their art.

I also believe I am an amazing personal cheerleader haha. We could also try to keep ourselves accountable for habits we have been trying to stick to (I for one, would love to get back into reading , making digital art and working out more often).

I'd like to keep the possibility of voice conversations on discord or something open over texting when we can make the time."

I haven't doubted that she sees me as a friend, but now I have doubts. Like I asked a couple hours ago if I can come over and read. She said she's out now, but go ahead, she'll be back in 30 min. Two hours later and she's still not back. And I'm still feeling lonely. 

I just feel dumb. And selfish too: Obviously she doesn't need me to feel content. So is it just one-sided when I'm trying to hang out? Blah, I'm just talking out loud.

I just hate being lied to. And yes, I feel jealous when people want to hang out with people other than me. And I mostly just feel alone and it makes me sad. That's all I got."

It makes me think that my pain, although not meaningful, can be beautiful while tragic. But recently, they're all the same. It's probably because the situation I'm in is unchanging. People are grouping together. I feel like I'm bothering the few people I can talk to. And my ambitions are far greater than I will ever be. My whole life is encompassed by this existential dread and I'm not even sure that's accurate.

Just recently, someone talked to me about their concerns in life. I comforted them. I doubt I helped but she did thank me. I scolded myself. I become so indescribably happy when I make someone happy. It disgusts me. I find solace in the worst of people. God, I have Betty Who to thank for that line.

I work extremely hard every day to better myself and get a shot at a D1 school (even though my grades have suffered a bit, which I am fixing). I am also an aspiring producer who, through my dad, has finally made some progress with selling my beats.

My problem is, unless the topic is football or making music, I have NO IDEA how to hold a conversation with girls. There was a girl in my math class last year who I could not take my eyes off of, but the only thing I could do was offer to help her with work, which she politely declined.

Unfortunately, this has been a very common theme throughout my life since even Pre-K. I like a girl -&gt; can barely say any damn thing -&gt; move up a grade -&gt; repeat cycle.

This has only gotten worse since I've been in high school, where apparently every girl has a boyfriend, has had sex, or just isn't in my interests.

I really do want to talk to girls, not even just to date. The idea of having a female friend is really cool to me, yet has been a pipe dream for a while.

Just a quick note: I am terrible at explaining things, and I apologise if I say something offensive and / or not bright.

I’m 16 turning 17 in a few months. I have just started Sixth Form College at my school. Most people I know have been out with people and been having a great time before (and even during) COVID-19.

I have not been so fortunate with my times with the opposite sex. I have never been asked out (at least not out of pity or as a dare) and I just don’t have the emotional capacity to risk asking someone out myself.

I have also been hearing rumours from my friends recently that people are taking people out on dates and afterwards are saying “We’re still just friends, right?” or some bollocks like that. This has happened to a few of my friends, and as well as me pitying them, it also discouraged me even more from opening up and trying to maintain a somewhat meaningful relationship.

However, I do try my hardest to not give up and just go about my normal life, however the more I see people in my year dating and stuff and while I’m working to my full capacity while people were / are partying, it just grinds my general happiness and therefore my productivity to a stop. 

I am hoping that this will change soon, and not because my friends see this on Reddit and pity me (that would just be the last straw tbh, considering how introverted I am). I also hope that anyone else faced with this problem finds someone that they are happy with someday, and doesn’t have to go through the emotional quarrels I have with myself everyday."

Why do I have to feel this guilt, this hesitation that stops me from building any kind of friendship? I'd love to be friends with people... but that means they have to be friends with me, y'know? I wouldn't want that for them. I'm not interesting, or funny... Sometimes I feel like living my life alone is the correct way for me to go about life... but I just don't know."

lonely,How do you cope with being invisible in a romantic sense?,"How do you cope with being invisible in a romantic sense? - I am 24 year old FA guy. I am wondering how can you come to terms that you are going to be alone for the rest of your life? I had 2 serious girlfriends and neither of them really found me attractive. Both of them were with me because they did not want to be alone.

I realized that I am mostly invisible to women in a romantic sense. I am not ugly or loser at all. I am successful student, I can say that I take care of my personal hygiene, I am well groomed, dress well, read a lot, have many hobbies, I can talk about many different stuff and so on. The only thing is I have a few extra pounds but I am not really obese. 

All women say that they want nice, kind guy who will treat them well and who has his shit together. Well guess what they don't. I do not want to blame others but I have started to notice that standards and expectations for a guy are becoming more and more insane. We are supposed to look like movie stars or football players, make a lot of money, entertain them and so on but if a guy says he does not want larger woman all hell breaks lose. I know you can not force someone to like you but being isolated, overlooked and ignored is really bad for me. I am wondering what am I doing wrong every day. I see my friends enjoying life taking girls out on dates etc. while I barely get ""hi"" back. I am also wondering if I am the only one who doesn't get any attention and if I am not how do you guys cope with that?
I am sad everyday when I realize how different my life would be if I were a bit more attractive."

I can't stop thinking about how alone I feel. How no one knows the real me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a couple work friends and I live with my mom, but it's more like an existential loneliness. Like I'm just going to end up alone anyway. I've never been in a relationship before and I'm almost 24. At this point, I'm not sure that I'm ever going to be in one. Ending up alone is one of my biggest fears and I think it's going to be a reality."

lonely,I feel hopeless about ever making IRL friends.,"I feel hopeless about ever making IRL friends. - Other than my LDR girlfriend and one other person from high school, I don't really interact with anyone in the real world. Simply due to past emotional burns, such as people not reciprocating interest in my friendship (eg. not wanting to hang out with me, which I understand, but it happens way too often), I've developed this thought pattern of, ""People almost always reject me, so why should I even bother? What's the point?"" Not to mention the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and everything, which only makes things even harder.

Hearing other people talk about their best friend or their friend group(s) makes me go a bit loony, especially when they talk about how close they are, how often they talk to each other, and so on. It's not helpful to compare myself to others, but when the word ""friend"" is like the 200th most common English word in the dictionary, you can't help but hear that word so often.

Think the only answer is to unironically talk to other people, but if I'm so certain that they'll reject me, why bother? It's better to be alone and be spared that risk of further damaging my self-esteem."
lonely,DAE feel like being triggered by loneliness?,"DAE feel like being triggered by loneliness? - I noticed that the feeling of loneliness triggers me. I usually feel dread in my stomach, I get very sad and I feel like crying.

I'm sure this has something to do with my parents' way of bringing me up. Whenever I got a bad/unsavoury grade, my parents would shout at me and wouldn't talk to me for a WEEK. During this time, they wouldn't interact with me in any way. They didn't even look at me. This was the icing on the cake, because I got into a new school and I didn't know anybody. To add, some classmates bullied me. So, the feeling intensified.

Or sometimes they would throw the usual ""I will disown you!"" at me. 

I became anxious, depressed, started to stutter to a point I couldn't talk. But my parents didn't do anything. Didn't even budge or care. I was left alone.

I felt like I didn't matter to my parents. I felt like if I were to disappear, they wouldn't notice.

I sometimes wish I was dead."

I have so much love to give and no one to give it to. 

All I want is someone to cuddle and watch movies with. I don’t even care about sex at this point. Just someone to hold hands with and run errands with and have lazy days on the couch. I’m on all different types of dating sites, but trying to find other lesbians is SO hard.

I feel like they are way more mature, and way more empathetic than guys of the same age. For the most part I can't stand hanging out with guys my age, they are completely not self-aware of themselves or others. Women are so much nicer, they'll just casually dish out genuine compliments whereas guys basically never directly show appreciation for anything. Obviously there are exceptions but this has just been my experience with interacting with both genders.

What I really should be doing is going to sleep anyways, it would give me something to do instead of wallow, and I would get some good rest. Idk if this recurring feeling is a good thing because its a motivator, or a bad thing cause it's a sign of something worse like depression. Either way it's one thing. Uncomfortable.

I did have someone, but she doesn’t care anymore. I ruined that because of everything that’s wrong with me.

You fight on your own, you’re the definitive host
alone in this fight they want no part
And against your belief, your success won’t make them start

A smile is found in the adrenal gland
Held down for so long, you are in command

Command of your path, although all alone
It’s not that scary to be on your own
Narrow your view, get in the zone
It’s not longer forced, you are a gemstone

Gemstone of light, go lift others up
You have fought your own battle, do not let up
There are more like you, who need the connection
Here, let me give you a review session

So I’ve been thinking of what to say to my tattoo artist at the consultation if he asks me why I’d like a tattoo in an area that would affect job prospects, and the answer is as simple as this. Non conformity. it would force me to be extra motivated as well as putting me in a position where I’ve no choice but to explore my creative side and find my creative passion and earning an income from that, and honestly that has always appealed to me so much. What’s the alternative really? Get a boring bullshit 9-5 office job where at the end of the day I’d come home to a frozen meal dinner? I can’t do anything fulfilling like starting a family, my genes are trash. My wife would be giving birth and then out plops my baby in a wheel chair and knitted green quilt. And then I’d just be in this fucked cycle of existential dread where I’m used to the routine of coming home from my office job and interacting with my weird child and eating frozen meal dinners until my 40th or 50th birthday where I finally decide to sit in my garage in the car with the windows rolled up blasting Metallica or Coldplay while I inhale exhaust fumes. What kinda life is that? And not to mention the fact that my wife would probably be fucking the mailman the entire damn time. I just don’t really see any downsides to this really, I’d have beautiful and meaningful artwork on my skin, I’d get to truly express myself and I’d get to turn my passion, once I found out what that is into a fulfilling source of income. the thought of following societal norms for the sole sake of fitting in makes my skin crawl, what is the point of life if you’re not living the sort of life you want to live? Or not getting to truly be who you are inside?"

I was quite a popular person at my previous school however before joining the new school I was diagnosed with depression and found it very difficult to make new friends. However over time I became closer with some people and could say I had around a handful of friends.
On the bus back after the day we were playing a game called “Psych!” and we were playing “the truth comes out”. The game basically gives a name of a person then other players have to write a answer and the other player vote for their favorite answers. When my name came up I was worried about what people would write as me as not many of my friends were there but many of their friends were. Once everyone had written something my heart dropped as about half of answers were about how no one liked me and that most people just spoke to me and acted as a friend because they felt sorry for me.
This has been very difficult to handle and I could really do with anyone I could talk to every now and then or to help me out for the time being."
lonely,Redesigned my website companions.love where you can chill without chatting.,"Redesigned my website companions.love where you can chill without chatting. - Hi all,

almost a year ago I created my website companions.love in an act of sheer loneliness and also posted it here.

Back then I implemented a chat with quite a few features, with technology that's absolutely not meant for it. Somehow it worked (and it's still there), but it turned out a chat app burns out really quickly, as in, people stop caring. Besides, there are much better solutions for this, like discord, which don't go up in flames when there are 20 people online. 

However, today I finally gave the page another design rework that emphasizes what it has always been about: the world map on which everyone who is online is a colourful dot.

It's a place where you can just go to see someone else ""being there"", without necessarily having to interact, and it's quite beautiful to look at once there are a handful of people at the same time.

Sadly my mobile redesign completely ruined the desktop view, so I recommend using a phone.

See you around :)"

I’ve always felt pretty lonely but this year really does take the cake (seriously I have not talked to my ‘friends’ since March apart from the occasional texts or snaps) but I know that I’m not even at peak loneliness yet since now all of my friends have moved on, not that I was that close with any of them anyway. They’ve all moved out of town into their uni places and I’m the only one still here. We’ve all already stopped talking.

So all in all, I have no job, no friends, no SO and crippling anxiety. I spent my 18th at home which I didn’t mind since I had the excuse of a pandemic but come 2021, I don’t know who or how I’m going to spending my 19th birthday.

And I know I shouldn’t wallow in self pity and should be positive but I seriously feel hopelessly alone and everyday feels like a chore and I’m so so bored that I’ve been staying up all night and sleeping in during the day to wage the days and it’s been unhealthy af but I can’t seem to find a job especially post corona and especially with my intense fear of interviews"
lonely,"Tired of going through life alone ... no family that gives a shit , no significant other that sticks around ... ugh am I destined to be alone ?","Tired of going through life alone ... no family that gives a shit , no significant other that sticks around ... ugh am I destined to be alone ? - There’s no real reason for this post .... ever feel so broken and disconnected from everyone after being beat down to the core by life ? I’m just so friggin lonely ... I wanna move and start over but covid is putting a stop to that . I don’t know anymore"
lonely,No one cares about me,"No one cares about me - I have only 2-3 friends that I feel comfortable with asking to hang out or text but even they don’t really like me as a person. I think everyone find me boring and dull, when I meet new people with my friends I can see that they are more interested in my friends than me. I met a lot of people during summer and I hoped to get closer to them but it didn’t happen. They tell me they like ma a lot but they do nothing that would show that they want to be any closer with me. They don’t invite me to the parties, they don’t text me etc.
Today I had a really shitty day that made me think that I should actually give up and stop going out again. Someone texted me if I’m around and I was like!!maybe they want to meet but they just asked if I can buy them cigarettes. It’s always like that, someone text me or ask me if I can come to the caffe but it ends up they just want me to buy them alcohol or cigarettes. Sometimes they ask me if I want to join them (if it’s alcohol) but it’s more about not being so obvious in using me. 
Another situation: I was sitting in the park and two guys we sometimes sit with came up to me and asked if I can give them a cigarette, when I told them that I don’t have any they just said goodbye and sat on different bench. If my friends were there they would stay and talk with us but since I was alone they weren’t interested. 
I notice this more and more, people just greets me when they see me and they go off with whatever they were doing but when my friends are with me they stay for a quick chat or something.
There is a little hope in me that maybe it’s my attitude, I can be really distant and cold to people I don’t know well because I’m shy and stressed. So sometimes I tell myself that they like me but maybe they are not sure if I do so they act like they act. I think it’s kinda toxic thing to think for me tho. I still hope to befriend some people and I get hurt like every week because it’s not working. I should give up but I can’t. 
People often say that I can’t complain about no one doing anything to be my friend if I don’t do anything as well, but since the beginning of summer I met like 30 people and I think that only ONE of them ever texted me. How of all of those people only one did the first move. There is no way they like me. 
School is already closed, soon there will be another lockdown in my country so I won’t have the chance to meet anyone accidentally. Everyone will forget about me, including my crush with whom I never been able to develop deeper relationship than saying hi and hanging out only if our mutual friends are with me. I had a lot of chances to do something about my social life during summer but I wasted every single one and now it’s too late. I’m just sad and lonely."
lonely,I’m just so lonely it’s so hard to handle,I’m just so lonely it’s so hard to handle - I spent my entire life not caring what anyone thought about me until I got to high school. Then I realized I messed up and I have basically no friends and no gf. I have never loved anyone ever but I really want to just as much as I want to be loved. I hope when I go to college next year I meet someone who truly makes me happy because cuddling a pillow and thinking about being happy gets old after a while when I think about how sad and alone I really am. Anyone wanna talk feel free to comment or pm
lonely,Another way to feel lonely.,"Another way to feel lonely. - Being lonely is weird for me. I have plenty of friends I can talk to online. But that might be why I feel this way too.
I get really attached to my friends, and it hurts to see that they don't feel as strongly.
I'm also aromantic, I don't want a romantic relationship, I do still want to be together with someone, and live with them. But I know that won't happen. 

I'm not a very remarkable friend, I'm the friend who would walk behind the others if there's no space on the road. I also very easily push people away, and notice it too late.

I wish I could find someone who feels the same way about me as I do to them, but that chance is virtually 0."

Just yesterday she *promised* it was going to happen, and it took two weeks to even extract that agreement after I initially asked. 

I don’t know why I expected anything else. She’s treated me like a last resort for a decade. Her endless string of trash receptacles she calls boyfriends get top priority over her own sister. Oh, I’m not so expendable when she needs me to encourage our mother to do her a favor because she’s gotten herself in some clandestine financial jam again. I’ll say I’m done but the next time she needs me I’ll be there. I hate that I allow her to do this to me. I hate how she doesn’t notice my silent screams for help and friendship."

And due to depression + COVID-19, I am still friendless here while they're living their lives and hanging out and having fun.

Now, whenever they mention/show any type of social interaction, I have to hold my tears back.

Best friend laughing with her roomies on Facetime? Tears.

Coworkers mention meeting up with their friends over the weekend? New coworkers making friends at work while I'm still a loner? Tears.

Friends posting pics for another's bday, all new memories that I'm not a part of? Tears.

I've tried to make friends here but it just hasn't been happening for some reason, and now COVID-19.

I haven't laughed with anyone in person besides my BF in a year. It's all triggering, so triggering that I just had an anxiety attack lol, I love constant reminders that I'm alone."

But I hate myself too much to feel as though I deserve love."
lonely,I'm 13 and im really lonely right now (please read the post),"I'm 13 and im really lonely right now (please read the post) - ok so imma try and explain my situation the best I can:

my life was pretty sweet until now I've never had lack of confidence which maybe is also because I act for 6 years I was always pretty outgoing but still liked to be alone sometimes (but never in a lonely way I really love to rea for example) so I'm basically in 8t grade right now (in Germany middle school is till 4th grade and then comes high school) the going over from middle school to his school was pretty easy for me cuz I got there with my best friend ad it wasn't difficult for me to find friends. Everything was well and we were always me my best friend and another friend from high school. and that up until a few months ago where my friend and my best friend started hanging out with two kids from another class who id prefer to the ""cool guys"" me and my friends were never nerdy or the ones being bullied or something we were pretty popular but i really didn't like these guys cause they just didn't seem right to me they always hanged out with some girls who some would prefer to pretty but it want like they were everyone's crush besides i just thought they were dumb. me and my best friend kinda always were thee mature ones and not to sound arrogant but ""intelligent"" the other friend of our 3 guys group wasn't like that but that was ok he just was another kind of friend. btw that was the reason why we were best friends we were super similar and i just liked him because he was the one i could talk too in a more mature way. now the ones from the other class were exactly the opposite they are dumb and make stupid pervert jokes and talk about dumb things make gay physical contact(but not because they're gay don't get me wrong my problem wit this is that they do it to make fun out of gay people) i really don't get what he likes about them but since that we don't talk much anymore cause he's always with that guys. he's been nice to everyone but with me, he's just weird and i hate that cause i don't wanna loose him but i think i already did. yesterday i took all my courage and asked him if he wanted to meet sometime since we haven't done it for a long time, he said that this week he doesn't have any time but net week he would like to! now the thing is how i said before i know for a long time and that was always the thing he said when he didn't want to meet with someone i also know because he told me multiple times so i was a bit sceptic but didn't really think about it too much and was pretty happy. now the thing is that today i sat besides him and heard how the guy from the other class asked him if he wanted to meet tomorrow and he said yes n problem. at that point i was very said i got to two other friends i talked to sometimes who actually are the more nerdy/weeb kind of guys i noticed that they weirdly vanished every time i got to them for the last few days and that one of them often asked the there one if he could come to the toilet with him when i got to them. anyways i thought that i was just imagining it and just kept hanging out wit them, bt after the thing with my bf happened i got to them to get my mind off and saw them talking and walking with a group of girls so i joined and talked wit them after 3 or 4 seconds i joined them noticed that my two friends were drifting off behind the group slowly and when i looked for them they were running away. at that point i came to them and confronted them they didn't say anything and after asking again the friend who always asked the other one to the toilet (who basically is , known to everybody, the worst liar in the world) lied about talking about anime or some shit at that moment i was completely shattered and just walked away with a ""whatever"". so that's basically my story I'm feeling the loneliest I've ever been right now. I don't have anyone to talk to, i don't want o take with my parents cause at home is the only place where i have so much positivity right now and i don't want to ruin this place too that's the only place where i feel safe right now. i guess I'm just searching advice and maybe some love you can dm me if you want and yeah that's basically it, I've always felt anxious and that's normal to me but I've never felt that lonely so yeah, in the last couple of months i think I've become bit socially awkward and i don't like it i REALLY have to get back on track cuz I'm feeling so fucking depressed and lonely right now and I'm in fear for tomorrow cause i don't know what to do in the break so please help me."
lonely,Take a min and read it,"Take a min and read it -  

I don’t know if I’m ever going to share this letter with thousands of strangers. It was tough sitting in the corner of my room and putting my suffering into words. What I’m writing right now is a part of me, the darkest one I may say. The one I’ve been running away from since a long time ago. And here I’m today, sharing it with everyone out there who might relate or who might need it to heal and feel that they’re not alone. I’ve chosen to write this today, after hesitating a couple of times. I decided to face my reality, my past, my future, and my fears with what I love doing most, writing. As Jerry Gilles says “Confront your fears, list them, get to know them, and only then will you be able to put them aside and move ahead.” So here it goes.

 I’ve never felt safe being home, or shall I call it, being in my “house”, because home is where you feel safe, and I don’t. I’ve always been terrified of being near my father, his hug was jail to me, his touches were thorns, his voice sounded like the monsters underneath my bed. As a child, I remember him beating me up for silly stuff, not paying attention, being too noisy, and any silly acts that would cross your mind. Then I grew up, and so did his abuse, matters became worse. There’s so much I want to say when I mention “abuse” but I don’t want to spend my whole life focusing on the abuse and forgetting to heal. I even remember apologizing after his abuse, because for a long time I went to bed blaming myself for the abuse and continuously convinced myself that I “deserve” it. My dad used to be my hero, then I realized, heroes don’t exist.

I threw this letter in my closet for two weeks. I guess I was triggered . Then I took a deep breath, gained my power again, then continued writing.

Growing up in this house I always questioned God about why all this was happening to me, I prayed, hoping someone was up there listening, I mean, there had to be. I needed a shoulder to cry on, instead, my hands fell on blades and pills. Suicide just felt like my destiny or my exit door out of this hellfire. I desperately needed anything to relate to, a song, a book, a quote, a movie, or even a person. I needed to hear healing words, anyone to let me know that the sun will rise, and that the winds will heal my wounds.

 If my destiny was a person, I’d ask her why out of all people I had to be the chosen. I’d ask her if there’s hope or if I’ll ever survive. I’d ask her if one day I’ll have a family of my own, and a place where I call home.

 After all the ups and downs , the hell and the heaven, the rights, and the lefts, I’ve been diagnosed with depression, Bpd, PTSD, just two weeks ago. I take antidepressants when I’m only seventeen, spent my teenage years dealing with trauma rather than being a normal happy teenager, and fall in love. I wonder where I’d be now If I was a normal teenager who didn’t have to look at the mirror and feel guilty about being born. Or who wouldn’t consider her diary as her best friend or put down any chance of love, because I’d never let anyone in my darkest memories. Maybe all I need is an apology to heal, I hope one day I’ll get one. So for all you out there dealing with any type of trauma, you’re not alone, you’ll survive, you’re strong. Just hold on. I’m not a survivor yet, but I’m a warrior, and so are you."

We are currently living together with her family until I can move back home. I have no friends to talk to about my issues because no one lives near us. My work mates do not care. My family do not care. I have 0 other friends. 0.  She is an emotional abuser, liar and manipulator but I have to remain here until I can finally leave. I will be moving back to live with my parents. My parents who are racist, sexist and buy in to dumb conspiracies i.e. 5g, new world order and anything else ridiculous. My parents who have struggled to communicate with me emotionally for my entire 25+ year existence. My parents who have 4 spare bedrooms full of items and clothing, one of which was mine until 2 years ago but they are annoyed that I asking to have 1 room for me. They expect me to sleep in a single bed in my 20s because they don't want to move items and clothes from the other rooms. They expect me to sleep surrounded by 4 walls of shoes. Who the fuck owns 200 pairs of shoes. I have no one to talk to. No one to listen to me. I have wasted 5 years of my life and I have been surrounded by people who make me feel incredibly lonely. All I want is someone to care for me as much I care for them. Someone who actually wants me. I am sad. I am lonely. I am angry. The internal pain and shame I've held onto for so long is weighing me down."

And right now with Covid, the CA fires, the job market recoiling I’m so existentially sad.

I had a friend that we were talking every week through the lockdown. I would check in on her and she would check in on me and then she just dropped me completely. We were working on a project together, I did my part then she disappeared. She’s just been posting pictures with other friends acting like she’s so popular. I message her and just get reactions. The rest of my friends have gone full blown anarchist activists wanting to tear down society with this civil unrest. And I very strongly don't see the world in that light. I feel so bad. I can’t escape negative thinking. Feeling left and unwanted just like being a kid. When I was a kid I was always left out and always had to figure things out in my own head by myself."

While I won't say I'm hideous, I not exactly what girls are attracted to.

Secondly, where I'm from it's all about money. If you don't have money, cars, bikes and property no girl will even consider going out with you. My father failed at every angle in life and couldn't buy his own house. Something literally every other man his age did years ago. My brother has been a victim of this four times already, he's charming and girls are attracted to him at first but when they figure out he has no inheritance they leave him in a very ugly manner. It has happened once to me as well. Even if a girl dates you for a while, she will inevitably kick you out of her life and won't give you a second thought if you don't have any inheritance."

lonely,A Message to Young People from Andrei Tarkovsky.,"A Message to Young People from Andrei Tarkovsky. - \- What would you like to tell young people?  


\- I  don’t know… I think I’d like to say only that they should learn to be  alone and try to spend as much time as possible by themselves. I think  one of the faults of young people today is that they try to come  together around events that are noisy, almost aggressive at times. This  desire to be together in order to not feel alone is an unfortunate  symptom, in my opinion. Every person needs to learn from childhood how  to be spend time with oneself. That doesn’t mean he should be lonely,  but that he shouldn’t grow bored with himself because people who grow  bored in their own company seem to me in danger, from a self-esteem  point of view.

If you are unfamiliar with Andrei Tarkovsky's works, he was a Russian director who is considered one of the greatest film makers of all time. Although he only made seven feature films in his lifetime, each one of them is a visual masterpiece. He also wrote a book about film making. called, Sculpting in Time. Among many aspects of his movies, one of them is Silence and Solitude. That's why I want you to read this. When I was reading this paragraph, I instantly thought of this subreddit, so you may know that if you somehow convert your loneliness into solitude you can open the door to grow mentally and spiritually. And if you admire Movies or Books or anythings passionately, I'd love to talk about it, just hit me up. And also, if you want to read the full interview, let me know I'll send you a link."

lonely,Just venting ig.,"Just venting ig. - So it’s been a while since I’ve been able to actually connect with anyone. I’ve been living in a college town for a while now, but it was a different town before that, and a different one before that, then another, then another and then 2 more before then to reach the place of my birth. 
I think what I’m trying to say is in the incoherent section prior to this is that I’ve move around so much over my life that I’ve started feeling... disconnected? It’s hard to describe the feeling all the faces start melting together and it feels like the people those faces belong to have forgotten about me as well... I feel like I have no friends. I mean I know people and I think I know how to interact with them but I feel like that’s just me being fake. Like the people I meet are just people i have to put up with. Maybe I’m just a jaded dick? 
Idk all these thought imposed along with the self doubt make it hard for me to feel happy.
I’ve kinda given up trying to find a girlfriend and have just committed to trying to get into a med school. I don’t go out anymore, I’ve stopped approaching people entirely, it’s literally just me that’s been with me for more than a 3 months, everyone else’s just changes. 
I’ve watched the office way to many times now.
It’s not like I don’t smile or look happy. I smile and I look happy. I just don’t feel happy.  God I feel like such a loser complaining like this, I think I should be better than this. I have to be stronger right? To get into med school? This is what it’s like for others too right? 
Is it weird to think that the internet can act like your diary of you approach it right? Huh..."

lonely,Lonely and sad,"Lonely and sad - New to this group and looking for some support here. Devastated by how two faced people can be. This is my story-

There is this acquaintance that I have known since 4 years, when we met through a common friend. We became facebook friends and chatted once in a year or so, but never hung out since we went to different cities. I recently moved to a new city and found out that this acquaintance lives in the same city as well. We met once for coffee and chatted for a really long time and found out that we have a lot of things in common. I don't really have a good friend in this city and I was hoping that this person finally becomes one.

Now here comes the sad part. I was recently searching for an apartment after my current lease got over. This person mentioned that he has a room available in his apartment and I took it up. I was hoping to join his social group and hang out with this friends. I started noticing a behavior in his actions towards me after I shifted to the apartment. He started acting too formal with me and maintaining a bit of distance with me. Whenever I asked him if he wanted to hang out while suggesting something, he would make some or the other excuse and not hang out. There was one time when we hung out, and my god was it so frustrating. It looked like he was hanging out, out of pity for me and not because he wanted to hang out. I thought maybe this is his nature, but then I saw him with his friends, and he was so happy and friendly while hanging out with them.

It is 12 am here, and I can hear from the wall of my room, that his friends have come to give a surprise birthday party in the living room. I was not invited to this even though all he needs to do is walk 10 feet and knock on my room.

I have always been a bit of loner, but I prefer to hang out only with trustworthy and honest people, so have very few friends. Most of the people in my life have been two-faced and this person turned out to be just another. I have crossed 25 and haven't spoken to a single girl in my life and don't have a good set of friends to hang out with.

Apologize for the long rant, just wanted to get it out. Appreciate any form of support you guys can provide :) Happy to do the same for you guys."

lonely,rant,"rant - so far ive been to around 8 different schools, which would probably explain a bit of my struggles to be social. but ever since 9th grade, its been not so smooth. 

usually every grade i was in school, id have multiple best friends, and it was so fun. but in 8th grade i was bullied super bad, ive been bullied a few times before but it was never this bad. not to be dramatic but i felt so embarrassed, gross and ashamed for just existing. so obviously when i changed schools, id change the way i behaved to prevent that. 

the thing is though i was afraid to talk to people, so obviously no one wanted to talk to me either. i regret this so much, because now im in 11th and have absolutely no clue how i could even befriend someone. 

ive been trying so hard, from attempting to talk to people on *a bunch* of different discord servers, apps, joining groups and in person. but nothing has ever worked. the only people in my contacts who isn't my family is my manager and moms friend.

it hurts so bad and ive been crying to sleep so much for SO LONG, i don't even know how long. i just wish id have someone reach out to me, or go to them. and knowing it's all 100% my fault hurts me even more. 

ive tried convincing myself that having no friends wasnt a bad thing, being a lonewolf sounded cool, no dealing with fake/toxic friends or drama...etc... but its too much now.

i dont even care if i had the most horrible people to talk with. i just want feel how i felt when i had someone to laugh with, tell personal things to, express literally any emotion at all. id do anything to be comfortable with a person.

im so desperate, i dont know where to look or reach out. i never use this site but this is for real my breaking point, last straw, whatever."

For years I’ve just been holding everything inside and felt like there’s no one left I can be comfortable around. All my friends left to go somewhere else years ago and I’ve had nothing since, no family, no classmates, no coworkers. Just to have one person who I can break free from holding back would make all the difference. That’s all I’ve asked of for years and still nothing, nothing but being stuck with people who shun me for who I am, constantly holding in myself and draining all my energy and motif doing so. It makes me so pissed all the time that I can’t get this simple request, while everyone else I meet daily has all of that and more. Just smashed my tv and chucked a propane tank and chair though.

They hang out together without me, and Im trying my best to move on and find new friends but given the covid situation it’s been almost impossible. And because we were all friends last year, I can’t help but feel super lonely, left out, and wonder what is wrong with me. I’ve talked to them about it, and they said they’d do better at including me. Im trying my best to believe them and move on but i cant forget how they treated me.

Growing up, I honestly I thought I could do it alone. But I've realized now that it is very hard to do it alone. I have actually been severely crippled my entire life from the lack of social support but I just never noticed it because I had no comparison point. I didn't know what it's like to have social support and I still don't.

I know that it is difficult to go without social support. My reality is brittle. Any basic problem I have makes me feel like my world is shattering. If I had social support, I would have people who could help cheer me up and make me feel safe and help me withstand life's hardships.

The worst is when anyone shows any malice towards me. If anyone purposely does or says anything to try to harm me, it feels like they will destroy me and make my life miserable.

I can't handle the stresses of everyday life. I'm already old (late 20s), so it's extremely difficult to make social connections, and it's only going to get worse honestly."

lonely,My religious parents don’t allow dating.,"My religious parents don’t allow dating. - I’m 13, and I know I sound *waaayyyy* too young to be “lonely” but idk what to do. I’ve had several crushes before, but I never confessed because they weren’t anything major. Until this girl, she’s a cute , nerdy tomboy and I absolutely adore her. She’s really chill and I love that.

I was born in a religious family for my whole life. My parents believe that dating is only allowed when it ends in marriage (Something very unlikely for a first gf/bf). My parents most likely wouldn’t want me to date at this age even when I’m almost in high school. My older brother just entered college, and for the whole time he was in high school he didn’t have a gf (or he just kept it a secret). It doesn’t help that I’m starting to doubt my religion.

I’m also extremely insecure about myself, mainly about my weight. I hate how big my belly and thighs are. It makes me look like a monster. I hate wanting to skip meals so I can loose a pound or two.

lonely,Is it possible to have friends when you're depressed,"Is it possible to have friends when you're depressed - For me, it's been tricky.

lonely,Unrequited,"Unrequited - I fell hard for a mutual friend on a discord server.

Fast forward to now things were starting to feel fine then he asked for advice on what works on a dating app and I've had the same crushing feelings as if I'd been rejected allover again. It hurts, it hurts so much but I've been putting on a brave face and faking it until the pain goes away but I just want to cry about it without bothering my friends right now because I feel so goddamn silly for feeling like this. 

I didn't even realize I held any hope maybe it hurts more because I'm insecure about my loneliness and looks I mean I've been gaining weight while at home and I already didn't feel very confident as it is and it just felt so right with this guy because I was finally comfortable around someone again. Oh well I shouldn't dwell much longer I've wasted enough time as it is on someone that doesn't see my worth."

lonely,I dont know how to rebuild,"I dont know how to rebuild - 
The week before my 18th birthday I left home to study a prestigious course at an elite university in a beautiful city. I had been shy, lonely, and repressed in high school and spent the summer before leaving dreaming of making a new life for myself.

Instead I spent the following 2 and a half years digging myself deep into a hermit life where I regularly went 2-3 weeks without speaking and felt genuine fear before leaving my room. Eventually the isolation and hopelessness broke me down and I had to drop out and move back home.

Now I've recently turned 24 and am still stuck in my hometown. I eventually got a minimum wage job and sort of resocialised myself enough to feel more or less normal again, and moved out into a sad little flat on my own near my parents house.

I'm not being dramatic when I say I've never had a close friend. When I was in school I was always a peripheral member of social groups. We were friends in school but not outside. I lost what few old friends I had had almost immediately after leaving and I've never made any new ones. The people I work with now are the most significant relationships I've had in at least 6-7 years, but I don't think they consider me much more than an acquaintance. Romantic relationships have been out of the question in the past.

Now I feel trapped and alone where I am. I don't have any social circle to meet people through and feel embarrassed trying to meet new people and having to reveal how sad and empty my life has been, doubly when it comes to trying to date.

 I don't have the money to move away and start again, even if I could find a new job. I doubt if I'm even capable of going back to education. I constantly think about the past and all the opportunities and potential I squandered. I used to at least have a little hope that some day things would work out and I'd be happy and feel successful. Now It seems like I'm settling into a quiet uneventful unsatisfying life without other people in it and I don't know what to do about it."

Maybe one day I’ll run into a miracle person who would look at me with genuine interest and ask if “I’m ok”  I’d look a little baffled at first then insecure and defensive then the guard I always have on in public finally drops.  And I’d give that person a hug and crying saying “I’m not okay it’s soo dark and lonely here I don’t want to be here anymore this isn’t for me and I don’t feel like I’ve ever belonged or were supposed to be here.” And they hold me tight and gently pat my head and just tell me “it’s okay” but I actually felt that they meant it and I can just cry till I was content. It feels great till I snap back into reality then realize I feel so lonely I imagine a random stranger would just genuinely care and it gets a little darker.

I suffer from anxiety and pretty severe depression. I’m realizing I don’t have a supportive group of people around me. I’m lonely most all of the time. COVID hasn’t helped, but I don’t think it’s hurt me either. I was lonely before it hit. I’m a very affectionate person and I prefer you be the same. I’d also prefer you be my around my age or younger — just so I’m more comfortable. Having your heart on your sleeve doesn’t hurt either since that’s my biggest downfall.

lonely,The only girl I've ever really cared about ghosted me months ago. I don't know what to do.,"The only girl I've ever really cared about ghosted me months ago. I don't know what to do. - I met this girl a couple of years ago, and I basically immediately fell in love. I loved the way she talked and joked, and it seemed like we hit it off. For the last couple of years, we've been good friends. We would talk over Discord (I was never brave enough to ask for her number), for hours. Around most people, she was pretty shy as far as I could tell, but around me, she would talk and laugh, and I took some pride in that. She would confide some pretty personal things to me, like how she came out as Bi to her parents, and they punished her for it. Things seemed fine, but towards the end of the first quarter of last school year, I noticed some things were wrong. She began to sleep in class, and she wouldn't do her work. Her grades began to slip, and she stopped staying after school for the club we had together. I asked her what was up, and after a little prying, she told me. Her parents had been having marital troubles for years, and finally decided to get divorced. Even before the decision had been made, her father started to see another woman. She told me so much, and I felt really humbled that she trusted me so much. 

When covid hit and we were all quarantined, I messaged her and asked her if she wanted to play some Xbox games online. After a while, she responded and said yes. For the next few weekends, when I wasn't working on online school, we would get on Xbox Live and chat while we played Minecraft or Halo. We even played until two in the morning once, beating Halo 4 in one sitting. She seemed fine over the calls, and I wasn't really worried. She said she was fine, and all I could do was believe her. After a few weeks, she told me that she had been grounded from games because of her grades. She asked me for some help with her homework, but after a while, she just stopped caring about school, and  let her grades slip even more. Her responses to my messages got shorter and eventually, she stopped responding all together.

Summer rolled around, and I messaged her on discord, asking if she had been let off of the hook for the summer. I didn't realize it, but my Discord notifications had been disabled, so I didn't se her response when she sent it two days later, and then not for like a week after. When I did, I immediately tried to respond, but I said that she had either removed me as a friend, or blocked me. I messaged her on Xbox, and after a while, she replied, saying that she had been cleaning out her contacts. I asked her if she had any plans, to which she replied no. I saw that she had been playing a game, and I asked her if she wanted to play that one. She said sure, so I downloaded it. As I started to download the game, I asked her which version I should get, to which she responded ""It doesn't matter, it's all the same"". That was the last thing she said to me, back in June. Since then, I've only sent a couple of messages to her on Xbox, but she hasn't responded. She hasn't refriended me on discord, and she's ignored my couple of friend requests. I tried to send one more a few weeks ago, and it said that there was an error, so that means that she probably blocked me. I haven't seen her at in person school at all. I feel so empty. Honestly, I really liked her, but being friendzoned would have been a win for me."
lonely,Scrolling through the posts...,"Scrolling through the posts... - I'm about to turn 25 in a few months. 

I've been going through hell for the last 5 years. Days, weeks, months fly past me. Years ago seems like it was only yesterday, yesterday seems like it happened years ago. It's weird slipping into the abyss. I've lost all connection to time. I wanna change so bad. It seems so easy. Just do it. But the fear of change is so big that the will to change is drowned in it's infancy.

Anyway. Looking at all the posts of people feeling lonely... it's kinda funny. The feelings we share somewhat make me feel less lonely. Even if it's just for a moment that will blend in with the last years and be forgotten eventually. 

I don't even know where I'm going with this. I hope things get better for you. I wish for you to find someone. Maybe for a day or a few months? Maybe for the rest of your life. I'm afraid that train has long since passed for me."

lonely,Is there something wrong with me,"Is there something wrong with me - Growing up I struggled to make friends. I wasn’t the quirky girl... I was the weird girl. The one that people avoided like a plague. I was unattractive and unaware of how to be socially normal. I had two friends that lived in my neighborhood but they were always closer. They would often exclude me or just all together ignore me. I was used to it though. I ended up getting social anxiety and just doing online school. Even in college I have struggled to make friends even though I try so hard. I just got my own apartment and the loneliness feels louder then ever. I purposely frequent the pool and gym in hopes that a conversation will arise. So far nothing. Tonight I realized one of my childhood friends blocked me. I am not sure why, most likely my line of work. I know I rarely see her but it hurts I guess. I’m not sure why I am writing this I will most likely delete it immediately. I am just sad I guess and don’t understand why. I wonder if there is something wrong with me. Perhaps I am mean, rude, or weird. Hopefully I figure out my problem. My goal for the last two years is just to make one good friend. Wish me luck"
lonely,My confidence is absolutely crushed,My confidence is absolutely crushed - It's gotten so bad that I've convinced myself that no girl would ever want me. This has led me to an addiction to buying pics. I want to stop but I keep thinking with my dick and buying. With every purchase my confidence gets worse. It's a vicious circle that I can't break. I hate myself.
lonely,Moving on (pt. 1),"Moving on (pt. 1) - About a year later, she came to me and asked if I still had feelings for her. I said a bit, because I still hadn’t completely moved on. She wanted to get back together, saying that she is now ready to date. We went on our first date, and I pieced it together rather well, I think. Timed at sunset on a lakefront, casual with pizza. Thinking back on it, that wasn’t the best choice, but it was my first date and I wanted a special place for anniversaries if it ever came to it. Anyway, the date went well, and I asked if she might be interested in another one later on, and she said yes. About 2 weeks later, I called and asked if she has any good ideas for a date, and she said that she’ll think on it and get back to me. As soon as I hung up, she texted me that she wanted to break up again, saying how she still wasn’t ready to date, and probably wouldn’t be until college. That hurt. Why couldn’t she have just told me in the call, did she not trust how I would react? Anyway, that was a few months ago, and I still hurt every time I see her. I went from being fine with being single to aching every time I see a couple, and I think about what I did wrong. I know it’s a bit extreme, but I had feelings for her for years, since jr. high. I just feel empty."
lonely,Moving on (pt. 1),"Moving on (pt. 1) - I’ve had a crush on my childhood friend for around 5 years, and then last year she admitted to having feelings for me too. We became “a thing”, but we never dated or did anything, and it never moved. After about 3 or so months of that, she told me that she wanted to break up right in front of my friends and hers. I understand that she wanted to break up, and I could respect that, but didn’t she trust me enough to just tell me instead of bringing it up in front other people, like she was worried of how I would react?"

Still she was cute. She was like the epitome of ‘Doomer Girl’ in real life, she has the same cute short jet black hair. Cute!

lonely,20 and an odd-ball,"20 and an odd-ball - I know people say that I got a lot of time ahead of me, but it sucks knowing that other girls my age and even younger are in a relationship. I only had one boyfriend in my life and it was around 18/19. No high-school sweetheart or anything like that, and I feel like a part of that was my upbringing in the Jehovah’s witness cult where you can only “date” another Jehovah’s Witness and nobody else, even if they’re Christian. 

I have gotten attention from other guys, but it usually doesn’t end well. I get weird vibes from them or they come off as creepy. I have noticed that a lot of them notice my looks, but not my personality and it sucks. I want someone who wants me for me, for my personality, not because they want to fuck me.  And it’s hard because most people my age don’t want a serious relationship and it’s frustrating. 
Okay, rant over."
lonely,I feel like I'm alone in the world,"I feel like I'm alone in the world - I've been feeling like this for a while. I feel like no one in my family or any of my friends can understand me. I have a lot of problems in my head, no mental illnesses I don't think but I feel isolated like I don't belong. I was bullied through out elementary and middle school mostly by girls and my ""friends"" because I was a little chubby when I was younger (I still am I'm 40 pounds over weight. I'm very insecure and I get nervous around girls (I'm 18 and still in high school) I have made most of my friends in the past by being forced into groups in class. I had to move out of state so all the friends I made there have stopped talking to me. I have never had a girlfriend before so I don't know what that's like and my dad left when I was young so my mom married my step dad who drinks I have 5 siblings and one of them is in a gang. I get really unmotivated a lot like in the beginning of the day I'm motivated but as the day progresses it slowly fades a way. I just want to feel connected to something the only time I feel normal is when I'm high or drunk. I feel tempted to join a gang but I decide to join the military instead. I just feel like nothing can fix me I feel broken and alone and I feel like people loose interest in me fast. IDK what to do I try help other people with their problems but that doesn't help me in the end. Sorry for the long post I just had to get some of this stuff off my chest as I have no one to talk to"

Be guaranteed to have a hug within the week. Know that I can expect some level of warmth and comfort to help with...like...life. I keep signing up for dating apps and then not following through with the dates because of severe social anxiety and every. Damn. Time. That I don't act on it I picture the date I canceled on because of my anxiety I don't picture us having sex, or us kissing, I picture us hugging. I picture the comfort of another human simply embracing me.

I'm lonely as heck. And I keep dreaming about her, and the dreams are so real. In my dream last night, she was cuddled up in my arms and I can even recall how she smelt like shampoo, and she held my hand so tight. Then I woke up, no idea who she is and alone again.
I love posting on this sub it really helps me build patience while I wait for her. But it would be really nice to no longer see comments about ""just being patient"" or something. Those comments are 0% helpful because I am 100% happy with myself and patiently waiting for her.

I need to feel her. I need to feel her skin. I love her, I just don't know her."
lonely,Complete isolation makes doing good things for oneself so much harder,"Complete isolation makes doing good things for oneself so much harder - Over the past seven months of quarantining and social distancing, I've noticed that my motivation to take care of myself has completely diminished.  I've always been an introvert and generally have spent more time alone than one should to maintain mental stimulation and positive mental health.  All told, my day-to-day isn't completely flipped upside down in the midst of this pandemic, but my hope for a better future and the related incentive to do things that are good for myself have gone out the door.

I know I should take care of myself.  I know I should engage in habits that would make me the type of person I want to present to the world.  Among these things I should be doing are exercising regularly, cleaning my apartment, cleaning my car, spending time to learn something new from start to finish, developing plans for my future, scheduling appointments for the doctor or dentist, buying new clothes, getting a haircut, making a dating profile, drinking less, eating healthier... the list goes on.

When things were normal and when my mental health was in a modestly better state, I could generally keep on top of these things without so much of a struggle.  Now it just seems impossible.  Not just difficult, but impossible.  My days off are spent sleeping in, spending hours deciding whether I should first make my bed, do laundry, or clean the kitchen, and then dropping everything so I can get whatever meager form of exercise I have time for that week.  I feel like I have no time and yet the time I do have is spent doing practically nothing. 

I know I should treat myself better, but psychologically there is no incentive to.  I have no one to impress, and I really can't wrap my head around the idea of that ever changing.  I know if I were able to view myself from an outsider's perspective, I would see my accomplishments and my capabilities and I'd think that this person deserves a rewarding life.  But there is no outsider's perspective, just mine.  The reward mechanism is just not there and it's absolutely detrimental."

At the last minute. With a reason like ""oh someone else invited me so I'm going there instead"". That's so rude, no? Why let me know I'm the last resort, or a placeholder until something better comes along? I have a bf but he works 24//7 (workaholic in top industry, not needing to make ends meet) so I sit alone day after day after day. My parents both moved abroad separately. I just have nobody who seems to want to spend time with me.

I’m such a loser I pay for camgirls. I probably have spent thousands at this point. 

I also recently downloaded tinder and if I see a girl put her Snapchat username in her bio I will add her, with the false hope that she will be friends with me. But we all know tinder ( a majority of the time ) is for attention whores ( guys and girls ). I’m guilty of it too. I want attention from the opposite sex ( who doesn’t ). It’s just unfair how easy it is for girls. If you want success on dating apps more than 90% of the time if you’re a guy you have to model status looks. 

Online dating and the internet in general has made lose faith in humanity.  There’s so much garbage and negativity, not just with porn and dating, but everything. It’s not even funny."

I never had any real friends. I never had anyone that would care about me. I was always alone. People would constantly bully me in Elementary school. I'm looking terrible and I can't do anything about it. I wake up every morning and look at myself in the mirror. The thing I see is disgusting.

I'm so much different from all my classmates. They have friends, girlfriends, social lives, lots of money from their rich parents. I have neither of that. But most importantly - they are attractive, good at sports, smart, funny, charming and other stuff. I'm not even close.

It frustrates me so much. I'd like to have at least a little bit of joy in my life. A basic feeling of satisfaction. But fuck no. I'm a mess. Everybody always stares at me. It makes me so anxious.

And this is not even the end. I feel like everybody hates me. They are treating me like a trash. From time to time I have dreams where it all goes away, where I'm treated like a member of society. And then I fucking wake up.

lonely,Far away for far too long,"Far away for far too long - I'm writing this as a way to vent, I suppose, so it might be long and rambly. Actually, probably will be.

I'm 32-years old. I'm so lonely that it feels like I'll lose myself to it. I've felt this way my whole life, but I can relate to this exact feeling since I was about 16. I live in Sweden. I came here as a refugee from Iraq, at the age of 5 years old. We as a family suffered in many ways, but I'll focus on myself here. I didn't realize it until much later, but growing up in a strange place never worked for me. Sweden is great, and the people are kind and generous, but it's not home, and I don't know if it ever will be. I speak perfect Swedish, and in many ways act and live like a Swede, but I don't feel like one. A lot of it is because I don't have the things that are inherently familiar; the culture of my homeland, people that look like me, people I act as almost on a genetic level, and most importantly, my own family. The few times I've gone to visit, they've treated me as the long lost son, making his return, even though we don't know each other. Just because we're family. I felt love. I felt belonging. I don't know if I can ever get that in Sweden, since I have no family here outside of my parents and siblings.

Speaking of my parents and siblings, ever since we came to Sweden, it was chaos. Parents fought, father abused mother physically, loud yelling. Traumatizing. He left the year I turned 11.  My mother is the victim of various physical and mental illnesses, so I could never rely on her for safety, comfort, stability. My older brother was a sadistic abuser, bully. I endured him until I was 23, when he finally left to live on his own. In school I was this weird kid who zoned out and acted funny. I was labelled stupid and gross. I hated going to school. I preferred to be at home, with the door to my room closed, playing video games, and later, spending time on my computer. I spent some time chatting with strangers. For what it was, it felt good. It felt like I connected with people. I was about 13 at the time. Later on I was introduced to MMORPGs, about 2-3 years later. They consumed me profoundly. Here were worlds with avatars of real people scurrying around. A world where I could be someone cool, important, a leader, and a friend. I was good at typing fast and wittily. People grew to know me and like me based on that personality, and the fact that I was somewhat strong (in-game) and helpful and kind. I was on almost every waking minute, and didn't eat or sleep to maximise my time there. 

I felt like I had friends. People would message me as soon as  I logged on. Girls in the same guild would welcome me with various sweet expressions. It's hard to put into words what it did to me. Everything I lacked in life (family, friends, love, money, belonging), I could get in those virtual worlds. I never wanted to unplug. But it couldn't last forever. I met a girl through one of those games, a girl I played with and talked to on-and-off for years. We got married and had a child. Then it didn't work out and they left, and I was back to my lonesome.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got new anti-depressants that affect the dopamine level in my brain, and they helped tremendously. I've started an online education to become an electrician. The education is short, at one year, and the particular field I'm specialising in is in high demand, and on top of that it's decently paying. That's where I am today. In about a year and a half from today I'll be employed and for the first time in my life, in control of my life, at least financially. I've spent my entire life living on social welfare, because I always felt too bad to work or study. I don't know where it will go from there, since I've never had to truly take care of myself. Although I've spent the last 5 years or so living alone, I haven't had many responsibilities, being on welfare.

My hope is that I'll be able to endure working full time, and build up the things that can be bought with money, including opportunities that cost money, like travel. I call this step ""finding myself"", after which I'll find my love. Although I can never live in Iraq, and I'll never have a network of family in Sweden, my hope is that I'll feel good enough to enjoy life with a woman by my side, and children to nurture. The kids are a bonus, because what I truly need is another person; someone who can give me physical touch, someone who can see me, encourage me, support me emotionally, someone whom I can look into the eyes of and caress. It sounds almost naïve, even to myself, how much I expect to get from just having a person in my life. But I'm not naïve enough to think that anyone can save someone else. Only you can help yourself. Other people can only support you, but even knowing this, is it too much to expect? I don't know, but right not it's part of what I need. The other part is having friends, but that's more complicated in a way. I've been lonely my whole life. I don't know what you're supposed to do with friends as an adult who's working full time. Having a girlfriend is simpler in that sense; we live together or apart, we are each other's half, we have sex, we spend a lot of time together, and the rest apart. But friends seem to need more substance. I'll have to deal with it slowly, as it comes, and figure it out that way. That being said, I can't rely on just my lover for companionship. Friends are maybe as important. Gotta keep that in mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

My hope is that I'll be able to bury those memories of the years I spent in MMORPGs, and truly feel like I don't need them anymore. To be able to look forward bravely and honestly, because I'm content with my life as it is, since I have everything I got from those fake worlds, but for real this time. Work, love, friendship."

Her mind plays tricks on her. 

 thoughts of does he love her? An I good enough? Is he going to leave her like everyone else has? When is she going to have her day? Is this what was written for her? Pain over and over. 

She can't find a way to get out. It's her own prison, which she is stuck in without away out. She thinks she tries everything..There is no key.. because no one cares. They just leave her to deal with everthing alone.

lonely,feeling too ugly and shy for love,"feeling too ugly and shy for love -  Hi everyone, i’m a 17 years old guy and i feel ugly most of the time. I’m actually evidently balding ( it’s really noticeable even from miles away ), and of course that didn’t led to an increase of my self esteem. The fact that i’ve never been in a relationship with a girl, and that i have never kissed one, makes me feel very sad. I’ve been practicing sports and going to the gym since 9 years, so i’m physically good. The main problem is my face. Plus, i never feel enough for girls: as i go to the gym and see a girl i find attractive, i start feeling sad because i think i’ll never be in a relationship and i’m too shy to talk to any girl. In italy, it works like this: guys always have to make the first move. Most of them can get VERY pretentious pretty easily too, Not easy at all. Btw, another thing that destroys me is my stuttering, that sometimes gets sorse and worse. I’m really introvert, and i like it, but i’d love to be way less shy tbh. I sometimes have suicidal thoughts because of my ossessive thoughts, that destroy my self esteem too. I’m having a psychotherapy since 3 months, but the situation isn’t improving that much. I also deleted my socials, cause i was done with all those perfect looking guys with their girlfriends and all other things.  
I’m also a bit tired of the cliche sentences everybody keeps telling me. Life is not a fairy tale.

Thank you for the time, just wanted to rant a bit but a bit of help would be really appreciated... sorry i’m a bit stressed right now."
lonely,deprived,"deprived - I’m touch deprived, I’m deprived of so many psychological needs that I’m surprised as to how I continue to live, it is that bad. In order to compensate I just fantasize about being in a romantic relationship and being hugged and loved and stuff by my current crush. I’m only 17 but I’ve felt this way for a while now. It makes me so sad because I’m so young but I have a very unfulfilling social life , which I know is my own doing. I don’t know why, I don’t want a friendly hug , although that would be nice, but I want a romantic hug? It really confuses me as to why I feel the need for a romantic type hug from someone I’m romantically involved with? I feel like that would fill me up the most, as opposed to a hug from a friend :/ does anyone else feel this way? I just really want a boyfriend I guess you could say, maybe it has to do with my daddy issues who knows lol"

Yeah i might be only 15 but i feel sad every day because i am lonely. I do have friends but i dont have friends that actually care about you. I do have a crush on this girl for like a super long time now.

Thing is with her, today i was talking with her because we had some time between lessons. It went alright and it was actually nice to talk with her. 

Only she said after a while because we were talking about if she likes someone that there is a guy but that “i dont know him”. I do and i was pretty sad when she said that. But i just went on and acted like i didnt hear that.

She is a girl i realllyyyyyyyyyyyy like. I never told her exactly how i fees but she knows. She is where i think about the whole day. I do have other things like hobbys and school, school goes alright so thats not a problem.

i understand that she doesnt like me and that it will never work but i hate being friends while deep inside i want more than friends. Im stuck in this shit. 

Me and her arent really a match i gues but i only like her. I hooked up with other girls to get over her but with all of them i thought “no i dont want this i want her”."

I've tried reaching out and making new friends but women think I'm just trying to hit on them and trying to have sex. All I want is just someone to talk. 
My roomate has a gf and brings her to our room occasionally and its fine, but I hate hearing their conversations. 

I just stay in my room all day and don't do a thing. I will usually play video games or just sleep.

I feel everyday it gets harder to get through the day without at least thinking about how everyday that goes by I'm getting older and going to stay alone. 

I'm 28 and live in a navy base in the middle of nowhere. The newest town is 20 min away and it's a small military/farm town. Everyone there is already married or has kids so I always feel awkward trying to talk to people in town just seeing a ring on their finger."
lonely,Don't want to graduate to not lose the daily social interactions am I weird?,"Don't want to graduate to not lose the daily social interactions am I weird? - Hello, so I'm in a weird situation I'm a boy 22 years old and I feel like I've never had any real friends despite being the funny guy in class. I always liked school because this is the only place where I could talk to people and people would talk back to me, some likes me some do not and since I was afraid of being lonely in class I had to be the annoying clown in the class. I've never had any real friends lots of them were only here to get distracted in class. Today I realised that was a bad move because I always ended up alone. 

I'm going to graduate from university this year and I'm so afraid of losing all my social interaction that I literally don't want to quit school like I'm currently planning to do a PhD so I can stay 4 more years with people around me. I think the things that scares me the most is that I never met a girl, never talked to a girl outside of the classroom, never touched a girl and so on. I always wanted but I don't know how to do it, like I just cannot go to a girl it feels so awkward. Since, highschool I always be around boys because girls do not like science and maths I guess.

In a nutshell, I'm lost like I don't really care I have no friends/gf but I feel like leaving school may remove the small amount of daily social interaction I have. 

I recently joined this subreddit and at first I was like that's the way it is sometimes you win sometimes you don't and you gotta move on but after reading dozens of stories I'm like I gotta do something but what?"

But one of them has another group of friends that she always hangs out with (that I know too) and they’re all really close and the other 3 girls all hang out together and they’re really close. I feel like I don’t really belong in any of their groups, and I’m starting to feel more and more lonely each day. They all have photos of them together as their phone backgrounds or photos of them in each other’s wallets but I’m never in any of them (even if we’ve taken a group photo together they use the ones without me in them). They have group chats that I’m not in, and sometimes when I’m hanging out with them I do feel a bit unwanted. I get talked over a lot, and sometimes they just straight up don’t listen to what I’m saying. Don’t get my wrong, they’re all really great people but I just feel like I don’t belong.

I know I’m not as pretty, funny or outgoing as they all are but I really love them all. I just don’t ever really feel that love back. I’m 22 and I feel like a bit of a loser worrying about whether my friends like me, but I can’t help feeling lonely even when I’m with them."

So I talked with her. Turns out she watches anime as well. I asked for her number, she gave it to me, we talked on Saturday, and we were supposed to meet on Sunday ""unless something comes up"", she says. After we talked, however, I noticed that they say it will rain on Sunday. So I text her that, and ask her what other day would she be able to meet, since it'll most likely rain. She doesn't reply.

Then Sunday comes and it turns out it doesn't rain, so I text her if we can meet. She replies after like 3 hours that she has something to do for college. That is already strange because you don't just receive homework or projects or whatever on freaking Sunday. She had to have known about it since at least Friday, meaning she'd have known about that when we talked on Saturday. Her saying we'll meet ""unless something comes up"" I feel like was her way of saying ""Give me some time to come up with something that'll prevent it"". Because, ok, sure, we could give her the benefit of the doubt and say she had that homework already received, but forgot to do it and remember on Sunday. Sure. BUT, I text her back asking ""Ok, that's fine. What other day can you meet on, then?"". This was on Sunday. It's Wednesday now and she hasn't replied or called or anything.

I've been through too many rejections and no-rejections-because-i-didn't-ask-because-it-was-obvious-they-didn't-like-me, just like this girl who is in the latter category. I'm done with trying. I've tried plenty.

I recently had to read a book for school that had a character say ""It's not the mouse's fault for not being a lion"", one which I feel like works really well with this sub's group. We're mice, others are lions. And this isn't a video game, a mouse can't just evolve at a certain level and be a lion because game logic dictates that. We're stuck the way we are for whatever reason."

lonely,I wish I could have a real conversation with someone.,"I wish I could have a real conversation with someone. - I've never had a friend I can REALLY talk to. I've known my closest friends for 5 years already; all of them are great and I genuinely enjoy their company, but there's always this unspoken barrier that's never really been crossed when our conversations get more personal. It just feels like whenever I do try and connect with them on a deeper level or talk about something more meaningful it just gets awkward and then we just go back to joking around or complaining about how bad this is one lecturer is. I realise how this might sound like I'm not appreciating my friends enough; I'm so incredibly grateful for them and so thankful that we've all stuck together for so long, but sometimes I just wish we could have a REAL conversation. 

It makes me feel so alone to think about how out of all the friends I have, not a single one truly knows me. I just wish I could find someone who really gets me - maybe then I would feel less lonely.

I don't know, maybe this is just my sleep deprived brain talking, just wanted to know if anyone else felt this way at all I guess"

But everytime it seems to be going to  well it takes a left turn, example being left on read, sudden change of acting distant, not hearing from them again. I completely understand that people have lives and stuff going on,  but when they act like they are into me that's when it hurts the most. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a good chunk of my past with love has been exaclty that.  They seem into me but after a while I've realized that's the case,  these people I've talked to b4 I genuinely thought they were but after trial and error that's not the case.  And tbh it makes me think there's something wrong with me. Like getting ghosted after thinking we had a genuine  connection, really hurts and makes just feel worthless, for example earlier this year in college I met this girl,  i thought it was genuine, I say this due 2 the obvious signs that were being thrown at me. Like when they initiate The 1st move, this one was different I really liked this girl and I thought she was into me as well,  but I tried to reach out to her via text and calling her but after the 3rd time of trying to text her and no response I left it alone.

lonely,"Fuck it, time for success again","Fuck it, time for success again - Success looks like this for me:

Plan a routine and stick to it.

Timers for focused worktime, starting from 15min only till the first pause and maybe ramping up to 2 hours.

Sleep deficit will come eventually because hard sleep pattern shift to early wakeup with exercise again. Or because of nights where you just can’t stop thinking. You have to stick to the wakeup call and drag yourself through the following day despite of it.

Learning more recipes with cooking and make sure to have a full fridge with healthy food.

Keep your environment clean.

Focus on yourself and delete all the abusive fake contacts for whom you only matter when they need help.

Don’t try to be yourself in situations where you would fall for love or have empathy for (in the end) another disappointing, discouraging or insulting person, just focus on your self-dedicated plan. You can have them around but don’t fall for it. Stick to your routine. Nothing is more important than the appointments with yourself in this plan.

There are enough rare stereotypes who you never encounter on the streets but are just like you. The majority is just the shit stereotype without having a sense for important values beyond career, faking and cheating to look good and thinking before judging, ... .

I fantasize about driving out into the middle of nowhere and blowing my brains out on a daily basis. Hopefully nobody would find me, and I could be forgotten and drift off into non-existance.

I've gotten over alcoholism, only to fall back in because I sit around doing nothing in Los Angeles do to Coronavirus. I live with my widowed father like a fucking loser. Afraid to work full time and go to school simultaneously. Not that I'm doing either because I'm a weak failure.

You know a chad? I'm the exact opposite of that. I've had ED my whole life and premature ejaculatory problems. Combine that with no money because a lack of motivation to live and you lose all self- confidence. The worst part is I have to fake being happy all the time.

You know what I hope for? I want it all to stop.

That's all. I just want everything to fucking stop. I can't take...any of it anymore. At least not much longer.

I have a few close friends and that is really enough for me. I never felt loneliness in the sense of not getting energy from a group of friends. My loneliness is just a hollow feeling of needing love and validation. The type of love I am talking about is one I only experienced receiving from my mom and dad (who live thousands of miles away). that sense of warmth and love and caring about each other. The sense of vulnerability.  The sense of security. The wholesomeness of knowing you have someone who will get happy at your accomplishments. someone who cheers you up.  besides all of them, the excitements of romantic gestures, intimacy and sex are what really energizes me.  I am 29 years old and didn't experience romance except for a short relationship with a girl who gave me all of that. Our relationship didn't work because of reasons outside our control but now it hurts more cause I know what I am missing on."

But even still, I’ll likely end up alone. This is my quick story. - Grew up poor. My drive for success grew. At age 17, I landed a spot in a competitive sports team and got to travel. When I turned 18, I met a smoking hot girl. We dated. We broke up. 

The next 10 years would be nothing but suffering with the occasional big successes in between. Last year I landed a job making $100k a year. I recently graduated from Marine Corps boot camp at age 29. Lost 50lbs. Got more lean and mentally tougher. I’ve gained an immense amount of knowledge in many areas of life.

Yet even after achieving the seemingly impossible, I’m sitting here in the squadbay more lonely than ever because I can’t find the right partner for me. Either my standards were too high and I wasn’t interested, or the girl wasn’t interested in me. It’s this never ending cascade of being alone.

I don’t know what to do. Suicide is not an option. My family needs me. And I still have to accomplish my purpose in life which is to transform and revolutionize the dating industry. 

But it’s likely that I’ll end up dying alone. All I wanted was a family of my own to lead and love, but I’ve accepted that it just won’t happen for me. I don’t need pity. I don’t need advice. I just want to know that someone is reading this and understands my pain.

Since then ive had a plan to be more social and going to concerts and manning up to go to a bar all by myself and trying my best to be as social as possible. But then came covid, and with that i went back to the dating apps (which i really dont recommend!) and to the life before manning up and yeah the gym closed to all my mass turned into fat and till today im still kinda chubby and losing muscle mass due to that, and the NYC mayor has only opened the gyms with pathetic rules only for a month. I have tried again and again to meet new people and also going on dates but i havent gotten anything besides a hookup here and there (which i awfully hated it) and ghosting's, so yeah im still charming and my heart is open to give out love and i hate it when girls see me as just a sex object or a free mealer or just someone that could give attention over the phone screen (which i hate the texting relationship stuff), and dont get me started with the whole only fans stuff that most beautiful girls try to promote their accounts and also IG and all that social media bullshit just to try and get that sweet simp money and attention because many girls just dont give a fucking shit about people these days!. So overall not the best time in my life and i believe not to everyone. I live by myself in the city of dreams (NYC) with broken dreams and tears in my dreams that i have no friends or anyone to date or even talk to besides my 2 cats that are my only thing in this world. Im at my mid 20's and within time i fell like the day where i have to tell my mom that she might not see grandkids from me would come because IDK how long i could try to keep searching where there are many women out there that dont wanna give me a chance or even people in general that i have a hard time opening a convo, at least at the gym i was very very very social and met a ton of wonderful people. But sadly its gone and im all alone here.

I started to write this down after i was trying to jack off after 2 weeks of not thinking about it and i just couldn't even get in the mood even if i wanted to, i just couldn't feel it (sorry for being so open about it). I want to feel loved and appreciated and go out and have fun and get to know more people that i could connect with but sadly everything in this city is shutting down and you see hate just everywhere, and even if i try to meet people and just meet a friend that could get me started up again so i could have someone to talk to, i just cannot get a long lasting convo no matter what or even just a switch numbers and lets go out for a drink or something. And also people on social media have became extremely toxic.

Overall i know people here like to vent, cuz i know many people here just dont have much anyone to talk to in this world and i wanna let out some steam somewhere, or even lay there shoulders on. Im still young and full of life and most of my time im just playing videogames or watching youtube and netflix or sleeping and feeling with everyday that passes im slowly decaying and dying inside."
lonely,No one will love me.,"No one will love me. - I just ordered an exit kit that should be here by end of the week. I have nearly finished my novel and I Eleave it along with a note.
I want people to know the horrors I've been through. The Co stant abandonment and lies.

These things like up and like up and just angers you.

All I wanted was for a man to care for me like I would for him.support their dreams and always make them feel better than they think they are because let's face it, we're all our own worst enemies. I can't help I'm a people pleaser but instead, I'm someone easily manipulated and used tossed aside like nothing and no one cares.

I have this thing were any man is nice to me I fawn over him greatly be it online or in real life. I know I may be overbearing and effecrionate but please just call me out and tell me slow down.

The worst is when I've met someone and told them how afraid I am to trust someone to get that close to me. They once again reassure me that it's their decision and they really life me
 or course...they ghost.

I have nothing in this world worth living for. My kit comes in soon and my plans is to fly to VA and tell my nieces one last goodbye.

With men, it's acceptable to be lonely. With women? I'm defective because why wouldn't so.eone want me? No one does an I cry as I write this."

I didn’t have friends when I previously lived on my but worked in an office and was able to socialize with coworkers. Due to the pandemic I’m now working from home. The prospect of living alone and working from home is started to freak me out. 

I’m considering doing DoorDash just to get out of the house to see people. This pandemic is going to last for months longer if not another year. I’m seriously concerned that I’m going to go legitimately bonkers after a couple weeks. 

I know that others have been dealing with this since March, but I’ve been on easy mode since then. I was living with my parents and have had them to keep me company during the pandemic. I also had a girlfriend during the first few months of the pandemic (first time being in a relationship in years). What’s everyone been doing to stay sane?"

It’s been like that for a while.

She didn't see pain and heart break in her future. All she saw was fake love. 

He never gave her the love she needed and wanted. He was only looking for one thing. That's when the devil 😈 showed his horns. He stabbed her heart. 

He wanted to steal her heart, so he could take over her mind and soul. He knew that he will betray her. 

She knows he will never be sorry or understand what he did to her.

Now I do have friends, family, no girlfriend unfortunately but I do have people in my life that care about me and all that stuff, it’s only that right now, my mind is kinda racing all over the place and the one thing that’s really hitting me hard is that, I have this female friend that I’ve known for a log time now, she’s my best friend (and yes I’m a straight guy), and she has a boyfriend rn and they had a fight and she vented about it to me earlier and it just now hit me: “Damn, she’s genuinely unhappy” 
Which makes me sad, and makes me feel like I can’t do crap about it, and it got me thinking that I basically don’t have anyone to cheer me up right now (and in most situations like this)

lonely,I wish I could trade away my academic accomplishments just to have felt loved at any point in my life.,"I wish I could trade away my academic accomplishments just to have felt loved at any point in my life. - Nothing I've done academically has made me happy. I'm so alone and depressed that I can't even do basic things anymore, like laundry or brushing my teeth. I have been depressed since I was 10-11 years old and close to everyone has avoided socially interacting with me. People either see me as an arrogant prick who thinks he's smarter than everyone else or they see me as a loser who only does school because they can't do anything else in life like getting laid (which is true, I'm still a virgin at 21 years old).

I wish I could go back in time and fix my priorities. I would've focused on school much less and would've gone to my local state school instead of an elite college. I would've made an effort to hang out with more social people to get actual life experience involving partying, sex, and drugs. Unfortunately, all that time has gone to waste, and while everyone else enjoyed their youths not worrying about responsibilities, enjoying relationships, and feeling loved and connected to the world, I wasted mine at my house doing my homework and burying my face in a textbook while I sobbed uncontrollably about how unfair everything is. I'm the definition of a loser and failure, and no acceptance to medical school or high gpa at an elite college will ever change that.

I hate my life and I hate that I'm like this. I wish every day that I could just be someone else because then I'd actually be happy."

I understand that this is something most people would never share on the internet but I am going to. Normally when I feel rough, I write a message to my future spouse in my phones note pad. But today, I decided to put mine here.



Today is one of those days that feel like a dream. One of those days where I'm floating through life and not actually doing anything. I ate way too much food today and that's probably out of boredom and ""self care"". But I've also thought a lot about you today. I don't know who you are, and I know nothing about you. I don't even know your gender. I just know someday we are going to meet each other and it will be a blessing. I want to set up a blanket on a grassy hill and watch the stars while we tell stories of our pasts. I want to sit in comfortable silence with you and feel the love in the air.
Since I've started my new job I've felt especially lonely. After busting my butt working hard all day I wish I could come home and no longer sleep by myself. I want to wake up next to you and talk about our dreams. There's so many plans I have for us and realistically there's a chance I'll never find you. I hope I do though, and I hope it's soon. I've got so much love saved up for you, and I'll be saving it for you until I know we've met. Until then my fantasies of being cuddled up and you playing with my tattoos and my beard will simply have to wait."

I recently looked at my Amazon orders, all the way back to 2012 and I can actually remember the feelings I had in that period of my life by looking at whatever item I'm looking at. It's weird.

It is also a reminder of how shit my life has become. It has gone downhill a lot, snowballed. But I feel I had become accustomed to living a shit life year after year. Just coasting. I really don't have memories, every passing year seems like a blur. The orders put everything into perspective and it's quite shocking how I got to where I am.

Few examples, in like 2012 I bought books I never read, still in my book shelf. I feel like I've tried to read but ""couldn't find the time"" which is bs of course. 2015, I bought a glue gun to make a prototype of a product that I wanted to start a business on, I haven't started a business... In 2018, I bought a present for someone I love, who I have a bad relationship with and I'm wasn't sure why (you know them ones where you feel a certain way about someone but can't figure out why)... I remember having an argument with the person around that time and I was in a bad mood for a few days. I bought a business book in 2014 and I haven't started a business...

You see the pattern. I guess I never really could pinpoint why I became the person I am but there are a lot of indicators there. I also found some emails about something I was doing but quit / never tried. I always intended to do stuff but never followed through.

I guess, (I say I guess a lot ) it's never too late to learn where I went wrong but I wish it was sooner because I wasted a lot of time. Ive printed those out and stuck on my wall to act as a reminder to never make the same mistakes again."

lonely,I am close to giving up,"I am close to giving up - Going to college on the first day of my last semester after the pandemic subsides in my country. Honestly, I feel scared and out of place when I entered the school. Everyone's literally gathering in groups, waiting for other friends to arrive in front of the school gate. 

Meanwhile, I ducked my head in the crowd and went straight to my new class. Seeing people chattering happily and making plans before class starts ache my heart. Seeing people in their cliques made me feel alone and isolated.

I see my classmates being pals with other classes. They met each other during internship and become closer. Meanwhile, I sat in my seat, staring at my phone to hide my discomfort. 

Anxiety creeped up on me that I wanted to throw up. During class, peers walked around, helping one another and asking questions. I had to ask the teacher as he was my only sole helper in my new class. I knew nobody execpt one of my intern mates. She have a friend in this class. I didn't want to intrude as she and her friend animatedly talked. Plus I don't know her social circle well.

When the teacher announced there will be a group project, my heart stopped.

I hate the term project. The teacher was so kind to give the class freedom to choose while i had a mental breakdown. 

Being lonely in this class affected my self esteem. I was ready to give up the course but since I am close to graduating, I have to tolerate for the certificate.

Now you may say, go to a person and asked whether I can join his or her group. After losing my clique last year, I have lost the confidence and trust. I didn't want to get hurt again by the same experience. 

I wish school was online learning this year. I hate coming to class, feeling like a lowly person. It's affecting my mentality that I was on the verge of tearing my hair out. 

I despise this raging loneliness. I fear I couldn't hold myself together one day."

Yet, when the previously dissipated anxious bouts and depression start flooding back, it all begins to fall apart again after a prolonged period of busy days filled with work and coursework. Thinking the best of current relationships turns to fading away and thinking ""Yeah, they probably don't want to talk to me right now. They have other friends to keep them company.""

It's always the same. Everything seems fine for a while, we connect, find that we share a lot of interests, can't stop thinking about them, then it breaks apart. I make promises that I can't keep due to a terrible schedule, become too ashamed to show up afterwards, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of going back to being alone.

It's as if everyone I met has no comprehension of being utterly alone, with nobody to turn to. They always have people in their circles. I simply don't get how they do it. People have these tight-knit comraderies and yet I can't even last long enough to establish a friendship without silently falling apart into an emotional mess. There are even times when I'm so null of emotion that I appreciate spite just as much as mutual reciprocation, as odd as it may sound. I'd rather be hated or disliked than be alone since it at least feels like an honest emotion.

What the hell do I do? Take another year-long reprieve from trying to make friends and try again when I'm seemingly ready? Attempt to rekindle the relationships that I've strayed away from?

At 23, it's as if I already tossed aside the years that I should have spent resolving this. I'm no good at being an online friend without being anxious and there's no point in-person until I graduate for the sake of self-sufficiency. There's no in-between options with the damn pandemic."

lonely,Why is making friends so hard?,"Why is making friends so hard? - I’m 31 and I can honestly say I don’t really have a best friend. There are people I guess I call friends but, there’s always a catch. My guy friend who said he’d always be there for me? He makes weird comments, hits on me, jokingly asks me to make out- when he knows I’m not interested in him like that. So what do I do? I distance myself. 

My female friend whom I thought would become a best friend because we both were dealing with our breakups at the same exact time proved to be self absorbed and truly only cared about her life. I bent over backwards to see her, to give her advice, offered her money so she could buy a house.... but when it’s my turn to share? Everything is reverted back to her. So what do I do? I distance myself. 

I’d rather be alone than in the wrong company. It’s why I ended my two year relationship. He was abusing me. 

How is it at the ripe age of 31 I can’t find anyone with good intentions to truly connect with? Does everyone have ulterior motives? I just want a real friend. Seems like a joke at this point."

But I could not explain, the way I meant what I said. As a non English native speaker, I can say now, some words in the wrong context can be devastating. I do not now if there is ever a chance she contacts me again. I would like to at least part as friends.

I do not have many friends. I would like to, but I am to shy most of the time. As it was wonderful having had someone for even a short amount if time, so it is hurting having no one around you who cares for you. I am sometimes stupid. But I never aim to hurt someone.

lonely,Friendzoned... Again,"Friendzoned... Again - I honestly really thought I had a chance this time. Everything seemed to be going great but apparently it was all one sided. She genuinely seemed interested and didn't give any hints that she wasn't. I'm usually a pessimist, especially when it comes to relationships but I was actually optimistic this one time. We've been talking for a few months now and although that might not seem much, to a teen (17) like me it's a pretty long time, especially given quarantine. Everything was well until I actually told her how I felt and no surprise I've once again been left in the friendzone. It just sucks cause I was really considering a future with her. Turns out she recently started seeing someone who she met a few weeks ago...to hear her say that really hurt. Apparently all this time she's only ever seen me as a friend and never really considered otherwise. I do still want to be friends with her because she's honestly such an amazing person but it still really sucks.

lonely,"I hope venting isn't against the rules, really need to dump my thoughts somewhere","I hope venting isn't against the rules, really need to dump my thoughts somewhere - I am so starved for emotional warmth that I usually behave like a dog, traumatized if kicked, and completely all over people if I am treated nicely aka like a basic human being. A girl has to sign in on a computer in my room, my first thought is ""She's the one."" A coworker tells the group that she broke up with someone, my whole view of her flips from ""cool person to talk to"" to ""SHES THE ONE DUDEEEE"".

On the flipside, I manage to be quite the entertaining individual. i have learned to make people laugh with situational comedy or abstract scenarios, stuff that people wouldn't usually come up with. However, it feels like at work people enjoy me as a distraction, but as soon as work ends, no matter how loud they laughed, if I made them tear up or whatnot, I am dropped like a toy until the next day of work starts.

i offer to pick people up for work too, hoping one day when I drop them off they might say ""wanna come in for a coffee?"" but it just won't happen. We laugh a lot on the drive, its really just a great time, but then they get out of the car. The door opens, they get out and the familiar cold takes their place, fastens the seatbelt and takes me for a ride. 

I don't judge them. Instead I judge myself. I feel like there is something about me that draws people away, even if they wholeheartedly laugh, not out of politeness, but simply because we're having a good time. it feels like something about me warns them to stay away regardless of how much they are enjoying my company.

I look at myself in the mirror. i never liked the way my eyes looked. it's not the color or the shape, it's the way they seemingly hunger for things to stare down.

I started school as the outsider. Being friendless isn't all that fun though, so I looked up to the funny guys in class and adapted their way of joking around. It was a lot of trial and error, honestly. I went to school with these people for 12 years and its safe to say that I surpassed them as the class clown. I was busy perfecting my role as the entertaining factor of the lesson while they grew up into functioning social adults.

All that social environments have taught me are anxiety, pressure, hostility in the form of bullying, words that surprisingly pierce your oh-so-hard shell and hit right home, leave you breathless and paralyzed, so after school I would usually go home and play video games alone or with other people (where I would once again get a chance to be the weird funny guy).

Now that I am 21, I feel like an unfinished building. I feel like the front of my house looks nice, cozy, inviting, while the back is open, no windows, naked wood, with the wind dancing through the gaps in the brick walls, singing a song to underline the many missing parts in my being.

It doesn't help that at this point my self-image looks so fucked up that I don't feel like I belong to anyone. When I see girl out with her friends or have a chat with someone, I imagine me between all of them and think: They don't deserve this burden. They think I'm a nice person but all I actually am is a rusting car, ready to fall into pieces right after the money crossed the counter and the thing is sold to some unsuspecting soul.

The worst is probably the fact that the usual choice is to hide all of this, my sad side. Even when I am jolly me and make people laugh, I can't mobilize people to reach out to me for more than necessary, so it would be a complete disaster if I was actually honest about how weak I actually feel, about how confused I am about life and who I am.

i sometimes feel like I am not the man I see in the mirror. in these moments, I feel like the boy I abandoned at the start of school, the boy that is waiting for his older shell to bring him some friends to play and laugh with.

Oh well this became quite the tantrum.

I don't exactly know the rules in terms of forbidden topics, so I'll just ensure y'all that I'm gonna be fine, not exactly happy, but fine. I've had my fair share of grim thoughts but I've made peace with them and they usually mind their own business unless I specifically look for them. 

anyways if you actually read all of this I hope that you are having a nice day and that you are staying safe, much love from a random goofy guy."

They make fun of me. They call me ""quiet"" or say that i'm ""always quiet"" which is impossible btw.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is. The term ""quiet"" doesn't actually equate to you being a quiet person. It is an insult and an attack on your social status usually resulting from people starting bad rumors about you or in the process of starting one.

&amp;#x200B;

They find out you have no friends. They see that no one wants to be around you and it's like a pack of wolves hunting their prey. Everybody wants to be in on making fun of the person who has no friends or a significant other. Their goal is to bully the person to the point of them lashing out in violence either to themselves or others.

I just feel kinda lost, lonely and sad. Idk how it really started, but for about 3 years now I’ve been falling deeper and deeper into this lonely hole that I can’t really seem to get out of. I have plenty of friends and stuff, but I feel as if I can’t really sit down and talk with any of them. Idk, I feel really isolated even though I’m surrounded by friends. But it’s just been getting worse, festering up for years. I’ve caught myself texting multiple exes that were toxic in our relationship and trying to grab anyone’s attention that’ll listen. But it’s all the same really, they’ll talk to me for a half hour and then drop the subject. Idk what to do but I feel like this is really degrading my mental health. Idk what the problem is or how to fix it. I feel like this is my lowest point yet. It’s getting to the point where I’m starting to lose sleep over it. God I feel stupid just writing this. I shouldn’t be laying my problems on other people. But if you read through it, thank you for at least reading it"
lonely,Who would ever want me anyway?,"Who would ever want me anyway? - (sorry this is so long) 

I don't know what's wrong with me right now, I've been doing well recently, been working on my self, trying to stay positive, (apart from one day about a week ago), but all of a sudden I don't know, something in my head just triggered my feelings of loneliness and worthlessness.
I know I'm only 19, and I've still got my whole life ahead of me, but I can't help but feel like I'm just unwanted, a lot of the time people who were my ""friends"" just leave me, I've never been close to a girl, I've never even held hands or even been hugged by a girl before. I just don't get it, most people around me seemingly have partners, or at least experience in that area..... Then there's me, someone who just can't seem to figure out how, or why. 
I wouldn't say I'm bad looking or anything, but I wouldn't say I'm good looking either, I'm just..... ""Eh"", I guess. I haven't got the most confidence in the world, and I've been working on that, but why do I keep finding myselfback on this head space? 

I also feel like I just got this aura around me of ""this guy is just awkward and weird and annoying after 10 minutes"" 
I'm currently sat in my dorm room, kinda fighting back tears, just wondering why I'm lonely. What makes it worse is that my uni isn't letting us mix with other households, which I completely understand, and usually I'm fine with it all, I have been all me life after all, but I don't know, I've been like this for a long time, especially since I turned 18 and realised just how alone I am. 
And lately when I'm watching a film, an anime, TV show or whatever, I just think to myself ""I wish I had somebody to watch this with and cuddle up and have pizza or ice cream together"", I want someone I can talk to, someone who can rely on me and is comfortable talking to me when they feel down or just want to chat about whatever, and vise versa. 

I just want to be somebody to someone.

I don't want the world to see me, I don't want to be liked by everybody, I just want to be somebody to 1 person, that's it, that's all I want, I don't want the world, I just want that 1 person who can be my world. 
All my life I've been the ghost in the back of the class no one really acknowledges, that name on a register that's just there to be ticked off, I'm just..... A ghost, that's how I feel, I've always been a ghost (and not the cool kind from Ghost of Tsushima unfortunately), I'm that weird geeky guy who likes all things film, anime. TV, a gaming and music, but yet no one really cares about. I don't really get notifications from anyone, at least none aimed at me specifically. 

I also just feel like ""who would ever want a guy like me?"", I'm alright looking, not the best, especially since I lost a lot of my hair (which has really knocked my confidence), I'm not muscular, I'm just skinny (slightly underweight, due to anxiety), geeky, not really all that interesting, autistic (not severe, I have high functioning autism), and incapable of really talking about anything outside of my interests, because I don't know how to, people say I'm smart, but I don't know if I really am, depends on the subject I guess, and weird, and not the most confident (I'm working on it), and I'm not the best at reading social ques, and I'm not the best socially either. But I want to be better, and I'm working on it, it's just hard when you get a day like this you know? 

Man, but I do hope one day I'll find that person who I can love and cherish and who will love me back, and somehow not get tired of me or get weirded out by me, maybe we'll both be absolute weirdos who knows? 

I don't really know why I'm posting this, or even wrote this, I guess I just want to get my feelings out on something in a bid to try and feel better. Sorry for venting to all of you. I guess I also needed to do something to stop these tears from coming out, although some people say it's best just to let them out, but I don't know anymore, I guess I just don't like crying"

To be able to find someone whom you're genuinely interested in learning about who they are, knowing when they feel lonely, sad, happy, ..even horny. To know the intimate details about their lives, and find that genuinely interesting, intriguing, like a mystery unfolding.. how nice is that.

Recently I have this odd fantasy to be a silent observer of a stranger's life. Like that angel played by Nicolas Cage, watching the girl he likes, knowing what she feels, and thinks in City of Angels. Not in a creepy way ofc, but it's like, reading a story, or watching a movie, but in this case it's all real, intimate, and filled with raw and genuine emotions.

lonely,I always feared to be alone,"I always feared to be alone - In 99' when I was a kid, I had problems making friends. It was lonely at school, them at home while my mom was working. The only place I could really be free, had importance and be strong to do things, was in videogames.
My step dad always showed at my room at night for years, just to say how much of a failure I would be, standing there alone playing that crap.
2006 I moved to another place to live with my dad, I was happy cause I could be with him, until his new family yews at his back saying things like ""Im suppose to go back where I belong"", so even moving to another parent I was alone yet again.
At school I met that girl that made me want to create my own family. I started running after what I believed, challenged my limits and even faced my father's new family that rejects me every day. We dated for seven years, just so she cheated on me with two different guys in college.
Since them, I was labelled a bad person, cause no one believed a cute girl could do something that bad, ""the problem must have been him"" they say.
I tried my best to make them happy, the people whos important to me... best friends, family, even not blood related, only to be discarted when its convenient.
Today I still have friends because they pity me. I work at night and dont like to go out much because... you know how it is to go on a place full of people, like a mall or something, you sit there looking around, and notice how lonely and worthless you are? Why do this to myself? ""Just go back to your house and play video games, at least there you're doing something good, even if its for NPCs.""
All the few relationships I had taught me that I'm a bad person, cause thats what they say when breaking up with me. ""You dont like going on clubs? You're the worst boyfriend!"", ""What? You cant aford a expensive dinner every night? Dont ruin my rotine!"", ""You're not going? Guess whos gonna date a cute guy there!"".
People always preach about ""you gotta love yourself"" on facebook and other social medias, how can I do this if whenever I see myself in the mirror I see someone who needs to disappear? Someone who nobody would lift a finger to help?
I always feared to be alone, and today mark 3 years that I'm alone, and every place I turn theres people talking bad things about me. 3 years of waking up, go to work, and go to sleep, all day with my mouth shut. Happy birthday you piece o shit, happy birthday."

lonely,dk if this belongs here but any advice? idk :/,"dk if this belongs here but any advice? idk :/ - So I’m a girl in grade 11 and I’ve never had my first kiss or been in a relationship. I know I’m still young and have my life ahead of me or whatever but the loneliness still feels so real. It’s really weird because during quarantine I kind of got to know myself better; I worked on myself, improved my mental health, started dressing the way I wanted to and became much less socially anxious than I was before. I even talked to new people and made new friends somehow. I did basically everything people tell u to do when it comes to finding a relationship, all of the “be yourself” and “put yourself out there” bullshit, but still nothing. I recently hung out with a guy one on one which I normally would have been terrified of, but I wasn’t, I was myself, I talked and kept conversation flowing as best I could. There was even a moment I thought he’d want to kiss me? But no, I asked him later if we were more than friends and of course, he told me it wasn’t like that. Idk. It just feels odd. Because I feel like I’m doing everything right and there are just no results. All of my friends have so much experience with guys. I remember taking that stupid rice purity test online with my friends and my score was so embarrassingly high compared to the rest of them I literally started tearing up. My friends compliment me and tell me I’m cOoL but I swear it’s just girls being nice to girls :/ If I was actually the interesting person they say I am wouldn’t I have found someone by now? And I’m not even trying to sound full of myself but I know my worth man :/ I know I’m not ugly and either way I’m a lot more confident in myself than I was before, but still I guess I’m just broken. I feel like guys never see me as an option. I don’t know what it is about me. I feel like I’ll always be the girl in the background in a guy’s eyes. Maybe it’s the way I present myself? I dress alternative but that kind of style has been trendy with teens my age lately? So honestly it’s just me and there’s something wrong with me haha"

Reflecting upon my life so far, I have come to a bitter realisation that if I vanished tomorrow, hardly anyone in this world would care. Nowadays, I feel I would be better off if I was no longer around than to live with crippling depression and loneliness. I have helped countless people over the last few years especially during university - advised them, encouraged them, helped them yet when I need help and support today, there seems to be no one around. At best, I have only got two people looking out for me at the present moment. 

I am a complicated person undoubtedly. I don't think the universe wants me around. It seems I have been set up for failure and disappointments in whatever I do and wherever I go. I am a sad waste of space who doesn't deserve anything good happen to him.

lonely,I hate dating apps,"I hate dating apps - I've been on them for two years and I have never made any good progress. I don't know why. I think it's because either my photos have shit quality or I have a shitty bio, but then I change my bio so much that it almost leads me to believe something is unappealing. I try pickup lines, wits, being straight forward, and nothing works. I like to believe that I use the wrong ideas or whatever for the wrong lady, but then again maybe I'm not that appealing physically or whatever. Maybe I'm too socially awkward or something. Worst part about it is that I really want a girlfriend and I know I will have less opportunities if I were to delete them. There has to be someone out there that cares for me or an app that have more open arms. I dunno. It's pathetic that I'm even making this post even if I'm still young."

lonely,Rejected a girl I’m in love with with,"Rejected a girl I’m in love with with - About a year ago, I had a girl that was a friend of mine in college. We had two drunk hookups in the beginning and then she told me she wanted more than that but I only saw her as a friend at the time so I never pursued anything. Fast forward over the coronavirus and I went back home and I left college and over the course of around 6 months I couldn’t stop thinking about her and I realized how much I actually cared about her and how big of a fuck up that was. Now I returned to college these past 3 months and I asked her to hangout because I wanted to take her out some place and she told me she now has a boyfriend. 

I’m 23 and I’ve never been in a relationship before and that fact has made me incredibly lonely and increasingly depressed. This mistake has taken a MASSIVE mental toll on me because I prevented the exact thing that I wanted. I can’t believe I did that I would do anything to go back to that it has gotten me extremely depressed over the past couple of months to the point that I’ve been losing sleep about the fact that it all could have been different now. Any advice?"

lonely,I think that I don't know what is like to have a friend. (Some thoughts),"I think that I don't know what is like to have a friend. (Some thoughts) - I used to think that, tho. Before university, some people were there to talk, sometimes to hear about me. But there was always some kind of wall, something that never let me bond with them. I was always the guy that walked behind, the one that no one ever invited to anywhere, that ""oh, I forgot you were here"" and I don't know why. Like, am I boring? Irritating? Why nobody tells me? 
I looked around and see that everybody had a friend, someone to text all the time, and when I tried that, the response was always a left seen. Why? An then they just forget about you. 

Then I got to the university. It's the same. People only searching for you to ask about homework, never beyond that. And if I try to socialize, that goddamn seen. 

I feel so lonely this days. The energy to go and try to talk again with anyone on the social media is gone. The outcome will be the same, I know it.

lonely,"I want of life of my own, but I feel trapped because of the guilt of and for my family","I want of life of my own, but I feel trapped because of the guilt of and for my family - I've always wanted to express these feelings, but I have nowhere to vent them. I'm a man in my late 20s, and I don't recall a time in my life where I've had any complete control of my life's direction despite the normal optics. Growing up I was very athletic, heavily involved in school &amp; the small town I grew up in, ""model student"", first to graduate college in my family, and now have a decent job and live on my own. However, much of that was never at my discretion and has created a heavily, internally conflicted life which reads like an old naturalism novel.

I feel much of it starts with the fact that I was born before my parents were married, and I was probably the only reason they married because of the strong Christian backgrounds of their parents (and then those beliefs were heavily pushed onto me). My childhood wasn't social as I mostly spent time with my largely extended family or babysitting my mentally disabled sister when my parents were working late. I feel this is heavily a reason why I've had much difficulty making friends with others because I'm stuck with the same people over and over.

Many of my activities and interests were those that my parents wanted me to pursue, and not what I wanted to do. I can't tell you how many times I expressed interest in trying something, and my parents spent forever talking down the idea. I remember many times when my dad wasn't happy when I wasn't doing something sport related, and belittled it. Even to this day my parents ridicule when I pick up a new long-term hobby or interest, and this also is a toxic trait of their relatives. Anything that someone seems to do to get ahead or better their life is degraded, and this has created a pathological sense of guilt or shame whenever I do something positive. I never felt any dopamine urge when I received awards or congratulations, just guilt.

The same thing can go for relationships. I've never dated despite many opportunities organically &amp; from others wanting to set me up, but it's due to many reasons. The same thing can be said for dating or thoughts of attraction as any positive push in life; I just feel guilt and shame when I'm attracted to someone. Of course, these negative thoughts then roll into a decade plus of self hate and low self esteem. I'm also deeply embarrassed of introducing anyone to my family as I'm highly aware of how they could push anyone away with their demeanor.

I also feel entrapped because I worry about my sister's future. To be honest, I probably would have greatly separated myself from my family long ago if my sister did not have disabilities, but I'm the next in line to care for my sister when my parents are gone (and, yes, it's legally tendered). I only travel home because my sister frequently misses me, and I don't know how she could process a world without me (which is the same feeling that has prevented me from taking my life many times previously). This also has made life extremely conflicting for me because I don't know if I can ever truly be able to seek a relationship or life of my own as I will eventually one day need to drop everything to find a way to care for her. I feel it would be greatly disrespectful if I ever did find a wife and have kids that I would have to deprioritize them for a time after committing to them.

Carrying this guilt has been immensely overwhelming, and this year hasn't made it any better. I was for once optimistic to actually try to separate myself a bit from my family and take control of my life. I took a job in a city I adored (after leaving a job for a highly reputable company in a less than desirable city), and hoped to try to finally build a social network and begin dating. That was less than a month before the pandemic started, and now the only people I have to contact are my family and relatives. I've coped being alone for a long time now, but this year was just a punch in the gut as I briefly saw light at the end of the tunnel before it collapsed in on itself. I've struggled with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts before, but this year has amplified everything as I'm stuck in the same rut for another year plus. It just feels like my ideal life is dangled on a string in front of me, and pulled away as soon as I almost attain.

Anyway, if you took the time read all of this, thank you. If you ever have a kid of your own, please allow them to explore their true selves to a healthy degree. Be a supportive, emotionally understanding parent and help them understand their thoughts and feelings without instilling negative ones. The gift of guilt is not a gift, but a curse."

I'm literally doing everything right yet all of my snapchats are left on read. - I don't have any real friends. I don't know why, I always thought it was because I was unpopular in school, but now I've been in college in another town for years and I still have nobody. I genuinely don't know why. I don't think I'm mean or rude at all, I don't think I'm weird, hygeine is good, I'm not unattractive, I can't think of any reason why I am alone. I am in a club and have checked out a few others, I work on campus, I always go to class (well not right now because of covid), and when I'm not alone I am a very happy guy. I like people. Everything they say you should do to make friends I do it, and yet here I am with nobody. 

All of my snapchats are on read right now, like am I annoying? Why can't they respond? Its not like I send people constant messages, but maybe once a day I send a snap to someone who is ""close"" and usually it gets one responce or maybe none and gets left on read. 

I don't get it. What is wrong with me? Obviously something is, otherwise I would have at least one friend. I don't want much, just someone to text sometimes, maybe play some games with, hang out a little. Whatever is wrong with me there is no way for me to find out and fix it."

but now, i just remind myself that if he really wanted to be with me, they would be. obviously they know i’m single.

lonely,I'm a broken lonely mess of a person,"I'm a broken lonely mess of a person - I'm lonely. I'm broken. In my 20's and starved for companionship. I just want to hug a cute woman, to cuddle, to feel her warm against me. I want someone who wants to know me, and who wants me to know them. No one ever seems to want that. I'm smart, attractive, sociable. Yet I never really get further than acquaintance with anyone.

When I get lonely like this I tend to watch porn, I'm a virgin and I don't know if I'll ever have sex. Its not actually about the sex, I'm sure it feels good but I want someone to want me that way. I want to be loved, I want sex represents to me (a relationship). I can't get that, and so I start to tear up and feel like I'm going to implode on myself. In the past Ive ocassionally talked with women online and messed around, and that at least lets me feel something. I just want to hear a woman talk to me, and tell me I'm normal, I'm not horrible or unlovable, i want her to be with me on the phone while I watch porn, as weird as that is.

I'm not sure why I want that, I think I just don't want to feel alone, I don't want to feel like I'm broken for wanting to do what I'm watching other people do. More than anything I just want to be accepted despite how broken I feel."

I could try and make myself feel better but... I don't even want to. 

Never thought I'd reach the point where I'd feel this way. I don't know, at least I feel alive somehow when I'm feeling sad instead of just existing I suppose. Don't even know why I'm typing this. Just wanted to throw this out into the world I guess"

I don’t have anything to offer, not much to say, I’m not all that special and I can see why they crack jokes saying I’m not apart of the family. It’s true, I’m very disconnected from them. When I try socializing I can’t really connect with others.

I speak, I interact, I ask questions but it’s not really working, they usually think I’m weird and awkward.. When they pick people to come to do things I’m usually last choice. Probably my fault cause I’m so distant. They sometimes forget about me... a lot.. 

I’m weird I can admit, I’m also trans so that’s probably another reason. Trying to fight this lonely battle for 19 years of my life, going into 20. I can see why they wouldn’t really bring me up. Only thing I really can give them is my “talents” I edit, I photograph, I draw, I can do logos, music, but other than that I’m not much of anything.

lonely,Do u ever feel like you are a middle friend?,"Do u ever feel like you are a middle friend? - I always wonders why my friendships don’t last. 
I always wondered why do all my current and past friendships seem so one-sided. Am I trying too hard? Why won’t they text, call, or ask to hang out with me first? It’s always me putting in the most effort. 

The thing is, I am always told how nice and kind and funny I am and that they don’t know anyone who can dislike me. I’ve asked a couple “friends”, since no one is perfect, “what would someone say about me behind my back?” They said nothing... I didn’t believe it ofc. 
Because if I am so great why don’t I have a friend who wants to talk to me, who wants to hang out with me, who wants to tell me about random stuff.

I call this the middle friend. I am the middle friend. The friend who isn’t really memorable but you also have no reason to hate them. The friend who is nice and easy to get along with but you have no interest in being really good friends with. 

I’ve been stuck in this middle friend limbo all my life.

lonely,GG,"GG - You know things get crazy when I person who mostly respond with some rather nice comments is gonna be having trouble as well. This might be a rant but. Anyway straight to the point.

Just got a lecture from my parents about my future and I got to say its not the best. I am the odd one out of my whole entire family line. From what I see that is. My parents criticize me about my personality like why am I so quiet, why won't I speak up, etc. only my bad side. How I won't get a job and just plain dumb. They compare me to some of my relative and said that if they know English or if we were still in our hometown that they will do a better job, etc. Then my brother also keep saying somethings at me and its not very kind. It was a long lecture and it was mostly just yelling and such at my uselessness. My dad keeps speaking super loud and then my parents shouts at each other. This is probably the problem, they were gonna divorce each other when I was little probably around 9 or something. I feel like I am the cause of all this. Got to apply for a job and already they are saying I am trash, ngl I stink at talking. Going to find a job tomorrow with my dad, that's what my mom said, and hopefully is goes well, knowing my dad, he is gonna be piss if I don't speak and such. I have social anxiety and is being peer pressure. This is gonna make me even lonelier either way.

That's about it. Let's see how it goes. If it goes well, I will be back here chatting and replying to you guys. And, if it doesn't well, I will be too depress and will have no more motivation to continue, don't worry I won't end myself, just won't have enough motivation to continue. I might end up ghosting a lot of people, and a few friends on reddit. So I apologies in advance.

Good luck everyone and take care! :)"

I feel like, “why would I bring this up to anyone when I know the answers but just don’t want to accept them?” 

Anyway, any advice for pushing on and continuing to live? Btw, I have only rarely thought about suicide, and I think I’m too big of a coward to do it, but I don’t want to live anymore. 

Thanks"
lonely,I just need to vent. Don’t mind me.,"I just need to vent. Don’t mind me. - I’ve got a few people who would probably consider me close friends, but I can’t really say they know much about me. 


I’ve got a good job, but I don’t really relate to people I work with. They’re all old-money types who have never missed a meal, or struggled, or anything. I honestly doubt most of them have ever had to make a hard decision about anything. 


This wouldn’t be so bad, if I didn’t spend so much time at work. I feel so isolated and depressed and I just desperately want for someone in my life to want me for who I really am, and not because of some pre-conceived notion about me because of how I look or what I do."
lonely,Has anyone found going sober helped with their loneliness?,"Has anyone found going sober helped with their loneliness? - I’m new to this group. I’m a 43 year old single gay man in the Bay Area. I drink quite a bit, pretty much everyday. One glass of wine after work soon turns into a bottle a day. Alcohol zaps any motivation I have to do anything about my loneliness. I’m watching the world and my age go by behind a haze of alcohol. It’s been worse since the pandemic started. I’m afraid I won’t be able to cope and without self medication. I feel like I’m losing myself."

Every single time I’ve had friends, I’ve always been the emotional punching bag, even if they don’t mean it. I had a friend group that called me trash for a whole school year, and then quarantine started and my life has just been going downhill since.

I just want a friend group. That cares about each other. Like a family. I want a family.

This isn’t fair. This world isn’t fair. I hate being on this stupid earth. Why can’t I be loved? What did I do? I’ll do anything just to be a normal kid. Why do I have to suffer? 

What I’ve learned is that friendship, family, and love is just fiction. I don’t have any hope anymore."

Since  this whole covid thing I've been living a complete solitude life. And  I hate it. It's time I meet someone preferably local to talk to and do  things with. I'm not a perfect looking guy I have my flaws. So if you to  do even better. I'm a laid back guy who tries not to take life too  seriously. I'm a smart guy,well traveled (globally).

lonely,I constantly feel left out of my friend group and I’m not sure what to do about it,"I constantly feel left out of my friend group and I’m not sure what to do about it - I graduated from college two years and moved to a new city for a job right after that. My job had training for college hires so I made friends that way and eventually found a friend that I’m now a part of. They all have known each other for years before I came in and lately I’ve been feeling very left out of things. Like I’ll hear about something they did that I was never invited to. Lately it’s mainly that I see them all jump online to play video games and I’m rarely invited to join. I tend to join myself and then it’s fine from there but I feel like I’m a tourist not part of this friend group. Another example, one of them is getting married soon and we had an impromptu bachelor party. We went hunting and hung out. But two of them got the groom a nice gift. I was the only one out of the loop so when the groom asked if I was in on it I just made joke about it. Like I’m glad they got it for him but it would have been nice to be in the loop. 

As I write this and thinking about other friend groups I’ve had I remember that my college friend group kinda got nuked. At least for me. I had a really close friend group. I ended up marrying one of my friends sisters. We got divorced pretty quick after I graduated. So I haven’t contacted any of them in a while. 

My high school friends are all a state or two away. Also never really in contact with them. We had a group chat that lasted a while but after Covid started it kinda dwindled. 

It doesn’t help that I live alone and currently work from home. If it wasn’t for my girlfriend I wouldn’t see another person for days or weeks at a time. 

I’m just feeling lonely and wanted to vent somewhere."

Four years later, most of them either hate me, or have forgotten about me. The only people that like me are my parents. I have next to no future prospects other than suicide or loneliness and mediocrity.

lonely,Does anyone else try to cover it up?,"Does anyone else try to cover it up? - All my life I've tried to hide how isolated I am to others. I've become incredibly good at it actually. I don't have a single friend and only had my first friend at the age of 35 which lasted two years. I have literally no one i can talk to, no one who would say I am their friend.
To outsiders I must look popular. I do outdoor pursuits that suggests I am outgoing, confident and surrounded by fun people. My FB friends are always ready to say something nice on my posts so to new friends I must look normal. The truth is- I've never met any of them.
I got married once and in an attempt to not look so pathetic to my family and his friends I asked people I had only just met to be guests and maid of honor. My extended family didn't want to go and they wondered why they even had an invite. I cringe thinking about it.
Generally though, it has worked well. No one knows I'm broken and lonely. My aim was always to never let people see that I'm defective. If someone knows you have no friends and never have.... well... there's probably a good reason for that, and they walk away.
The thing is, I'm not sure why I'm hiding it anymore. No one cares about me anyway so its just me that I'm lying to now. I've been facing this more and more recently and I'm not coping well with the empty reality of my situation."

I came here because I wanted to run away from the virus and be able to meet people I know, little did I know that London will go into tougher restrictions too.

lonely,Feeling really alone,"Feeling really alone - Got out of a 3 year relationship about 2 months ago. It was a long and very sad 2 months but I eventually picked myself up, I had finally decided that I wanted to start talking to other people again so I did the unthinkable. I downloaded Tinder :o!!!(jkjk)

Once on Tinder I didn’t really connect with anyone in there except for one girl. We both connected really fast our first 3 nights of texting. Then boom! All of a sudden she ghosted me for the following three days. I tried to get in contact but nothing. Then all of a sudden she came back, texted me, apologized, said it was due to family issues, and apologized again. I forgave her and was just happy she was back. Then we texted for 2 more days and she disappeared again. It’s now been a week since she’s said anything to me.

I know it’s not a very long time to build a connection with someone but I don’t think that’s why my loneliness is here. I just feel very neglected and unwanted right now. I feel like the world is against me. My 21st birthday was a few days ago and all I could think about is how I feel unwanted. It sucks and I hate getting to this point in life because it’s happened before. But my life is getting to the point to where I just don’t care anymore, regardless of what may happen. My heart just won’t allow me to care about anything."

lonely,Trust issues.,"Trust issues. - I'm lonely, but I have issues with trusting people. Maybe I'm just overly critical of others, but I feel like that little twinge of an ""off"" feeling that I get from people sometimes is usually an indication that they are not trustworthy. Just recently I tried to befriend a girl at work, and I figured she was asking a lot of invasive questions because she was curious about me and wanted to learn more in order to develop a relationship with me. However, when I learned that she had told other people some of the things I shared with her I realized that she only wanted to learn these things in order to gossip about me. This is not the first time this has happened, but I guess I'm so desperate for friendship that I tell prying people personal details even when I do get that ""off"" feeling about them.  

Sometimes, I feel like these kinds of people get excited when they learn that I don't have my shit together lol. Maybe that's just my paranoia, but it's like the energy from them changes once they learn that I'm struggling a lot. I don't know. To be more specific, this strange phenomenon is from the other women that I try to befriend.  

I do want companionship, but not at the cost of trust. Sometimes I feel like people surround themselves with others just for the sake of having people around them...I'm not interested in performing, I want genuine trustworthy people that I can connect with. And when I do find people like this, it's like they're not interested in being friends with me beyond our little workplace bubble."
lonely,"The more lonely I feel, the more alone I want to be","The more lonely I feel, the more alone I want to be - Kind of ironic, but the lonelier I feel, the less people I want to have around. I don't really know how to shake this need to isolate myself more and more, I go to therapy (over a year and a half now) which doesn't seem to be doing that much anymore, obviously covid is not helping. I had my first acid trip last week, it gave me a wonderful afterglow that made me feel great for a few days and allowed me to have some perspective in a few issues that I've been ignoring (mainly my lack of self-love and some weed abuse), but now I'm back to my old and familiar mindset.  I do feel more calm and less depressed in general (or it's just hiding, idk), but the loneliness, that just never goes away.

When I was leaving school I had these big dreams of being so successful,married and have kids by now. I don’t really have anyone I can talk too I smile and make jokes with my “friends” but inside I don’t even want to be here anymore. I feel like I’m just wasting the air around me.

lonely,Lonely at University,"Lonely at University - I recently moved into uni halls at Manchester in the uk and have never felt so alone. I get in really well with flat mates and have other friends outside the flat but for some reason I still feel alone. 

And I think this is where it gets tragic. 

I’m 18 and a guy and have never had a relationship, all of the online chats and “advice for uni” stuff was saying that loads of people would be in a similar situation to me. That’s not true at all. Everyone I’ve met bar a select few have all been in relationships and all have an experience being close to someone like that. I don’t and it makes me feel so fucking lonely. 

So I was like fine I’ll go out and chat to people and maybe find someone I like. I did and it hasn’t gone well. I should probably mention at this point that for the past couple years I have been struggling with various mental health issues and it has essentially ruined a lot of my confidence and self esteem. This is obviously a problem as people don’t want to be in a relationship with people who hate themselves. 

So I’m now sat in my accommodation lonely as fuck and I feel so stupid cuz I’m focusing everything on a relationship and I think that that will be the thing that will make me less lonely. Idk I’m currently hanging out my arse cuz I was out last night so cheers if you read this and any and all help is appreciated."
lonely,Why's it seem so important to have a companion?,"Why's it seem so important to have a companion? - For all of us lonely folk out here, why do we put such emphasis on finding companionship. The obvious answer is because we feel alone, but people who aren't alone can't seem to see the flipped side of this coin. When I observe happily paired people, I can't help but wonder if they truly realize how fortunate they are. It sometimes seems like they just take it for granted that someone be forever at their side. The rest of us, however, feel like we're doomed to a life of solitude. I just wonder if the grass is really greener on the other side. It appears to be, but I have no real experience. Just trying to figure out, at this point in my life, if it's really worth seeking a close, intimate relationship or if I should just accept things the way they've always been. I don't know."

lonely,"I've Never Felt this Alone, and I Don't Live Alone","I've Never Felt this Alone, and I Don't Live Alone - After graduating college, I found a job in a city and moved. My sister also found a job, we moved into a small, two bedroom apartment. This was the end of January 2020. I have never felt this alone in my life.

All throughout college I had a wonderful group of friends, we'd stay up all night and talk. I'm an introvert, but I truly appreciate a tight group of friends who are there when support is needed. I lived with my college roommate for 3.5 years. She graduated a semester early, and I lived alone. Even though I spent a lot more time by myself, I did not feel alone. 

Now I'm not not by myself. I have a sister who stays in her room all day. She did just met a guy online, so she sees him a few times a week. It's either Tiktok or the boyfriend. It's not the best move right now. I would be much more at ease if she didn't just meet him and spaced the meetings out. I spaced my dates out when I gave online dating a try over the summer (not for me). We're very different people though.

Even so, I can't help but think that I would feel less alone if I lived alone. It's kind of depressing having your one roommate camped-out in her room all day. Before covid, she never wanted to go out. It's like she lives her life on her phone, or has this other college party sorority life. I just find it depressing. Part of me thinks if I knew that I was living alone, I wouldn't have that. 

I was supposed to meet my old college roommate last week, but she wasn't feeling well, so we took the precaution. I can hardly wait! I need to be able to have a good conversation with someone. Back in the day, we used to talk about our day. It was nice to listen to someone else's troubles and achievements. It was nice to have someone to listen to my troubles. I guess now, not having that makes me feel like I'm in my own world. Although, I have to say, I will never take a good friendship for granted."

As time goes on, I become more and more disinterested in whatever going around me and doing things on my own to entertain myself I also hardly react to when someone makes a joke because im hardly aware whats happening around me probably because I grew up like this and causing me to have such behavior, anyone feels like this all the time or can relate to this?"
lonely,Here's to another birthday alone,"Here's to another birthday alone - I think I have almost accepted it. It's pretty much been this way since 13. I don't have friends at all. Haven't had any in years. So I don't expect any messages, I didn't receive anyway. It's my **18th** just to point out. I can legally drink in my country so at least there is some positive to it. 

My childhood is officially over. I'm not a child anymore, I'm legally an adult (I know I've a long way to go before I'm an actual grown up). It's strange to say that. 

I just wonder how many more birthdays I will spend alone. Every year I care less and less about my birthday. I start to see it as any ordinary day rather than the anniversary of my birth. I start to question a lot of things such as when will death occur, why some people romanticize childhood or even the reason we exist in the first place. But more importantly how did I end up like this. 

Anyway bottom line is, here's to another birthday [alone.](https://www.google.ie/search?q=birthday+cat&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjErLWSgr7sAhVBVRUIHao4CZsQ_AUoAXoECBAQAw&amp;biw=1360&amp;bih=657#imgrc=HB8Bn03qfNEtuM&amp;imgdii=-LjO5ce6JunWDM)"

J feel so related to him.... and everytime i hear the music I can't hold in my tears....
Its okay if guys say that i am wierd and that its impossible to connect and relate so much to a videogame. But for me, its like i am watching myself in a TV.....

I’ve been on 1 date (which now that I think about it I don’t think it was it since it was a casual). I don’t really know where to go with this but I’ve been always working on myself and know what I prioritise in my life. At the moment it’s my mental health and family. I think this is the kind of loneliness where I love my time alone but lonely cause I have no one to share it with..? 

At times I feel left out when my group of friends talk about their relationships and wonder “when is it going to happen to me?”. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy my single life as I get to enjoy to do a lot of things in my own time but I just thought it would be nice to share it with someone who share the same interest and passion as me. Or maybe just interested in me as a person. I hear people say I’m fun and funny to be around with but yeah just wanted to vent out"

My problem is that he doesn’t even get attached to anyone and I don’t think he would care if I disappeared, despite acting like he would. 
I also have a little crush on him and he can be quite flirtatious despite not actually wanting anything romantic. 

I hate the idea that i’m the only one who can get attached but I don’t know what to do next. 
I feel like because I don’t have any other good friends and I’m quite lonely I’ve become overly reliant on him. 

I once told him I had gotten attached and took some time away from him but when we started talking again, I got sucked back in. 
What steps can I take?"
lonely,Constant rejection makes me feel like I should just give up on finding a partner.,"Constant rejection makes me feel like I should just give up on finding a partner. - I’m 20 and have been single for the entirety of my life. I’m not asexual, I’m not an incel, I don’t hate or resent women. But I have the last 6 years trying in vain to find a partner. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m not a creep, I like to think I’m a nice guy, and like I mean a legitimately nice person not a “nice guy”.  

I’m not the ugliest person to ever walk the world, but I wouldn’t say I’m attractive. That became very obvious when I started using tinder. That app showed me just how ugly I actually am. I feel like I’ve since adjusted my standards so that I go after women in my league. Even women that I’m not attracted to think I’m too ugly for them for even a single date.

I really feel like I have no option but to be alone. And everything that comes with that feels like a burden. Seeing all of my friends in relationships, constantly being asked by my friends and family why I haven’t been dating. My virginity. The crippling fear that I’m running out of time and that if I don’t find anyone soon I’ll be lonely forever. All of these things have been weighing on me. I just really feel like if I found one girl that was interested in me it’d be better. 

I just got my heart broken by a girl I was pining after for months. She was a very close friend, I though I did everything right, but she still rejected me. Now I just feel like I have no chance with anyone. I mean there must be a reason why I’m 20 years old and not able to find anyone that wants me. Maybe it’s just natural selection at this point and I’m not fit to have a partner. It makes me feel like I should just give up and invest my time elsewhere because obviously no one wants me."
lonely,Insanely difficult to make friends.,"Insanely difficult to make friends. - I'm 31 and with having social anxiety and not really leaving my house much it has been difficult making friends (I don't have any). But I've been thinking that from your mid 20's onwards (maybe even a bit less) it becomes even more difficult.  
As by this age most people have already settled down, had kids / relationships and so on. And they don't really want or need new 'friends' as such.

I usually get some social interaction from my choir group since people are pretty nice and talk to me, but after that class and before I never talk to anyone. It also especially sucks since I've delt with this before in 4th grade, 1st, and 2nd. It also just makes my clinginess way worse due to my past loneliness and my energy is practically drained throughout the day due to me being an extrovert and I've almost had mental breakdowns in school due to being lonely. 

Should i just ask my parents to pull me out of school and then bring me back once i progress to the next grade?"

It's like being torn apart piece by piece. It shatters you and makes you question your worth and everything you stand for. It leaves you feeling unbearable pain and grief. You have a yearning desire to be loved back by the person you love but it remains unfulfilled. You used to think that love was a beautiful feeling but then you realized that love is miserable. It hurts even worse when you never got to date the person because you never even got to experience them... it’s like wanting candy but then it being ripped from your sight forever to never get the chance again.

The constant rejection. 

Being told over and over that ""I care about you just not romantically"" 

"" I just don't see you in that way""

"" I see you as a sister""

"" I don't want to hurt you""

No matter which way it's said it all means the same thing.......

I'm not good enough. 

I'm not what they want. 

I'm not what anybody wants.

Unlovable. Unwanted. 

It hurts.

lonely,Why is it her and never me,"Why is it her and never me - Each time I have a crush on someone and consider asking them out, I end up discovering they are interested in my best friend. It's been like that for years.  It happened again this year and the guy keeps telling me about how much he loves my best friend and how she is so beautiful. I want to be happy for her but I can't help being sad and depressed when that happens. I know she is really pretty and I see why guys would like to date her but being her shadow makes me more and more insecure everyday.

Are you up for the challenge? :) - I've  made a form to find friends where 25 questions are asked (most are  multiple choice). And based on the answers you get matched up with other  users.

We ask two things for each  topic, (1) Your answer (2) Answers you want to be matched up with. So  we ask about whether you want to voice call 📞, share pictures 📷, your  continent 🗺️, your age, if you play games/books often, if you're  studying or working and so forth!

This  makes it super simple and quick to find people that both want to talk  to each other. You are instantly shown matched people (most people get  around 20-80 matches), and then you can send them a friend request, once  they accept then contacts details are shared with the both of you.

Good luck everyone! Any questions please ask away :)

I  try to work on the site as much as I can in my spare time, so you can  expect new features to get released as well. If you're a designer,  developer or think you can help with this - please get in contact it'd  be great to have some help and feedback.

But then I thought about it, would I rather spend my life depressed and pessimistic or live it happy and thankful for the opportunities that I have. Make a list even if it’s short of the things you have done. How many years have you lived? Did u graduate? Did you get that job? Think past the relationship what do you want in life. I want to be a lead or sous chef and maybe eventually own my own restaurant. I want to live my life to the best it can be. I don’t want to live wallowing in despair.

lonely,Relationship struggles,"Relationship struggles - This is my first time ever using reddit or posting anything on here but I decided to because it’s hard for me to keep my thoughts bottled up

I’m 17 years old and I have never been in a relationship with anybody romantically and it really eats at my manhood. I don’t know how to talk to girls that I like or initiate conversation with them and now that COVID happened and there is no school, I have to now initiate those conversations online on Instagram or Snapchat or something. But every time I get the courage to talk to somebody or someone talks to me I’m immediately shot down by my own insecurities and thoughts that I’m too ugly for them or something. I have friends that I talk to about these issues but the problem is that they all have a lot of experience with relationships because they are good looking people so their advice never really resonates with me. I at least try to maintain the idea that I am an outgoing person and a funny person when you get to know me but I still I have almost 0 confidence in my physical appearance. I think I have an okay style but I weigh 240 pounds at barely 6ft which I have actually lost almost 25 pounds just because I’ve gotten to the point where I just stopped eating because of my issues. But anyways I’m still fat and hate what I look like so I guess that’s the main reason I struggle with relationships. I can easily be someone’s friend but I think people find it hard to find me attractive in any way. At this point I just don’t know what to do I don’t get any attention from girls that I like or really just people in general and it’s really hard for me to get up in the morning knowing I am the way that I am. I really just don’t know what to do."

lonely,How harmful is it to never get hugs?,"How harmful is it to never get hugs? - I'm asking because

For the 15 years I've been alive on this planet for the only people who have hugged me or showed any affection were my parents when I was very young. I hardly ever got any friends and have never received any hugs outside my family. My classmates are all friendly with each other, hug each other and stuff, and I'm just in the back because I'm both introverted and with social anxiety and ADHD (And I have different interests than most people I know irl so it's even harder for me to get along with others) 

I sometimes talk to some of my classmates, but they still never even say hi to me when they arrive to school. They just go to their friends and don't even notice me. One time one girl said hi to me and I nearly teared up. Every time I see others hugging and being happy with each other I get angry and jealous but I try to hide it by doing stuff on my phone or eating.

I had over 6 suicide meltdowns or more over the past 2 years due to this matter. If I didn't have my internet friends and my favorite cartoon I would have probably been dead by now. Some of them have tried sending me virtual hugs to make me feel better, but I know those can't replace real affection.

I stumbled across articles a while ago saying that not getting affection is as harmful as cigarette smocking and it decreases your life span. It sounded ridiculous to me at first but thinking about my mental problems I'm starting to believe it but I want to hear what different people think instead of what an article says."

I wouldn’t have it any other way. - I don’t cry in front of anyone. I don’t think I could even if I wanted to. Pain and depression aren’t things I show on my face. Ever. Except when I’m alone. It’s weirdly comforting, really, just breaking into pieces alone. Like I’m not causing stress on anyone else. I’m not making anybody fearful or worried for my mental health. I like it that way. Thank god for being able to say “oh I’m just tired” all the time.

But then there’s this hellish cycle where I desperately want, more than anything, a shoulder to lean and cry on. The shoulder of someone who knows all the fucked up things about me. But I couldn’t do that to anyone. I’d feel to guilty. So I stay alone, willingly, while also wanting more and more to have someone to cure the loneliness I seem to love so much and the cycle continues.

The fuck is wrong with me?"

I've been crazy lonely and depressed for most of it. I'm doing my best to get myself out there but with COVID restrictions and busy work schedule, it's been tough. Anyways, recently I've been writing rhymes on the train in the morning on the way to work trying to express my feelings rather than just keep bottling them up. Here's one I wrote this week that I thought I'd share. Maybe some of you can relate. 

Anyone else out there feeling like they're at the end?

Where are the other humans where music is their only friend

Artists who write about the stuff I feel inside

My brain when left silent makes a gash to open wide

A wise man once said accepting negatives a positive thing

But how do I ignore the negative, its a constant high pitched ring

It sneaks into my ear drums and slithers into my head

A domino effect leads to thoughts of ""you're probably better off dead""

My desire is to believe that things will eventually turn

And I can leave these years in the past, toss em in the fire to burn 

The hope that one day I'll be texted by friends on Friday night

That one day I'll escape this darkness and finally see the light

I need to realize that there's more to life than this city

The truth of the matter is, when my mind is right, life is pretty"

lonely,35/M feels constantly lonely,"35/M feels constantly lonely - I really do feel like I am constantly alone everyday. I of course still live with my parents but I still feel that loneliness of not have any real life friends. I have had high anxiety and depression most of my life so it makes it hard to make friends in real life. I've also never had a girlfriend or dated in my entire life.

I'm one of those geeky nerds who likes to watch movies and collect things that most people think are dumb. I wish I could find a woman who is into the same stuff but I never seem to be able to find one. It's really hard to talk to women in real life and online. I guess I'm just don't feel confident like I should be but I just find it really hard to. 

I guess one sad thing I do is I go on Twitch and like most watch some of the women who stream on there but I know they are mostly on there for the attention and money they can make. I really don't know how to meet girls or talk to them. I just hunger for female companionship that's all and not to feel so damn lonely. 

Of course me being 5'2 and 350 lbs. probably isn't the ideal guy for most women but I am funny, smart, and I will say I do not think I am half bad looking either. I'm really into stuff like Marvel comics mostly the movies and I enjoy collecting things. I know that sounds weird but that's the thing about me is I'm weird. 

So I don't know if anyone would want to join the lonely club and talk but I am game for anything."

lonely,Is it normal to feel disconnected from most people?,"Is it normal to feel disconnected from most people? - Other than friends I've had since high school (Whom I'm a few hundred miles away from atm) I've realized I don't know how to connect with people anymore. I'm not sure if making real connections as an adult is rare, but not only do I find myself unable to connect with coworkers or college colleagues (before covid), I rarely have the desire to. I have one coworker who I can entertain actual small talk with on a variety of topics. Everyone else I feel like I'm on a different wavelength from. There's a point where small talk runs dry but there's the expectation to keep a conversation going and when I'm unable to it tends to be perceived as rude. It's not a shyness thing, I just feel the convo has ran it's course. Attempts to dive deeper into to a certain topic with people or change the subject rarely end up fruitful.  It makes me wonder what people talk about in depth, because I seem to be missing marks.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to make of it, and I'm finding myself more and more secluded psychologically. I keep busy with various hobbies but they all tend to be solitary (Cycling, outdoors, instruments, reading, cooking, lifting) and a lot of people in my age bracket don't seem to care too much about those things. At 24 I'm starting to feel horribly boring, out of the loop, and unrelatable/unapproachable. I've been invited to a few Halloween parties from girls at work and while it sounds nice to socialize again, god damn it I don't want to sit there and not be able to connect with anyone past ""Yeah we work together"". I have other plans with friends back home but even if I didn't, I'd still run into this roadblack."

I lost my dads mom in April and then my dads grandmom passed away in September. 2 other family members passed this year, but these two women hit me hardest. 

About my aunt, she stole $450-500 of my social security money and it was happening for a little over a year. The whole time she was telling me I was only getting $300 but i was really getting $763.25.

About my breakup and a joint apartment I was staying in, I was with a guy for 9 mos. about 3 mos into my relationship, I met a guy (through family) who knew how to paint, do construction, and had his own moving, bicycle, painting, and afterschool business’s. He helped me and my boyfriend move into our apartment. Hes given us money to make sure we were straight. We become good friends, and then my relationship becomes a shit fest. More arguing, more assuming, more hurt words being thrown back and forth, less trust, less dates, less having fun, less us. I noticed the change and fought long and hard, for 2-3 months almost EVERYDAY to tell him I knew something was going wrong and that i didnt wanna be with a person who wont talk to me to figure out whats wrong or how we can be better but i only ever got SILENCE, seriously. as our relationship started to deteriorate to the point where i felt as though i couldnt keep letting myself be sucked up by the four walls, i started going out more. the business guy was the only person who was there for me and treated me like a friend with everything i was dealing with this year, and my ex hated him. i gave up everything i had to be with this guy, a place, a car, a job, you name it, i lost it all. and now im back at square one. im currently staying in a van with my business friend who has stuck by me with all the crazy bs going on.

i just need to vent and some advice would be greatly appreciated. good and bad."

lonely,I’ve never felt so alone,"I’ve never felt so alone - I’ve always been shy, which eventually turned into being scared to even socialize when I got older. I’ve had the same group of friends throughout high school. People knew me ofc, but now that I look back on it, besides that friend group, it’s always been just acquaintances. I don’t consider them my friends now.

I’m in my second year of college and well you guessed it, I made no friends last year and well with covid, it’s hard to do it this semester. Few of my high school friends go to the same college as I do actually. But they can actually socialize and aren’t afraid to make plans or reach out. They both have made new friends and I occasionally talk to them but I don’t want to intrude their new life; they’ve reached out to me once last year actually, but when I was hanging out, I felt like an outcast. I obviously didn’t have the same chemistry with these new friends and I was too scared to talk. 

So yea, because of my dumb ass, I’m here being lonelier than I’ve ever been before. I feel like the only solid person I have in my life is an online friend I met on minecraft 7 years ago lol. He’s been the person I spill everything to, but the actual irl connection is missing and it does suck cause that’s all I’ve ever wished for in my life: to have that one friend who would actually think about me.

I even debated getting therapy because well I am depressed but I don’t want to say it’s depression cause I’m not officially diagnosed, but I do self-harm occasionally. My sister told me I’m basically paying $150+ to have a friend or someone to talk to, and that just made feel like in another life, I wish I wasn’t this socially awkward and scared and that I could save my money by actually having a friend to talk to 😪"

Im in the education field in my uni and we have to take the state certification exam in order to clinical teach. I took my test October 3rd and got my scores back today. I failed by 7 points. Im an English major so I had to take the state exam around the subject of English. I wasn't able to get the study material in time for the test so i just had to use this website that showed some examples of what questions would be on the test (big shock, none of the questions looked like they did on the free source) i did everything i could. I tried to study as much as i can, but i just didn't make it this time. I keep telling myself that i can take it again, but it's bringing back emotions I haven't felt since middle school. That feeling of failure; not being good enough to be with the other people who made it. I was depressed in middle school and always thought about suicide. I never told anyone and still haven't. I was alone, distanced myself from people and I'm scared to go back. Made it all this way; climbed this far out of the ditch called depression just to slip right back in. I don't want to go back to that. It's just some stupid test, but it still hurts. I'm trying everything to keep my footing, but it's hard. Just gotta keep moving forward i guess."
lonely,Everyone leaves you after 22,"Everyone leaves you after 22 - I’m 31 and haven’t felt a second of happiness since I was 22 and partying with my roommates and friends. And looking back, that probably wasn’t happiness, just the 20 beers I drank. Every day I feel more and more isolated and alone. My roommates have long since moved out and stopped talking to me. They were the more “popular” friends so they took their friends with them. I haven’t been invited to anything will my old group of friends since the last roommate moved out and my texts go unanswered. I wasted so many years thinking these people were my friends. I have a girlfriend but at this point she feels more like a roommate than a romantic partner. I could tell her all of this and she’d say, “That makes me sad. What should we do for dinner?” I feel like I have no one to talk to and even when I try people don’t take me seriously. I guess that’s the downfall of using humor to deflect, no one takes you seriously anymore. I just feel lonelier and lonelier and less of a will to drag this shit out another 50-60 years. I don’t even know where I’m going with this. I’m just really sad and really lonely."

In all honesty, I’m lonely... super lonely. I’m in college and I don’t have a lot of friends (maybe 5-6 in total, 2 of them are roommates who I like). 

I just am not interested in what most people are interested in. I’m a 21 year old male. I’ve never had a GF. I had sex with one girl but in all honesty I regret it and wished I waited until marriage or until I find the right girl. 

I’m not a partier, I mainly read and watch movies. I love reading business journals and articles. 

I want a girlfriend but I’ve never had one. I actually get kinda nervous around women in all honesty. It’s not that I’m bad looking, I’m 6’4 dirty blond with blue eyes. But I just... Idk.

Ok, well I had this one best friend but we stopped talking a couple years ago I recently say her a couple weeks ago. I dont really think she was a real friend because the only time she talked to me when when all her other friends were unavailable to come over. And everytime I did we would argue. I an socially awkward and no one seems to like me. At first I'm a completely different person. I seem all excited and confident. They seem interested into getting to know me. Once I feel more comfortable around them I start being myself and then I start being myself. All awkward and not knowing how to respond but I'm still nice. But then they seem to be uninterested and then im all alone again for the rest of the school year. This has been happening every since I was 5 (When I started school) I feel hopeless and I don't know what to do. I dont know what wrong with me. I will admit I don't normally talk first. I am very shy. That may be the problem like I said the people who do talk to me ghost me the next day. I think I give up. Thanks for listening if you're still here. If you have any advice people tell me. Bye 👋"
lonely,"Being an adult is realizing that no one really cares about you anymore, just you can do for them","Being an adult is realizing that no one really cares about you anymore, just you can do for them - I know everyone’s experience is different, but I miss the days of being young and having several people that I could talk to or spend time with at any time and they genuinely seemed to care. Then becoming an adult, everyone gets married, careers, kids, and everyone is in their own little world. And it’s not only
viewed as inconvenient to be close to people, it’s also considering weird or inappropriate for your age. You are supposed to just be content in your work and home. And often it feels like people at work or home don’t really care about you, only about what you offer them and can do for them. Life becomes about taking care of everyone else and what you can do for them. 

Anyway, rant over. Just sucks sometimes. I miss having people to share thoughts and feelings and experiences with."

Maybe we go to the same uni? I'm in the UK, University of Lincoln. If u go there too, then we just have to meet. Cuz I'm not sure where else to go to find anyone round here. 

Otherwise any suggestions where I can go?"

lonely,I quit all my dating apps/sites and don't feel much better. Maybe this is how it will always be.,"I quit all my dating apps/sites and don't feel much better. Maybe this is how it will always be. - I'm a 22 year old autistic male with virtually no social life. My nearest friend is an hour and a half away and always busy and I hardly get to see him often. I don't have any people-oriented hobbies. I mostly read books, watch series/YouTube, and play video games. Frankly, I'm not really interested in much else. I sure as Hell don't have any luck with women. I've never been in a relationship or even on a date. 

I am still grieving over a woman I met online last summer on Interpals. She was Russian-American (I have a thing for Slavic women and am a huge Russophile) and she spoke it fluently. Plus, she was really beautiful. She thought it was cool that I was into that stuff and liked my memes and sense of humor. I was very happy when we got to video chat that one time...Unfortunately, she ended up ghosting me for another man (after telling me she loved me and cared about me) and then gave me a half-assed apology and defended her actions when I confronted her months later. Before her, I was talking to a woman from England who would send me ""good morning"" messages and talk with me pretty much all day. She also liked my memes and my humor. Something similar happened, I fell hard for her and then she found a boyfriend in England and got too busy for me. 

I tried meeting women in real life when I was in high school and college and got nowhere. I had to learn the hard way that just walking up to women and trying to talk to them doesn't work and even get me accused of harassment and written up by the dean...I tried online dating and various subreddits here to find a partner but I never get any likes/messages/matches, so I decided to quit wasting my money on dating app subscriptions. Right now, I'm just trying to do things to distract from my loneliness and it's not working well.

I have a feeling I'm probably not meant to have IRL friends or a partner. After my one friend finishes college in a year, I won't even have him either. Because of who I am and how boring and ugly I am, I probably won't make any more friends or find a partner. I don't have looks, money, or personality on my side so what the Hell do I do? I hate myself and I wish that I were a tall rich man with good looks and an interesting personality."

Whenever I talk about this to somebody, they always say that I am still so young and I can find someone in the future. But all of the people who said me that experienced love in their lives while I have never experienced a love life before, they are also same age as me or younger than me. I am the only one I know who hasn't loved anyone or loved by someone. So I think there is a weird thing about me, something different than others, I don't know what is it but I want to know what's this. That's why I wrote here, I want to know what is this I want an advice"
lonely,I just want a woman to cuddle me and heal me.,"I just want a woman to cuddle me and heal me. - My child’s mom and I split up recently. It’s been a great relief, but I’m now starting to become lonely. For a short time after, I connected with another female, but the timing and situation wasn’t right, and I had to end it. 

But now I’m afraid that I’ve closed a door that I wish was still open. I am painfully lonely and I feel desperate for physical contact. Not sex, just cuddling. I want to reconnect with the newer girl, and I’ve tried, but I’m not getting anywhere this time. 

I’m so depressed and empty and I want nothing in this world other than some time holding her. But explaining all this won’t get me anywhere. It will only make me look weak and even less desirable to her. 

I’ve also tried reaching out to other past flings, and they’re all giving the cold shoulder as well, even though there’s always been good energy between us, before and after our time together. I don’t know why the world has turned on me suddenly. I feel like I’m being boxed out by the women that I’ve always been able to count on for anything. It’s nothing to do with me being too forward or emotional towards them, I can’t even get a reply from a simple “how are you?”

I just really need to be in the arms of a woman I have a deep connection with, and it’s not happening. And I don’t see it happening for a very long time. Yeah I could meet women somewhere, but it could be months until I meet one I have a strong connection with.

It’s just tiring when all you ever get is rejected. I know I have some “quirks” that not all guy get and/or appreciate, but that’s just who I am. I’m overly affectionate (physical affection is my primary love language)and overly sensitive and wear my heart on my sleeve. I only ever get messages from older guys (which make me anxious) or guys that have no intention of staying around. If only I could my best friend. I know he has to be out there.

lonely,Night Club and cats,"Night Club and cats - So I’m watching my friends cats and listening to Night Club while drunk. Don’t worry, work is over and I already did all the cat things(food,water,scoop poop), they actually really like me which is cute. I’m pretty well respected at work but there’s very few people I want to hang out with and they don’t always want to hang out. Guilty, because I’m not always the best company while drunk. I don’t know, part of me says this is stupid and I’m just attention seeking posting here and another part says it’s ok because there’s a reason why I want to. This is also my dilemma, I like people(to an extent)but there are very very few that I actually want to relax with, my family is not in that group unfortunately. I also haven’t been in a relationship in 10 years. Whenever I go onto a dating app I’m just so put off by the whole chore of it all, like let’s just go get coffee or something and if it doesn’t feel right then cool. Ughh. I’m sure if I made enough money to do whatever I wanted I wouldn’t feel this way but we all know how America works. Anyways sorry for the rant.

I also have a crush but she just doesnt care about my existence at all. If im there thats okay but if im not there thats also okay for her.

And i am 200% sure that if i would be the rich succesfull guy that like a lot of people would actually care about me and my crush would too.

But at 15 its like impossible to get rich rich.

I do have all the opportunities to get rich later on in life but thats later on, not now.

It really isn't their problem and you should really just keep quiet about those sorts of personal issues.

lonely,I haven’t had a friend for 7 years,"I haven’t had a friend for 7 years - I used to have friends but I moved to the other side of the world. I was always shy and anxious but at school it’s easy to make friends. When I moved I really struggled and avoided trying to talk to anyone or make new friends. I struggled for a year of high school but thought I could meet people at university. I basically continued the avoidance and didn’t make attempts to make any friends, throughout this time i dropped out and swapped courses a few times. I also worked a few different jobs and basically I closed myself off from everyone each time. Now I’m done with university and school and it feels like i have no chance of making friends. 

My biggest problem now is that not having any friends is my biggest insecurity. I never want anyone to find that out which means I close myself off. I’m basically stuck in a loop where not having friends causes me to not be able to make any. Has anyone overcame something like this? I feel like moving somewhere else for a fresh start and so I have an excuse for not having friends. I feel like a complete loser and as if I’ve wasted a lot of my life. Where do I even start to fix this mess I’ve created? I’m self employed so don’t have co-workers i can try to befriend and I don’t have any old friends I can reconnect with.

Am just going to jump straight to the subject, am a 23 years old male i have a couple of close friends am fairly satisfied with myself but i've never been in a real relationship before, i think that's the biggest reason of my never ending loneliness i try to get over it by focusing on other things  i enjoy but i feel like am in a point that i really want to meet that special person that i just don't want this feeling anymore i ve met so many incredible amazing girls that i really liked but never loved that way i think it never worked for me as in a relationship...

The thing is i don't feel like it's going to happen for me anymore and to be honest am not making any efforts to meet someone new mostly because i don't feel like it (i just feel like i don't have it in me anymore to try again because i tried so many times and like i ve said i ve met so many amazing girls) and in the same time i can't right now with the corona spreading all over the place in my country.

umm so yeah i think i've said it all to  summarize , i've been feeling lonely for more than i can remember i think i ve realized it most when i went to college about 4 or 5 years .

Thank you :)."

       I’ve failed, and given up trying at all, gave up on our love. though i never stopped loving you.That’s unfair to say but I can’t help it. You want nothing to do with me and that’s fair to say as well. i’m an awful human with a clouded mind.                                                                                         I need help, you tried for 3 years to help and i just shoved you away from me, further driving the wedge between us. i mocked the things you enjoyed, judged you constantly. I can never make up or take back the things said or done. i wish every day that i could, that you’d talk to me again. but i buried our relationship. that was me. I have no right to hold onto it anymore but I just can’t let go of you. Accustomed to your kindness, your sweetness I became blind to how much you truly cared for me, deep down in the deepest parts of yourself loved me. Insecurity swallowed me up and turned me into a jealous control freak over the person who’s supposed to be my best friend, companion, partner. that’s no way to treat a partner and i did it because i’m a coward. to protect myself from being hurt, while all you wanted was to be my support. you were the best thing that has ever happened to me, just to blind to see, and I can’t let go. when i think about the future my mind still wants to imagine it with you. i’m so angry.
I love you, Dinah. I still can’t let go of you, but i’m trying. I always said you were better without me, and i’m glad I was right."

lonely,[M17]I’m ugly and worried i’ll never be in a relationship ( a serious one of course ),"[M17]I’m ugly and worried i’ll never be in a relationship ( a serious one of course ) - Hi everyone, I’m 17 yo and I’m afraid about my future because i’m ugly and i don’t think i’ll ever be in a relationship. I’ve already got a good physique, so i’m in fit, but my face is my problem and i’m balding too. I don’t want to get any kind of surgery ( so no plastic surgery or hair transplant ). 
I’ve deleted all my socials because i am done of scrolling the home page and seeing all those model-like guys with their girlfriends. I’m also sad that an ugly guy can’t pretend to have a beautiful girlfriend, because of his looks ( luckily, btw, i’ve got not high standards, and i’m happy with it. But, dropping standards is VERY hard for someone who’d like to be in a relationship with a girl he aesthetically ( too ) loves ). Why do i have to be judged for something i can’t change ( i repeat i already have a pretty good body, the face is the problem ).
I’m also really lonely.
How can i cope with this difficult period?"

lonely,Is it okay to want people to care about you?,"Is it okay to want people to care about you? - People are consistently preaching about self love and how we shouldn’t seek the feeling of being cared for, being important, being noticed by other people. If we do that, then that automatically means we’re weak. But why? What’s wrong with wanting other people to care about you? It’s not the only thing I care about, really. But what’s wrong with wanting that? I have consistently been there for people I care about, I do and say things that make sure that they know they’re loved and cared. I’m there for literally anyone who needs someone. But why don’t I have that? I don’t have a person to talk to, and even when I want to start talking about it, it goes back to them, again. And again. I just feel so lonely. I thought I had friends, but I guess I was just someone they talk to. I don’t even know what being friends mean anymore.

lonely,Had a dream about my ex girlfriend,"Had a dream about my ex girlfriend - It's so hard to put my thoughts and feelings into words, but yeah. My ex girlfriend, whomst I broke up with 2 years ago, was the star of my dream last night.

I'm honestly starting to question whether or not I'm over her after that night. I woke up in a cold sweat unable to think about virtually anything else for the rest of the day, my mind was so focused on that. I rarely remember anything about my dreams longer than a couple of minutes after I wake up, but this time is different. While I did forget most of it, I do remember a few things. It also reminded me of her in a way I haven't been for years.

It showed how truly sad and alone I am, despite seeming fine with it all, and how much I miss her. It hurts to think about her, but that's all I can do. But I don't think I would bring myself to contact her, if I could even find a way to. Which, over the course of two years, has been impossible. And at this point, if she's even still alive, isn't really my place to start trying again. 

I doubt I'd keep this up for more than a few just because of how shameful I am about my own emotions, but god am I so depressed about it all. I just wish I was over her so I could move on with my life"

lonely,"Another day has passed by me, people slip through my fingers. It feels as though there’s an invisible wall keeping me from feeling another’s warmth.","Another day has passed by me, people slip through my fingers. It feels as though there’s an invisible wall keeping me from feeling another’s warmth. - I rode my bike tonight, even though I was exhausted from walking all day in the cold. 

I kept thinking to myself, what if by sitting at home I am missing all the opportunities to bump into someone? So I put my coat back on, and got out on my bike. 

I rode until my mouth felt full of cotton. I sat at a stop sign and changed songs on my phone. 
Headlights blinded me, and a small red car honked twice. I tried to see who was inside, to young guys waving at me as they drove by. 

I didn’t recognize them. By the time I realized this though, they had already passed me. I quickly turned and watched them drive off. 
“OH NO! I didn’t wave! What if they think I wasn’t interested or annoyed by them??”

They turned into the skate park up the road, I rode my bike on the back trail to the park. Just to see if I could get a better look at them, maybe they might see me and want to talk? 

Once I got there, they were already pulling out. 
I watched them drive off once again. 
They passed the stop sign I had been sitting at. “DAMN IT! If I had just stayed there they might’ve stopped and talked to me??” 

I rode as quick as I could to make it back to the sign, but once I was there, they had already made a turn. I didn’t know which way they went. 

It isn’t until now that I realize how desperate I am for some attention/friendship/interaction. The idea of having someone over to my place tonight, or having a boyfriend, of having a girlfriend, of going on a drive with someone, talking, a late night walk, getting coffee, someone to cry with..... 
I am in desperate need for a connection. 

The problem is though, when I am with people, I put on this facade. To everyone I am happy, annoying but bubbly. They all like me, but I fail to make any friends. 
I wish I could show myself to them, but I haven’t a clue how. I wish I could talk to someone and listen to them, and become close, like I’ve always dreamed. 

Anyways, how’s it going with you bro? Lol 

TLDR/ I am in desperate need of a close friendship, like everyone else here."

I feel so lonely, but I just want to be left alone so no one would notice. I don't tell anyone anything. I just don't want anyone to give me their attention to make me feel better. I feel so disconnected from everyone again. Thinking about that makes me feel worse.

Now that I think about it, this may be one of the reasons why I'm so lonely; people don't abandon me, I push them away."

Sometimes I wonder if anyone really wants to hang out with me or talk to me. I was feeling lonely anyway but I recently made a huge move and am super far away from friends and family. I’m starting to regret it as I haven’t made any friends here. I’m sick of feeling like I’m not the #1 person in anyone’s lives and no matter how I try people don’t wanna be around me. Even on tinder I don’t get messages. I’m starting to think I’m meant to be completely alone and I’m wondering if it’s even worth it if that’s the case.

lonely,Ex got married,"Ex got married - I just found out myex gf (she's 26, I'm 30m) just got married. We had a very hot and cold three year off and on again relationship. We loved as much as we fought, one of those things. We finally ended things in April, weeks after covid broke out. She immediately left town and met some guy in another state. 

I wasn't terribly upset by her dating someone else, and as months went by, I began to miss her. I missed her company, her affection, and our shared existential angst. We have broken up before, and come back together somehow, and I guess I thought it would happen again. I thought this week, if we get back together, I will marry her this time. 

I reached out to her via email to see if her and the cat we raised from a kitten were okay (hurricane). She said she was fine, she was actually in Portland (where we had always planned to move together), and that she was now married to that rebound, and that this was her last goodbye. 

My heart dropped, I know we aren't right for each other, that this is for the best, but I feel so crushed. I'm 30 years old, no kids, never married, found out my oldest friends were not my friends, and the woman I loved for years replaced me almost immediately. It makes me question if she ever really loved me, or am I just some tool that can easily be replaced. 

I feel so left behind, in general. I think it makes it worse that I had decided to marry her if she came back. My work feels like a prison right now, and I dread the night every night, because the dark makes me feel so lonely I think I might suffocate."
lonely,Too ugly,"Too ugly - The fact of the matter is i will never know what it will be like to be in a relationship simply because I am too hideous. Nobody wants to wake up and see my ugly mug first thing in the morning.

It always irks me how blase almosy everyone around me is about relationships saying how I should just stay single and/or not have children even though at the end of the day things work out for them. Almost as if they are suggesting it's not something I should aspire to have.

Long ago I said to myself that if I ever win the lottery (unlikely but you never know) I would just remain single because my money would just bring out the gold diggers and they would only want my money and not me. Better off just paying a prostitute for my urges because at least I know what they want.

I am well aware that what they offer is mostly just a facade to make you happy but it's good for a little while (it's legal in Australia and well regulated) but something more genuine and long term would be nice."

lonely,My longtime friend and lover just died. He was 30. I've never had a loss this devastating.,"My longtime friend and lover just died. He was 30. I've never had a loss this devastating. - I saw him the day before he overdosed. It was unexpected; he had been sober for a long time. 

He gave me a gift that day, a stunning necklace that he had made himself, with bones that he had collected on his trips in the forests. 

I wonder now if he knew it would be the last time I saw him. 

We played music together, went foraging, talked for hours - I've never had a connection so tender and rewarding.

It felt like in every way; platonic, romantic, sexual, musically, we were on the same page. A once-in-a-lifetime person. A person who I will miss so deeply and never see again. 

We met when we were both homeless and needed somebody safe to be with. Somebody with no other intention other than to be there, to witness and hold. 

I keep playing the music that we played together, that he introduced me to. But now I'm playing it alone. 

Money can't replace it, no memory can erase it, and I know I'm never gonna find another one to compare.

lonely,i am so confused with my relationship status,i am so confused with my relationship status - there is this girl and I am friends with her. I have always been supporting of LGBTQ+ and will always be. I watch a lot of LGBTQ+ TikToks and videos and they are really good but I feel like some of them are turning from Homosexual to Heterophobic. I don’t know if it is just me though. I feel like I am having trouble controlling the thoughts in my head and don’t know if I actually like this girl or if my brain is telling me to be lesbian because everybody thinks very highly of the LGBTQ+ and lesbians in general. Thoughts?
lonely,Can someone talk to me?,Can someone talk to me? - I'm feeling really depressed right now. I don't have any close friends to confide to.

lonely,I don’t wanna go through life alone,"I don’t wanna go through life alone - I’m 18 and I’ve never been in a relationship. I’ve never had someone care for me that way. I’m pretty damn good at hiding it, but man it’d be nice to spoon with someone :("
lonely,What's a friendship? How does it happen?,"What's a friendship? How does it happen? -  I don't understand anymore, what's a friend? How do I know if I have a friend? What does friends do? How I become a friend to someone? How someone become a friend of mine? What do I do if I'm a friend? How do I act? What do I say? 
 I don't know what I'm looking for, what I like or want, I don't know who I am.
 I see people in here, asking for smart people, kind people, fun people, silly people, shy, introvert, extrovert, talkative, no talkative, mature, no mature, who likes animes, games, movies, sports, creeps, no creeps, with life and without a life. I feel like I can't fit in anyone of those, even if I have some characteristics I have none at the same time.
 I always think of me being a bad conversationist, shy, boring and stuff but tbh I think even if I wasn't all of that I would be questioning the same things...
 I have two friends who I barely talk to, we don't share much together, we are like sharing the life in a distance, without texting, without talking and we are still friends.. this doesn't seem normal but is the only thing I know to something close to a ""friendship"" I don't know how to feel about anything, i don't know what to do, I don't even know if I'm interested in having friends but I do like to talk to people and that's why this is so frustrating."
lonely,I don’t want to be lonely but constantly find myself wanting to be alone,"I don’t want to be lonely but constantly find myself wanting to be alone - I’m surrounded by a lot of people; my family including me is a family of 6, my extended family means I have a billion cousins and aunts and uncles. 
I have my friends but... I never truly feel like I fit in. I feel like the forgotten one a lot - my 2 best friends always talk to me but I find it hard to explain just how lonely I feel. They’ll ask me if I’m okay and I will always reply of course. But I will always demand an answer for their own sadness. I always like my own presence and keeping my feelings to myself because the idea of being exposed and vulnerable is completely frightening but for the past couple of months, I just want someone. I have grown up an anxious person and even though I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety because I’m completely terrified of going to a doctor only to have them tell I’m overreacting, I know that this isn’t normal. But my anxiety eats up at me and my loneliness. It almost indulges on it. It takes my loneliness and makes me overthink everything and pushes me even further away from the world. I’m yearning for someone to understand this and to just know it’s an anxious and lonely day by looking at me. But we don’t live in fairytales. And I grew up on the pretences of fairytales as my escape from home. 
I’m that kind of lonely where I’ll lay awake at night and just dream of having someone who I could always go to. I imagine this someone to be warm and tall so that they can completely hide me when they hug me.
It’s heartbreaking sometimes just when I realise how lonely I feel and it hits me in sudden waves. 
I don’t want to be a burden and tell someone but I just wish I had a chance to meet the one who would make me forget everything but love everything with them.
I also hate myself for writing this because it feels like I’m giving into the loneliness almost. 
I don’t know... I hope I find my warm person and I hope that this loneliness stops engulfing me."

lonely,Touch starved teddy bear,"Touch starved teddy bear - A little background first, I'm a single, decent looking, in ok shape, never married, 35 yo male from a small town in Tn. I was painfully shy till my mid 20's so I've never had a long term relationship. I spent 6 years in the Army and started college as soon as I got out. I'm now on year 4 of a 5 year degree. I don't know what is going on with me in the past year. I've always been ok with being alone, but now I find myself painfully lonely and wishing I had someone to snuggle up with at night. It's been hard because all the girls I interact with on the daily are 10+ years my junior so it kinda feels weird to think of them as a potential gf, and the local dating scene is a 2020, since dumpster fire seems nice in comparison haha. Of the dates that I do get, these girls seem to want drink till they're blacked out, and do all sorts of drugs. Needless to say, I don't match mentally or emotionally with any of these girls. I just feel lost and that I should've started taking dating seriously a decade ago. This feeling of loneliness combined with depression that I'm already dealing with makes my mind go to some dark places. I Just wish I didn't feel like an outsider all the time. Sorry if I come across as a rambling mess. It just helps to vent and get it out there."

lonely,rant,"rant - dude i’m just gonna fucking rant. i don’t know if anybody can relate but, i have like a hard time with life sometimes. sometimes it’s great but sometimes it’s really hard. and no matter how i’m feeling, like i always find myself struggling with like certain patterns of behavior, i find myself like stuck in like the same thing that just keeps repeating over and over again. i always think to myself like “how am i in this?” and it’s that moment where your in it, and you just seperate yourself from that situation and you look at it and you see it for what it is and your able to then do something about it. like you’ve now broken out of that circle or cycle. i know that for me that when i’m inside myself, when i’m in my own head, it’s fucked. like my head, my mind, whatever, it’s a bad neighborhood dude. i should not be in it alone. i can’t be there by myself. so like when i’m in my own head, my whole life gets thrown off. like i don’t say nice things to myself. there’s another josh in there that like wants to take me down. i find that whether it’s substances or whether is behavior or depressive stuff or whatever it is, like if i’m not actively getting out of myself and being with other people. like as in being a friend, or being family, or being a bandmate, like if i’m out of myself i’m great. if i’m inside all the time, i’m horrible, i’m a mess. and like i concoct problems in my head and literally drive myself nuts, like actually thinking that all of these are real problems. like all the stuff in my head, i’m just doing this to myself regardless of whatever that thing is. and so this is like conscious awareness of that thing and like when you can step back and look at something like your actually elevating yourself consciously, like your enlightened at a certain degree, and so this is that moment of enlightenment where you go “i could do something about this and by doing it i can move forward and get unstuck from this” and for me, it’s like i could actually live on life’s terms, like i could experience the spectrum of humanity and not wanna get out of it, whether it’s happiness, sadness, or whatever. like when i’m in it, i just wanna get out of however i’m feeling no matter what it is."

lonely,What a time to be isolated,"What a time to be isolated - I moved twice during the quarantine. Once out of the city to the sticks to escape the ongoing mass agitation; and again from the sticks to my childhood home to escape a toxic relationship. Presently I’ve been twiddling my thumbs to say the least. Most of my friends are in the city that I left in June. I can go visit them but I know I’ll feel like an alien even more so than before. They know I’m back in the area. I haven’t heard from anyone and that’s ok I’ve just been thinking:

The funniest part of all this is that I’m desperate for contact-a conversation; a text; a tinder match; a hug. It seems the only good thing from remaining connected through all these smart devices is I receive plenty of fear porn and spam from corporations that want to exploit me and texts from various organizations desperate for my $ contribution or a promise that I’m going to vote. I’m depressed and isolated-it’s hard enough for me to feed myself let alone reregister to vote and actually do it (I believe both parties to be completely corrupt). To receive these false notifications from faceless entities/bots/algorithms is insulting. I just want someone to tell me they miss me or have thought of me. But I have to appreciate the irony of it all. I just needed to rant thank you in advanced for reading feel free to share your experiences."

My boss said that it could make me lose or had a suspension on my work. And my family told me to stay still. While he did a tantrum about me telling him to not say curses. And now I have to stay in silence until he calms down. 
A hug and saying everything will be alright is all I need. But no one to told me it. I really don't belong here, but I don't have elsewhere to go. All I can do is stay in silence.

Some of my best friend's haven't called me from last 4 years and also they never called me for their marriage. Once I was in my best friend's town, I called him, messaged him to meet me at a hotel near his house. He never called or messaged me. I haven't heard from him till now. 

I had a friend who had 2bikes and 1car and he still always kept telling me your house which is 3kms away is very far and I can't come. He would always ask me to go visit him at his place. It's been 5 to 6 years I haven't heard from him.

lonely,I just want to be happy,"I just want to be happy - Covid has completely dismantled and destroyed my social life. I’m in high school, all my friends go out and do whatever they want together, with whoever, and do whatever. Their decision, whatever. I stay home and haven’t left since last spring. 

I play video games to get interaction and escape. It worked for a while. Now I realize I only have surface level friend ships with about 25 people online, and I speak to probably five on any given day, which is horrible when it’s my only interaction. Then there’s the underlying fear that they aren’t even surface level friends, they pretend and only play with me because I am female. Now I get angry at them/the game so quickly I can hardly play anymore. 

I found out my two “best” friends both have had boyfriends for months and didn’t say anything to me, I had no idea. It just really hurts they don’t tell me anything even tho I have been keeping them updated. They both literally agreed it’s a “out of sight, out of mind” scenario. After hearing that, I cried the hardest I have in a very long time. No one I know in real life has spoken to me, except to say their busy and that’s why I haven’t heard anything from them. 

Yeah, I have a boyfriend. We talk and call every day and it’s great, but it hurts so much for him to be the only human I have a connection with. We are long distance and trust me it doesn’t help my loneliness. It hurts even more knowing the one person that cares for me is far away and I could loose him at any point. 

Everyone is fake, they don’t care about me. All of my friendships are surface level, I want a hug. I want things to be normal again. I’m so sad. I can’t keep pretending I’m fine, I think I’m slipping."

lonely,Lonely in college rant,"Lonely in college rant - Hi everybody :) 
I couldn’t attend my “virtual” group therapy session today but I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with sadness and loneliness lately so here i am.
I’m a senior at uni and I feel like I should have established strong friendships with my peers by now. It’s a really sad feeling to know people you considered good friends are hanging out without you and finding out via social media (or, more embarrassingly, through actually seeing them all out together while running some errands alone). Everyone I know has settled into their respective friend groups and I’m just stuck...alone.
I just feel so inadequate and like a second choice to everyone I know. No one reaches out to me first to hang out, with the only exception being some desperate guys who view me as an object. My whole life I’ve always felt like something was wrong with me socially and I feel like this entire year is proving me right. I know I’m boring at first but I wish people would at least stick around long enough for me to feel more comfortable with being outgoing around them. 
Living alone for the year has really exacerbated these feelings. At least if I had a roommate, I could talk to them. Considering my campus just closed back up, there really isn’t any way I can make/meet up with friends. I was also recently ghosted, which I guess is what triggered the upheaval of all the emotions. 
On a bright note, I’m thinking of taking up crafts as a hobby, maybe candle making or painting. Also, volunteering at the local hospital is the highlight of my week, as I get to distract myself from my loneliness and I love interacting with patients. But i feel like neither of these are viable replacements for genuine friendships. idk. i’m just goin thru it rn."

I cry about it often now as a grown woman but I never did growing up. I just don’t see how you could bring life into this world and then leave it. Even as a woman that doesn’t want children, if I did have kids I’d never leave them and sure as hell make sure the man I brought them into this world with would be In their life regardless of our relationship status. I’m afraid I will never find love because I’ve only known men to hurt and abuse me. I feel like I’m damaged. Although I’ve healed, (Partially) I just don’t know what man would want someone like me. I am lonely but I pretend it doesn’t bother me. I just want a man to be everything my father wasn’t and also my lover. It seems fucked up but I don’t mean it in that creepy way.

Driving around blasting music all the way to where we're going. friendship has always been very awkward for me, somehow performative. if they knew what was underneath, that all the sweetness and sincerity masks a ragged monster. I keep my distance because I can't bare to see that familiar fear in people's eyes that they've been left alone with a monster like me.
   I'm trying my best to change, but sometimes I get so angry that my emotions get the best of me. Even if the words are truly what I'm feeling and I'm communicating, I'm scared that I'm abusive. I realized the value of talking to a crisis counselor, but last night I went off the deep end on my lover for not answering a genuinely important question and brushing me off with ""right now you need more help then me."" I was calm before he said that.. not so much after. Well, he's gone now. Only liked my 'firey passion' as he described it when he wasn't close to the heat. 
Look.. I know I'm a fucking basket case. A big old ""yikes"" picture. a crazy bitch, with deeply seated mental illness and too high of standards for how low I've fallen.  
but for once.. just for once. I'd like to be told I deserve friends who wont leave me at the drop of a pin. People who will fight for me as hard as I've fought for them in the face of mental illness. most times now, I either view myself as an imposition in hitting them up, somebody for them to take care of or use their degree on. an unleveled imposter, posing in the guise of friendship so they can study me. I struggle with drawing the line between intuition and perception. I often walk away from people because my trust issues are so jacked that I think they'll all gaslight me, project on me, call me names, put words in my mouth, and be all around toxic. Or they'll be the opposite. Cold. Dismissive. not care about losing me. so I've grown terrified of confrontation  and end up ghosting a lot. 
I'm sorry for how all over this post is, but it encapsulates how I feel about friendship these days. 
This is where I'm at. 
And I'm sick of being alone."

lonely,I don’t want to be alone but the thought of getting hurt again is draining,"I don’t want to be alone but the thought of getting hurt again is draining - I don’t think I have the energy to put up with another heartbreak. 

My life isn’t what I’d call chaotic — I try to be a low-key person — but there is unfortunately a lot going on right now. 

I have friends, but nobody that I can share deep thoughts with. My conversations with them have a tendency to be more surface level. 

I am tired of scaring people away or not being good enough. I recognize relationships take a lot of effort, but that’s not what I’m afraid of. Building a sense of trust with someone, only to be told they changed their mind about what they felt, is terrifying to me.

As of right now, I just need a cuddle buddy."
lonely,I just want to belong to someone.,"I just want to belong to someone. - Not in a weird way, but I want to belong to someone. To be someone’s person. I feel like I’ve never really belonged to anybody. I really just want someone who thinks about me when I’m not around. Someone who’s happy to see me when I am around. It’s hard to be confident and cool and outgoing when I feel this way. Even if happiness did come knocking, I’m not sure that I’d recognize it at this point."

lonely,I feel unloved,"I feel unloved - I’m a college student and this semester has been awful. I should’ve taken it off, but I made commitments that I couldn’t back out of. All this Covid whatever has made my depression worse and it gets worse everyday. I have a boyfriend who tells me he loves me, but my brain won’t listen. I have friends, but we’ve been drifting and I think I’m being replaced. I just feel like everything is going downhill and my brakes aren’t working. I’ve reverted to old harmful habits that I haven’t even thought about in years. No matter what’s going on, I feel perpetually alone and unloved. I don’t know what to do. I can’t even bring myself to cry anymore. I feel like I’m pushing away all the goodness in my life and there’s absolutely nothing I can do about it."
lonely,No one likes me.,"No one likes me. - I completely fucked up all of my relationships. My family thinks I’m a burden and they always complain about me. I never see my friends and they probably think I’m asshole because I never talk. I used a favorite student of a lot of my teachers, but my mom fucked up and now they are all pissed at me. I left my online friends because I was too anxious to talk to them and they turned out to be borderline criminals. My in- school friends seemed annoyed with me the last time I saw them, and I’m out of touch with them because we don’t text or use the same social medias. Hell, even my dog hates me, I give her a shit ton of treats and I’m always nice to her, but she literally runs away from me. I just want people to like me, I don’t even want a friend, I just want to be liked by someone."

lonely,Feeling of emptiness?,"Feeling of emptiness? - I am 23F and recently moved to my hometown with mom due to the pandemic. I’m getting my masters degree, online of course but other then that not doing much. I haven’t lived in my hometown since I was 17 and I have absolutely no friends here. Well I have some friends but we have just drifted apart in our interests. I live a really really active lifestyle running, hiking, backpacking, roller skating, surfing doing literally whatever outdoors. I lived a pretty nomadic lifestyle while in uni and have friends scattered across the state, country and world, but I am just feeling so lonely. I sometimes regret that nomadic lifestyle and never settling somewhere to have an immediate friend group. I think I’m a happy, educated, spontaneous person and maybe I am wishing I had someone to share that with. With the pandemic and all it seems impossible to try and find that person. My other friends I talk to about this loneliness say that I should just embrace being alone and try not to compensate with a partnership right now, but I have always been alone.

Every few months or so, there’s always these types of positivity chains where people tag other people, “nominating” them. I have never been tagged in any of those. I’m not against them or anything, but it constantly reminds me how much of a loser I am. Today, everyone has been posting “you are loved” and posts about them always being there for anyone who needs it. Bullshit. The only “you are loved” for me is you are loved by nobody. Where was all this energy when I tried my best stepping out of my comfort zone to talk, only to have those same people treat with such negative energy. Words, especially those on social media, mean nothing to me anymore. Until you can name someone I am loved by, I am loved by no one."

I don’t know, lately, it feels like everyone is in on it except me - to ice me out. I’ve had my fair share of difficulties in finding and making friends... but frankly it’s getting a little ridiculous at how hard it is right now. Like I want a mixed friend group of five or six guys/women. How hard is it to find a group like that? Surprisingly, it’s very hard. 

I like to think I’m a decent guy, well articulated, mature, able to carry conversations... but sometimes it just feels like everyone has someone (or even people) but you and it feels like it’s this grand master plan that’s directed towards trying to make you think you won’t ever find your people."

I drink a lot alcohol, just to feel better, and i also know that this isnt the solution to my problems, but i just feel bad and it makes me feel better. He was a really important person in my life as i have almost 0 contact to my parents or in general to my family. I don't even know why i write it down here, i guess it's because i feel lost again. Why does everything has to be that difficult. Im 27 and i can't get into a relationship, because i feel like im different. I had relationships, but even then i felt alone somehow, it's so weird and frustrating. Why is it so hard to find people who really care about you.. Why is the world so fucked up. As i said before, i really don't know why i have to write it down here, i really think it helps me to write down my current problems. It gives me the feeling that there might be people out there with the same or even more fucked up situations. I had problems with drug addiction in the past, and i never want to go back to this. 3 times in hospital, only because of that.

lonely,I’m lonely,"I’m lonely - I lost my best friend a while back. We were so like minded and we both mountain biked and skied and chilled together, it didn’t matter what we were doing, we didn’t have to talk all the time, we were comfortable in silence. He moved away and now I live alone in a studio apartment and my girlfriend is my best friend. I love her to bits, but I’m still lonely. I have friends but I don’t hang out with them because I don’t feel a deep connection to them like my best friend, I don’t want to just chill or go over to someone’s house, it just doesn’t seem appealing. I’d rather be doing the same thing but alone. I joined a mountain bike club, and I really enjoy it, I have some new friends, but I don’t hang out with any of them outside of the club. I just want a best friend again, someone that I don’t have to tolerate being around, just thoroughly enjoy hanging out with them. My best friend is now across the country doing the best he has ever done, he’s totally change his lifestyle and I’m really happy for him, but I can’t help to be a little mad bc I’m all alone now. I’ve never had to try to find friends, they usually just happen because I was always surrounded by people whether that be the college dorms or highschool, whatever. But now, I live alone, in apartment building full of people who are like me, introverted and don’t want to associate with neighbors. I try to have fun, I do what I enjoy, like mountain biking, as much as possible, but it’s not enough. I need a friend to enjoy that stuff with. I don’t know how to find that friend. I’m just waiting it out and hope he comes along. But I’m sick of waiting. 
Thank you for reading, just had to vent, and if you have any advice, I’ll take it. Ik I just have to try harder, and put myself out there, do things that are uncomfortable, and try to make a stronger connection then just small talk. But it’s not easy when you’re introverted."

lonely,22 F West Yorkshire - Seeking A Connection (Mental Health TW),"22 F West Yorkshire - Seeking A Connection (Mental Health TW) - Almost every night I come on here (*sad, I know...*) in hopes to connect with somebody whether they be nearby or far away. Preferably would be nearby but at this point I don't care. The majority of people I've spoken with on both here and IRL are sex crazed maniacs or conversations that fizzle out after two to three days. I am tired of searching. Though I can honestly say, hand on my heart, that this is a search that I will never stop looking for. Maybe the internet not being the best place for it but this is the only place I feel comfortable with. Having severe social anxiety makes it almost impossible to leave the house.

lonely,Down in the dumps after a dose of affection,"Down in the dumps after a dose of affection - I’ve always been a lover of love and a hopeless romantic but this semester of college has been intense. I’m lucky enough to have a circle of friends to reach out to when I have a free day from studying my ass off but it often feels like our connections aren’t satisfactory for me, mainly because they are more invested in their significant others or other friends than they are with me (not to say that I don’t think I’m enough). Because of that, I don’t really feel like I have a “go-to” friend and these friendships feel more like a way for both of us to pass time when *I* need company. Relationships have never worked out for me either, usually because they have all been one sided with all the weight on me. I’ve been using dating apps to find someone but no luck. Basically, I’ve just been wanting to lose myself in someone, whether it be platonic or romantic.
Last week I was hopelessly swiping through Tinder and matched with a guy who was visiting in town and looking for a hookup. I hadn’t gotten laid in a while and he wasn’t from my school so I thought why not. He came over a couple days later and we had dinner and drinks before heading off to the bedroom. This hookup ended up being different to anything romantic or temporary I’ve ever had before (and I’ve been with many people). The sex was more intimate than anything I can remember ever having. The known facts of why it was probably like that was because I crave passion and he told me he hasn’t had sex in months. Anyway, it ended up making us super comfortable with each other and he dropped by once more before he left town after texting me he loved spending time with me. The way we showed physical affection and attention to each other made it feel like we’d known each other for a while and it felt fueled by emotion, not just sex. It could’ve easily been an act, but I felt an odd sense of genuine comfort and safety around this stranger and a mutual investment in each other both physical and emotional. It made me wish I had this affection and someone’s need for my time longer than just the two nights. We had trouble saying our goodbyes because we didn’t want the night to end and we really held on to those hugs and kisses as long as we could. When he got back to his place he sent a text about how amazing the night was, thanking me for it, and then he was gone.
Who knows what was going through his mind, maybe he was really into me or faking it to fulfill a similar need for an emotional connection, though temporary. Though I loved learning so many things about him, I can’t say I caught feelings for him, but I did for his attention and affection, especially because it’s something I’ve wanted for so long. Since that night, I’ve been super depressed, wondering why things like this happen to me for either such short periods of time or never. I just want a long term and genuine connection with someone based on the desire for each other’s attention rather than just to be social and pass time."

I get my 40+ hours a week in by working the other 4 weekdays. But I’m miserable in my spare time. I feel like I’m typing a similar variation of this thought every week, but what the fuck can I do to feel less lonely?

It doesn’t matter if I hangout with my friends once a week. Because in-between those times is a pool of nothingness. I have no calling in this life, whether it be personally or professionally. 

I wake up very early in the morning usually, so I’m already in REM sleep by 9 pm at latest. Pretty pathetic for a 23 year old. I’m so tired of depression that I really don’t want to live. I fucking hate my reality, and there’s nothing I feel I can do to change it given my Indecisiveness."
lonely,A Different Kind of Lonely,"A Different Kind of Lonely - It’s not that I’m alone, I actually am very fortunate to have many close friends and family members. What is troubling me is that I am nobody’s #1. 

Every single one, and I mean EVERY single one, of my close friends is in a serious relationship. So are my family members. I am the only person in my circle that doesn’t have someone. 

I’ve been single for over 3 years and I’m generally OK with it and enjoy my independence but the pandemic has seriously disturbed that peace. I live with 3 roommates, all of whom have significant others. I visit my family often, all of whom have significant others. For the past 7 months my only in person social interaction has been my family, my roommates, and their +1s. 

I cannot even begin to tell you how tolling it has been on my mental health. On top of dealing with the stress and anxiety that everyone feels during this time, I also have to watch my loved ones happy and in love. I have to live with the knowledge that they have someone to hold and talk to to feel a bit better about it all and I do not. It feels as though it’s being shoved in my face how single and alone I truly am. Of course I am happy they they’ve found their person, and truth be told I do enjoy the company of their S.O.s but it’s extremely challenging when you’re limited to your house to have that in your face 24/7. 

I’ve have countless panic attacks and anxiety ridden nights since the pandemic began agonizing over the questions, “what’s wrong with me?” or “why am I not good enough?”. I’ve spent entire days in bed listening to my roommates laugh and exchange with their S.O. while I sit and cry in solitude and silence. 

It’s a different sort of lonely when you’re surrounded by period, but still feel all alone."
lonely,"I made a form/site entirely dedicated to helping everyone get matched up with people taking into account their interests, preferences etc using 25 questions. Are you up for the challenge? :)","I made a form/site entirely dedicated to helping everyone get matched up with people taking into account their interests, preferences etc using 25 questions. Are you up for the challenge? :) - I've made a form to find friends where 25 questions are asked (most are multiple choice). And based on the answers you get matched up with other users.

We ask two things for each topic, (1) Your answer (2) Answers you want to be matched up with. So we ask about whether you want to voice call 📞, share pictures 📷, your continent 🗺️, your age, if you play games/books often, if you're studying or working and so forth!

This makes it super simple and quick to find people that both want to talk to each other. You are instantly shown matched people, and then you can send them a friend request, once they accept then contacts details are shared with the both of you.

Good luck everyone! Any questions please ask away :)

I try to work on the site as much as I can in my spare time, so you can expect new features to get released as well. If you're a designer, developer or think you can help with this - please get in contact it'd be great to have some help and feedback.

lonely,Hello there!,"Hello there! -  

Hello! My name is David, I am 20 years old and I am a student at State Petroleum University.  
I do love to learn languages - this is my big passion.  
A month ago I ordered something from an online shop and now I do play it every day. It makes sounds like magical water drops and it can literally make you feel nostalgic! Do you have an idea what this is? I can tell you or you can try to guess yourself!

I used to watch Netflix movies and sometimes I do it with my friend as a Netflix Party (well, now it's teleparty haha)  
I am not a real gamer, but sometimes I like to play some online games or very old offline. Recently I've been playing Among us, if you also enjoy this game, we can both try to find out who is The Imposter!  
I do not want to make you feel that I am a nerd or something. I can't tell for myself how active or talkative I am in a conversation, but I can make you sure that my friends find me funny. Believe them or not, it's all up to you :)

Why do I make this post?  
To be honest, I feel lonely in the last days. I've been locked in my house for the last 8 months, learning a new language. Now I can speak this language quite fluently but noticed that I have not that many friends and very little of them who I can really talk to.  
I won't say I am ugly or I have any issues that would make people pass by, not at all. Doing workout every day makes my body look athletic, one of the things that also makes me feel happier. Honestly, I used to be very popular in 10-11 grades of school. The thing is, that more than one year ago I decided to become a better version of myself. Self-improvement - that is what I found interesting to me more than walking out with people and drink some unhealthy drinks. I quit that, and now I feel better about myself and the things I do. But here's one more thing... now I feel lonely. Even those a few friends that I talk to can't always make me feel good, and they don't have to, though. They have their own lives they do live. I really appreciate their help and everything they try to do for me.

I am sorry I got off the track. I want to thank you for reading this! Feel free to chat with me, girl or boy it doesn't really matter. But the only thing I want to ask you about before you text - think twice if you'll feel comfortable chatting with me. I am a 20 years old student, so maybe if you're older or younger than me, we can look different at some things within our ages.

David."
lonely,I thought I wanted a touch or affection but it made me feel emptier.,"I thought I wanted a touch or affection but it made me feel emptier. - I've been feeling lonely for years ever since middle school started and throughout high school watching other people having fun with each other, sharing stuff together, laughing, supporting and stuff made me feel much lonelier. I kinda wanted what they have, the connection, the touch, the affection people have with each other.
Not saying that I didn't have that with my family at least not really, used to have a father who's been closest person I've ever been with.

Today having one of my classmates pat me on the back after having some small talk with him sorta made me feel sadder and emptier. I thought that I kinda wanted this. I thought that I'd be happy with that and it turns out that I kinda hate that feeling. I kinda think that I can't be with people anymore. I've been distancing myself a lot. Rejecting connection. I thought that I wanted to be accompanied but lately I feel like this is just hopeless and it brings me more sadness.

I don't know if a lot of people could relate probably some reading. Maybe being lonely isn't that bad once you're just always been lonely."

lonely,How do I start to cope with the fact that I’ll be forever alone?,"How do I start to cope with the fact that I’ll be forever alone? - This isn’t a pity party post so you don’t need to feel bad or offer kind words. I’m just trying to come to terms that I’ll likely be alone, relationship wise for the rest of my life. I’m an 18 year old guy who thinks that whenever I’m coming to terms with being lonely forever, there’s always something that makes me sad about it again. I’m not very desirable. I’m very ugly. I do have good hygiene and everything but I just have so many ugly characteristics that I can’t fix. I struggle with self confidence due to my looks. I’m about 6’ 2” 165lbs. Yes I know I’m thin. I never really got into weights because I can’t bring myself to lift alone. I do eat pretty good and I like to run instead. Overall though I’m not muscular and it’s obvious girls are into muscular guys so it’s not like I have that going for me. I’m more introverted and not super open about myself at first. Once I get to know a person then I’m more outgoing. I just tend to be more of a listener and laid back. I just have a more calm, respectful, chill demeanor when I meet them because I don’t want to be overwhelming and I like to get to know the other person first. It all boils down to the fact that I’ll probably never approach a girl first. I’ve been called ugly in the past, to my face. I just don’t like my chances at all if I were to ask a girl out. The thought of making myself look like a fool is not appealing to me. I know damn well that a girl will never approach me first. IF that ever does happen though, I know that they’ll have my full attention. If a girl were to show any interest in me, I’d be sure to try my hardest and make them feel special. I just probably won’t waste any time going out of my way to find a girl though. Like I said though, if a girl ever is willing to show interest in me, I’d give them a shot."

lonely,A Dark Secret?,"A Dark Secret? - So I'm a 32 yo M, married for 4 years and in the most toxic marriage imaginable. I got married partly out of a fear of loneliness, yet I've never been so lonely in my life. So I've decided that being alone is better than being in this horrific marriage, and I'm filing for divorce in a few months. I'm terrified about being single again even though the divorce won't make me *more* lonely, but I'll be just as lonely without an end in sight.

I've read many many posts in this channel and the common theme is for people to want to be loved. I want to explore the following from both male and female perspectives

1. For guys: when you say ""All I want is for another person to share my experiences"" or something to that effect, I'm curious to know how many women you find a little unattractive have you *considered* asking out?
2. For women: I'm very curious to know the female perspective on loneliness. Are you lonely despite being in a relationship (like me) or is it because you're single? If you're single, how many men have approached you in the last 1 year (that you've obviously turned down)?

TL;DR: I'm trying to explore how much of our loneliness is of our own making and how much is out of uncontrollable factors, and trying to get both female and male perspectives into this."

lonely,31 F Looking for Writing Buddies,31 F Looking for Writing Buddies - I’ve been pretty lonely for a few years now. As I’m getting older I’m finding it harder and harder to make new friendships. I thought one on one chats could be too much pressure when we are all strangers so I wondered if anyone would be interested in being part of a writing group? We could still chat about random stuff as well but I thought it could give us a starting point. I’ve not written anything substantial yet but I would like to complete a novel.

I have a bunch of contacts of people I used to talk to/random people I’ve met in life but you’d think with all these contacts I’d have people to talk to. In reality I dont. If I want to talk to people I go on my discord servers or reddit and chat with my internet “friends” who don’t even know my real name (because I’m paranoid they’ll doxx me or something). It’s sad that I live in such a big city (nyc) and I feel like a little fish in a ocean that’s just trying to keep up but still failing.

lonely,I have absolutely no one.,"I have absolutely no one. - I used to have quite a bit of friends throughout high-school. I always felt left out however, as we never really shared the same interests and I was always insecure about my weight, so I wouldn't put myself out there as much for fear of being judged. Teens can be brutal. So I kept myself in the shadows. My friends always wanted to smoke or drink and go to kick backs, while I had no interest in doing any of that. I'd much rather go to the mall or a theme park and hang out, no drugs or alcohol necessary. When my senior year came around I had to move to another city and school, I lost contact with my friends and everyone I knew. No one in my new school seemed to have an interest in talking to me, even after I tried. A couple people in my art class were awesome, but they all had their own friend groups so nothing came out of it other than just sharing the same class. I became a loner, I had my headphones in all the time and I hung out by myself on the stairs my entire senior year. I didn't even get to go to prom. I was supposed to go to my old high-schools prom but my friends stopped talking to me and they never updated me on the date or any other info.

Fast forward to today, I'm 21 years old and I still have no friends. Save for the two I knew from high school, whom I only hear from about once every three months. I have a boyfriend, but hes been doing his own thing and I rarely see or talk to him as he is always busy with work or he's out with his friends or family. I'm not really sure what to do anymore. I'm super lonely and it's been so long since I've made a genuine platonic connection that I don't even know where or how to even start. I avoid social media as everything that people post seems so be so disingenuous. I talk to people at work or school. But our relationships never go beyond just coworkers. It's just me and my cats...lol.

I have not felt genuine happiness or love in at least three years. Everyone says it will get better but it doesn’t. I am so fucking lonely.

I even used the opportunity recently to tell my friends and family that I’m just desperate for any form of happiness or affection or love and just get ignored or brushed off. I literally couldn’t say any more clearly how fucking miserable I am, but perhaps that’s what I deserve.

I am so sick of this. I am so sick of being here for seemingly no reason. I cannot see any difference I am making to anyone. I just want to love and be loved and I 100% objectively cannot ever see that happening for me now."

I am so depressed because of the title and the post below. It’s a direct copy of my post on r/depressed because I don’t feel like typing it up again
~~

I am 20M on leave from college and at home with family.

There is no love between my family and me. They love me, but they’re so oblivious to how much they hurt me; so much that I resent them. For context, my brother verbally and sexually abused me, and my parents are emotionally abusive and negligent.

All the people I care about were in college. No one even wants me in their home because of the pandemic. 

Last year, I spent Thanksgiving with my best friend, but she was seeing someone, which broke me. Thing is, she’s the one who cares about me so much and I do too. This year, being with her won’t happen (pandemic again). 

Christmas was spent at home where I was suicidal and had to call the Hotline. 

Can’t imagine them this year where we sit around the table, looking awkwardly at each other, eating mediocre food, and not having reasons to celebrate. 

I really want someone who loves me with me right now, but that will never happen. The Holidays this year are gonna suck."
lonely,Does anyone else always want to a relationship with someone whether it be a friendship or love relationship but keep pushing them away.,Does anyone else always want to a relationship with someone whether it be a friendship or love relationship but keep pushing them away. - I have a habit of pushing people away but its ironic because I don’t like being alone. I have friends and family that always try and contact me or interact with me but I always either don’t reply to them or make an excuse on why I can’t go with them. It’s weird because I just don’t interact back and I do this all the time and I’m really not enjoying being alone and I know I’m the cause but I don’t stop. Does anyone do this as well?

lonely,Letter to a woman I love,"Letter to a woman I love - I shouldn't love you, there's no point to it. But I cannot choose not to love you, it's a fixed element of my very being.

Ever since I saw you for the first time eight years ago, I knew you were on a league of your own, and from that point going forwards, getting to know you has only confirmed that hypothesis. 

It's not that you're flawless, though I may have put you on a pedestal from time to time, it's more that you are so mystifying that I cannot evade you.

I cannot choose to not love you. How can a person learn to unlove someone? I spent years of my life without you, and while they weren't bad years, and I was almost able to keep you out of my mind, it was dull, my life is colorless without you, it was just a monotonous mess, and there was this nagging feeling of what could have been.

And now you're back; and I shouldn't love you, I should avoid you, I should stop thinking about you, but you keep me on a loop, and while you know what I feel for you, and I know what you feel for me, I'm stuck in this spin, where I can't make a move, and I know you won't make a move, and the only choice left for me is to keep loving you the way I've been doing it for years.

You mean the whole world to me and I'm a fucking afterthought to you. I don't give a rat's ass if you love some one else or not, if it's just some platonic shit or not; I'd rather be that goddamn platonic lover and never physically be with you than being this fucking miserable wretch of a person, limping for some shitty breadcrumbs of love.

And also, you have the fucking gall to come back to me and try to just be friends? You dare to tell me that we have grown? Yes, I have grown as a person, and some things about me changed, but I can't fucking change the fact that I love you so goddamn much. I should be the one who leaves this time, I should just say ""Fuck it"" and throw it all to shit; but you know what? I can't even do it, because you haven't done jack shit to hurt me, it's just my fucking delusional unstable self that can't contain itself.

If this rant sounds too fucking passionate it's because I'm too fucking passionate about you, all my emotions go up to 11 when I'm exposed to you, you're my kryptonite, of all colors, all in one, my sadness turns to depression, frustration to fury, doubt to dread, joy to ecstasy, and I can't just be calm, I'm full of energy, euphoric, on the edge of collapse, on the verge of frenzy; full of contradictions, and devoid of answers"

lonely,You don't need a friend or any romantic partner,"You don't need a friend or any romantic partner - I have been a long time lurker in this subreddit and have seen many people longing for friends or partners in life and feel alone and sad because they don't have friends(I myself have social anxiety).  But here is something from me: I had Social Anxiety since I was in 1st grade. Never made friends due to this and when I thought I had a friend or two they all ended up bullying me. And over these 10 years with social anxiety I realized that I don't need friends nor any partner to bring me up.

I have one thing to say and that is if you think you need friends or relationship to build you up back and feel happy then you are wrong. I felt that I have wasted my childhood and had formed no memories what so ever, that when I grow up I would not even look back at my childhood. But if there is one thing that I remember clearly was the joy when I entered into physics and mathematics. Whenever I did physics or maths I never had this one negative thought about having social anxiety or being lonely.

Same goes for you, you don't need anyone else to build you up or make you feel warm, what you need is a passion in anything you like from gaming to gardening to studying theoretical physics. You don't need a bond of attraction between a bunch of other atoms to feel safe. Lonely people are the most emotionally strong people since we didn't have anyone to apply bandages on our wounds when we fell down.

There are many people in my class who can do physics far better than me at the same time being in so man relationships than I ever could in my life combined but that doesn't make me sad because I am doing the thing I like. I have placed physics and maths far above than other negative things in my life. 

I have my mom sitting in the other room feeling ill and thinking that she has COVID-19, but when I do physics these sorrow don't affect me. I would like people that are lonely to be the same, find a passion and work hard on it. Being alone had many negative aspects but if there is one positive aspect of it is that we get far more time than others to work on ourselves and make something better out of our lives. 

Remember our wings always look far less shorter than those who are flying. It is only until when you spread those wings outward and move out of the pit we realize how big they really were.

lonely,My friends feel like strangers,"My friends feel like strangers - I've had the same group of friends for years but I've been feeling very disconnected from them for a while now. I used to love them - I don't think they're bad people. However, they haven't changed much over the years while I've changed a lot (partly due to some personal issues) so I don't fit their dynamic anymore. Being around them makes me feel lonely - I used to try talk more with them and get closer to some of them (because I thought I was the one pulling away) but I've given up with that now. I get that drifting from people is a part of life but that doesn't make it any less painful, especially since it seems I'm the only one who drifted.

They barely feel like more than strangers to me now.

Some weeks it bothers me more than others. Overall, I've come to accept it. For me, it's difficult to make new friends (I guess because I've never had to make them on my own) and it's only gotten more difficult with the pandemic. It's hard to bring myself to let go of them because it's letting go of the past as well as the safety net they give me, separating me from really having no friends.

I'm posting this in hope of hearing someone's similar experience, or maybe some advice, or maybe just for some acknowledgment. Thank you for reading."

lonely,Things keep getting worse and I just want to be with someone,"Things keep getting worse and I just want to be with someone - I'm a 28 F and have never had a boyfriend. I've always told myself I still have time and I'll find someone, but these last few years, it's really started to hurt with how lonely I am. I told myself I was really going to try and get out more, but then Covid hit. I even tried online dating for a bit, but I couldn't get into it, so that ended up being a bust.

I've tried to put myself out there, tried to talk to people, but it's like it's not good enough, or I'm not good enough. I'm lucky if they want to to be just friends with me. Most of the time, I feel like I'm a bother and I'm just annoying them. What friends I do have, most live 1+ hrs away, and those that live nearby, we're not apparently close enough for me to be invited to anything.

Then 3 months ago, while I was working, my neighbor (30 m) comes in and starts hitting on me, calling me gorgeous and pretty, and going ""how does someone like you not have a boyfriend?"" No one has ever said stuff like that to me. No guy has ever called me pretty. He later messaged me on Facebook and added me.

He had been talking to my mom a lot, complaining about how his live-in girlfriend was mean to his kids, and how she was threatening to leave him because he getting called up for active duty. He did ask if I would go on a date with him, but I said no, because he had a girlfriend. I told him it wasn't because I wasn't interested in him as a person, but because he had a girlfriend and I was going to respect that. He then asked if I would go out with him if he broke up with her. I told him I probably would, but he needed to think about what he wanted, and he shouldn't ask me out again, unless he and her were no longer together, but to let me know what he decided.

He never replied to me after that, and ghosted me on and off for the next two weeks, even going so far as to ignore me in front of my own mother, but then would randomly talk to me about something. Then one day, his girlfriend comes in and buys a pack of condoms. If things were going so rough between them, why were they having sex? And if he wasn't interested in me anymore, why not say so? I was devastated and sent him a message asking what was going on. But then later he comes in, and my co-workers who checked him out said he also bought condoms. After a bunch of messaging later, he admits he and his girlfriend are going to work it out.

I was heartbroken, still am. He was just going to drag me along, never telling me anything. People tell me he was just wanting me for sex. And I'm pretty sure he was lying about being in the Marines. I've been trying so hard to get over what he did, trying to focus what a shitty person he is, and tell myself I got lucky and dodged a bullet. But it's hard, when I have to see him everyday, whether it's at home or at work.

Then the other day, he comes in and starts talking to woman that is his gf's stepmom. I couldn't hear the conversation completely, but there was something about an apartment and bedrooms and and just waiting to hear from somebody. And now I'm just...I don't know.

I feel so unwanted and broken. I don't know what's wrong with me, why no one wants to be with me. But at this point, I don't know why anyone would want to be with me either. What man wants an almost 30 year old woman, who's never been in a relationship, who's never been with anybody? High schoolers have more experience than me. There's nothing special about me. All the plans and ideas I have had never turned out. I'm so tired of trying, only to be constantly turned away. And I don't feel like I can talk to anyone. I have no one. Most days, I don't even want to get out of bed. All I want, is for someone to think I'm important to them. I want someone to get me flowers and to be by me, to wand me to be with them. But, it doesn't feel like that'll ever happen and I'm ready to just give up."
lonely,Notice how it's mostly men that are lonely?,Notice how it's mostly men that are lonely? - I wonder why honestly. What is it about women that make people want to be around them? Why arent both sexes equally desired for friendship? Are men just naturally programmed to desire women more than women desire men? Do women seek out women more than they do men? Does social media and media altogether sexualize women too much to the point that we're addicted to anything related to women?
lonely,I've lost hope.,"I've lost hope. - I realized a bit ago just how much I felt alien. I have a few friends, and I don't really feel apart of any of them. We have to be doing something in order for anything to happen. If we're just chilling, nobody talks to me at all. I become invisible it feels like. I feel like some of them just talk to me out of pity. I don't really have many people to really call my friend. I feel disconnected from them all. I've started hanging out with them less and less, which is making my loneliness worse. There isn't a point to bug people when they're just pitying you. I feel like a bother, so I just started backing away from them slowly. Now, all I have is 3 family members I can talk to and 2 friends who I could talk to. I don't have any plans for the future, and if I did, they probably wouldn't involve people being around me. I feel like I'm doomed to be lonely forever."

I am so alone and lost in this world. I am so tired of my life. I'm so tired of constantly working and never being able to enjoy anything I want. I know now I'll never be happy.

We dated for a year, she got better. I helped her find her self confidence and then she cheated on me. Fml

lonely,I want to be loved and wanted,I want to be loved and wanted - (F17 ) I have always felt that I would never be wanted by anyone . I have never been in a relationship or even talked to a guy . I’m so lonely and I know it sounds pathetic and desperate but I would really like it if I somehow met someone who will love me and be there when I need them the most. I am not physically attractive at all I have never gotten attention from any guy at all . I have been told things by guys that have deeply affected my heart like “ no one will ever want you “ “your so ugly who would date you “ Your so fat”. “ your a weird looking girl no wonder why you don’t have a boyfriend “ or “ if a guy dates you he has to be blind “ .I’m so ugly and horrible looking . I would want someone to love me and I always get ghosted .I’ve never been kissed or anything  and I would love to have that experience . I also know that I will be alone for the rest of my life with no one by my side . I have always thought that something was wrong with me for not having a boyfriend and that I am very odd looking .   I would really like to make new friends if anyone wants to chat :)

I’ve never had many friends in the first place but at this point I don’t have anyone to talk to except my family. I’m grateful we get along in general but  I want to talk to other people too. I haven’t seen any of my friends since March when school shut down. The two friends I do have aren’t responding to my texts and seldom ever text me first. I’ve signed up for a couple university clubs online but so far I haven’t got any response from any of them. I’ve joined some course group chats but people are only engaging in small talk. I’ve tried immersing myself in more hobbies and they temporarily boost my mood, but at night I feel sad and lonely again. Often I would sleep very late, such as 5 A.M., just so I could fall sleep during sunrise because I feel happier in the day. But this doesn’t help in the long run because I end up waking up late and wasting out on daylight. It also makes me even lonelier when I see groups of friends hanging out and having fun when I’m stuck at home most of the time. I don’t think my friends’ parents are willing to allow me to hang out with them for awhile too."

Giving my best opinion or advise, cheering for couples who made it. At the end of the day, it’s just me again and I don’t know if I’ll ever have someone for me just for once I guess. I’m used to helping people, supporting them and I like it that way however, I didn’t realized that I needed help too but I don’t know how. 

Anyways, cheers to everyone and keep safe. ✨"
lonely,33F Searching for human connection,"33F Searching for human connection - I feel as though I'm older than a lot of you and thus, logically have less in common. I'm not single and I have kids, but I'm still lonely.

I think most people are some degree of lonely. We all want to be heard, to be acknowledged, accepted and not condemned for being who we are and where we are in life. We need connection. We need to feel our soul is speaking with another soul, whether that be through a stranger, a friendship, or a significant other. We're all just yearning to feel that spark, exhilaration of connecting with a fellow human being. 

The best we can do is to keep searching."

It’s not like I get sad over him that much anymore, it’s more just a simple thoughts, like I kinda miss him, I wish I could tell him about this, I felt safe with him, I wonder what he’s up to, I wonder how he is.

I'm far from perfect myself, as is everyone. But living in a house with someone who doesn't even want to be with me, while also working from home at a new job and living in a town we just moved to kind of all adds up.

Am I really that bad?
I'm so tired of living with someone who has never held a steady job, is so resentful of me and outright tells me that she would go anywhere else other than be with me if she had anywhere to go. Yet then when I say I'll leave but continue to pay the rent she tells me I always leave....what do you want from me?!
Why do I even still want to be with her and marry her?!

Anyways, super lonely. If I'm not working I'm just sitting there fantasizing about making small talk with her or cuddling or just being happy to be with each other. 

I just lay on my air mattress and read the news and wait to fall asleep listlessly so I can work and then sit around again."

lonely,Why I Feel Lonely and Guilty,"Why I Feel Lonely and Guilty - I wrote this to help myself through my situation. I hope by sharing it that I could get some practical advice about how to better my situation. 

I was dealt a pretty good hand in life. It makes me guilty to say that in pretty much every category things have come easily to me. I am attractive, athletic, and muscular. I was born into a well-off, well-respected, loving family with a noteworthy name in the city I am from. I'll be the last to complain about any of these blessings but it is true that blessings sometimes carry a double edge.  

People judge me before they know me. Their preconceptions based off my name and my looks are that I am probably a douche for multiple reasons. I have to fight this by overcompensating more than most people. I have to be artificially quiet and overly humble. I can't tell funny stories about myself without them coming across as braggadociousness. I have high expectations from my family so have grown up heavily groomed. I don't want to embarrass my family/ hurt the reputation so everything I say is significantly filtered, which makes me feel boring. I also worry about the fake people out there who fake friendliness for proximity and favors. I have been hurt by a few. All of this adds up to me feeling repressed, unrelatable, and my keeping everyone at arm's length. Now its just built into who I am. I feel like nobody understands my situation, nobody knows me, and like people would just criticize me for complaining (which is fair). 

Also, if anyone had the perfect recipe to not be lonely, it's me. So I feel like an even bigger failure for feeling this way, given the cards I was dealt. 

Can anyone relate? Any advise?"

The song Anyone by Demi Lovato came on and I think for the first time, I realized this song perfectly describes me and my cycles of loneliness and my hopeless attempts to escape the loneliness. I'll explain \*with lyrics\*:

* *""Talked to my imagination. Confided into alcohol. ""*\- I'm sad and I try to tell myself that all will be ok which turns into more hurt which turns into me drinking because Mr. Tito has never left me lonely. This is also when I realize that I am in need of a fulfilling human connection and desperately wanting that connection. 
* *""I tried and tried and tried some more. Told secrets 'til my voice was sore. Tired of empty conversation. Cause no one hears me anymore""* \- Seeks connection. Connection made. Trying my best to maintain said connection. Giving all of myself, but being on a different page. Still, I'm optimistic. 
* *""Anyone, please send me anyone. Lord, is there anyone? I need someone""*\- Feeling like maybe I'm meant to have this feeling of loneliness for the rest of my life. This is usually when I go all in on the connection even though I know inside that I am headed towards more hurt. But maybe things will get better. 
* *""I used to crave the world's attention. I think I cried too many times. I just need some more affection. Anything to get me by.""* Things went to shit. Saw this coming. Anger. Pain. Disbelief that we are here again. Just want genuine affection. 
* *""I feel stupid when I sing. Nobody's listening to me. Nobody's listening.""* Why do I try when I always end up hurt in the end. STOP. TRYING. Sadness. Pain. Maybe I can drink until I figure out what's next.

Anyway, I'm going to pour another glass of wine and continue to cry. See if you can guess what stage I'm on. 

Check out the song if you get a chance. [Anyone by Demi Lovato](https://youtu.be/8ixVd8j_jv4) She is an angel."

It was cold, my parents went away for the weekend, and I spent all weekend in my house, sleeping, doing homework, or playing video games.  These kinds of days really show how lonely I am.

I text people, and I’m lucky if I get one word responses. I play multiplayer video games, but with no friends. And ever since all my sports were cancelled for the year, I have nothing to do with myself. The weather’s cold, so I can’t go for bike rides either.

So here I am, it’s 9:30 at night, and I take my dog out for a walk. The weather is so beautiful when it rains at night, at just the right temperature. 

Most of all, I wish I had a car so I could drive around. Maybe pick up some kids I know from school, and listen to my music. That would be heaven for me.

My only hope is that college will be better, but my SAT scores won’t allow me to get as much money as I hoped, and Idek if I’ll even go next year because of coronavirus.

And to think about how lonely I am, it’s embarrassing. I shut down when everyone left. And during the quarantine it only got worse as everyone began to forget about me. 
I just wrote a piece about how much i miss the people I had in my life but what’s worse is that I know they want nothing to do with me.

I haven’t hung out with anyone outside of my 2 friends and they don’t even have time for me anymore. I haven’t had any affection in almost a year, no hugs, no kisses, no compliments, nothing, and I’m certainly not getting any birthday wishes.

I wish things weren’t this way. I wish I could go back and prevent myself from making all of this.

I don’t want to waste anyone’s time anymore with a long, drawn out story that no one wants to hear — but between college, my dad slowly dying day-by-day, and the severe isolation and lack of physical human touch, I feel miserable. I know this is just another sad story in an ocean of them, but I guess at this point I don’t have anyone to talk to besides the void. 

It’s been a long time since I’ve ok. I know this sounds terrible, but everyone around me is getting to feel ok but me. I spend most nights crying myself to sleep in my bedroom, and most days barely being coherent enough to do all my classes online from bed. I’ve lost the motivation to GO to these classes in person even though I think I’d be doing better if I did. I’m surprised I’m still barely maintaining myself hygiene wise, my day pretty much just consists of showering, putting on clean clothes, brushing my teeth, and then spending the time im not in classes crying in bed. Most days I wonder why I shower though, it’s a drag to do it. 

I don’t know what my deal is. I’m not even a good person, I’m a terrible person. There’s a reason I don’t have friends or really anyone. But there’s some part of me that is glad I have nothing and no one because I feel it’s what I deserve. 

I feel like I’m drowning and there’s no one around to scream to. Even if there was, I don’t think I’d scream for help anymore. I don’t deserve it. Im a HORRIBLE person, I’m so messed up, I’m not coping with life.

I hate my life, but I feel like I deserve it so I am trying to be content with misery. I deserve this, completely, I know I do. I’m not looking for anyone to tell me I don’t, I know I deserve this. I’m not going to accept anything but hearing this as the truth. I can’t stop hating myself because why like myself when no one else does. No one wants to spend time with me, but it’s because I don’t deserve it. I’m too clingy and needy and I’m a messed up person. I’m tired, I just wish it would stop hurting so I could accept my misery."

I'd go to extremes just to get a pleasure rush. I'd go to shady places just to be surrounded by free attention so I wouldn't feel so lonely. But I still felt lonely. It just was medicated I suppose. Whenever I walked away, the pit returned accordingly.

I hate feeling alone. I hate feeling purposeless. I hate not being able to connect with people like I want to. I want to be loved but I'm afraid I might not be able to love back... I don't know... fucking is easy but it just brings me back to square 1 emotionally... a black hole of a soul.

I wish people actually saw something in me, but maybe it's because I fail to show myself as a person that I never really feel loved... I'm a simpleton but people expect intrigue and when I fail to show that, they lose interest... fuck that shit... why must I be so simple?

Because the the sky is always gonna be blue but you’re not gonna feel sad forever. 

I know phrases like “this too shall pass” or “your feelings are temporary” are super cliche at least to me but I think it’s cool that in Portuguese it’s literally built into the language that the state you’re in is temporary whether it’s that you’re hungry or you’re sad or you’re sick or you’re happy.

I hate weekends, because I never have anything to do on the weekends because I don't really have anyone to do anything with. Watching everyone go out and have fun just makes me feel so much lonelier than I usually do, and this weekend was really bad. Idk why. I cried a few times, but only small cries. I felt so sad, but for some reason I couldn't just cry like I wanted to.

Because I was so upset, I didn't really get any work done, and I was already behind on my classes to begin with. This weekend, I was supposed to catch up.

I'm in a sorority and I'm a new member. We had an event for new members yesterday, and we played a game there where some of us stood in the middle of the room, while everyone else stood in a circle around us, closing their eyes, and they would call out things like, ""touch a sister who believes in you,"" or something, and we'd go and tap three or four girls that believed in us or whatever.

Well, I don't know anyone here, so I just did there awkwardly in the middle of the circle while everyone around me was walking around laughing and smiling and making jokes. With each thing they called out, it became more and more clear that they weren't gonna call out anything I could move for. I started to panicked and felt like I was gonna cry. Eventually, I did and I ran out of the room.

This girl followed me out and asked me what was wrong. I said I didn't know anybody there and I was so lonely and this always happens to me and a bunch of other sad stuff. It was nice to talk to someone about that but I still don't feel like anything is going to change. Nothing ever does.

Today, I had a test in my statistics class that I forgot about. I'm so behind in my classes that I don't even show up to statistics and I don't do any of the homeworks cause they're not required. My roommate tutors for statistics though, so she helped me as best she could, but I was just so mad at myself and ashamed for letting this happen and stressed out about my classes that I wanted to self-harm. When the test was over, I went out and started hitting my arm with a hanger, but I accidently hit my ear, and I couldn't hear well for like the next half hour.

I had an appointment with a psychiatrist online right after to be assessed for ADHD. It was very rushed and she was rude to me the whole time and it just made me feel like I was dumb. She barely asked me any ADHD questions and immediately started asking me questions about depression, then she went more towards anxiety and essentially came to the conclusion that I have anxiety and I really, really, really don't think I have anxiety. The whole appointment was like 20 minutes and she asked me if I wanted to try medication and I said I didn't know, because I didn't even know if I wanted ADHD medication, let alone anxiety medication when I don't even think I have anxiety. The whole appointment was a waste of time and left me feeling like shit.

Immediately after it ended, I left the room and started crying. When I came back, I started crying again. My roommate asked me how it went and I said terrible and that's when she realized I was crying. I told her what happened and she said that lady was stupid and that I'm not dumb, and then I kept crying for like two hours. When she was done with her class, she gave me a hug, and my other roommate did too. It was honestly the first time in my life I really genuinely felt cared about, and it kinda made the whole thing feel better.

TL;dr I had a few bad days, idk if things are gonna get better, but I got some hugs and people care about me so it's okay :)"

lonely,Is this what grief feels like?,"Is this what grief feels like? - Ive gone through it before. Ive felt it, through every moment in those times where i truly disliked myself. It’s irrational, because I’ve worked extremely hard to finally come back from /that/ place and i’m glad... but I’m back there? 
It feels different this time. I feel completely alone. No one, outside of my family, love me.
It’s wild to feel so utterly traceless. 10 to 0.
I also predicted that it would end like this. You with every single person that we loved.
And me, all alone.
...
The worst part is realizing, those people we loved didn’t love me back...
*clears throat*
I’ve accepted I’ll be absolutely alone for the rest of my life, but I refuse to let it bring be back there.
Ive cried these past few days for straight hours, sobbing all my...grief out. Accepting my unfortunate truth.
I’m done crying tho.

lonely,"If I didn't have a job, I probably wouldn't speak to anyone","If I didn't have a job, I probably wouldn't speak to anyone - It feels like, the only people I actually have any communication with are the customers I serve at work. Not sure if the occasional ""hi how are you?"" and then taking a payment counts as a social interaction but it's pretty much the only time I speak to a person during my day. There is a little old man who comes by my work sometimes and stops to chat to me. That always makes my day and I get legitimately excited to see him.

Any other people I do talk to will only talk if I talk first. I feel like the one person I do have regular contact with is now tired of me.

I'm feel just  so horribly and painfully isolated, to the point where a terrible customer service job is the only thing that makes me feel like I get any human interaction. Without that I would probably lose my mind"
lonely,Trying to help a little bit.,"Trying to help a little bit. - Here is a quote from one of my favorite movie

 ""There was once a true love I had, but I did not treasure her. Only when I lost her did I feel regretful. It was the most painful thing in this world. If the Heavens can give me one more chance, I will say ""I love you"" to her. If there has to be a time limit to this love, I hope it to last 10,000 years.""

Now replace some words, like how he say love and instead use your life. Basically interpret it like this

You once live a life you had, but you didn't really treasure some things in your life. Only when you lost it or think back to those moments, when you could had did something, you feel regretful. It was the most painful thing in this world. If you were giving one more chance, you would change your life for the better.

I hope this help, I try to interpret it in a way to relate to us. Have a safe great day, take care, and I wish you guys the best of luck! :)"

lonely,"I just wanna tell my story to people that would understand, I'm not even looking for an answer at this point","I just wanna tell my story to people that would understand, I'm not even looking for an answer at this point - Hello there, fellow lonely hearts. Or heart. Or no one, I mean I'm just assuming this won't be seen as with other posts I made. But I doesn't matter. I just want to get things off my chest. I hope it will help, many people say it does, but hey, what could go wrong if is suddenly tell my story on a social network? Nothing much more, I suppose.

Let's just begin with the obvious. I am quite sure to have depression. I don't know what kind, nor how serious. I stopped going to a psychologist some time ago because it did nothing but help, but before we stopped she told me she was pretty sure that I had depression, and I looked around and it seems that I have severe signs of depression and anxiety and stress. But I haven't been diagnosed, so I don't really know. I also might have myself. There's a quote from a French song called ""somewhere else"" (written by two brothers that rap, it talks about suicide) and that goes ""I don't want to be myself, but I don't want to be anyone else either"". That's how I feel. I don't want to exist at all. Or just forget everything and start from new. Or i don't know. I don't fucking know.
I feel like I don't fit in this world, I feel like I hurt everyone, including myself and that it would probably be the best for everyone for me to just... Disappear. The only things keeping me here are my friends and my music. I love classical music, especially, I must admit, Franz liszt.
I have talked about my stress a bit higher. Let me just say that... I feel like I was tied to the end of a train and I am forced to run after it. And if I can run anymore, I'm dragged along anyways. I'm pretty sure school shouldn't feel like that. Also I regularly have something at school, or everywhere actually, where my mind can't control the input anymore,and then every sense just seems to attack me. Like really. Attack me. All the sounds are so loud, every sensation is amplified and it fucks me up. Also I've recently found taste in carving lines with my pencil into my arm. It hurts a bit, but I'd ont know. It releases some of my agressiveness towards my hated self. I had stopped some time before because of my neighbor in class, that girl who randomly appeared in my life, who started hugging me and now I'm addicted, I have to admit. The problem is that I have a girlfriend. Or I'm supposed to. That's a problem of its own. We barely talk, we saw each other some weeks ago, and left ike I could hug her was 10 weeks ago. And there are so many problems more. I feel touch deprived, because I try to not hug the girl too much, I think I'm seriously annoying her. But I think I'm slowly falling for her. And now idk what to do with my relationship. Or with anything. 
Have i talked about my anger yet? How angry I am, so much that I could actually punch a wall until I broke my entire hand, or that I could just.. I don't even know. Just angery stuff.
I just feel fucked up. Sad, depressed, angry, maybe in love, confused. I can't take it much longer...

Have a good time folks. Good luck to anyone reading this.

Thank you for having read through it., I wish you well"

lonely,Catch 22s of depression,"Catch 22s of depression - 1) You are lonely because you are depressed and depressed because  you are lonely. 

2)They say reach out to friends and family but if you reach out too often then you won’t have anyone to reach out to. 

 3) When you try to reach out people don’t answer your call then they wonder why you didn’t reach out before you attempted suicide. 

4)You are not a burden but dealing with your depression can be burdensome to loved ones. 

5) If you’re chronically depressed you should work on yourself a little before trying to reach out so as to not overburden people but if you don’t reach out for long enough you will have lost your support system. 

6) Once you have lost your support system you have the option to find a new one but you are depressed and fear abandonment. 

7) When you are low income you’re only option for therapy is someone with questionable credentials that will push whatever medication that they get perks for prescribing you whether that medication was designed to treat it or not. 

8) Even if you find a therapist who says they are willing to do a more holistic treatment and accepts Medicaid after a few sessions they will refuse to see you if you don’t take medication.

lonely,I'm not sure what to do next,"I'm not sure what to do next - Only today did it hit me that I'm feeling lonely. I've always been good at talking to people, making friends ect. so I guess it hadn't crossed my mind that maybe the reason I'm feeling so empty is because I just have nobody to talk to.

For context, I'm a 17 year old guy living in the UK. Due to depression and anxiety I ended up completely dropping out of school early this year, and I've not kept in touch with people there due to drama. I definitely don't want to try getting back in touch with most of them anyway: they're assholes. I've kept myself busy online, keeping a good presence in communities on discord, and I've just started an undergraduate course at the Open University (i.e. studying is entirely online). From the outside, I look better than I've been in years, but I don't feel any better. Reading a post on r/AskReddit this morning made me realise that that's probably because I've got nobody to talk to not on a screen. 

Fine, I've got people I can laugh with over a voice call, and then my family here, but that isn't the same as having friends I can see in person. I find myself longing for someone other than my mum to just give me a hug or something. Problem is, I don't have anyone right now. My colleagues at work are all at least 5 years older than me, and due to the nature of the Open University, there are few students on my course who are both around my age and live near me. I don't have any other way of really meeting anybody new right now, especially with COVID about.

I guess my question for you guys is, what would you do? I'm not majorly introverted or anything, I actually really enjoy talking to new people, my problem is that I don't know how to meet them.

Cheers :)"

lonely,Modern Day Boo Radley,"Modern Day Boo Radley - I feel like a ghost when I’m out in public. I’m 6’4” and well built which you would think would get me some attention but it doesn’t. I keep my head up and eyes looking around hoping to catch someone’s eyes and feel a connection with them for even a few seconds but it never happens. People avoid me like they would a leper.

On the rare occasion that someone is forced to acknowledge my existence (those in the service industry mainly) and make eye contact with me; I’ve noticed that without fail they will give me this wide eyed expression of surprise/fear. Mainly fear though. There’s just something about my eyes that inherently makes people afraid of me. Maybe they can sense the deep abyss of loneliness that lies just behind them.

With every passing year my sense of depersonalization and existential angst grows. Sometimes I swear that I’m already deceased and I just don’t know it yet. Maybe it’s the stench of decay wafting from deep within me that fills others with dread. 

I know people say you can always change yourself and become sociable but I don’t believe that. I’ve tried to reinvent myself so many times, to work on myself and my issues in order to be desirable to other people but it’s never worked. Honestly, I’ve always been this way even when I was a young child. There’s just something completely broken about my personality that I’ll never be able to change. The cement of my being dried along time ago and there’s no change possible now.

lonely,I wish I wasn't lonely.,"I wish I wasn't lonely. - I wish I wasn't so lonely all the time, it's hard to go about my day without feeling empty, and I find that very troublesome. I'm not good with words, talking to new people makes my hands shake and my stomach gets filled with too many butterflies for it to be as nice as stories describe it-- but even with that being said, I really want to communicate with people more. Its been years since i've talked to people aside from my family and I don't want to end up going crazy. 

I keep overthinking about the things I say and how much I say, often wondering if my messages are too long or if they're too dry, after all i've been told that i'm as dry as a stale piece of bread. I despise myself so much because of this process of overthinking, how do I expect myself to rid this loneliness without communicating with people? 

Some days I don't bother thinking about how alone I am because there's not much for me to do about it, but there's days where it bothers me most above all things and i'd end up feeling a mixture of irritating emotions to the point where I pull at my hair. some days, looking at stars in the night sky makes me feel dreadful because i've seen them for over a hundred times and I have ended up forgetting why I ever liked looking at the stars. 

What is so beautiful about this life? I wish I could remember.

Help"
lonely,I wish i had someone :'),"I wish i had someone :') - (M17) I am so lost, i recently was lead on by a girl that i thought i would be able to one day call mine. I had genuine feelings for her and she crushed them when it mattered most. The feeling of being able to express my love and affection for someone, sounded lovely. I just wish i could have someone to talk to, vent to, someone i can be there for. All I've ever wanted was to be there for someone, and someone there for me. Im afraid this loneliness is making me struggle to be healthier and happier. I want love."
lonely,Life would be so much easier if I could just care less...,"Life would be so much easier if I could just care less... - Would I care about the fact my death would impact my family? No!

Would I care about that little optimist in me that has some aspiration to continue and succeed in life? No!

Would I care about the fact that suicide would be wasting my life? No!

Then I could finally just end it all without caring too much."
lonely,I don't have any friends.,"I don't have any friends. - And despite joining Reddit to make friends I still don't have any. People ghost, don't reply to what I last said, or it all just goes south.

I just feel like it's pointless to even bother anymore despite not having posted at least once on every possible friend making subreddit. Maybe this format of making what is essentially a wanted ad for friends might not be for me. Or maybe I haven't met the right people yet.

I feel like maybe I made a mistake by waiting so long (over a year) to try and make friends again since I've gotten use to the solitude and just functioning without company. On the other hand I think maybe it was a good idea to wait because there's no way in hell anyone on here would want to deal with someone who was struggling to get over a romantic interest who has untreated BPD. 

Aspergers doesn't make this any easier because I just figure whatever and can go back to what I was doing before this which was just getting other things done. Making a post like this just feels pointless but at the same time I can't go through life without any friends."

lonely,angry at myself,"angry at myself -  when I see my classmates hanging out with each other, I can't help but feel a tinge of jealousy. I want to hang out with them, but at the same time, I don't want to. I'm so used to my life (staying at home and doing nothing) that I'm not open to any sort of change.

I'm angry that I'm not open to change, angry that I'm me. I hate how I want to have friends, but every time someone asks me to eat with them, I turn them down. I'm angry that all this frustration could be easily replaced with happiness if I just changed a little."
lonely,emptiness,"emptiness - this might sound a little pathetic but really, there's not a single person who I can tell my feelings to without feeling uncomfortable.

I've never really had any close friends, just some that stayed for a few months. no one who I really expressed my feelings to. my mother has been encouraging me to talk more about my feelings but I can't bring myself to do it. even the person from my class who I used to text every day. our conversations have been rather... empty... these days.

I'm left with a feeling of emptiness, frustration and a tiny bit of regret. i hope some people can drop some comforting words here, just so I can feel a little better. i'd really appreciate it! thank you!"

lonely,I get that we’re lonely but are you at least at peace....within?,"I get that we’re lonely but are you at least at peace....within? - I was just sitting here thinking to myself, like damn yea I wish I talk to more people, or had some genuine ppl in my corner, or at least a few friends, but when I think Of it in this time, I’ve gotten to know me more, stop doing things I don’t like, finding interest in other things, reading more...saving more, and just at peace. When Drama does come in my life and I have no one to tell I just write down what I feel good instead of telling ppl then wishing I didn’t tell them once I calm down. I guess I can say my loneliness doesn’t just come from lack of friends but also family, parents deceased, siblings don’t act like siblings, so I just feel alone most of the times but I’m starting to be ok with that. I don’t look forward to anybody texting me,nor anything....I just don’t care. I can say I’m happy with my life right now but I do plan to be more social and I guess smile more(ppl say I look unapproachable☺️) next year is gonna be great for me, and I’m only saying next year and not next month because I’m currently a stay at home mom due to COVID but come New Years I decided to send my babies back to school so mommy can go back to work. Hopefully my plans stay the same.

lonely,I'm feeling betrayed,"I'm feeling betrayed - So I() have this one really close friend or that's what I think so, she(19M) and her group of friends who mutually linked to me are going out to places and for rides without inviting me even once. Another guy who's just our age and not so close, gets the opportunity to roam with them but not me. That's my question. When I asked her why she's ignoring my text... She says that she was depressed but she's clearly lying as on the others social she was spotted having a cozy time with them. I don't know what I'm feeling after all of this."

lonely,Not no friends but it feel even worst.,"Not no friends but it feel even worst. - Let me explain... I'm Celia F15 and I'm transfem.
So I'm born in a boy body (let's call this boy A), and when I was 10 I started to feel better when I'm a girl. Because of CEN (Childhood emotional neglect), depression, social anxiety and some other things, I played A everytime I was in public. I made friend, but they were friend with A. With the time, my personality get really far away from A's personality. 4 month ago, I came out to A's friends and to my family, and they had exactly the same reaction : ""we don't care of what you are"". They said to me that they make research about transgenders but they never asked me my pronouns and my name. I tell them I was hiding who I was. I sent them 2 full pages to explain to them that I'm Celia, I'm a girl, etc... But they didn't read them and they said that they read them .So to summarize the situation, I'm hiding behind the personality of someone I'm not even to the people that know it, just not to be destroyed by them.

(Sorry if my english is sh*t)
What should I do now... ?

Thanks a lot if you take time of your life to read a part of randomone's life. Thanks too if you just read a piece of it."
lonely,"Being 17 with no friends finally hit me, and it hurts.","Being 17 with no friends finally hit me, and it hurts. - I guess being alone in my room during this whole pandemic started to take a toll on me. I never really cared that I had no friends at all and that I always wanted to be alone, by my self, and wanted no one to talk to me at all. But being alone for so long, stuck in my room for hours sitting in my chair playing video games and browsing reddit made me more depressed than ever before. And for once I actually felt being lonely. But the fact that time is ticking and im almost turning 18 and i know for sure my parents arent gonna keep me around for much longer with no where to go, no one to talk to, and no one to look up to. And to top it all off, the need to finally start dating people (which i know damn well i cant rn). I have never felt this way, and i spent the last 3 years alone in high school without making any friends at all, i would just to go school and stay mute for the entire day until it was time to leave and i didn't care at all that i was alone and actually liked that i was. But now things have changed. The amount of time i spent in my room thinking about my future and life choices made me realize that this whole ""staying alone"" thing wont help me reach my goals and become the person that i want to be. Just thinking about all the time i wasted makes me feel so disappointed in myself for how much time i wasted, so many opportunities missed, and many good people i could have met. Its hard for me to move forward now, i just keep on thinking about how life could have been if i just opened my mouth and decided to start meeting people. Now here i am typing this at 2:11 am, school tomorrow, no friends, no time, and frustrated that this is what i set myself to become."
lonely,Guess my grief is no big deal,"Guess my grief is no big deal - I'm set to lay my grandfather to rest in a few hours, and instead of at least making sure I'm ok, my girlfriend is busy playing a game with her new friends. A game that used to be something special with just us two. Time was I had to practically beg her to play. Now she's got no time for me because she's always playing with them. 
Normally that would be fine. I don't ask her for much. But right now that I'm hurting and grieving, I just can't believe she is so clearly putting me last. We've been together for a long time now and this is probably one of the most hurtful and upsetting things she's done. 

I don't have any friends of my own and my family is all feeling the loss, too. So I really have no one to talk to about anything right now because the one person I thought I did have is too busy with people she's known a month to make sure I'm doing ok. It's just not a good feeling and I guess I just needed to get this off my chest."

lonely,I'm Going To Carolina In My Mind,"I'm Going To Carolina In My Mind - The [original song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRIhSrWFeWM) was about a guy homesick for his home state, but for me, North Carolina was always a dream I had. Every winter, I went to Raleigh to spend time with my relatives and I had an unbelievable amount of fun. I loved spending time there and I fell in love with the beautiful nature of the state and the climate.

I keep dreaming about going to Carolina in my mind to keep my mind off how sad my own life is. If I ever try to think about what really is going to happen in my life, I just start crying because I know things will always go downhill. My life is so pathetic and meaningless right now, and I have nothing to live for. Nobody talks to me, and I don't talk to anyone else because there's nothing to talk about. I live the most boring, depressing life in existence, and I have no reason to interact with any other people because I have nothing to contribute to any conversation. That's why I just stay alone in my room working nonstop and daydreaming about living in my own North Carolina. Obviously I'm not really talking about North Carolina specifically, but I just daydream about being a better person who actually has the motivation to pursue relationships or friendships instead of just sitting alone every day living as an empty shell of a person. 

I just feel so empty. There's nothing to live for because I don't believe my life will get better. All I have to live for is what's in the moment, and all I have is work. The only reason I'm doing work is so that I can be better prepared for a better life in the future, but if I don't even believe I can ever live a happy life, what's the point? I think about an alternate version of myself who's living a happy life in Carolina or some other beautiful place. That's the only way I can be happy, but I know I could never be that person in my life. 

If I had any booze I would be drinking it right now to wallow myself in sadness. However since I don't have any, I'm just left conscious and alone with my thoughts yet again. The only option I have to avoid just thinking about depression, existentialism, and suicide is just to daydream about going to Carolina in my mind."
lonely,School,"School - It's hard to be at school, again. If I say something, I'll be met with a ""what do you want"", ""why are you talking"", and another stuff which I cannot translate. Besides, loneliness and other problems, I had to be careful at grades, and it's hard to concentrate when you're lonely and sad. I want to cry, but people would see me doing. When I hear that other classmates talk, and go outside in the weekend, I become sad again. I write this as I can't hold it I my mind anymore."
lonely,How is it possible to have a good friend group and still feel lonely?,"How is it possible to have a good friend group and still feel lonely? - I understand a lot of people don’t even have friends and I’m fortunate to have them but I can’t figure out my feelings so I turn to the internet to help me.

About three months ago, I went through a breakup with my girlfriend of 16 months, and ever since then, I’ve been feeling worse and worse as the days go on. It feels like just a void of empty nothingness, and it’s especially prominent when I’m by myself. I just want that feeling again. Having someone who loves you completely is amazing. And now that love is gone it’s just been a downwards spiral.

I’m not going to blame coronavirus isolation for this, because frankly I have a really good friend group of friends that I hang out with. I’ve been with this group ever since my freshman-sophomore year of college and some even are from highschool. We share drinks and do all the stuff that you’re supposed to do in college. But as soon as I go home for the night, all these feelings return.

I’m just sad. Maybe im trying to cope with not having the high level of connection that I shared with my girlfriend. I don’t know how to feel. On one hand I can hang with my friends and forget about everything around me, and on the other hand, it’s sadness.

I’ve tried dating apps but I’ve never used them before, and I’m not quite sure how that culture works. Matches are few and when I do get one, the talking and texting never makes it past a day or two.

Anyone have advice for me? I appreciate anyone who has time to respond.

TL;dr: I feel lonely even though I have friends and I’m struggling to cope with it."

lonely,All my friends have made a group against me,"All my friends have made a group against me - I can’t share too much but basically one person who I considered my best friend, I found out has always been jealous of me. A certain situation came up and she took advantage of it and long story short she took all of my friends. Like literally all. I wish I was exaggerating. I have absolutely no friends. They all comment and post on each other’s Instagram, tag on FB, Snapchat, hang out, etc. And some of these friends didn’t even know each other before but somehow they have all become close friends and kicked me to the curb. I know this means they were never my friends to begin with but can you blame me if I say I feel really lonely, jealous, confused, angry. It honestly hurts. I feel so alone. It’s making me go crazy. 

I’m in college and because of covid making new friends isn’t going to be easy, more like impossible tbh. I’m not trying to get pity. I just want to know if anyone has ever been at this point in their life. I feel really lonely with no friends and to see all of my old friends be so close to each other. It hurts :("
lonely,Mixed signals,Mixed signals - She doesn’t want to give me any mixed signals as we go thru our rough breakup. Remind you that I live with her still atm. But she doesn’t want to confuse me during my stay. She’s just so casual about being half naked but doesn’t want to do anything sexual. She told me earlier that she was off her period and was “wet”. So she wanted to have sex right? As soon as I try to do anything she said stop so I did. Then tells me she just doesn’t want to give me mixed signals or confuse me. What I literally got my hopes up thinking I was gonna get it after a good while. It just kinda hurts that she doesn’t want my slong after she told me she wants mine specifically. Fml
lonely,I’m the most successful of all my friends but I’m also the loneliest,"I’m the most successful of all my friends but I’m also the loneliest - I’m 21. I know I’m young. But dating the last few years has been nothing but a revolving door of horror stories. I graduated college a few months ago and I already have a well paying job in my field, I’m moving into my own place soon,I run my own business, I invest in the stock market, I’m about to buy my 2nd car, and I have a nice sized saving account. LIFE IS PERFECT well for the most part. I haven’t been in a committed relationship in a few year. All my friends are dating or happily committed to one person but I’m single with no interest. I know I don’t need a man in life but I miss companionship. I miss having someone to talk to at the end of a long day, I miss going on date and getting cute, I’m miss getting excited to see someone. My last relationship broke my heart into pieces and although I still love him, I want to move on. But that’s hard to do when I’m not dating. I just pray that I find the person for me and I don’t mess it up. I just want to settle down with my special someone. Maybe it’s me."

lonely,I just needed to vent.,"I just needed to vent. - I feel like the only reason I haven’t ceased my existence myself yet is because it would make my parents upset. Life has been kicking my ass, beating me to a pulp and gauging my eyes out with a rusty spoon. I’m not the type of person who can deal with this stuff by myself. I used to talk to a lot of people but once I realized I was always the one to initiate conversation I decided to stop and see what happened. Low and behold I don’t talk to anyone at all at the moment. I want to keep up the image that I don’t care but it honestly really gets to me. Idk it’s made me realize that I’m not that good of a person if that many people that were my “friends” forgot I exist. One “friend”(know for 2 years and I thought we were close) moved away and it’s been about 9 months. My birthday just recently passed and I got texted happy birthday from my family. Friend flew back up to the state for a weekend . Idk why but it really hurt my feelings when I saw him post”I had to visit all the homies” yet I wasn’t included. I get really envious of other people’s friendships. Iv tried to branch out and make friends of my own but I don’t have the self confidence to do so. I weight 209 lb and I’m 5’9”. I really dislike my body and I’m trying to change my self but I know I’m not giving it my all. I’m hoping that losing weight will boost my self confidence. Iv lost a lot of motivation to do basically everything. I used to me on top of my classes and did well at work and saved up a bunch of money. Now I skip about 40% of my classes and do close to no homework. I want to change my behavior and do better at school but I don’t think I can. This all comes full circle to my parents. They have such high expectations for my. They want me to be happy, get a good job and live a good life but I don’t think I can do that. I lie to them all the time about what I’m doing with my life because I too ashamed of what a shitty son they have. If I could put an end to myself and I knew for 100% certainty that it wouldn’t upset them I would do it to make their lives easier. Thank you for coming to my yearly let all my feeling out for the night and then bottle them up for the rest of the year talk. Thank you"
lonely,"I’m lonely, even when I shouldn’t be","I’m lonely, even when I shouldn’t be - My whole life I haven’t been the most popular, but I have a handful of friends. But since COVID and starting college I have had less social interaction with them than ever before. And when I finally do meet my friends, I feel as if I’m not there like I am a shadow. I’m now in my second year of college and I have made no new friends and all my old ones are slowly vanishing away. I’ve never had a relationship either, while I see all my peers having the times of their lives. I just don’t how to make connections with people, and the longer I lack them the more depressed I become. Sorry for ranting and thank you for reading, I just had to get my emotions off my chest. I hope we all find happiness someday."
lonely,I'm not lonely when I'm alone. I'm lonely when I'm dealing with other people.,"I'm not lonely when I'm alone. I'm lonely when I'm dealing with other people. - This may sound contradictory to some of you, but it really isn't contradictory at all. When I'm alone, I don't have to deal with anyone. I feel much better and less stressed when I have to deal on my own. When I'm around other people, I just don't have that. Real life, online, I can't get along with anyone. I never had a real friend, I was never close to anyone before. 

The ""friends"" I had during school were pretty much acquaintances, nothing more. Once I left them, I never saw them again. I've transferred to like 5-6 schools throughout my lifetime and there hasn't been a single person that I could relate to or have no sorts of arguments with them whatsoever. Everyone goes along well in one single group and when I'm next to that group, I'm the one who talks the least. Or rather I'm the one who doesn't talk at all. I was always the one who gets isolated, ostracized, mocked, bullied, and hated by others.

Online is a similar thing. These past of couple of months/years, I've been dealing with similar things as to how I was dealing with in real life. Everyone getting along with each other, I'm the one being isolated, ostracized, and mocked by others. When I tell them something, they just get confused and don't understand my point of view because it doesn't relate to theirs.

I hate all kinds of positivity, happiness, optimism, fun, excitement, love, kindness, politeness, empathy, sympathy, whatever. They just feel so ingenuine, uncomfortable, and unnecessary. I'm not getting the purpose here at all, it makes no sense to me whatsoever. I need a clear-cut reasoning as to why people prefer positivity and happiness over anything else.

Everyone keeps telling me that I'm playing the victim and make up excuses. I'm doing none of that, I'm just telling the truth as always. As Plato used to say, ""No one is more hated than he who speaks the truth."""

Any one I date now is either wanting a quick fuck and nothing else, suddenly realized they aren't ready to date because of their ex, or dps me for their ex within a couple weeks. 

I have sat and swiped right on everyone on tinder for 15 minutes before, only getting matches on bots or extremely overweight people (I'm no skinny person, but I'm talking arms the size of my calves). I don't mind women my size or even bigger, I truly don't, but a 75 pound swing is a lot to ask.


The last person I really clicked with on Hinge had a sudden panic attack and decided she wasn't ready to see anyone (this was after almost getting back with her ex the previous day, then saying no to him) and blocked me. It's not that I blame her, it's just my luck.


My previous serious relationship left me for someone half a country away, telling me she never actually loved me.


My friends all abandon me, and the ones that stick around don't have the desire or energy to do anything with me. 


My family can barely muster a fuck to give.


I have a wonderful daughter I am barely present for because I'm in a fog of loneliness, trying to figure out what the problem is. I have Asperger's, but I know I mask well. I'm emotionally open and honest, I try to never lie to anyone, I never push for anything from a dating prospect, wtf is wrong with me?


Someone out there relate? Anyone figure it out? Am I just too far removed from neurotypicals?"
lonely,Feel alone without my truck (kinda breakup post),"Feel alone without my truck (kinda breakup post) - Hey everyone, this isn't your normal lonely post. I feel lonely in general, but this one hits me way harder than most lonely feelings. I recently lost my truck. I never thought I could feel this way about a vehicle. We spent 14 amazing months together, had so many amazing times together, all-in about 10,000$ with all the upgrades I did, into this 2001 truck, with 220000 miles. Did great in every weather, sun to blizzards, and everything in-between. Never let me down. It got some issues that I thought were too expensive to fix, and sold it, and bought another vehicle. No matter how great this vehicle is, it will never compare to my truck. I've been looking every day for the same type of vehicle, but I know deep down that it will never be MY truck. I know that this isn't nearly as bad as most of the posts in here, but I genuiy feel lost. I get in my new vehicle, and it feels like I'm borrowing someone else's car. It's not mine, even though I own it. It will never be mine. It's honestly worse than any breakup I've ever been through, even after 3+ year relationships. Like I said, its not as big as some of the posts here, but it's the biggest emptiness I've ever felt in my heart. I'd do anything to get it back. At 19 years old, and 220000 miles, I'd still pay more for it than a brand new truck, all shiny off the lot. As simple as I can put it, I'm lost without it. My entire life hasn't hasnt been the same. Hasn't been happy"

lonely,I've started drawing social situations as a replacement for real life interaction,"I've started drawing social situations as a replacement for real life interaction - I'm weary of over sharing on the internet but here i am doing just that. So I like to draw elves and anthros interacting with eachother and basically just living their daily lives amongst eachother in this weird fantasy world Ive created, which is a lot more beautiful, interesting and close knit than the real world. I placed myself in this world to in the form of a demon character that is like an exotic, more dramatized version of myself, in this world I have a big fancy house on a private island, a hubby and children, and numerous animals including swans, ducks and gryphons (half bird half lion). I post my work to Reddit if anyone is interested in seeing.

I'm on the autism spectrum and I suffer from psychotic episodes. I do this because I have a lot of trouble forming relationships with people or even being in their company as you can imagine, so I use this as sort of a therapudic thing to make me feel better.

I just want to say that I'm not here looking for pity, fortunately I'm fairly close to some people in my family, enough so to keep me from going insane, my friendlessness is more or less what Id consider a first world problem, I was just hoping to share my story and my work, and maybe we could have an interesting exchange about those things."
lonely,I am so horrified that no one will ever love me.,"I am so horrified that no one will ever love me. - I have never really been in love, not anything mutual. I had been talking to someone earlier this year and it was going really well, but then they got sick of me being sad and pent up. I was too afraid to talk about how I felt about them becuase I didn't want them to say they didn't feel the same way and lose what was the closest thing I've had to mutual affection. They haven't spoken to me in months but it is around the time when we will be able to talk about and im too scared to even send them a message for fear they will have replaced me or moved on or just ignore me. The idea that they might still care about me but not talking to them again, feels somehow better than sending a message with the chance I dont get a good answer. It has been so hard, and I really don't know if I have it in me to have my heart broken again. I've been running out of energy for trying for such a long time and have barely anything left. I dont know what to do, I dont know who to go to, and I dont know how to deal with this pain anymore."

I know it was dumb but I really thought I could make her change her mind about me just being a friend after I told her my feelings. I kept seeing her as a friend, I kept feeling crushed every time. She was there for me whenever I needed her and was easily the nicest person I've ever known. In the end I couldn't take it, and had to push her out of my life for my own good. Now I've lost my best friend, I've lost the one I felt was the love of my life, I've lost a kind, caring, outgoing, funny, talented and beautiful person. It was the best relationship I've ever had. Worst of all I was tactless and drunk, and I wasn't nice about it. Now she hates me, I haven't spoken to her for a month now but she still weighs heavy on my mind everyday. None of my other friends seem to appreciate what a big loss this has been to me and are sick of me talking about it.

I'm 23, awkward as hell and haven't made any new friends in years. I really don't know how long I can keep going like this."

lonely,Loneliness has made me more callous and self absorbed,"Loneliness has made me more callous and self absorbed - Up until now I've realized that Ive always felt like the black sheep, outcast, third wheel or just expendable person with my family, friends and coworkers and it's caused me to completely close myself off to others. It's like that everybody around me aren't even people to me anymore, just potential threats to my ego and well being. 

I desperately long for somebody to understand me yet I refuse to be vulnerable. Its self sabotage at its finest yet I can't help it. I can't bare anymore emotional pain, neglect and abandonment. It's all I've known my whole life. I cover up my true authentic self with bs memes and a happy go lucky attitude cause if people knew how I really felt which at this point is just a mix of bitterness, sorrow, hate and depression they wouldn't want anything to do with me, but lately that's all I feel. The only time I feel okay is when I'm making music or am sparring/fighting in the gym. Idk if this will ever change but until then all I can do is numb myself with my passions and escorts so whatever I guess fuck it. I'm gonna make an album that I've had envisioned since I was 16 someday and when I do I might just call it quits with this life shit."

lonely,I don't want to feel this way.,"I don't want to feel this way. - I'm not sure about anyone else, but I feel it's enough that I'm a lonely man and have been for years, despite many attempts to get back out there. But nope, the feeling is so overwhelming that my hope for ever being in love again is near nonexistent. Not only that, I hardly feel any motivation to do the things I love and that I'm passionate for anymore because of how overwhelming it is. Lastly and most pathetically, I've developed a huge resentment towards romantic couples of any kind. The prescence of these happy, innocent folk is unfortunately unavoidable, and don't get me wrong, I don't want anyone to feel bad for being in love just because I can't find any. However, just seeing a happy couple being affectionate towards each other makes a geyser of hate erupt inside me. I don't let any of this hate out though, because that would be stupid, so I either try very hard to ignore them or just leave. I recognize this as very much a problem, as it's getting to where I can't even see a fictional couple on TV without getting like that. 

I want very much to improve, and every person I've talked to about it said the same thing. ""It all starts with learning to love yourself."". It's a very insightful statement. However, I don't even know where to begin."

Those moments where you tell yourself that you don’t need anyone else just to feel a wave of isolation staring at waves crashing through your ankles, trying to find peace within its serenity. However, the realization that the ones you loved moved on to different places with those connections severed by distance.

This is me first time writing here because I am really feeling so bad right now. I am planning to do internships in Germany and I've been learning German for at least a year. I've also planned to go to South Korea for an exchange semester and staying there for 8-9 months to learn the language. I've also been learning Korean for 2-3 months. I really want to go to South Korea and Germany too. I am dreaming to going these places every single day. This is giving me motivation to continue learning the languages.

 I am studying mechanical engineering at a very hard, intense school. I dont interact with people because of covid, I just go for little runs 3-4 times a week also do some lifting at home with my weights. 

It's been months since I talked with somebody in real life, talked with my friends real life. I am saying friends here but 1 only have 1 real friend and I am really thankful for that. Most of my friends have girlfriends, they meet regularly. I dont have a girlfriend and I also dont meet with anyone because of covid. I feel so alone, I feel so anxious sometimes. Lots of this language learning, university chores, online classes making me so busy and lonely. Most of my friends tell me that I shouldnt learn these languages, but I feel like I should to be a better and more qualified engineer. I also enjoy learning a languages but I become so stressed and anxious sometimes because I feel like I cant manage all of this of my own. I need someone to tell me you can do this man ! You got this ! Instead of this my friends call me a dumbass for learning languages. How nice. 

I feel like most of my friends dont care about me, they dont message or call me if I dont call or message them first. I just want this virus to finish man, I am just so sick of it. Thank you for reading."

lonely,Feeling used,"Feeling used - Broke up with my ex because she didn’t want to stay in the city where we live and showed for months while living together that she wasn’t really that interested in me sexually or otherwise and didn’t have to the heart to break it off. Then I break it off, get kicked out of the house, still paying rent, got my guitar stolen (I’m a musician) and hit a new low. Ex asks if we can still sleep together and me grasping at any kind of normalcy go for it and then find out she’s moved on by her throwing me a condom out of a big opened box of condoms and said I have to use these now. Now she’s emotionally asking for me to comfort her for something she blames me for and it’s just drained me mentally. I want to be with her and she blames me for the way things turned out and won’t address that we didn’t work not because I broke it off but because of problems we had that she never wanted to address. I like to think I’m an introspective, respectful and nice person and feel like the last 4 years (2 serious relationships) were unloving and opportunistic. I’ve always come to the conclusion that it’s my own faults that end up breaking the relationship or my own shortcomings but at this point I truly feel like there’s no real love or passion or compassion anymore. Just people using people to get by and no one truly caring about other people’s feelings"

lonely,Feeling alone around other people,"Feeling alone around other people - A couple times a year, some people that I was previously good friends with will reach out and let me know they’re thinking of me, etc. but it doesn’t seem like they have the time to talk to me beyond that, even though I see them on social media hanging out with other people. I would almost prefer they didn’t reach out at all rather than reach out and then pretend I don’t exist for another 6-8 months. I don’t know what their reasoning is, but it doesn’t feel like they’re reaching out because they genuinely care about me. 

I also hang out with this guy on and off (we’re kind of all over the place) and he’s essentially said that he just wants to use me and that’s it. Last week he came over for a little bit and bounced. Even though you would think being around another person would make me feel less lonely, it made me feel more lonely because I know that this guy does not give a shit about me. 

I feel like I have very few people in my life that I have meaningful connections with. There are so few people who reach out to me to say hi, invite me to do something, or even share a funny video with me. The few interactions I have with people are fleeting and/or feel very transactional. It only makes the loneliness louder."
lonely,Women literally only want my dick,"Women literally only want my dick - Sounds stupid, as a guy I should love the stream of women wanting sex but honestly I hate it. Every woman I talk to only wants sex, they’re ridiculously for it and the ones I want a relationship with are never interested. 

It’s weird, I’ve always been more keen on relationships. I’ve had enough pointless sex to know it’s not worth it and the more that gets offered to me the lonelier i feel. I don’t know how to explain it, it’s just shit. I have no idea how to get the ones I want to be with so in a vein effort to feel something I go hook up with whoever happens to be in my inbox

I want attention but not from the people who are giving it to me. I miss her specifically. I have no way to reach out to her anymore. Even if I could she would just bite my hand. I don't miss the misery that she brought. I'm pretty sure I'll be alone for the rest of my life. I can accept that, I just wish I could let go of the haunting emotions and feelings left behind.

I've hated being a nerd my entire life. I feel as though I've never been able to develop a true identity outside of my intelligence and academic achievements. I feel like I have nothing unique or interesting to offer to other people. I'm a 21 M virgin, and even after joining a social fraternity in college I barely talked to women or made any lasting friendships. I work my ass off so hard for my gpa because of how important it was to get into medical school. My entire life I've worked so hard to get to this career, and I can't even feel proud or happy about it because I'm so alone.

I wish I was just like every other guy who didn't give a shit. I wish I gave up on my dreams and aspirations a long time ago; none of them have made me happy. I will never get back the time I wasted. I will always be the person that missed out on having a normal social life at a young age. I even tried lying about my grades and accomplishments when asked so I didn't look like such a nerd, but of course, this never worked. Any time people talk about past relationships or sex in conversations I can't relate. I've genuinely been left behind by the world, and I'm all out of energy and time to catch up. I will most likely end my own life very soon.

It's so easy for everyone else to figure out this aspect of life, and I never could. Every other man my age can just fuck around all the time and do drugs and not give a shit, and still get laid.. I am so alone and suicidal and have been this way for years. Life is unequal, and I genuinely have one of the worst existences possible. I want nothing more than to end my own life right now."

I dont know how to put it in words and convey what im trying to say but picture this ; if we are no longer together , he'll still have someone but as for me , i'll have no one.. 

My boyfriend and his friends (all guys) are planning on a graduation trip (after covid ends) and it makes me sad  not cause i dont want him to go but ive always dreamt about traveling with friends but I genuinely dont have any. I expressed that i want to travel with him since years ago but because his parents are VERY VERY conservative we are not able to travel together .. so seeing him travel with others makes me feel a little ... sad

I dont know if im the reason why i dont have friends.. i dont speak alot , i find it hard to create and continue conversations unless we know each other for a long time.. i feel like people always feel awkward around me .. im also super soft spoken . I dont like being rowdy and loud .. if i had to describe myself as a character , the closest visual and personality wise would be violet from incredibles ...

in high school i only had 1 friend . Of which after grafuation, we just lost contact, like she just found a new group of friends and didnt want to meet up with me . Ive offered her out for lunch multiple times but she always said she's too busy for me .. and even on instagram she posted the "" friends im thankful for post "" and i wasnt mentioned , im ok with that but few days aft that she removed me from her socials .. till today i dont know what i did wrong 

In college i had a 3 other new friends but they left me out and made me felt unwanted. They would go out for lunch or birthday parties and not invite me . For some reason they will always try to bring me down by mocking my flaws.. we parted ways since graduation.

Nobody takes the time to socialise even if they did its just like a "" hi-bye "" conversation .. i failed a module , so i have different modules to take from everyone, in short i dont meet the same people every semester so im a new kid in every class i joined each semester . From which they already had their own cliques. My house is not far from my school so i go back home to have my lunch during my breaks or ill just eat alone .

I feel like nobody understands how lonely it is for me ... some nights i would cry because i just miss having a friend . Dont get me wrong , i love my boyfriend he is the sweetest most kindest man ive ever had but i want friends too just like him.... i want to go on a trip with my friends , i want to go to a party with friends .. i want to go lunch with friends , i just wish i had friends..."
lonely,Anybody else got shit ton of acquaintances but no true friends?,Anybody else got shit ton of acquaintances but no true friends? - I know so many fucking people but I have no one to talk to when I feel sad or lonely. I have no real friends. I have some people that are close to being called my friends but they still don't know me like that and wouldn't really care if I asked them for help or support. I'm so fucking lonely. I just need someone to talk to. Create an illusion that I'm talking to a good friend that genuinely cares for me...
lonely,I stop existing,"I stop existing - Think back on the things you've lived through, on all the people you've met.

Think of the people you've interacted with the most, the ones that impacted on your life.

I am not a very social person, I've never had that many friends, the ones i had have distanced themselves from me, only one person really remains in my life who i can call my friend.

But the ones i left behind did spend some time of their life with me, at some point, and i can't help but wonder, ¿do they think of me often? ¿do i have  any place in their thoughts anymore or have they stopped remembering me?

When i can't fall asleep late at night, my brain bombarded with these thoughts, i realize that there's spots of time in which absolutely no person thinks of me, not one person in this earth has my presence in their minds; moments in which i am not interacting with anyone in any way; moments in which absolutely no one can see me or notice me.

Those late at night moments are the ones in which i stop existing, not even in a intangible way, i simply abandon all forms of human interaction and i cease to exist to society."
lonely,just scared,"just scared - I just wonder how different my life would be if I hadn’t read all those stupid romance novels when I was young that just instilled into my brain that I was only worth something if a guy like me. I wasted all of my adolescent and teenage years waiting like an idiot to be chosen and living in this fantasy world and missing out on so many things. And when no one ever chose me that hatred was so destructive, I didn’t think I deserved a good life, I wondered what was so wrong with me, I despised everyone for having friends and partners and people that just loved them. I never got asked out or had a first kiss or any of those stupid moments from all those YA novels and I just wonder how differently things could have been if I had actually tried to be social and friendlier instead of having my head in the clouds waiting for a prince that never existed. 

Those years of loneliness and bitter regrets have created a monster that I have to work so hard to fight against everyday. My mindset is much better now, I know I have things to life for, but sometimes all I am is just her and the loneliness. But I will never stop trying to make friends and genuine connections. I can’t waste my adult years too."
lonely,Attempt to end loneliness and anxiety.,"Attempt to end loneliness and anxiety. - The idea came into me during the early months of the pandemic when I read a fact about more people feeling lonely and isolated during quarantine. I found out that its actually been an issue even before the pandemic occurred. Hence, i wanted to do my part in solving the problem and started to brain storm different ways I could.

After attempting to help some of my own friends in the situation, I found out that the main reason for loneliness and anxiety is because the person dealing with it, quite literally, lacks the energy to reach out for help. There are existing messaging and such platforms, but that is still too much friction for the people suffering from mental health

I pretty much can't get near any girl without fucking something up and while people tell me that I shouldn't focus on this stuff cuz I'm still in 8th grade with an exam coming up in a few months, I still can't do anything about it. I always feel so lonely and depressed that I can barely do anything school related. Not to mention that I literally can't tell anyone about this because I'll make the whole situation worse than it already was as I pretty much always give people the wrong idea and they'll think I'm just depressed for no good reason or that I'm using depression as an excuse for why I'm doing so bad at everything. Even worse is that I see everyone doing almost everything right while I'm just sitting here like a worthless idiot that can't help anyone, let alone help myself.

not tired of being alone, i'm tired of going out and being reminded why i'm alone. i just wanna be left alone but life won't let me. but i think i've been so scared about heaven or hell, that i never really really thought about my stopping my own life ya know?maybe tomorrow my mindset will change and i'll be free. i don't want attention, i dont need anything, i just thought i'd let my last thoughts out in a place where people who maybe feel like me can relate. and i'll exist in a post to them."
lonely,My only friend is getting more closer to a new friend and it hurts,"My only friend is getting more closer to a new friend and it hurts - I don't have a friend IRL but I made one from an online game whom I've grown closer to. We used to do quests together, sometimes they'd ask me for advice, joke around, share random stuff, basically just be there and help each other. Nothing romantic or something like that. It was just really fun spending time together after feeling lonely for a while.

Fast forward to today, they've gotten closer to a new friend, and all of the things I've mentioned above rarely happen or never at all. They don't talk or spend time with me as much anymore. And even if they do, it feels kinda forced because I asked them if they'd want to help me with this quest.

Everytime we're both online and their new friend, they spend time and joke around so much that it honestly hurts because I used to be that person. I'm jealous and I know I shouldn't be because they can make as many friends as they want. But sometimes it's so obvious that they'd rather spend time with their new friend than me and it sucks, but I can't do anything about it.

I miss them so much. I really do. I'm thinking of talking to them about it but I'm too afraid to offend them or push them away further. Right now I'm just finding ways to ease the pain while the inevitable happens which is when they'll finally drift away and I'll just become someone in their friends list.

lonely,Alone in a hostile house,"Alone in a hostile house - Every night my dad gets black out drunk and almost every night my parents get in mostly one sided physical altercations/yelling matches.

We live in a small house with very thing walls so every day i have to suffer through listening alone. I’ve tried to stop him before but it has only made things worse for my mom and is ineffective because i am only a below average height 14 year old girl. I get these intrusive thoughts when they fight on how i could stab him in the neck and take a juvenile charge for it. But that honestly would just end in an excuse for him to murder me through self defense. I would never act on it anyways because I want to build a future for myself successful enough for me not to be burdened by their baggage. My best friend tries to relate with me and i for a while thought our family situations are similar and found comfort in it. I would causally mention my familial problems and she would respond awkwardly, as if she’s never experienced it. As time goes on I realize we have differences that define us too greatly.  I love my mom more than anything in the world and would do anything for her, but I wish her love for me was shown better. The only thing i have that keeps me going is the thought that she loves me, but there’s nights on end that she ignores me and i can tell she recognizes my father in me. When she does that she’ll take out all her frustrations towards him on me. I really feel alone."

i’m a twenty-five year old that (unfortunately) lives in the us. ^(please vote haha) i’m an infj to the core; if i miss any details, read up on 16personalities and you’ll have your answer(s). 

i like animals, video games, music, tv shows, movies, and sleep in no particular order. i’d really like to find someone that i can hold a meaningful conversation with throughout the day - whether you’re able to respond frequently, or a handful of times.

*•i have three dogs and one cat.
•i mostly play dbd and valorant, but i’d like to get into phasmophobia! i’ve also got a decent amount of hours in acnh, with little motivation or progress to show for it. 
•my music taste is typically involves mellow, sad songs - more specifically lauv, finneas, and joji. 
•the last show i watched was cobra kai, and i’d like another to (somehow) hold me off until the next season. pretty much any genre is fine!
•movie suggestions are much appreciated. if you have a favorite spooky szn one, send it my way! 

# ***about you*** 

i don’t mind if you game, or not, but you must like animals. i don’t trust people who don’t. you’re in north america preferably, so we don’t have to worry about limited time to talk and large gaps of time in between responses. you send me a suggestion of some sort - song/album, show, movie, or game. you pick.

lonely,I keep crying over how lonely I am,"I keep crying over how lonely I am - It just keeps getting worse. Usually I like being alone, but I'm so sick of being lonely if that makes sense. I'm so desperate for human contact and it's caused my standards for both friendship and attraction to get somewhat low. I'm also just so pathetic that I don't have anywhere to go to about how I feel other than here or my journal, I guess. I don't think I'm that undesirable of a person, but maybe I'm wrong. I just hate how wanting only one person in my life who isn't a fake that doesn't care about me is apparently too much to ask for. I want to touch and hug and cuddle someone, is that weird? I hate myself for being awful at talking to people and never being able to initiate conversation. If people are so draining, then why do I want a meaningful relationship with one? Why do I value good connections so much when I never even get them? I tend to miss people a lot, especially ones I haven't talked to in forever. I met a guy a while ago and he was really cute, had a great personality and a nice music taste. I miss him so much. Why is it so hard to find people like him? And even if you do, they don't even care about you? I don't want to live for several decades more if this is how my life is always going to be. People are meant to be with each other, but some of us never even get that. What the fuck is the point then? I keep trying to get over it and convince myself that I don't need someone else to be somewhat okay, but it doesn't work. I can't stop getting upset over it. I have nobody anymore. I don't even like my family. All I ever feel like doing is laying in bed and staring at the wall. Hell, even doing that sounds nice as long as it would be with another person. But it never is. I'm just really lonely and touch-starved and desperate and pathetic. I'm so tired of crying and being miserable over things I don't even have the functionality to change.

I have some vague friendships but we're all around 30 and they are all in relationships. Very very occasionally i manage to hang out with them on a weekend (maybe once every 2 weeks if i am lucky)

I am the only one who tries to get us all together but I guess they are busy happy not living for some reason. So i end up spending all of my time alone and isolated just working.

lonely,Been suffering and pretending,"Been suffering and pretending - Last night. I had another emotional break down... again. It’s happening a lot lately. It mostly happen during evenings.

I just feel like my life sucks recently.

I just graduated in college. The irony is I took the course in Psychology but seems like there’s no helping myself when sad days occur. I call it sad days because I am sure that I don’t have depression. At least I am over with the thoughts about ending everything. I thought graduating college is the answer to my dreams but how come non of those is happening? Once again, I feel stuck.

When emotional breakdowns occur to me. I tend to rant on twitter the most, I delete it the next day though because I feel silly sharing my stupid thoughts online when none of those people care.

I realized that even your friends don’t care when you’re sad. It’s been happening quite a lot. And the more I realized it, the more painful it is. I have friends during fun times but how come I don’t have them when I’m feeling down? I realized I cry alone and when I reach out to them, no one is available. I understand we all have our own circumstances but I always try my best to be there for them.

But then I guess I am also not available towards them when I see them being sad. How come that when there’s fun, everyone is gathered but when there’s someone breaking down in front of our eyes, we can’t do anything about it? 

Additional to the struggle I face right now is the mental drought. It’s been months we’re stuck at home. I am tired of being home so I did my best looking for a job. No one calls me back. I know I’m wasting so much time of my life and it comes to the point where I can’t endure it anymore.

I started to feel tired. I don’t have any motivation to do anything. I just lie here, watch videos online, listening to motivational speakers but how come none of them inspire me anymore. I have a dream and now I feel like it is impossible for me to reach..

I feel so pathetic. My life is filled with drama and though I pretend not to ne affected by all of these, it’s tearing me apart inside. My family sucks that’s why I need to leave sooner but now I am stuck with them. No. I’m living with an extended family and they made me live pathetically since my mom left to work. They do mooch money from her and when they’re not satisfied with what I give them, they talk behind my back. I know it. And I am always anxious about it.

I want them out of my life completely. I’ve cried many tears because of them.
I’ve attended two graduations without a parent walking me on stage. I feel neglected. Sometimes it hurts my souls. I thought I’m already over about stuff but just writing about all of these makes me want to cry again.

How come life is very unfair to me?"
lonely,21F - 12 years later and nearly after one year of searching... extremely lonely gal with no male friendships and I'm close to shutting down,"21F - 12 years later and nearly after one year of searching... extremely lonely gal with no male friendships and I'm close to shutting down -  21 years old, MtF trans *(not yet passing)*, moved to Australia with a family in 2008 when I was a 'wee child, in order to start a new life. I've had ups and downs since, mostly downs *(too much to detail in my post).*

Now, fast-track forward to the year of 2020 in August, I was in the middle of pursuing a career in Nursing, and in the middle of my degree *(which I'll get to shortly)*, I discontinued my hospital clinicals and entirely withdrew from my semester units. I had an ambition to pursue the career path of becoming a military flight nurse and if that didn't work out, alternatively, working as a RAAF or even if moving over to the US.... as a DoD civilian nurse at an Army hospital/Naval medical center.

**All in all, eventful things have happened** ***(no, this wasn't due to the virus)*** **in this particular order**:

1. Having lost my friendships over a previous partner *(served in the Marine Corps as a 0311)*... ""my former friends"" calling me f\*cked in the head for choosing a guy like him especially given his former background and warning I'd get abused *(farcry from the truth)*
2. Lost my then-partner when it came to a dilemma of him vs. Nursing career ambition
3. Lost any confidence and chances of career-to-be when I made subtle, major mistakes that ended up compromising patient safety during clinicals and in turn, not trusting myself and reassessing my stage in life from hereon.

Now, with everything that I've experienced, I came to the epiphany that as much as I tried to deny it for so long and clinging to old, dead friendships and accepting the littlest of crumbs... I have no friends. And where do I start when people ask me what kind of friendships I'm looking for? The essence of friendships I'm looking for overlaps with that of a relationship... or at least with a friendship with relationship benefits. I feel that intimacy, affection and closeness should extend to my male friends and be as caring for them as I am with a partner.

What existed in my university/professional/work life were only three things: isolation, loneliness and the feeling of disconnect . Each passing day presented a day of hardship where I felt truly alone.

I'm aiming to start my new, perhaps hopeful chapter of a life in the Fox Cities/Valley area in WI *(in the US)* there but I feel like I want to bring along some people in my journey from my old life here in Australia... where there's almost nothing for me here. All but unpleasant memories into a future where I can look forward to. However, that is all the more difficult in my present situation/circumstance and lack of male friendships.

**I am that extremely lonely in that it feels like I'm making up for lost time, as if the feeling I was released from prison, wrongfully convicted and trying to live the remainder of whatever life I have.** I have trouble connecting with people, and the same story applies to online. Oh, the reddit downvotes certainly don't help.

People irritate me when they have their success of striking up friendships and connections and I feel like I want to blow up in their faces and give them a reality check on how hard it was for me.

I just want a close affectionate, even intimate male friend... after being alone and lonely as a cause of it, don't I deserve to have something that makes me happy?

And btw, screw mental health awareness day"

lonely,Ive decided to make a scary decision about my life in order to bring myself more happiness,"Ive decided to make a scary decision about my life in order to bring myself more happiness - I'm making a scary decision today. After years and years of repressed sexuality, where I felt guilt for having sexual desires, guilt for looking at porn or masturbating, and guilt for wanting to let loose and have fun. Today I'm deciding not to feel guilty. I'm going to do the things I enjoy and I'm going to enjoy them. I'm taking responsibility for my own life!

I'm going to watch porn tonight bodly. I'm not going to feel shy about it I""m going to pull up a tab, and look right at it. I'm going to look for a woman who turns me on, I'm going to embrace the fact that I enjoy looking at a woman naked.

I'm going to accept my sexual desires. I'm going to accept the fact that I enjoy talking sexually with women online. Its been quite a while since Ive tried to find someone due to the shame and tonight I'm going to post on r4r and other subs to try and find a woman to get to know, and be sexual with. I'm going to accept that I like the idea of watching porn together with a woman, and I'm going to accept that fact without judging myself about it.

I'm going to accept that I want a woman to see me naked. That I want to show myself to a woman in that way. I accept that I'm going to seek out a relationship with a woman online who will want me to show her my penis. (Consensually and not out of the blue of course).

I'm going to accept that its ok that I'm in my 20's and still a virgin. I accept that and when distancing from other people is no longer required I will go out and date more, and eventually have sex with a woman.

I have no idea how to find the things I want online. I have no idea how to find a woman to talk to , or interact this way with. But tonight, I'm giving myself permission to not feel guilty, to not judge myself, and to instead seek out the things I want, and to enjoy myself."

I feel so alone. I'm surrounded by people who probably not care if I was gone. I've lost all interest in my hobbies and job.

It just feels so odd. I rarely talk to anyone, parents said they'd call me everyday, which so far they only did once; I have no friends; and my classmates don't care for me except when we have to cooperate. The only thing I have that keeps me sane is the schools teachers, because they are paid to interact with me. But that's only 3 days every week that I have any social activity.

Problem is I went to school in the south (I’m currently on the east coast) and I went from having a good social life to virtually nothing. I have a long distance gf but she’s in the south too and I haven’t seen her in months. I have a great job that I love but ever since I started working virtually in July, I’ve developed a loneliness I can’t really explain to people.

My life feels so mechanical now. I get up at 6 am work till 9 pm usually and then Friday night’s/Saturdays consist of me just cruising around in my car because I’m so fucking bored. There’s no one to hit up or do stuff with and it blows.

I seriously dread the weekends now because there’s no one to hangout with, all my friends are busy (didn’t help that I had a small group of friends back home to begin with) and I don’t know how to make new friends post college. It’s really starting to take a toll on me mentally because it just sucks having no group to hangout with outside of work.

lonely,"The Louder Someone Shouts About Being A Friend, The Quicker They Forget And The Less They Care About You","The Louder Someone Shouts About Being A Friend, The Quicker They Forget And The Less They Care About You - I (39M) have recently learnt (again) that the more someone talks about being a friend, or a social group claims to be a welcoming community of people, the quicker they forget about you.

&amp;#x200B;

I first learnt this 10+ years ago, when people I had pretty much known most of my life (growing up together in and around church) at that time seemed to just forget about me as they organised social gatherings. As a result, I slowly drifted away from them and the church, and into the pub that was less than a stones throw away from the church building, and none of them noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

This was also around the time my brother (2.5 years my junior) was serving in the army and deployed in Iraq. The few times I would stick around at church, all I was ever asked was ""How's &lt;Insert Brother's Name&gt; doing?""  I had no idea, as communication lines weren't exactly easy to maintain, but I wholeheartedly believed he was in a much safer place/position than I was as I began to spiral downward.

&amp;#x200B;

My increasingly more frequent visits to the local pub allowed me some escape from that, as the people I met there knew nothing about my brother.  As friendships with my fellow drinkers grew, I began to feel like I was welcomed for who I was and not simply as someone to be used for what I could do for others.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of years later, whilst working in a voluntary role, I was invited to a different church and decided to go along as I didn't really have anything else to do that particularly Sunday.

&amp;#x200B;

I met knew people and made friends, and initially felt welcomed.  I've celebrated engagements &amp; weddings with these new church friends, as well as partying with them simply because it was Friday and that was worth celebrating.  I felt like I belonged.

&amp;#x200B;

But this global pandemic, along with its lockdowns and restrictions on social gatherings has changed my mind, reminding me that the more people profess to be a friend, the less they actually are.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 7 months, I've had no contact with these people I thought I belong in a community with.  I've watched (not literally, but seen posts after the fact) on social media platforms as they've had online ""bake-off"" competitions and quiz nights, without a single invite to join in.  Even now, as I lay in bed typing this, my housemates are sat with mutual friends playing card/board games and having fun.  No invitation extended to myself.  I wasn't even acknowledged when I had to pass through the room where they are to make myself a drink.  


I should be (and I am) grateful for the guys I met and became friends with as I drank to excess. They're the only people I've had any half-way meaningful contact with for the last 7 months.  Without them, 2020 would simply have been ""Wake Up, Eat, Work, Sleep, Repeat"" for over half a year.

&amp;#x200B;

I want more than this in my life, but I've no idea how to change it."
lonely,Drinking Alone as a method of self care.,"Drinking Alone as a method of self care. - So this is something I’ve been doing since I was 19 (Currently M26 Straight and Canadian). I’ll buy myself my favourite bottle of wine and sometimes some food. Often I put something on Netflix or listen to some tunes and just sit there and let myself feel all the things. Basically allowing myself to be alone and vulnerable for a night here and there. The next morning I always feel refreshed....slightly hungover....but mentally refreshed and relaxed!  

Now I know a lot of people say drinking alone is not good for you and a sign of depression, and while that is something I have been and am dealing with, I personally couldn’t disagree more. I enjoy it, especially after a long hard week. It helps to put things in perspective and reset! 

Does anyone else do this?

lonely,my definition of love is fucked,"my definition of love is fucked - 
lately i’ve noticed that every time someone shows remotely a tiny bit of interest in me i tend to block them off. i basically end up guilting myself into thinking—they dont know how fucked, ordinary, trash of a person i am. 

or that this way i might be a lil happy,, but also the universe hates me so i’ll have to face sadness from elsewhere? probably my parents health or something. 

And then if the same person doesnt show interest in me, or is rude—not into me, my brain instantly starts getting attracted + attached to them. 

When the same person replies late, my brain waits for them to reply. And i end up blaming myself for scaring them away. Or them finally seeing how bad of a person i am. 

I am tired of this...i dont know how to change it? Its just...it seems like. I run behind the people who dont love me and run from people who do."
lonely,I've been lonely ever since school.,"I've been lonely ever since school. - I'm now 23, school finished in 2013 (UK). From then on, I have had no friends. It has caused me to be depressed among other mental issues. I am at the point where it would be too good to be true to have even one friend and I never believe that i'll ever have any. At first, I wasn't sure what was happening to me, I didn't realise I needed friends until I had none, they all forgot about me moving onto college. I have got worse over the years, i'm just not sure how to describe the feeling. I have social anxiety and this has always been the root cause of everything. After school I had gone to college but I was unable to speak to anybody, not even make eye contact. I dropped out after 6 weeks because I couldn't really bare walking around by myself at lunch times.

&amp;#x200B;

 Since then, it's just been a struggle and I have not done anything with my life. I feel like i'm the only one at this age who has this situation. 95% of my time is spent at home, watching live streams simply to feel less lonely as stupid as it sounds. I doubt anyone will care, i've never really posted like this online before. I guess its a sign of desperation."

lonely,My mom tells me that I’m an adult and can plan my own birthday parties so she shouldn’t have to do anything,"My mom tells me that I’m an adult and can plan my own birthday parties so she shouldn’t have to do anything - I (25F) have felt a bit neglected by my mom since becoming an adult. I know she loves me, but she very rarely answers texts or phone calls and almost never comes to visit me because I’m “too far away,” but she expects me to drive to her place (used to be an hour away, now it’s more like 30 min.). I sometimes feel jealous of the people who say their mom is their best friend and they talk to their mom all the time, because I very often feel ignored by mine. My cousin feels the same way about her mom (my mom’s sister). 

Anyway, my mom has said for the past few years that if I want a birthday party I have to plan it myself because I’m no longer a child. It’s not like I ever have birthday parties. Even as a teenager I think I only ever had 1 (yay no friends). But it’s nice to have a family dinner and then cake which is all I ever do anyway. 

Is it weird of me to feel sad that my mom can’t even plan a dinner and cake and have my sisters come over? That I have to do it myself to earn their attention? I graduated back in April and I still haven’t had so much as a graduation cupcake. I always go over to my mom’s on Mother’s Day and her birthday to cook and clean and shower her with love and presents. Idk, I guess I had just hoped that one day a year my mom would take some initiative, but maybe I’m thinking like a child and need to be an adult and cook my own birthday dinner and buy my own cake. The way things are going, I’ll probably stay home with my cats and make myself food and get a lil drunk. That’s my go-to evening anyway. 

Maybe my dad will say or do something. But he didn’t bother to show up on my birthday last year. Last year I planned a trip to a local amusement park with my sister and dad. Dad didn’t show. My other sister planned my birthday dinner and bought cake for me. Dad didn’t show, but he venmoed me money which was nice. 

I miss when we were all one big family before my dad left when I was 17. Even though I barely had friends, I always had my loving family whom I loved to spend time with. Now that’s gone, and I live alone, so I have no one."

Two of them don't ever wanna hang out with me, rarelly even talk to me if i don't start the conversation and most of the time just outright ignore me. They're always playing this fucking card game in school and the only way for me to hang out with anyone is to beg a person i don't like: ""Please. Can i play just one game instead of you. I'm begging you!"". And if i tell anyone about what's going on with me they just laugh and dismiss it as a joke. Well i'm not just a fucking entertainer.

So Ive been sharing stuff about loneliness and struggles with my gf lately. She just kind of casually  laughed today about it. She clearly expects guys to have lots of friend and here i am a lonely guy. I am scared to let my guard down. I dont know what the fuck to do.

Look if you're working that hard to please others you are surrounded by the wrong people, you shouldn't have to try to make everyone happy. And if you feel that you're unable to get a partner you are your problem. If you cant get people there is something else thats the issue if its your looks then work to change it. . . That doesnt mean supplements or workout shakes that means hard labor and sacrifice.

Im not saying its easy but its no one elses fault your where you're at. No matter what an issue is you have a way to change it and the fact you self loath means clearly you dont like it. So rather than live life saying, ""man I wish I had someone"" maybe get up and say, ""im gonna make some wish they were with me"" *[Not creep way]* but you cant just sit here and whine about it. No matter the amount of *""You deserve better""* you get online nothing will change you physically it will never make you happy.

lonely,"Repost w some changes (I was shadowbanned, so you couldn’t have read it anyway): I hate my life","Repost w some changes (I was shadowbanned, so you couldn’t have read it anyway): I hate my life - () I’m basically a trophy kid. My so-called mom only wanted me so she could brag about me to the others and my so-called dad only wanted me because she wanted me. 

She used to be physically abusive, but now she’s only trying to manipulate me and make me feel bad about myself because she saw that beating me didn’t have the same effect anymore. She also screams at me, but more rarely. 

She does scream at her mother every day, though and I hate it. Her mom is also shitty, but she’s much worse and she’s absolutely parallel w responsibility. Her problems are mostly her fault, yet she always blames others. Won’t listen to anyone but herself.

While she was beating and screaming at me, nobody bat an eye. Even if she did those on the street. Not even the damn police. I also tried to explain that she’s abusive to some of my neighbors and they didn’t really care. One of them even yelled at me that my parents are intellectuals, maybe I deserved to be hit, “But they’re so nice!” etc. I also tried to explain that to some friends of hers (psychology majors, 20 ish) and they couldn’t care less. But the best part is that I always lose people when I tell them I live in an abusive household. But she never loses anyone. Yes, I told some others about that too. 

(Fun fact: she is also working on opening a psychological office this year)

Also to my cousin. I used to think of her as a sister, but then she befriended my “mom” on a trip I really wanted her to be with me. And her mom befriended her too.

My so-called dad lied to me that we don’t have money for my biggest wish. He also laughed at me and screamed that we don’t have it. I would ask him for it every single day of my life. And he would lie every single time. When I found out how much money he actually had, I asked him why he lied to me and he told me that I should’ve never found out. 

Not to mention the fact that he would enable her disgusting behavior. He would even help her beat me.

I see so many amazing family relationships and I wish I had one too. I wish I had parents who loved me. Whom I can visit on holidays after moving out, whom I can call. Especially when I also think about how I am. I’m not normal. I suck at socializing and many other things. Although I try. But yeah... I wish I was adopted by someone who cared. Actually, the closer I got to being 18, the more I cried because that became even more impossible.

I used to be bullied. It started when I was in Kindergarten and continued until the 8th grade. Although, I had some high school classmates that weren’t that nice.

I don’t have any friends. Everyone leaves me. Unless they’re homophobic, racist or shit like this. In that case, I leave them because they truly don’t deserve anyone’s time. 

Also, I’m bi and in a very conservative country, so it’s very fun /s.

I also used to have a girlfriend, but she left me too. She didn’t actually break up with me. She just blocked me on everything she could. I realized later that we weren’t together anymore. But I kind of understand her. She wasn’t going through a nice time and I didn’t know how to support her and I was insensitive from time to time. FML

I remember my Latin teacher telling us once that the only lasting friends we were going to have are the ones from our childhood and I couldn’t help but cry because I had none. 

Once, a guy was nicer to me than the rest and I started seeing him as a brother (I’ve wanted one since forever so I wouldn’t be this lonely) and I really thought he cared about me, but he didn’t.

I also needed help from this other guy once. His family is close to mine and we met once. And he was super sweet and we have much in common. He also made time to speak with me once. I think I fell in love with him, but then he started leaving me on seen because I fucked up somehow. I asked him what was wrong and he didn’t tell me anything. I still can’t stop thinking about him and I keep imaging myself going on some cute dates with him and cuddling and stuff like this. And I know he may have a girlfriend and that I should forget about him, but it makes me smile and laugh and a bit less alone when I think about those. And it’s not like I keep bugging him. Thinking about those also made me calmer before the exams I had.

I also keep talking to the void before I sleep. I imagine him or my fictive family or sth like that. It sort of makes me feel like shit, but it helps me a bit. 

And I cuddle w my pillow and sometimes kiss its head. But I wish it was a real person.

I can’t even succeed in things because nobody really cares. Even worse is the fact that my classmate succeeded in those even though she started much later then me. She’s adored by so many and people tell her she’s perfect.

Then, even on Reddit, I get downvoted and it’s not like I was insulting people. I made a post on my other acc, asking for advice and I thanked the people who replied. Once I asked a bit more because I felt I needed more details. That’s what I got downvoted for. “Thanks :)” and “hi! Thanks :) I did this because x, but I could do it your way. Also...” (basically what I wrote). And this makes me feel like shit too.

I’m sorry I wrote like this and left details out and it may not have made much sense, but I’ve got a headache from crying and not eating well and being too much on devices."

I was going through a very difficult period of mental health and ended up avoiding a lot of people. I think the guilt I feel from it is stopping me from moving on and forming new friendships. It is on my mind almost every day. How can I let go?
lonely,Lonely Writer with Social Anxiety,"Lonely Writer with Social Anxiety - Just thought I'd pop on and share...

I'm currently on disability leave from my job because of anxiety. I'm a biracial Asian that has lived in San Francisco, but had to return to suburban Pennsylvania after a major anxiety incident (getting 5150'd when I wasn't an obvious danger really fucked with my head). I do like the job I have currently in just about every way except management and some of the white coworkers that refuse to accept they're racist. I mean, I'm on paid disability leave. As someone that's struggled with being able to cope in this world with my mental illnesses, it's a joy to have this option.

Anyhow... While on leave, I'm trying to focus on my creative work, which I had difficulty of doing because of how much stress I would have from work and then spend my time off just de-stressing. I'm writing a series of book. The first one I finished at the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in Pennsylvania. I'm currently on the 2nd book (as I don't like doing the informative essay/synopsis part to send out to agents). I hit writer's block and realized that all the mistakes I knew from even the first book needed to be addressed. I went through all that work and now I back to where I left off with Book 2. So I'm 26 chapters into what looks to be a 35 chapter book.

I'm taking a while to get to the point, but here it is... I'm excited... With nearly no one to share my excitement with. I've never really felt accepted anywhere, so it's been pretty hard to keep friends. Most of the ones I want to reach out to I met in SF... But it's hard for me to initiate conversations all the time because it gets aggravating on my anxiety. Not to mention I had a bad falling out with my FWB at the start of COVID-19 that has left me having a hard time trusting.

TL;DR: Excited to be 9 chapters away from finishing a 35 chapter book, but I don't have a lot of people to share my excitement with"

Are you up for the challenge? :) - I've made a form to find friends where 25 questions are asked (most are multiple choice). And based on the answers you get matched up with other users.We ask two things for each topic, (1) Your answer (2) Answers you want to be matched up with. So we ask about whether you want to voice call 📞, share pictures 📷, your continent 🗺️, your age, if you play games/books often, if you're studying or working and so forth!

This makes it super simple and quick to find people that both want to talk to each other. You are instantly shown matched people, and then you can send them a friend request, once they accept then contacts details are shared with the both of you.

Good luck everyone! Any questions please ask away :)

I try to work on the site as much as I can in my spare time, so you can expect new features to get released as well. If you're a designer, developer or think you can help with this - please get in contact it'd be great to have some help and feedback.

lonely,Sick of being the villain,"Sick of being the villain - This is a family matter. I’m the youngest out of the 3 siblings, my family kinda sucks. My dad is a total asshole to my mom, he made her suffer a lot, he never defended her against his family, he used to hit her i think, he also didn’t let her work at the time. My mom now is a very rough, angry person. She can’t let anything go, like she makes the fights really long and she always yells, she even explains herself to a random cashier if she doesn’t enter her credit card password wrong and it breaks my heart. At the same time, my mom sees me as the total failure. My sister and brother are in one of the greatest technical school in our country, I was supposed to be a doctor but I just realized I can’t do it, my school is not even that good because I changed my college exam field the last second. She said that I’m her biggest failure a few times and she never ever backs off about this. She thinks I hate her, but she yelled me for weeks and I couldn’t stop crying all days because of her and says stuff like “I must be a horrible person in your mind.” I’m just cold and bitter because she said she’ll never forgive me for not being a doctor and she doesn’t accept me, she tolerates. 

My dad treats me well but at the same time I worth nothing to him. He thinks I can’t do anything. Like I’ll always be the last option at every chore, he sees me as the annoying zoomer who can’t live without her phone. He doesn’t even care about my career plans. I’m really incapable and lacking in his eyes. Everyone in my family seems to think dad spoils me but since I know his real thoughts about me I don’t even take him seriously. 


Everyone thinks I’m the video game addict even though I always take a break when I have something important to do, I don’t even open a computer in my school terms but everyone thinks I’m an addict when my brother who secretly gives money to games, throws tantrums is there. He wasted his college entrance exam years for playing video games, he’s ahead like 70 levels in League but everyone just thinks I’m the addict, if I get angry they think it’s because of the video games. 


I said it before, my dad thinks I’m the zoomer who can’t live without her phone. It’s pretty much everyone, actually. Two days ago, I put everyone’s plate to the table, then started eating. My mom gave a glass of water to everyone except me, she said that I should’ve also put the glasses to the table, for her I just sat and started eating without giving a fuck about everyone else. I was the only one who helped her for the table. They just treat me like I do nothing, I don’t help anything. I’m the youngest, so I know I’m actually more spoiled than I think and I have to do less stuff but it just hurts. No one respects me, no one thinks I’m capable but at the same time they treat me like shit if I ever try to help. I’m really weak compared to them so I can’t carry stuff as they can but I still try my best. Sometimes I just act like that brat they see me as when they disrespect me, I ruin the day for them, I know I’m a bad person for doing this, I feel satisfied and bad at the same time, but then bad feeling takes over and I think I deserve their attitude. 


I’m insufferable, irresponsible for them, I don’t pay attention the things around me according to them. My mom and dad fights for no reason, my dad acts as a passive agressive dick with his words and body language and attitude, my mom snaps and yells and makes everything long and I just don’t want to hear it. Then sometimes my dad yells loudly and I got scared and I don’t want to hear it. Then my mom says things like she’s not that weak person in the past and he can’t lay a hand on her and yells him for yelling her and I don’t want to hear it. My sister snaps and says awful things to dad about how he made mom suffer and I hate being left out because they see me as incapable and narcissistic. If my sister says things about how my mom can’t have anything with yelling she also shames and guilt trips her about this is the only way she can defend herself. My mom goes inside and cries sometimes but I panic, I know she’ll reject me like always so I don’t do anything about it. I hear it, I hate it and I pretend that it doesn’t exist. That’s why everyone hates me. My mom went to my grandma’s summer house and she’s not home. My sister is in charge. Today she cried while hitting me how I don’t care about anything, don’t know anything, don’t do anything, I don’t how she and mom suffers... I was supposed to take my stuff from the balcony and that’s all, I was going to do it soon. She probably snapped to me because my dad bragged it. But I got angry because she hit me, I hit her back and I probably hurt her badly and she started crying so bad, my brother somehow left his video game and tried to hit me for hitting her while making me crawl, saying that I’m awful and all. My sister stopped him, I took my  stuff and put everything back to place. I opened this account specially because I wanted to hide this from my irl friends, now I’m crying alone in my room, I didn’t want to tell them all this stuff. Maybe some of them will see this anyways. I actually don’t care if someone reads this or not. Personally I wouldn’t read it. I just feel lonely. I wanted to tell all this to random strangers. They’re trying to make me the villain so they can shame me and hate me instead of dad. I’m an easy target anyways, I’m weak, I’m emotional, I’m a spoiled brat who can play the part well. I’m probably awful and just whine even though I don’t deserve it. But I still have feelings."
lonely,I always feel so lonely,"I always feel so lonely - I'm  a 20 year old dude in my first year of college because I messed up in  high school and because of my bad grades I've ended up in a college that  isn't big (in both physical size and population of students) like the  other ones nor is it somewhere you can hang out like how other colleges  have a cafeteria and a big campus, etc.

The  college itself is an evening one too and so a lot of older students use  it meaning there's even less people my age I can get to know, and now  because of coronavirus we are doing remote learning for the whole year.

I have 2 people I talk to everyday, one you could consider a friend and the other a very close friend but that's it.

I always feel so loney even when I'm talking to my 2 friends.

Everyone else has such a vibrant social life but I don't :("

Nothing big just a small thing but it's big to me. I started talking to this girl at the start of this school year. I guess because I feel lonely my standards are low and if a girl talks to me consistently I guess I just start liking them. I never wanted to tell her because I feel like it would make our friendship awkward and ruin it. Today she told me that from that morning she felt like she sort've liked me but said it was gross so she was going to block me for the weekend to get over me. She said it was one fo those phases, 1 day crushes. That really hurt but it's a great oppurtunity for me to try to get over her, issue is I know myself and I know I won't. That's why it really hurts and I hate myself for it. Just wanted to share this even if no one reads it. 

TLDR: Crush calls me gross and I get blocked for a while :)"

I do have something I care about and I know what I want to do in the future but I don’t want to do it alone so I don’t think I want to live after highschool. It will only get harder to meet girls and talk to them all I would have is myself and family left. I hope things change I hope I meet a girl but the way things are going right now it doesn’t look like it’s going to change. I’m already a junior so I have a 1 and a half for things to change. If things stay the same I might just end it after highschool.

Yes it’s onlyfans so when meeting a chick ask her if she has an onlyfans. If she says yes then ask her if you can help her film content for her onlyfans whether that be taking pictures for her, recording videos for her, or full on participating like being a male in the video that she can suck or fuck for her onlyfans. And if she says she doesn’t have an onlyfans then ask her have she ever thought of making one and if she says yes then offer to set it up for her and help her with content but if she says no then tell her if she ever becomes interested to hit you up and you can help her record stuff. And keep on doing this to every girl you hit on or become friends with a few is bound to accept your help given how popular and accepted onlyfans is nowadays.

lonely,Can You Ever Forgive Me?,"Can You Ever Forgive Me? - I shouldn't have done it. 
Today was a really shitty day for me, and the main cause was me. First, I cheated on a test and was caught by my teacher, who had high expectations for me and really only wants what is best for me. She has been dealing with a lot lately, and I feel bad for disrespecting her like that. Fuck the grade. She really had a lot of trust in me, and, for her, it was painful to see what I was doing. I asked her for a letter of recommendation, and she was happy to do it...now, probably not. I feel horrible about it. We've had a good relationship for a long time now, and she's helped me a lot with my anxiety and loneliness. And to let her down like this really was fucking dumb of me. I want her to know that I'm hoping against hope that she'll give me another chance, which I admit I don't deserve. But, if she can forgive me, I know I can build that trust again. 
Then, today I told this really annoying chick to shut the fuck UP, and no one likes this girl. Literally NO ONE. She is blatantly rude to EVERYONE, and she's just a fucking bitch. She flips off random people and goes out of her way to piss anyone off. And, I, after telling her to LEAVE ME ALONE, just let loose and yelled at her that ALL ANYONE WANTS is for her to SHUT THE HELL UP and to simply FUCK OFF. That that's ALL. that no one fucking cares what she has to say and that she should fuck off. 
What happened after was...just bad timing. 
Everyone went quiet, and then immediately, people either clapped or shouted compliments/thanks to me. The chick looked around and noticed that people were COMMENDING me because SOMEONE finally told this bitch to shut her damn mouth. She then told on me to a teacher, and I told the teacher that ""hey, I told her to leave me alone and when she didn't, i told her to stop."" 
People were STILL complimenting me about it, and that did NOT help matters. I didnt get into trouble tho...at least not yet, I think, because this chick left school after...before she left tho, she CRIED because she realized that no one actually likes her. She's also a lesbian, but I didnt know that, so I hope she didn't think I was attacking her for being a lesbian/hope she doesn't make it seem like that's why I told her to snuff it. 
So, I disappointed a teacher who thinks very highly of me, and I made a fucking junior cry (I thought she was a freshman, so I felt a LOT of remorse...and then I found out that she is not much younger than me, and I found out that she treats everyone in her social group like dog shit, and thus I lost all remorse). 


Why is this on the lonely subreddit? Because I'm a fucking loser, and both instances reminded me of how I disappoint those who respect me and just let people down. The latter instance reminds me that after 4 years, I'm still the guy who will tear someone up publicly. I've made someone cry EVERY year of high school, and then I wonder why I have NO friends - because I'm a fucking asshat to people at the WRONG times. Truly, I don't think im an asshole. Am I a great person? Ofc not. I dont think I'm a dick tho. Only when I have to be. But people only ever see the asshole in me, not the kindness. And I've just fucked up too many times that I am very scared that I will ruin my new social group - I found a group who isn't all acquainted with my past transgressions and issues, and they think Im alright. I can't fuck this one up. I'm tired of being lonely. To find a group who accepts me for me, accepts me because they don't know the old me...I want that...and I have a chance now. I just have to play it cool.

lonely,i feel overwhelmingly sad and lonely,"i feel overwhelmingly sad and lonely - i am not sure what trigger warnings to write if there needs to be any but uh i guess i am depressed and have had dubious consent in the past.

i feel like i am getting nowhere in my life. i know i don't give myself enough credit for what i AM able to do, but i always feel like i am underperforming/not doing enough. i am currently working 25.5hrs a week at a cashier job and am taking 12 credits at my college which is currently online because of covid. i just transferred after having a very rough first two years at an isolating college. i took a gap year in between those two years and my transfer because i thought i would just go back but then realized how much happier i was not to be there and realized i needed to get the fuck away. i really miss in-person classes. i miss spending time with my peers physically outside/after classes. 

i go back and forth between wishing that i was dating someone and feeling fine not having a significant other in my life. i have not seriously dated anyone since 2017 and i find myself craving an intimate relationship with someone. but then fear that maybe i'm not ready because i might just want a relationship for the purpose of having one. i constantly feel like i am only liked as a sex object and it feels extremely degrading. i don't know where i'm going with any of this but i feel like crying and i guess i want to be comforted. if you read all of this chill. idk. anyways. i'll be okay. i just don't feel okay right now."

It gets better. I felt exactly like you did at that age. And I know, no one usually wants to hear about it from - mom-type figure but seriously. I always longed for friends and dates and stuff, but I was a late bloomer under the thumb of an over protective father. 

So when I got old enough, I made friends with or dated people who were bad for me. I just wanted to belong. But eventually I would end up alone AND betrayed. I wish I’d spent those years learning, traveling, and making real friends. Experiencing things. 

I learned you can’t tie your self worth or happiness on others."

You know that feeling you get when you're just there in your bed all night attempting to sleep but it's just too cold and the thoughts racing in your head just keep on running till the suns out? That's me today, tomorrow, and the month after it. Being lonely isn't not knowing anyone, its feeling like a needle in a haystack, there are needles but you're the only one you'll ever see. I tried joking around but I ended up being bullied and abused which caused me to delete all social media platforms. Downloading them was my biggest regret and the truth is shit is never worth it. Not me, people, you. Nothing is worth it and you'll be there for yourself, no one will ever be standing by your side when you need someone except you. People of the internet, I've given up and no its not like the sky isnt blue or the grass isnt green anymore, i just cant find joy in the things i loved the most. So, ill be staying here all lonely staring at my dark ceiling all cold tonight. I wish that someone would understand me and listen but no one is. So for the next few months, ill be staring at my plain white coloured ceiling in the dark cold nights."

It sucks but I don't feel as bad as I did years ago when the feeling struck me at 21\~22 years old. This year I am 24, no family, no friends, no relationship. People say find the happiness inside, I tried to accumulate hobbies and I actually got really good at them. Let me tell you my experience with it: it doesn't work that well. I forget loneliness momentarily when doing things and when I go to bed it is always the same. Hugging a pillow is enough but nothing I can do to change it. I put myself out there but it doesn't work. I hope one day things will turn around.   
The biggest problem is moving to a country that you know nobody. It is unfortunate.  


For anyone who is in a similar position, I offer you my sincere hug and will be rooting for you in the corner to turn your life around as the way you wish and dream. Let's stay hopeful long enough until things change. Don't get used to being lonely completely, accept people going into your life and you'll make it. If nobody is going in, well, you should work for it yourself.   


Stay healthy, hopeful, and cherish every day because you are alive and can see the sky and trees. Taking a walk in nature with relaxing music or reading under a tree helps to me. I love you all for making me feel less lonely in feeling lonely. At least there is a sense of belonging somewhere in that."

lonely,"22 M Irish, hate my life","22 M Irish, hate my life - Hey guys, so I’m going to be completely honest about what’s happening in my life right now. 

Currently in my third year of college, I’m repeating one module because I failed. Bummed. I’m in debt because the bank cancelled my direct debit without informing me and a big bill came in, struggling to pay it off. Not a huge debt, just about €3k. I’m in court in December for dangerous driving. I was just speeding. Recently moved back into home with a family that hates me. I’m mentally ill (bpd, depression, anxiety and ptsd) but overall I’m a pretty normal guy. 

I like sports, gaming, tv, eating and sleeping. I’m going through an extremely hard time and I often feel like my life is not worth the effort. I’m often high risk for suicide. I feel isolated, alone and constantly on edge. No one or any of my family knows about this. I bottle everything. I only have one parent, my mother and she absolutely despises me. Not sure why but it hurts because she’s my only parent, my father committed suicide. 

What am I looking for? Just some company and someone that’ll be nice to me. It’s something I don’t get much. 

With all of this negativity put aside, I’m actually quite a nice and caring person. I’m mature and somewhat intelligent. I’m not a drug user (username) but I do like to have a doob to calm me down at times. Having a hard time tonight and feeling more suicidal than usual. I’m really trying to hang in there for better days. I’m extremely easy going and I’d love to talk to anyone on absolutely any platform that you’re comfortable with. I know I sound pretty bad in this but I’m worth giving a chance to.

Thanks"

It was intended to make myself feel better, and try to put myself out there and find someone to spend time with, but I don’t feel better at all. The apps make me feel invisible, like I’m just unattractive enough to fly unnoticed by everyone’s radar. It feels like I’m being ignored, and rejected every time I open the apps. It’s not worth it, but people around me want me to stick with it at least for a little while. I have no hope I’m going to be anything more than one more face to swipe left on"

I just say I’m fine most of the time because I know they’re just gonna throw bullshit at my face. Eventually I give in cause I have no one else to talk too. I tell them everything: about how I have no social life, no friends to talk too at school, no siblings who care about what I say, and how it makes me depressed and angry etc. Then they just look at me confused and frustrated as to how that’s possible(because they were the popular kids growing up with normal friendships and family relations and can’t grasp the concept). Then they just shrug it off in their minds and are convinced I’m being delusional and tell me to fix my mindset on the world.

 After leaving my old school (which was struggling to survive), which is where all my old friends used to be but left years before I did, and being stuck with my older siblings at home who think they own me, and having that as my only sense of a social life, telling me that as long as I’m positive and wake up to reality all things will be better(as if I’ve never tried that) is serious bullshit. They think from their narrow mindset that all things work together, if your confident and be yourself, you’ll find acceptance. Sorry, but not all of us are born with and attractive personality and looks and can just soar through life finding someone who likes us around every corner. Sure I have it better than a lot of people, but it pisses me off when someone who I know has a better life than me tells me I have it as good as them."

What really gets me is that I could've prevented ending up like this if I was just a better person when I was younger. I have no one else to blame but myself for this shit. I genuinely don't feel like a human being, how can I say I'm a person worthy of being alive and being loved when I can't even form these intimate connections with others. I'm so depressed and alone and I know that no amount of going to the gym or working hard in medical school will ever fix what's wrong with me.

I'm tired of people telling me being a virgin isn't worth being suicidal over, and I'm tired of people saying I have a mental illness and need help. Anybody would feel the same way if they were put in my shoes. Human beings are not meant to be alone this long, and I know I've probably suffered permanent brain damage and developmental abnormalities from being like this. I absolutely hate my life and no amount of self-acceptance will ever change that. I will never accept that I can be happy being this way when it was my fault I ended up like this. I will carry this pain for the rest of my life, and that genuinely makes me not want to go on anymore."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a 27 female from the UK I'm into

Cosplay

Changing hair colour alot (currently blue)

I play PS4 alot with lots of games I do have an Xbox one but I don't go online with it

Marvel/DC

Space/planets and what could be out there

I watch Netflix alot the things I watch the most are The Umbrella Academy, Doctor Who, Friends, IT Crowd, The Big Bang Theory, Friday Night Dinner and MisFits

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am looking for someone

Age 20+

Is kind

Not impatient 

Who never leaves messages unread or open

Who puts some effort into most of their messages and not leave one word answers or a few words that is hard to reply too

(I understand that people get busy or might not be in the mood to talk and that is totally fine it's just I say the previous two because I've put in effort to make fiends elsewhere recently only to find out they don't want the same as me and they never do any effort back so it felt pointless making it a one way friendship and I've wasted my time)

Who also plays PS4 alot as that would be the main thing to do as I'm on there alot 

Someone with similar interests having different interests is fine but it would make it easier to chat as we have things in common

And finally preferably someone from UK elsewhere is fine too but the UK is ideal because it would be easier to do stuff and I forget about the time zones and I don't want to wake you in the middle of the night or something

If you are serious about wanting a friend as I am then let's give it a try see how we get on if not then good luck in life and I wish you  health and happiness"

Last time, she said hi to me so I said hi back. And right now we're just on a ""saying hi to each other"" basis, as it happened again earlier today. But we still haven't talked or found out each others' names, nothing.

My confidence is under the floor so idk how to even approach this.

Maybe I would feel more comfortable if our teacher didn't also have to be there whenever we meet, but of course she is, since the japanese classes are where we do meet."
lonely,Feeling lost,"Feeling lost - (apologies beforehand this will be a long post as I wish to vent. I'm also on mobile as I'm not sure if that changes the format)

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I need to let out my thoughts. I never discovered how sad I was until my doctor suddenly asked me how I am doing and ""so do you have a best friend?"" to which I came up with  some made up name. I haven't had one for years as she moved away. It hasn't been since February/early March this year since I have talked to another person I know personally face to face. It has been since early May that I no longer have phone service which keeps getting a higher bill as that's the last I have texted a friend. I've never kept any social media for many reasons which would need its own lengthy post but to sum it down, I don't want people to see me as different with my 0 friends on whatever it is and treat me differently or make fun of me because of it. I want to be normal.

Life keeps moving forward while I stay behind. This seems to have been my theme for idk how long. I was always shy and have had bad anxiety kid who was also bullied in school. It didn't help that I had family drama between my mother and father divorcing and dealing with custody bs for several years. I have since left that issue, but I always thought once I graduated I'll be fine. I told myself that a lot. I forget that I'm an adult sometimes as I haven't really changed. I'm doing worse now...I talk to no one let alone see people outside of my family aside from strangers on the streets and at the store. I'm still the shy kid with bad anxiety now people have moved on and have expectations from you to be normal all the while I have trouble just adjusting to everything around me. I cry too much for it to be normal. I shouldn't be so nervous so much or be afraid of what everyone thinks of me. I feel like if I had a friend it would help but I live in a different city this year....and then this year isn't helping 

I can't seem to find a job as I need to earn myself some money but its been over two months applying to every local restaurant, every chain, some warehouse, Target, car wash you name it. I've only had five interviews since and its extremely hard for me not to choke up, not to look anxious, and not to mumble. I am trying and I feel like my family thinks otherwise as I am once again a loser. I already can't stand it when they ask about my friends I don't have. I am though...I am not taking my college classes this semester as I don't have a laptop for online courses...I'm doing nothing besides being alive. I have no job, no money, not doing school, no friends, and have never been in a relationship as I know very well I am not ready to seek one (I doubt I can open up to show intimacy) I'm trying to be happy with my interests but those are all I got aside from my family...but they're basically all busy except for the weekends. But I need to branch out from them too.

I just don't know what it is. I've always been called sweet by people and have been in friend groups before, but I just fade in the background over time and am forgotten. I have never gotten in trouble or even been a part of drama, but maybe I shielded myself too much from others...I am decent looking I guess as I am trying to accept my body and continue to exercise...but I just feel defeated everyday. I'm always asked if I'm in a bad mood or why I don't talk much...and usually I'm not particularly in one and I naturally just don't talk much. This is the most I've talked (or typed) for strangers to see at once all year!

I'm sorry if I sound pathetic. I don't blame anything or anyone but myself for being so weak. I just get nostalgic of happier days, and then realize the sadness that the only people that appear in my dreams are those I knew from high school that I haven't see since...

I have visions of what it'd be like to be happy. What it'd be like later on...I always wanted to be a part of a friend group and travel and have fun with. I remember my childhood best friend and the faint memories of what it's like to have a sleep over, to talk to, and to feel supported. I'd be content even with just one close best friend again. After all the years wanting to finish school, I wish I can be with them all just to listen and feel like I'm a part of something. I've always wanted to live comfortably with a normal social life, I've always wanted to go on a date at a theme park, and I've always wanted to go to a baseball game with my dad. It's just sometimes I feel its impossible to be normal. It's impossible to get better. Some days I wake up and wish that I didn't.

I try to hold onto hope. I know I shouldn't give up, but its just so hard and I'm so weak. I couldn't help myself from crying again right now admitting all of this. And I'm posting this at such an odd time of the day as this is going through my head keeping me awake all night

Idk what kind of ending note I should leave this with but please just be kind to others you never know what their day is like. Thank you to anyone who may have actually read this I might delete it later. I kinda felt comfort in writing it all out :')"

lonely,"If you want to get distracted from the continuous negative, judgmental thoughts on yourself, try to meditate","If you want to get distracted from the continuous negative, judgmental thoughts on yourself, try to meditate - Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state. 

In my case, whenever I feel like my mind is on the fritz (thinking “I’m worthless”, “I don’t like this about me, I don’t like that about me”), I focus on my breath and I realize these thoughts don’t define me and I can live not limited by my damaged self esteem. Loneliness isn’t caused by what’s factually happening right now, no matter what I’m doing, but rather by these judgmental thoughts in my head. But we don’t have to let the thoughts control our lives 

We can just accept the fact that we feel lonely, that’s okay, we’re human; and use that for the betterment of our lives. Let it be your power to be more open to people and get the life you want. If you’re having trouble with social interaction, call a psychologist, book an appointment. If there are people in the world meant to understand what you’re going through, psychologists are definitely at the top. You can succeed if you keep pushing. Try to not let these thoughts control you, you’re way more beautiful inside and you know what you’re really worth ❤️"

Crying have become a daily thing because i feel like i have nobody that wants me any good in this world, feeling lonely. Many people that i know i can write to at any moment, i just don't know how to most of the time.

i want to feel loved because i cant give myself enough to be happy, the foster families i have been in couldnt provide the love a real mom and dad could give. been living in the system for as long as i remember. both of my biological parents are not alive, lost them both when i was 7 years old. 

i have to drown out what i call my loud thoughts with hard rock music so that i dont go and harm myself. its basically just thoughts about my future and what has happend throughout my life

many times ive heard people tell me that happiness and love will come if i just give it time, but i cant wait that long time.... i need love now more than ever. hugs, kisses, cuddles. you name it"

lonely,Loneliness is being happy there's a fly in your room.,"Loneliness is being happy there's a fly in your room. - I am a 43-year-old man. I separated from my wife last November. I have no friends, because I am not a very social person in the best of times, and I live in a foreign country. My job is to talk with people on the phone so that they can practice their English. It's the only social interaction I have apart from talking to/being with my kids. It makes me even more lonely because the people I talk to rarely ask anything about my life. I feel like a mirror. I'm just there to reflect them and help them improve. I don't blame them, but it's not good for my mental health. After my separation, I decided to try to become more social, and the pandemic happened. It's currently getting worse where I live, so social events with strangers are not safe at the moment. I'm not afraid of getting it, I'm afraid it would put me in quarantine, and I don't have anyone who could take of my day to day needs, like getting groceries. I joined a pen pal site, and made one friend, so that's a start. It's just a hard life."

lonely,My Birthday hurts,"My Birthday hurts - I like to think I'm a good friend, even with low self confidence in other areas of my life, I can say for sure, I come through for people.

But I feel like no one cares as much about me as I do for them.

I feel this most when It comes to my birthday.

For the last few years I've dreaded my birthday, knowing it's the day I can feel extremely alone on.

Going back a few years to university,  I was the only person in the shared house that didn't get a birthday party thrown for them.

Even several other people who didn't live there I helped pay and organise some amazing parties for, and when It came to mine no one cared.

I actually spent that year on my own.

I've single handedly thrown Birthday parties for people I barely knew, just because I didn't want them to feel empty on their birthday.

Several of my friends birthdays where recently and despite having lost my job and having no income I hand crafted, saved and scraped up money for presents and organised events to make them feel special. 

And when It comes to my birthday, nothing.

It feeds into this feeling that no one cares about me the way I do for them. I love people in my life so much, and it just hurts.

But especially on this day.

Does anyone else feel this way?"
lonely,Relapsing and descending once again into depression,"Relapsing and descending once again into depression - Usually everything is numb, and honestly life is bearable like that. But every now and then a reality check happens that reminds me how truly miserable I am. The worst part of all of it is observing yourself spiral down into a dark hole that has no end in sight. Slowly embracing sled destructive tendencies because you feel that it just doesn't matter anymore. Normal is usually pain and anything seemingly good becomes suspicious. Asking myself every day what I did to deserve such loneliness and pain, started thinking maybe I was a monster in a past life. I haven't been sober since my last so called reality check, normally I do don't drink a lot but there isn't many other ways for me to cope right now. And here I am again rambling like a madman wishing I had a different life. For everyones sake that is on this sub, I really hope we all find purpose, meaning, and happiness. Yet again hope is dangerous"

lonely,my personal peak loneliness,"my personal peak loneliness - I'm gonna try to keep this short as I tend to over explain. I joined a stream community last year and met my boyfriend through that. After streams the streamer joins the voice chat channel in discord, this is the general channel and pretty much anyone in the server can join. Right now my bf, the streamer, and my bf's friend are in there playing a game but a few others have popped in and out. How do I know that you may ask? I've been watching it the whole time, it's been like 2 hours and I've been watching who is in the chat from the outside. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do this a lot, I keep the discord open on another tab and I stay awake watching who is in it, wanting to join but being way too anxious. I watch people join and leave and sometimes keep up with the memes they post in the channel created for the voice chat. I watch the public info, like looking in a window. If there's ever a time to join one it's tonight, only 3 people in it and 1 I'm super comfortable with but no, my brain won't let me. I just watch from the outside wishing I had the courage to even just ask to join. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I do this it feels very sad and lonely, I always assume they're having a lot of fun, of course I hope they are I just wish I was brave enough to join because lurking from the outside is the loneliest I ever feel."

All of my friends that I’ve had for years have cut me off, being in Los Angeles we’re still pretty restricted due to the pandemic so my day to day doesn’t involve much except trying to workout. I was really bothered by losing the only friends I had but I’m at a point where I just don’t feel anything anymore. I haven’t spoken to anyone since June, everyday feels the same. I don’t have any friends and I noticed I find myself just spacing out in my own thoughts a lot more than I ever used to. Like going to the grocery store, I’ll get in the car and just space out and be deep in thought for a while before even starting the car. I don’t know if I should be worried that I feel nothing, but it’s just that, not sad, and not happy.."

Not to mention that I just got out of a hookup relationship that made me feel uncharacteristically depressed, so i’ve rejected my only friends and absorbed myself in guitar.

Literally for one of them, we only had our mutual disgust and general dislike of her cousin. I’m aware being nerdy in an area with nothing but country girls is a solvable issue, but I don’t know where I’m going to end up after college. Hell, I’m still worried about being stuck in my crap ass current job for the rest of my life. I just don’t know how people can’t date. It’s such an insurmountable asylum darkening my perception."

I have blocked so many guys on here that aren’t loyal, have no compassion, or just are bullies about the way I live my life. I wear my heart on my sleeve and I want to keep it that way. I know that intrudes on most guys’ sense of masculinity, but they don’t have to be rude about it. It really hurts. Just say, “we’re not compatible” and move on. Don’t be mean.

I know these dudes, we sometimes play together and the dude that invited me is a friend of my cousin he knows me for years.

So I join the server, and I'm like ""Hello guys"" and they respond with a warm ""Welcome Peter"" and ""Nice he is here we are all here"" etc. Not 1 minute later I talk and none talks back to me.
 So the dude that invited me suggests that they play another game (league of legends) together 3 v 3 in a custom lobby instead of among us. 

They literally planned the rest of the night without me not 1 minute after I joined with their invite while I was there listening. I awkwardly laughed and just when I was about to ask if I can join they all quit the call at the same time without saying a word. That was cold. 

Anyway I texted the dude and asked what is going on and he didn't even respond he left me on ""seen"". 

I don't get it if you hate me why invite me in the first place? Why is this happening to me all the time? My day was depressive as usual but after that the sorrow ate me alive. I couldn't help it I cried again. The black goo is a hell of a sickness. Sorry for length and bad grammar I'm not a native English speaker.

TL;DR They invited me to a discord call and when I joined they immediately decided to ignore me and quit the call, all at the same time."

Addicted to pornography, not even one good relationship (any of those that were good I stopped for no good reason) and not being able to work on my hobby becouse of the countless distractions on my phone and computer.

I watched a documentary about Bobby Fisher recently. And tossing his lunacy aside, his sheer dedication to work on something for so long just made me realize how incompetent I am, still not even close to achieving anything of note.

I heard enough times to just do it, just start etc etc but it all goes down the drain very quickly. And I think it's becouse I feel lonely.
Most of my day is spent inside, so maybe if I had someone who I love to support me, and for me to have someone to support back Ill probably feel way more liberated and just.. happy. At least I think that's the case.
I can't seem to find any other deep sources of all of that crap.
So.. I don't know why I'm even rambling about all of this. Maybe I can ask how do I limit my internet consumption?

I just can’t seem to open up to others and I don’t really want to. Everyone always ends up leaving so it’s like what’s the point. In the past every time I put in effort the other person never did. There is this one guy I often find myself thinking about, he was a coworker of mine and he would always text me. I loved the attention but I never took him seriously because I knew he didn’t take me serious. I ended up leaving him on read because I knew he was just messing around. But it still hurts that I have never met someone willing to take me serious. It’s almost like I’m not good enough to be loved. I just hate feeling like this. I hate feeling vulnerable. I wish I didn’t crave intimacy but at the same time despise it. I guess the holidays make it worse and seeing all the couples on social media make it worse. I sound so bitter lmaoo I’m not. I just want to experience that at least once."
lonely,I hate my birthday,"I hate my birthday - I just need to get this off my chest. Today is my birthday and since many years ago I cry on this date, every single time. My birthday just reminds me how insanely lonely I am, and it hurts so much. Of course my family congratulate me and i appreciate it but you know... it’s a very dysfunctional family anyways and everyone wants a life out of the family. Every October 8th my heart aches, more than usual. I hope one day that changes."

lonely,I hate seeming cheesy but,"I hate seeming cheesy but - I’ve met someone and we just had our first date the other day after months of feeling lonely. He’s the first guy I seem to have stuff in common with, whether it’s tv shows, we are both family oriented or the way we both love affection and kissing. Not the type I’ve dated before but maybe that’s why my last relationships have failed; I had nothing in common with exes. I can just mention a quote from a tv show we both love and it gets us talking for ages. 

So don’t want to seem too eager but it’s difficult not to be, ahaha. I want to play it cool but at the same time show i like him. 

Just posting it here because everyone has hope. I still have no friends, my family I don’t often get on with, but here’s someone who has chosen to enjoy spending time with me. Let’s hope it lasts :p"

Screaming. 

Over constant rejection
Over unrequited love. 
Over past failures.
Over the loss of innocence.
Over unattainable... Lasting happiness...


Because you abandoned me... Even when I pleaded... Even when I begged...Even when I refused to give up... you gave up on me.

I have friends (around 4 people I consider best friends and then just normal friends I see at school and at hangouts through mutual friends) and I actually hang out with them quite often. I also direct message/group chat with them at least once a day, usually. But I have social anxiety so I am always stuck wondering if they really care about me, and I’m always hung up on the fact that they may like their other friends a lot more and don’t think about me much. I try my best to ignore my thoughts and initiate plans, go to plans, be open and happy with my friends etc. but sometimes the thoughts get ahold of me and I’m left feeling lost and abandoned. I think people are being distant and I don’t even know if it’s reality or my own thoughts... my friends do nice things for me often and do things to show they care. And I feel good about it until I realize they text way more with another friend or something like that. I’m just stuck in a silly game of comparison and it makes me feel incredibly, incredibly lonely. The scariest part is that I don’t know if it’s all in my head or if this is reality and I need to move on and find new friends..."

Literally I have been checking in and out of post but no one reply’s . Is that a thing or something?. Maybe everyone’s advice is trash or maybe people just don’t feel like replying back to someone . But they feel like typing ? It’s like they want to be heard but don’t want to hear other people ? Maybe that’s why they are lonely ? Cause they only care about what they think but don’t really care about what anyone else thinks . Just a thought ? I mean if you are truly lonely then it won’t matter who speaks to you . You would just be glad to speak to someone . But I feel like these people want a certain response from that someone and that someone isn’t giving it to them so if it’s not them who they want to speak to .. then it’s no one .

After a day of that, she started ""feeling"" bad since my dog was gonna get shot if he didn't got his rabies shot in which he did. I wanted to come over to her house because I was lonely at school and i needed someone to talk to. However, she said to come over on Sunday since we're making cookies with her sister's two other friends. I didn't wanted to go at first because I don't like being around people I'm not comfortable with, but I think it would be fine since it's just cookies. She texted me on messenger non-stop till past my bedtime about her crush that moved and I told her that he still likes her. Now, she wants to invite him over for cookies on Sunday instead of me. Her mom only allows her to invite one person. She admitted that she wants him over more than me. I'm feeling that she's just using me as a vent or someone to talk to about their OWN PROBLEMS. She only talks about herself but never even bothers to ask how I really feel. What should I do?"

Now I'm facing a similar situation. I have only 2 close friends now and one of them started acting weird lately. Turns out shes upset that I didn't wanna go with her to meet her boyfriend and his friends and shes kinda bringing random stories and incidents together and she wants to stop prioritizing me and being my friend.

lonely,Recovering alcoholic,"Recovering alcoholic - I drive an 18 wheeler 70 hours a week. I’m 26m and I lost my girlfriend at the same time lockdown started. It was a toxic relationship for both of us due to our own personal issues with mental illness. 

I haven’t had a friend in 3 years, and I have never had a real/close friend that wasn’t just someone that I drank with. I alienated myself from everybody. I only speak when at work or when I need to. 

I’ve tried so hard to reach out to people, but when I start to reach out I get anxious. I think about how many times and ways that I’ve been rejected. I think in a way I’m traumatized by my own thoughts and perception of events. 

I don’t know how to speak to people anymore. I try to imagine what normal people talk about.

I have started therapy, however the road is long and intimidating. I don’t know when I’ll ever feel normal.

lonely,scared for myself,scared for myself - Recently I’ve been experiencing a lost of appetite. To the point where I didn’t eat anything at all yesterday barely any water. I already have anemia and not completely intentionally forget to drink my iron pills. Yesterday i was showering with a someone and i guess the heat was just too much that i ended up passing out twice in the shower. I have no memory I completely blacked out but when the person tells me what happened i feel so embarrassed and i am not sure how to act or feel right now. We are close its not that i felt unsafe around them i just feel so embarrassed by the whole situation and having put them in the position of witnessing that. I am scared because i have never felt so weak i was unable to move and couldn’t walk on my own. (First time i have been scared to go to sleep and unsure if i would wake up). I am having a hard time understanding the person i am today and why I’ve chosen to not take my pills and take better care of myself i am just not sure where to start and how to address the situation that happened yesterday. My head goes directly to not wanting the other person to feel a certain way about me or think i have some type of disorder why cant i care about myself first?

He said I was amazing and that he wants to be more open emotionally and that he’s trying. 

After hearing that, I felt something break inside. I knew he was holding back but at the same time it fucking hurt to hear it.

I felt so bad and so lonely all at once cause for once I thought, maybe just maybe, this guy would actually want to be with me.

I made the decision to acknowledge the two of us as a fling until he sorts himself out. He agreed but I hate it so much. I like him and he makes me feel good but after this? I just feel like crap and I feel myself being openly distant and for him it’s a 180 where he’s being affectionate and calling me pet names.

Why would he do that? That just makes me feel 10x worse.

I have very few friends and I can’t exactly make any right now because of covid. I always get sad thinking about how some other people have kissed and cuddled another person. 

I’m very affectionate and would live to have someone to give it to. I’m as affectionate as I am horny (very) and having no one to share that with makes me very sad. 

I’ve only ever had a couple people show interest in me and they were all creepy and abusive. I just want a bf/gf who I can be myself around and who will make me feel special and loved and I can do the same for them.

One of these is certainly their staunch ability to withstand disaster and to let the stream of their life carry them along, past reaches of terror and loss. They have a certain quality which it would not be accurate to describe as callousness or indifference. It is, rather, a blessedly circumscribed imagination and an intuitive feeling that Life is Now. A foraging wild creature, intent above all upon survival, is as strong as the grass.

it's so conflicting but when i feel alone and empty and whatever it's really bad. no amount of reason can stop those thoughts and feelings (even when a relationship sounds awful, i still feel like i need it) and i hate it.

I also can't help but see the flaws in them and I wonder if we would continue meeting up after school is over.

I also distrust my classmates and wonder about their motives. I don't pursue friendship with some of them because I am so afraid of the friendship falling apart just because my mood is different on some days.Because of this, I am a loner in class. It also exhausts my energy to talk to them, so I usually keep quiet most of the time. Though I do try to make an effort, but once I see any sign that the person doesn't want to talk, I don't feel like continuing to try.Does anyone feel like this?This also happened to me in secondary school.I'll just not feel like talking. I just kind of feel trapped, my thoughts are like : I can't talk to this person in front of me because then the person next to me will wonder why I'm not talking to her.But then I can't talk to the person next to me because she doesn't seem to want to have a friendship.It's damn hard trying to battle these thoughts daily."
lonely,How much i'll have to handle this,"How much i'll have to handle this - Long story short, outside i'm seen like the smart and kind guy who has good grades, laughs to everything and likes to help others, but deep inside i'm so dead, alone and depressed. I'm actually so lost in life, the few of my friends (who are few years younger than me) already have plans for the future, some of then already do what they like, have girlfriends or someone to go in life and in general been doing good while here i'm having constant existential crisis and never had any kind of a relationship or close contact with a girl (i don't blame them, i'm really ugly, socially ankward and stupid so i deserve it).

I'd like to believe there's real love out there, but simply to me is not existant, i hate myself for everything and i feel like i'm doing all of this for attention so i learned to hide all of my suffering to everyone. I don't really think words can really fix how lonely and sad i feel in this life, and i don't want to take antidepressants anymore, that's a really hard thing to do to me and makes me feel like l'm more trash than i am, i really came to the conclusion that i'll never be happy and i totally deserve it for being like this, which not gonna lie makes me scare of myself, since my biggest fear is end up alone in life because of my unstable mental health and it's slowing happening, and i can't really do anything to change it. 

Writing all of that retrospect of my shitty life was really hard, to be honest, i don't know why i'm doing this, at the very least i can make the others happy, which they deserve it for what they have been doing."
lonely,"I’ve honestly never been so starved for a conversation, interaction, attention, human affection or touch.","I’ve honestly never been so starved for a conversation, interaction, attention, human affection or touch. - I’m over 6 weeks into my freshman year of college. I never had many friends to talk to but I had my mom to talk to after school. I can’t say she was ever too affectionate aside from an occasional hug. I’ve never had a girlfriend so it’s not like I’m getting attention or affection from a significant other. I miss my pets because they were almost therapeutic in that sense. I have a dog and a cat that I could hug, hold, pet and take care of but now im away at college. I always have done my own thing instead because I never had anyone else so it helped me become more independent. I never have enjoyed being the center of attention but it would be nice to be acknowledged once in a while by another person. I don’t know anyone at college and I haven’t really met anyone and it’s been so difficult with covid. Some days I literally will have almost 0 social interaction. I attend my zoom calls for the day and most of the time it’s just the teacher talking so I’m not actually interacting. After I’m finished with my zoom calls I go to the library where I do my work and assignments. After I’m finished I’ll get something to eat at the cafe. This is where my only interaction of some days take place. I tell them what I’d like, the cooks give it to me and I thank them. Then I go back to my dorm because there isn’t anywhere else to go or any activities really with covid. I haven’t really been able to meet anyone in my res hall. Some of the people seem to already know each other so it’s not like they are looking for a friend. I’m not saying I’m considering taking my life or anything yet but I’ve had some bad thoughts emerge over the past couple of weeks. Im tired of being alone. I don’t even know why I should continue though tbh. I have no friends or a significant other to live for. I don’t have many close family members. Nobody would really miss me and I can say that confidently. If this is what my life is going to be like I honestly am not going to want it for much longer. I know life is a gift but mine has been miserable and lonely lately as pathetic as it sounds. I don’t make it any easier on myself because I’m a pretty private person who is slow to open up to people. I am known to be pretty outgoing around people who I get to know but I don’t open up right away to new people. I mean it doesn’t matter due to the fact I haven’t been able to even really meet new people anyway. If I’m being honest I literally hug my pillow as I sleep because it’s the closest thing I can get to simulating something like touch or a hug.I came into college hoping I’d be able to make friends and meet new people and it has been the complete opposite and taking it’s toll on me."

I suffer from social anxiety and other mental illnesses from abuse in my past. It's extremely difficult for me to get close to people but I tried.

I signed up for a club at my university and made friends. We weren't that close but I know I could talk to them. I wasn't just a bystander anymore. I wasn't invisible like I was before. Most of the time I just met them during club meetings but I met two of the other members in private.

I got extremely close with one of them and even considered a relationship. And then everything went wrong.
Covid hit and everyone left the city to stay with family during lockdown. And no one contacted me. I tried to reach out but my messages were ignored. I wasn't mad and just waited because it was a difficult time for everyone.

We are back at uni now and still no one cares. We had an online club meeting with another club where I discovered that everyone from my club is together at the house of the person I got so close with. It's ten minutes away from me and no one asked if I wanted to come as well.

I feel so hurt and lost. Like everything was a lie and they just spent time with my out of pity. I wish I could run away and hide from everyone and never come back. 
I'm not mad at them. It's their right to not invite me. But it hurts so much that I'm not good enough again."

lonely,1,"1 - I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I turned 20 a little while ago and I’ve never felt so lonely and jaded in my life. I’ve suffered from selective mutism since I was in preschool and I’ve never been able to form very good connections with anyone in my life. I have this self hatred that I don’t understand. Like I loath being alive and being myself. I’ve seen people talk about being alone and everyone always says try to improve yourself so I do that. I lost 100 pounds and am in the best shape of my life and I’ve never looked better, but it doesn’t make me feel better I just feel empty still. It’s been a couple months since I’ve  spoken to someone in person or anyone’s talked to me. Every night I walk home from my gym I cross this bridge that goes over the interstate and every single time I just think about throwing my self off it. It’s been getting worse lately. Tonight I just kind of stared off the edge for 15 minutes weighing my options. The only reason I haven’t is because there’s the tiniest part of me that has hope that I can integrate into society like a regular person. However I keep getting older and no matter how hard I try it never works out and I keep getting more detached. Sorry for posting this but I just needed to get this off my chest and I don’t have anyone."
lonely,I need a hug.,"I need a hug. - I’ve been hospitalized on a mental health ward since January. When I was admitted I had a boyfriend who I cared about deeply and a friend I absolutely loved platonically. In March I broke up with my boyfriend and I ended up cutting things off in June because of some personal issues. It hurt a bit but it didn’t hurt that much because I was mostly angry and relieved.

In May my best friend texted me. The person I called my soulmate, who I loved immensely, who had been there for me and mostly visa versa for years, who I cuddled with and kissed platonically, told me they couldn’t bear to be my friend anyomore.

I fucked everything up. I didn’t communicate enough, I was distant, I had problems setting boundaries with my ex that made my best friend feel left out, I forgot to respond or left them on read. I was a terrible friend and I deserved what I got.

And now I have no one. I’ve started school in person but everyone there is bonding over smoking weed or drinking. They’re meeting up after school which is something I’m often either too tired to do or my parents won’t allow me to do. I hang around these people but I always feel like a tag along. I barely talk, I leave early at lunch to get to school on time instead of being late, I’m always walking at the back of the pack.

I wish I could have my best friend back but it would be unfair to them to try to rekindle our friendship when I can’t actually promise I’ll be better.

I miss having close friends. My family feels suffocating, as much as they try to be supportive. I feel trapped and I’m so lonely.

I just want hugs. I want someone to cuddle me. I want someone to stroke my hair and kiss me on the nose or the forehead. I want someone to watch tv shows with, I want someone who will tolerate when I pause a scene just to rant about how much I love it or hate it.

Sorry if this doesn’t make sense, I’m not proofreading this I was just kind of putting words down.

P.S I’m a minor so please don’t pop into my PMs to be creepy."

I've been talking to this girl for a while. We aren't dating, she says she wants to work up to that, yet is also saying she wants this to be a ""forever thing"". I said it back and didn't mean it because she was upset and scared that if anything bad happened I'd be able to move on. We don't know each other well enough to say that, and the way things have gone I wasn't planning on it being forever.

There are issues that we are working through, but there's no assurance that we'll ever be on the same page of the same book. There are also core issues that won't change that are making me distant.

I don't want to be alone again, I can't do it. But I don't want to be in a relationship that's solely based on me not being able to handle the crippling loneliness anymore. Im not a particularly viable partner, this is the closest thing to a girlfriend I've ever had. And if I try to talk to her about it, she'll turn it into how much of an asshole I am and throw a pity party. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

It feels like I have to pretend to my family and friends that I'm fine when I feel hollow. With my ex it was awful. She made me feel worthless and was very controlling, but I still like her somehow. Even after I found out she was having multiple affairs with my friends I still can't seem to absolutely hate her. It's like I'm trying to see the good in her even though I know there's nothing there. After her and the affairs I also don't trust people enough to try and get back in the game so to speak. I don't feel like myself. It didn't help that so much happened this year as well. My childhood dog and my grandfather passed away. I also found out that my 5th grade teacher, who I used to idolize and spend a lot of time with, is a pedophile. I'm just tired of all of this.

It happens every so often that I’m unable to contain my true self and I break down. I feel worthless all the time, I feel like I never do anything right. I tell myself that I’m ugly and fat and no one could ever want me or love me, and those who do are just using me for there own benefit. 

I hurt myself because I feel like it’s what I deserve. I don’t cut myself but I have scars from the past that show me I have have and could still steep that low again. Mainly I just hit myself until I can’t deal with the pain anymore. 

But today I looked at my scars and though they are faded I felt almost a desire to make them more prominent, I wished people could see the real me and how fucked up I really am, how I’m not the overjoyed happy person everyone thinks I am. I wish people could see the real me and help me, but I’ve played it off for to long. Would anyone really believe me, or would they think I was just seeking attention. Would they judge me?

If I was gone tomorrow would any of them really see it coming? Of course not. It’s always the same thing. I never saw it coming. She didn’t have any of the signs. She was the happiest person. 

But do any of them really try so see. Everyone is so caught up in there own business, covid, losing jobs, paying bills, living there own life’s, why should I put my darkness on then when they have there own problems. 

I’ll continue on my own, pretending to be the person that everyone thinks I am. Hopefully one day I’ll find someone who can see the darkness in my eyes, and see the real me hiding under this fake me."

lonely,Been waiting a long time.,"Been waiting a long time. - Feel free to ignore this post, this won't be anything special and there are other lonely souls here who deserve more attention, I'm mostly just rambling here.





I've felt suicidal and very depressed to varying degrees for seven years. Rarely does anything good in my life ever stick, no friendship has ever stayed good, I haven't had a proper relationship and I'm not the most desirable. Generally speaking I have absolutely nothing about myself that makes me special or unique, I have no talents or anything I'm actually good at and none of my hobbies or interests ever stay consistent. While I know this is pretty common for a lot of people I have found very little sustainable joy in pretty much anything at all.

I often feel as though my purpose to most people is to fulfill a need of theirs. To be more specific, I feel like with a lot of people that I'm only around because I'm needed in some way, not because I'm really wanted. I feel like if someone talks to me, chances are it's because they want someone to talk to rather than they want to talk to me. Take that sort of idea and you can apply it to more things, that's sort of what I'm on about what my purpose is. The variables and circumstances can differ greatly but those kind of things have caused me a lot misery  I'm not sure if that makes sense but I hope it makes at least some.

This year has been the worst for me so far and not because this year on its own or any personal crisis but rather what it's amounted to. Most social aspects of my life have staggered greatly since last year and have continued to decline to this day. I feel as though very few in my life actually make an effort for me, regardless of how much I have tried. I do not feel close to anyone in my life and I had my heart broken pretty hard and that meant nothing. Strangely enough lockdown and self isolation have been very minor factors in my plight although it has lead to previously mentioned social aspects worsening.

I have waited a long time for things to improve in a legitimate/long term way but nothing has. I have been somewhat patient about it and don't intent to stop it's just it would be nice to have something. I'm pretty tired of hearing the same things, I get a lot of pity and while I completely get that it's very well meaning it's just kinda tiring and patronising at points to hear repetitive things that come from people who just don't seem to understand completely.

None of this is to say that my suffering is entirely not my fault as it is probably mostly mine.

I don't think I will ever end up doing anything damaging or fatal to myself for a few reasons, one being that I'm legitimately too weak to harm myself properly, I have tried on my upper arm (so I can hide it easily) several times and my hand one time and I can never do anything that actually leaves any noticeable marks or damage and while this can be seen as a positive in one perspective, to me it just reinforces that I'm pretty useless. Another reason is that I'm a coward, I have very little courage to do anything that bad to myself out of a paranoia that I'll mess up in some way which ties into my last reason which is that I'm too picky on how I would take my own life, like really really fucking picky, the circumstances I would have to be in are near impossible.

I don't want to potentially make anyone afraid, especially considering I'm just a stranger. I don't have any real intention of taking my own life, I really really don't want to hurt my family, they've suffered enough as it is."

I’ve read a lot of posts in FA about men getting suicidal because of their lack of confidence and perceived lack of “attractiveness” and I have a question for u guys.

lonely,Dangerously comfortable with loneliness,"Dangerously comfortable with loneliness - I was always outgoing and extroverted. Throughout elementary school, middle school, and the beginning of high school I made friends so easily and was usually the entertainer of my friend groups. I grew very insecure by the 8th grade but still had friends and a social life. Something changed. For the last 2 years almost I haven’t had any friends. Only one guy but that was toxic so we don’t talk anymore. I wanted girl friends and a group of friends. I recently moved to a different state with my mom and younger sister and haven’t made one friend the entire time we’ve been here. I am constantly alone. I get little to no social interaction and I’ve become so nervous, so weird and hyper aware. I’ve lost all of my confidence and rarely feel comfortable. When people I knew from high school reach out to me and try to hang out with me I get so scared I just don’t do it. I’d rather be alone where I’m safe. I have so much anxiety and I’m just so depressed. I feel like not having any friends for so long made me socially inept and now I don’t act the same, don’t know how to talk to people anymore. I wish I just had one close friend. I don’t even know who I am anymore. Anyone else feel this way?"

lonely,Why me? why do I always get disrespected and used?,"Why me? why do I always get disrespected and used? - Today I realised just how lonely I am in university. I mean yes I have a “group” but I don’t have someone inside that I’m particularly close to, I think they just tolerate me. 

Today I went to the toilet without locking my laptop. I mean I was sitting with some part of the “group”, and the thought that they were going to do what they were gonna do didn’t even cross my mind. Came back and saw them looking at my chat messages, specifically the one I had with another member of the “group” who wasn’t there. Don’t really what they were looking for and what other chats they had also looked at. It was only later at night I found out they had also impersonated me and messaged the boy I had ended things with. Saying things like “hi I wanna talk” which made things so awkward???!! Well lesson learnt, now I know to never leave my laptop unlocked again.

Worse part is that one of the girl just msged me saying “oi im sorry” whilst sitting next to me. The other 2 didn’t even say anything. Maybe I’m being dramatic but I felt so disrespected and violated. To them it probably didn’t even mean anything and I think they won’t even rmb this in the future. Why am I so hung up on something so seemingly trivial?? 

I told the girl in the “group” whose chat they were looking at about this but she didn’t even feel angry on my behalf. Didn’t want to tell the others as I didn’t want to start drama but I at least expected her to be a little annoyed. Well guess what, she and the girls who violated my privacy has since been closer than ever. That makes where I stand super obvious does it not :) 

Today I went home and waited till my mum was sleeping before cutting myself. I have so much pent up anger and I don’t have anyone to open up to. I’m kinda angry at myself for cutting but on the other hand I understand why I’m doing this. Oh wells at least I forgot about the anger for a moment."

lonely,The Truth About Loneliness,"The Truth About Loneliness - Ive been on this group a while and the negativity is something else, with good reason, so I've tried to be positive in this, and I'm going to try and give a quick summary on what loneliness is. For those who haven't seen the Kurzgesagt video, here's a brief explanation about the biological nature.

Since the dawn of time we're social creatures. Our interactions with other humans are just like eating food, breathing and drinking water. What happens if you're starving, dehydrating or suffocating? Your body floods you with hormones in the same way as if you're being chased by a snake to try and stimulate it. Helps you catch that deer, run away from that bear, swim to the surface, run to the pond. However in the modern day, many of these hormones have the same effect. They make you paranoid.

This same thing happens with a lack of interaction. You go into overdrive. You begin micro-analysing every little expression but most of the time, this backfires. The body gets worse at interpreting social interactions and turns pessimistic, you misinterpret good or neutral expressions for neutral or negative. As a result it gets worse, your body continues to tell you you're doing something wrong. But not how to fix it. This causes a feedback loop, and can negatively affect life expectancy, as many of those hormones cause harm in prolonged doses.

I would recommend you watch the Kurzgesagt video on YouTube. Just type 'What is Loneliness Kurz' he explains it a lot better than me. He also offers some basic solutions, and you never know, you might find some of his other stuff interesting."

since then, it’s just been really lonely. because of covid i can’t see the family i have here as they’re high risk. i still haven’t made any new friends, and my family back home don’t talk to me unless i reach out to them first. i really wish i could talk to him. he’s with someone else now and i’m glad he’s happy. i just miss having a friend there and someone who understood me. 

its starting to get to me. i can’t sleep because of how i feel. i’ve been thinking of trying the dating apps, but i’m terrified. ive been taken advantage of because i don’t see warning signs before and i don’t want that to happen again. plus i’m super particular about germs (have emetophobia and when i’m close to someone i end up forcing my strict handwashing ways on them which pisses people off). just wish i had someone to go on cute hiking dates and listen to music with."

and i feel so incredibly lonely because of this. i feel like no one will truly like me because sooner or later they'll get bored of me, because i'm so uninteresting. because i lack something. i thought i was okay wirh being alone, but feeling this lonely is making me miserable. i just want someone to be there and hug me"

I stumbled on an ASMR video on YouTube today. Nothing particularly NSFW, mostly just a comforting female voice. The problem is I've been so starved of intimacy and non-platonic affection for so long that this taste, as artificial as it was, felt so good. For a moment. Then I felt more empty than I've felt in a long time.

I'm still living with my family, and they show nothing but me love and support. I have a close network of friends that I've known for years, and have regular online catch up meetings with colleagues at work. I know I have it so much better than so many other people, so why do I feel so isolated?"

lonely,I have never felt so alone in my life,"I have never felt so alone in my life - Hi everyone! I tried to write this post many times but it always sounded like I was looking for pity or just nagging. 

I am a 23 yo girl. In the last two years I ""lost"" a lot of friendships along the way.
The girl that was supposed to be my best friend of 9 years ""ghosted"" me (I don't even know if it makes sense in this context) after she started dating one of my friends. 
My group of friends excluded me once I moved in a new city to study, not calling me to go out when I was here or just ignoring my messages when I proposed to got out. Some of them were male friends that lost interest in the friendship when they fully understood there wasn't going to be anything more; some were just some superficial ""group"" friends. I tried to reach out with some of them in the past to rebuild bridges but it just made me feel more lonely and stupid to notice how little they cared.

I tried to create new relationships in the new city but after less than 1 year the lockdown brought me back in my hometown. I can say I have 2 real friends from the city I used to live in and some friends from my year abroad I talk to sporadically. I wouldn't know who to call just to go and grab a coffee here. It's been like this for months and I don't know what to do anymore. Since in the last 3 years I was always busy with university and living abroad, I never really had the time to fully metabolize it, but being stuck at home in my hometown during quarantine really threw it in my face. 

I don't have a stable relationship right now, I go out with guys I meet on apps but I understood that's not really what im looking for at the moment. I have to live here with my family at least until January and I don't know how to meet new people because of the Corona situation. I'm writing my dissertation for my master and don't have to go to classes anymore. The job I'm doing is also online and will end soon, without even meeting my coworkers in person. 
I'm living a very alienating life, which brings me anxiety, panic attacks and anger episodes against my family. 

I really feel stuck, like my life is just waiting for other 4 months to just ""happen"" as these last 8 have, to finally start to meet new people. I feel like a loser and I don't know what to do."

lonely,I always wonder if there is something wrong with me,"I always wonder if there is something wrong with me - I am F/19. It took me several years to understand what people meant with feeling lonely in a crowded room. I am surrounded by people, and yet I feel like none of them are there for me.

Around two years ago I met this girl who I consider being my best friend, but for the past year I have felt really lonely by her side. I do and give my everything for her while I get nothing in return. I tried meeting up with her during my worst times but she always declined, even though I was always clear on why I even wanted to meet up with her. I spend all my days alone at home, because I have nobody I could talk to, have fun with, enjoy nice time outside. My friend was a couple days ago clear about not wanting to meet up with me. All she talks about is how excited she is about moving in with her boyfriend to the other end of the country, and I feel like an awful friend for wanting her to break up with him. I never told her about this, but it wouldn't her bother anyway, because he always comes first. It was actually since she started dating him that I fell out of her picture.

I eventually started losing all hope for a better friendship for us. It feels way too one sided. But it's unbelievable to see how a person close to you can make you feel so lonely.

I see all those people around who spend their days and nights outside with their friends and having, and it always makes me question everything. How can they do this? How are they able to just become friends with everyone? Is there something wrong with me?

And what makes me feel even worse is that I feel ungrateful for crying about something like this, but I can't help it. I feel like there is an empty space in my heart and I just want to fill it up with just one person.

I don't even ask for a group of people to come and talk to me all day long. I just want one person to be by my side, who doesn't leave me.

has anyone ever felt the same?"
lonely,I swear mood swings can be bipolar sometimes,"I swear mood swings can be bipolar sometimes - Like, I was heading into bathroom and I did a floss dance therein and I DEADASS CAME OUT THINKING if I'll ever get the love of my life, sad, depressed, staring at my pitiful-self in the mirror."
lonely,I have friends but I’m missing something,"I have friends but I’m missing something - Lately the loneliness and depression is getting to me. It’s not because of quarantine, because these feelings have always been with me, but due to something that happened very recently my self confidence is at an all time low. 

Some background info, for the longest time my romantic relationships with people would always end up in me getting hurt in the end. Usually in these relationships, I’d show more interest and care for them, and they therefore get bored of me with time. Because of this I believe there’s something wrong me, it makes me feel undesirable, unwanted, and unloved. Why am I always loving others more than they love me?

The recent event that made these feelings even worse is my ex coming back into my life. I initiated the breakup out of fear that he didn’t love me anymore, so I did it before he did, he confirmed it when he told me he was going to break up with me. It’s been several months and now my ex is back into my life but now again I’m feeling so fucking stupid because he’s told me he’s talking to a girl and I’m still in love with him. It’s like a double whammy, deja vu all over again. It makes my feelings 10x worse because it just confirms every doubt I’ve had of myself. 

No one takes me seriously as much as I take them seriously. I just crave love where it’s mutually shared the same amount, I’m always the one who isn’t loved back."

What do I do? - I've had this crush on this girl since 8th grade, and I feel like I love her more than life itself. Her presence makes me so happy but it brings pain at the same time cuz we drifted apart really badly. That's due to me ruining any kind of friendship I ever had with her. She knows that I liked her back then but doesn't know that I like her now. I mean she had a crush on my bestfriend which made me fall into this dark state of depression but still I love her. She is my everything but I'm just an extra in her life. I talked to her last week for the first time in 7 months. In those 7 months not a day has gone by without me thinking about her I swear. So imagine my happiness that she talked to me, just to come to the realization that  I love her and that shell never love me or appreciate me as much as I do.

So now I don't know what to do. At parties she is the only girl I look at, the only person that catches my eye. My friends offered me the chance to meet some of their girl-friends or any girl but I don't want any other girl.... I just want her. I love her."

I hate loneliness but I hate toxic people remember lots of lonely people are still lonely in a room full of people.

lonely,How To Fuck Up Your Entire Second Chance At Life In 24 Hours,"How To Fuck Up Your Entire Second Chance At Life In 24 Hours - A week before my 18th birthday I was sectioned to a psychiatric ward, and the only faint glimmer of hope I had was University. Moving away from everybody I knew and leaving the past behind was exactly what I wanted - a clean slate and a fresh start. On top of all of that, I promised myself I’d be more confident, and try and involve myself with others more. I wanted to escape the cycle of anxiety and depression I had built for myself. 


The day of moving in to uni, I fucked it up. I hid away in my room for a large majority of the day, and I failed to make a good first impression with any of my housemates. Long story short, all five of them went out to a freshers event that night without me, and I completely understand why. They then talked and partied in the kitchen while I was too afraid to join them. 


That was nearly a week ago, and nothing’s changed. I’ve barely spoken to a few of my flatmates, and I’m sure some of them haven’t even seen me since that night. As much as I want to be friends with them, I find myself too scared to approach them. I’ve given them no reason to like me so far, so I doubt they’ll appreciate me pursuing a conversation with them. 


The thing that really saddens me about this is that freshers was essentially my only chance at making friends for a while. I have no in person classes or lectures, and most of the campus societies are cancelled. I’m going to rot away in a house that actively makes me anxious for the next year, and I would have completely ruined my chances at turning my life around. If I drop out, I’m exactly where I started, but I won’t get anywhere staying here either.


If I tell my family I’m not feeling happy, they’ll get me sectioned again - no question. I have no friends or peer relations to reach out to, so I guess this is my last resort. I just wish I was a different, better person, and that I could’ve lived a better life."
lonely,I feel terrible. Lied to. Alone. Not good enough. Everything negative you can think of.,"I feel terrible. Lied to. Alone. Not good enough. Everything negative you can think of. - Warning: this is going to be a long post

I’m in my 20’s and I’ve never really felt like I belonged much of anywhere. I had friends growing up. Not much but enough. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression around 15. I used to go to therapy and take medication but it didn’t last a year. I’ve kind of just been dealing with it myself ever since (just to give some context as why i feel as strongly as I do).

After I graduated high school a few years ago, 90% of my friends moved away. Like far away... as in across the country. The only friends that stayed around are the ones who basically already started their lives and families. I’m still in college and I plan on moving as well after I graduate, but that could take up to another year and idk if I can handle this another year.

I met this guy (yes I’m gay) last year. We actually became really good friends and we consider each other best friends at this point. I developed feelings and he didn’t feel the same (of course). At the time he was just settling into his sexuality and wasn’t really comfortable with “gay dating”. Even went as far to tell me he could never be with a man romantically. I let it go and I try not to harp on it with him because we’re really good friends and he’s pretty much the only friend I talk to or hang out with on a regular basis now. I don’t have anyone else.

Anyway... fast forward a few months, and he has a boy friend now. I have so many emotions going through my head. I’m angry, hurt, sad, etc. he’s been telling me for months that he could never be with a man and I would be his first choice if he ever decided to try it, etc. and now he’s with someone else. We still hang out but I don’t see him like I used to... for obvious reasons. And I know I have to be happy for my friend but it’s so hard when I have to watch him be with another guy after everything he’s told me.

I feel lied to. I feel betrayed. I feel lonely. I’m hurt. I don’t feel good enough for anyone. I can’t help but think why not me? At this point it’s mentally hard and draining trying to remain as good if friends because I just feel bitterness every time I see him now. But at the same time, I genuinely care about him and we are legitimate friends even with my feelings aside. I don’t just want to drop him because he technically hasn’t done anything to me.

I don’t really have a purpose for posting this other than to vent, because as I’ve stated, I only have one friend and this is about him lol

I guess I’m asking how can I get over my bitterness? Or how can I find another guy to fawn over? Or how do I get rid of feelings in general? Whatever you think would help me."

lonely,Everyone else was right.,"Everyone else was right. - During my childhood, I thought prioritizing my education and working hard on my academic and career goals would put me in a good position in life and make me happy. I was of course wrong, as after all this I am still a 21 M virgin, and I can't even get excited about the prospect of going to medical school because I am so alone.

In reality, many people in my life made it apparent to me just how worthless and pathetic they viewed me as because I tried hard in school. Despite the fact that I had other interests and wanted to be a well-rounded person, mostly everyone in my life based my entire identity and their image of me on my intelligence and the fact that I was just some nerd who spent too much time studying. Despite knowing very well that other things matter besides education, no one in my life wanted to see past my GPA or academic accomplishments. In school, I lied about my grades so that others would not view me as intelligent, just because I hated being given this identity so much.

What I've come to realize is that those people are right. Prioritizing my education did nothing for my life and only made me a miserable virgin. Not only that, despite trying so hard, I've never been able to form the identity for myself that I want. I feel as though so many social and romantic opportunities were unavailable to me just because people don't like hanging out with or dating people they view is nerds, and that this prevented me from developing into the person I wanted to become.

I am so sad and alone. I wasted my childhood and college years and have nothing to show for it. While everyone else has had multiple sexual experiences and memories of spending time with others, I'm stuck with my worthless GPA and valedictorian award from a high school where no one gave a shit about who I was. 

All the hard work I did in life was pointless, and I know that if I was a worse student or less intelligent my life would not be like this. I hate the expectations that are placed on intelligent people to do well while also having to face the expectations of being able to get laid, be muscular and built, and every other masculine quality that I lack. I am tired of constantly hearing the lie that because I'm intelligent and because I have career prospects that my life is great and that I should feel happy. Everyone in my life who has everything I want didn't try for jack shit in life and realized just how worthless academics and education is. I feel hopeless and worthless, and I just want my life to end."

Wish I could say that I am strong enough to accept that my life may be meaningless, to some degree, but I suppose it still stings and I will allow myself to shed tears, regardless. 

For all those who feel alone on their birthday, it does hurt and it does suck. To feel special is a wonderful feeling and in a sense, we truly are all special in our own way... we can only hope someone would recognize that and acknowledge it. If you did/do gift yourself a cake and candles, I presume your wish, when blowing out the flame, is to feel cared about by just about anyone. 

So, this post is being written for all those who are feeling/felt lonely on their birthday. For what was/is supposed to be a wonderful and exceptional day, still very much is. YOU are someone distinctive and someone valuable and I am thinking of YOU. YOU are what keeps this community strong and you may not get from it what you feel you need, but there is someone out there taking the time to read and reply to YOUR post... YOUR message you are sending to the world. Someone is taking the time for YOU and that is better than no acknowledgment at all. 

And if you ever happen to pass over a birthday post, make sure you give it a thumbs up and leave a kind comment, as that comment make make that person's special day. Any kind gesture, however small, is a significant one.  So thank you lonely community, for supporting one another and giving your literally valuable time, to one another. 

Again, Happy Birthday you lonely ones :)"

even tho i didn't even intend to be serious, i do realize that it was a mistake. and literally asked for help everywhere, but they all turned me  down, saying that i shouldn't have done it, in a mean way even.

lonely,Being human is hard,Being human is hard - My name is Jonah and I’m 27. I’ve struggled over the last 5 years or so to make any real friends. My last really good friend kinda burned me and since then I’ve been kind of closed off. I live in a small town and work out on an island with 6 other guys that are all much older.

lonely,No one is like me,"No one is like me - So, I’m a 16 year old girl who’s at college and without sounding vain I know I’m considered attractive. In theory, my life should be a breeze. I should have tons of friends and a boyfriend and I should never feel alone because at this age being good looking is usually the only qualification for popularity. 

However, I have never been able to find a friendship group because no one is like me. The ‘popular’ girls who dress like me and look like me are usually VERY dumb and are all carbon copies of each other with no personality. They label every ‘quirk’ as weird and in order to be their friend you must sit and talk about their boyfriend as they don’t have the intelligence to speak about anything interesting. I try and conform to that persona but popular girls have always had a habit of shunning me and I don’t know why. I am nice to them but maybe because I don’t have that aggressive streak they all have I don’t seem fun enough.

I have always gotten along much better with boys. To boys, I can make jokes about whatever I want and they don’t tend to label it as weird. I’m smart enough to realise that a lot of them have other motives than being my ‘friend’ so it makes me paranoid that even the people who allow me to be myself probably still do think it’s weird but just want to get me into bed.

No matter how many people I’m surrounded by, I feel alone because I have never had a strong connection with anybody, I’m smarter than most people my age so I enjoy intelligent conversations that no one can provide me with. I am waiting until I’m 18 to get a boyfriend so that I can get with someone a bit older as I’m hoping that will make them smarter. I hate feeling this way because I just don’t fit in and I can’t force myself to be the person everyone wants me to be .

I have been feeling so lonely that I have to sleep with a pillow in my arms just to sleep at night. I want a relationship with someone so badly. its been a long time and no dating apps or anything has helped at all when you live in a small town. Any time I do meet someone they either are not looking for a relationship or just lead me on. Most of the time I end up getting hurt or used. 
The last relationship I had I ended up coming home to her completely gone without explanation and I found out through her friends that she had been back with her abusive ex for months before leaving. I guess she decided to move back in with him without explanation or even a note. The last relationship before that was 8 years ago the first girlfriend I ever had my junior year of highschool and she unfortunately committed suicide after only 6 months due to being bullied and a bad home life. Just the last few years have started to make me feel cursed and alone."

Loneliness is not just about being alone, it is about feeling alone, maybe in a foreign country, maybe in a new school or even in your own house. In order to gain some insight on how to combat loneliness, we have created a survey which won't take more than 10 minutes. I hope this is not insensitive as I can relate to most people here and I would really like figure out some sort of solution which might help in creating a better community. I really appreciate your help.

lonely,I wish the dream I had was real/ hanging on that chance.,"I wish the dream I had was real/ hanging on that chance. - Even if no one reads this, I’d feel better knowing that I at least had a vent about it.

I woke up from a dream today in tears. It was a dream where I was in a relationship, and surrounded by friends. It just seemed like a typical day of that life. I can’t remember how I got there, but everything just seemed so happy. Then I woke up. I was alone. I’m not in a relationship. I don’t have many friends. I’m just a second year at uni unsure of my future. I don’t know who those people were, but it felt like I lost something. I wished so hard for the dream to be true, for some miracle to be real, but of course it wasn’t. If anything, I wanted to at least dream for a little longer.

I want to run away from reality.

My coping mechanism is to just imagine scenarios, like maybe I met someone or made a good friend. I do have some friends, but I can’t help but feel a little lonely seeing others with their whole group. The amount of real friends I have is an amount you can count with one hand. Maybe it’s a bit selfish, but sometimes I want more. I see all these people having fun and hanging out with their friends, and I wish I could as well. Normally I was the one making effort to celebrate occasions like my friends’ birthdays, but no one ever celebrated mine.

I feel really useless. I normally get too scared to actually socialize and back out last minute if I had plans to improve myself. I remember walking away from a place where a uni society social was being held and when I went home I cried. I didn’t even make my university friends myself. They were friends that my old school friend made. I can’t help but feel frustrated by how pathetic I am, and I try so hard to at least progress a step but I can’t. 

University is a lot lonelier than I expected. I thought it would be an opportunity to socialise and it would probably be the best years of my life, but I was pretty wrong. I got put in a flat in a quiet zone with people that were all shut-ins. It feels like I was just dealt a bad card in life, by the time social events were occurring everyone were just with their flatmates, having so much fun. I spent my first year pretty much alone. I knew some people at the start, but then we drifted apart. Now it’s second year, and with the pandemic, I don’t even have an opportunity to try and make up for it.

People tell me that it’s all about chance meetings, by chance you’ll find someone you love or at least friends that truly do care for you. 
I’ve been hanging on for that chance for a while now."

lonely,The Man and His Castle,"The Man and His Castle - I feel like this everyday. Sad, Guilty, Stupid and Idiotic, I feel like I’m the cause of my own pain. Maybe I am. My older sister keeps telling me how much I’m terrible. She tells me that I’m a bitch or I’m stupid, I’m lazy I never do anything. My mother compares me to other kids such as my cousins. And always sees how much better they are compared to me. How well they do in school compared to me or how much of a better kid they are to me. I write stories but none of them will read it, I have achievements such as my medals for athletics but none of them will acknowledge me. I do well in English, Biology, Chemistry, French, Creative Writing And even History But my mom always tells me I’m stupid due to my Algebra being so low. I believe I am, all my life I’ve been the lonely kid at home. My two sisters would always gang up against me (and they still do) whenever we got into a fight. My mom would always take their side. I’d always lose each fight and my little brother (he can’t help me nor talk to me.) it hurts, he’s right there yet I feel so lonely. My father left my family due to both my mom and him fighting. She keeps drilling it into our heads that his a bad person. But I feel like I’m slowly becoming him. Maybe it’s his curse I don’t know. My dads family was never close and I hate to say this (but I don’t think I’ll be close with my family either) I’ve been alone soo much I find the darkness comforting, I still talk to people at school and make friends with them because I care about them. I don’t want anyone to end up like me....I’d never wish that on one soul (Including my Brothers). I fear that if this all continues which I believe it will. I’ll end up just like the man alone in his castle (A.K.A. - My Dad.) I won’t want to have any interactions with my family, I won’t want to have any human interactions at all in fear of getting hurt or hurting someone. I wish I knew what to do, part of me wishes this too. I wish I was a better person or maybe I didn’t exist at all. It would be best if I didn’t. I could end my life but I’m too scared too, but my body wants me to. My Soul doesn’t. I’m scared of what will happen to me after I’m gone....I just wish i knew what to do. You could say I want to be loved, which I believe too....I just wish it wasn’t lust (which unfortunately it is). Maybe I will become my Dad...."

lonely,I wish I was okay with the fact that I'll die alone,"I wish I was okay with the fact that I'll die alone - Hey everyone, I'm posting here this one time to try and vent tonight- but I'm not going to make it a reoccurring thing because I've seen firsthand how miserable you can get when you let loneliness be the center of your life 


I've been alone my entire life, and the ever-increasing chances of me dying alone is a hard pill to swallow when I watched all my friends get into relationships in high school (and some are even married to this day). It was even harder when they introduced their girlfriends to the circle of friends I was a part of. It was even **worse** the day my ""friends"" made a facebook page: ""Get &lt;my full name&gt; a girlfriend"" and invited my crush. I wish not all good things came to end, because it seems this looming... ""Issue""... Is here to stay.




This isn't an easy thing to post, because I'm sure a handful of people are going to read something like this and immediately type ""lol virgin"" or something to that extent in the comments. Hell, outside of my own typing, I can already hear the clacking of y'all's mechanical keyboards going to town typing the same damn thing I'm talking about right now. 




I'd like to think I'm a simple man. While unmotivated outside of work, I put in 110% while on the clock and actually *enjoy* a hard day's work... I guess that's an oxymoron innit 



Either way, what I'm trying to get at is, I've never wanted much in life. Sure, I'll go out and splurge every so often : A brand new computer that doesn't run like ass, a cool revolver as an eventual nest egg for my future hypothetical kids... Yet, as time goes on, I begin to adapt to the idea that maybe there *ain't* a lid for every pot. 



I'm going to be 25 next year, and yet the closest thing I've ever had to a ""relationship"" was a ""long distance thing"" for five years. That's a story for another day, but needless to say I'm not entirely sure if I fully recovered from investing so many feelings, so much time into a girl that was fully aware she never wanted to meet me since day one. 



It really does a number on your self-esteem when the general consensus is ""There's someone for everyone and if you're single, it must be something wrong *you're* doing. Take a shower sometime, neckbeard."" I had girls pick on me way back in middle school when my self-esteem was supposed be developing. Most guys would get the usual ""bro I think she likes you..."" I got ""Hey, see that girl that stares at you every so often from the back of the class? She told me that she's **terrified** of you and that's her way of making sure you don't get anywhere near her.""



I'd like to think I'm not horribly ugly... Until I try places like /r/rateme and Photofeeler. People will swear up and down the street not to trust these places because they're all people with inflated egos trying to make themselves feel better, and honestly I'd almost be inclined to believe that. The problem is, though, that I can't trust the people in my life to give it to me straight. Friends would say shit like ""you're not **that** bad looking,"" and my Ma doesn't say much outside of ""you're a handsome young man"" and ""well **WHEN** you get married you can..."" like she's obligated to, like a supporting parent would. 



I'd rather the opinions of complete strangers at this point because they have nothing to lose by telling the truth. It doesn't exactly help that I had chemo as a kid and it stunted my growth, because that's not a good enough excuse for women in the dating world. I mean, hell - what girl wants to date a guy that's shorter than her? 



People on here swear up and down the street that ""&lt;looks, height, weight&gt; doesn't matter, it's all about what's inside"" yet I can't even get my foot in the door **because** of my looks. Photofeeler? **Three out of the 75** women that saw my photo said I was attractive. Sure that gives a sliver of hope, but they're the same people that constantly rate high so I can't imagine it was anything towards me in particular. /r/rateme ? **Two**, on a good day -- which is actually 3 more than I thought I'd get. I could go on, but I think you get the idea...




Circling back to the ""neckbeard"" thing before you get the wrong idea, though... I have a soul patch on my chin -- that's it. I hate anime, mountain dew sucks and the only time I'll buy doritos is to light them up to show everyone how much oil the chips are drenched with. Seriously- try it sometime. A single dorito could be a fire starter in a pinch



Anyway, this is kinda a long post just to say ""am lonely,"" but that's all this post is about. I've tried all I could to get out of this. Lost some weight, gained it again, got a job, left to get **another** job, got several different hobbies, lost my glasses and got contacts (which seemed to be the hardest fuckin thing on that list, ironically enough), got a new haircut, tried some new music genres to make me more interesting, tried dating subs, tried dating *apps* ... It all seems to be in vain when this was the same advice people kept pounding into my head since the beginning. A buddy of mine even tried hooking me up with a girl. She ghosted me, **and** him for introducing me to her. Or, so he says.... Maybe he's dating her now. Who knows?

I recently met with a girl, dated her a couple of times, she was nice but some things were, you know, not in place. I decided to go on anyway. Today I had a very heavy but still satisfying day at work, I asked her to go out for a walk after that... And then the situation was just nice, I was feeling so happy, and I kissed her.
Problem is, later by talking she came up with things that made me understand that that thing was not going to go anywhere, and we could not stay together long term, while she is looking for this. So I told it to her because I didn't want to hurt her, but it's pretty evident I have hurt her anyway. We are not going to see each other again. 


You know, I am tired of regretting things like a kiss.
It sucks to feel wrong just because I've tried to be happy for few seconds in years. 
And I am tired feeling alone, at the end of the day. Your career, no matter how good is it, doesn't sleep with you at night, doesn't have annoying hairs that end on your face when you get too close, doesn't wakes you up with a kiss.

I’m struggling in a lot of aspects of my life. At 30 years old I feel like I have never been successful. School, career, love... There is a lot of wasted potential and that has led me to be very hard on myself introspectively. There isn’t an easy singular place to begin...

I think the heaviest weight, however, is the void I’m experiencing with my child’s father. When we met, the stars aligned and I was in too foolish of a mental state to admit it. I had lost him before he was even mine. I have repeated over and over in my head to him “you knew it was a snake when you first picked it up...” but those are not harsh enough words to describe the venom I put into our relationship. 

He is now filled with resentment, and I again, am in too foolish of a mental state to realize there is no longer hope. I’m desperate to save our relationship. Desperate to realign those stars."

I had one good friend and now it has been 5 feeks since the last time we talked, and by talking I mean texting for 1 minute. I had never realized this. I’m not depressed or anything, but it definitely feels bad... how are there people who constantly feel this way?"

lonely,Why has it been so long and where are they?,"Why has it been so long and where are they? - I posted a comment on someone else’s post that was pretty similar, but I felt like making my own. 
 Im 26, Never been in an in person relationship, the only online one I had was super short, last month I almost thought I had found my person on reddit actually, was SO in love, thought they were as serious about me as I was them, only to be dropped and find out they may have been messing around with other girls. All those instances throughout my life of liking girls and guys and not having it be reciprocated, losing people, and even seeing other people out with their significant others (friends, family, strangers) leaves you with this really hopeless feeling of WHY hasn’t this happened for me? What is it about me? Am I not pretty enough, smart enough, interesting enough, caring enough, passionate enough, the list goes on and on. Logically no, you know there’s nothing wrong with you, but it’s easy to think there is. To find someone who loves me, who I feel safe with and won’t hurt me, it’s all I’ve ever wanted since I was a little girl. It’s what I thought I saw in a few people throughout my life, but really didn’t. I know no relationship is flawless or easy, but I don’t want that anyway. I don’t want easy. I want someone with a story and someone who will love, respect and cherish me just as much as I would for them. As much as I want it though, the bad experiences have also really scared me, both in terms of worrying it will NEVER happen, but also in terms of being able to trust other people enough to actually let them in. I know I can’t be the only one though, I hope not."

lonely,I’m 100% always alone and I HATE it and feel so I satisfied with my existence.,"I’m 100% always alone and I HATE it and feel so I satisfied with my existence. - I have literally one friend, who I never even get to see because he’s a truck driver and never around. I live by myself and work from home. I’ve downloaded so many “social” meeting/dating apps and tried to swipe on literally everybody just to increase the odds of actually hanging out with someone, but it never works because people are always weird about meeting up for a while (which I hate because the moment someone would ask me to hang, I don’t care if I know them or not, I’m down to go).

I’m just always alone. Never get texted by anyone. Only time I talk to “friends” is if I initiate, but even then, they NEVER want to hang out and just make excuses but then I’ll see them on their Snapchat story hanging with people, even though they told me they couldn’t hang with *me*. It’s bullshit and it’s so fucking depressing. 

I’m mid-20’s and told I’m good-looking &amp; always was told I’m fun to be around, so I literally have zero clue why no one EVER tries to hang with me. With social apps, I’ll get a lot of matches and stuff but that’s all it is...no one ever goes past that to actually try and make friends by hanging out. I’ve literally driven 12hrs one-way to meet people but NO ONE ever goes out of their way for me. I hate it. 

TL;DR: I not satisfied with my life whatsoever and so fucking tired of being alone and no one ever wanting to actually hang in person."

lonely,Butterflies....,"Butterflies.... - Anyone else miss that feeling? 

That feeling of them fluttering so hard that you swear you could feel their little wings grazing against your heart and it takes your breath away. 

The first time they say hello and it's the most amazing sound you think you have ever heard in your life. That first wink.....and you smile so hard that you are absolutely sure your face is has frozen and that you might look a bit crazy but you don't care.

That shiver of excitement that runs up your spine when you hear the PING! of their text coming through. Wondering how to keep the conversation alive and not sound dumb at the same time. All of the firsts of meeting someone new. The high of getting to know and eventually, hopefully falling in love with that person.

I miss it..........I miss the lusty glances, the passionate kisses. The way your skin lights on fire at their touch. The scent of their cologne and the way they smell fresh out of the shower.

I know what you're thinking....not everything is champagne and sunflowers. What about the fights? The little annoying habits you notice. When you start getting all comfortable and they make noises you've never heard before and the funky morning breath and  the toenail clippings all over the floor and the hair clogging up the shower....again.

Yes. I even miss those moments. Where it gets hard and scary and words are shot at each other  and feelings are hurt and there you go making your bed on the couch. Why do I miss those? Because that's when you find out how strong you are.....how strong they are and if what you have is all smoke and mirrors or if it's solid and stable. 

I miss feeling like I'm part of a team that can take on the world and whatever it throws at us. I miss knowing that someone always has my back, that they will he there when I stumble and will pull me up if I start to drown. 

True Love, a silly notion I know, is not meant for everyone. Only the precious and lucky few get to experience it once, let alone twice, in a lifetime.

But ah! Don't mind me. I'm just a lonely romantic thinking her daydreams out loud and desperately wishing that one day they come true."
lonely,"21F - Extremely lonely gal not having any close male friendships for 12 years seeking very affectionate, open-minded, kind and understanding men","21F - Extremely lonely gal not having any close male friendships for 12 years seeking very affectionate, open-minded, kind and understanding men - Much of my life and certainly after living in Australia for 12 years, I haven't found anyone that I could connect with. Compound with a series of negative and harsh experiences, I've grown tired and wary of connecting people here geographically and just with people, in general.

The things have happened in this particular order: 1) Having lost my friendships over a previous partner *(served in the Marine Corps)*... calling me f\*cked in the head for choosing a guy like him especially given his former background... whom accepted me as MtF trans 2) lost my previous partner when it came to a dilemma of him vs. career ambition 3) Lost any confidence and chances for my then-Nursing career when I made subtle, major mistakes that ended up compromising patient safety during clinicals and in turn, not trusting myself and reassessing my stage in life from hereon.

I've had a stringent criteria for guys in terms of a prospective friendships. But after searching for a year in my life of ever-present loneliness and isolation and not having any fruitful outcomes, maybe I'm going to start becoming more carefree and relaxed in my criteria....

With the traits I value in people especially guys, it's those who are fiercely loyal, caring and who share an unspoken understanding that life often isn't kind to some people. Some people get the short straw. Most importantly, it's the value weighted of people taking each other... and if I were to make a comparison, fellow infantry/grunts in the military dropping their bags to help their fellow buds in their unit when help was needed/asked. I try to implement that military mindset into my life.

There isn't enough people who believe as I do. And with some people, I guess I care too much for others and sometimes it works.... sometimes it doesn't but I'm owning it and I will not waiver from it. Nonetheless, I still feel extraordinary isolated.

It doesn't help that my existing, perhaps only male friend *(nothing romantic)* is in a 2 month long MC training rotation deep in the foxholes and looking at the stars and having to wake up with a message that the brass has given his unit the green light has left me a little lonely in that I'll miss him... hopefully, no mishaps in training exercises. He's one of an only, male friend who's equal in my age who understands my sentiments. I miss his cynical attitude of a jarhead...

I'd like to have a **close, perhaps intimate, extremely affectionate male friend** whom I could feel I could place a significant amount of vulnerability of myself, trust and safety.

Regular voice calls and if I feel comfortable, video calls as well *(though I feel extraordinarily self conscious since I'm MtF trans)*. One who's very open to having everyday calls.

I'll be moving over to the US *(in particular, the Fox Cities Area in WI)* though it will be in the distant future *(maybe in a few years)* since I'm in an LDR.

Now my partner knows about my desire to have a close friend who's extremely affectionate, kind open-minded and understanding.... stemming from the manifestation of my crippling fear and anxiety in the possibility that my partner *(who carries all these traits)* might pass away suddenly or from a tragic accident. His words: ***""I'll write two letters, one to you and one to your male friend. It won't be opened until that day comes but when that day does come, I want him to know how my female partner would like to be treated and the fact that she does not want and can't be alone...ever.""***

I don't want to have an epiphany where I realize if he does pass away, I have no else to turn to. I want my male friend to know how much my partner means to me... in that he's been the only one who saw me for who as I really am... soul and mind of a woman in a man's body. For a male friend to reciprocate the affection/intimacy I have for my partner and be reminded by being understanding &amp; open-minded, it means a lot to me in that my male friend would too understand me as the woman I am... having no qualms about it. In a sense, he'd be akin to like a second partner... with benefits of a relationship minus some things of course *(some things I choose to just reserve for my partner)*

I will say, that if you are a guy who is into hunting/firearms/fixing cars/manual labor, you are encouraged to feel free to respond back in kind to my post. You could be a total dude's dude and that won't really faze me. I'm very open-minded for a person and in fact, I try to encourage that sort of thing with any male friends.

And please refrain from sending messages of platitudes and that of me going to therapy... that has not worked for me during those 12 years.

Now, one last thing is if you're intention is to try and connect with me then disappear knowing I'm at my most vulnerable, don't bother to try and message me. I've had my fair share of them already. And any ""Hey/Hi/Hello"" posts will be swiftly blocked."

lonely,The art of Loneliness,"The art of Loneliness - Hi everyone, 

I just want to say that it sucks being alone but doesn't mean you're lonely. I've been thinking about my past and wondering why I burn so many bridges of my friendships. Its that they never cared about me in the present moment, people like to say certain words tell you certain things to keep you around to be the toy so they can play with because of youre just a nice person and willing to be there for them so when you want the favor to return back to you. Suddenly everyone is busy, can't answer the phone, or truly never cared to begin with. It's hard to separate oneself heading towards a journey of being alone too carry the weight on the shoulders, in reality, you've always had and always will. No matter the amount of people in your corner or not remember the one who wakes up behind your own eyes are you. Don't let other people discourage you from your dreams or tell you to do something else in your life cause they don't see the full potential you have.  Remember act like you're the shit but don't stink don't like these clones stop you from being pure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like Ralph Waldo Emerson once said 

“If we hide or hinder ourselves in fear of rejection of others, are we not in essence, rejecting ourselves first?” 

&amp;#x200B;

Trust yourself during great times and during hard times only YOU know what's right for yourself."

Was in a juvenile prison back when I was 14, that was also the last time when i saw my parents, spent there two years. After being released lived for 3 years with a second grade cousin. After finishing the high school, got a job, met a girl, been in a relationship for four years. I don't know why (maybe because she was the first true love, or maybe because I never got along with my parents and always felt alone) but I become really attached to her, somehow she became my whole universe, replaced my parents, my siblings (don't have any as far as I'm aware of) and everything was perfect until it wasn't and got dumped. Pushed by more factors, 22 at the time I left the country and went to UK. Got here an OK job, on which I've been working for the last 5 years and actually got promoted a few times, got scared by any human interaction (the nature of my job doesn't require too much, if any human interaction), even the landlord checks feels like breathtaking nightmares and also got an amphetamine addiction. The drugs used to help with my loneliness in the first two years of using them but for the last three years, guess the addiction installed so I still need the drugs to be able to function but doesn't help with the loneliness feeling anymore. Now, as I'm writing this I feel empty and lonely, can't find any meaning to life aside from suffering.

Freshman year I decided I wouldn’t play football so I could focus more on school and my grades, I noticed how quickly everyone’s view of me changed and once I was on the outside I could see how the entire football team were dicks and I saw how they treated people so I decided I’d not associate with them anymore. As soon as that happened everything changed and by sophomore year I only had three friends. After that I switched schools due to how toxic of an environment my current school became. Ever since then I’ve had not a single friend and that’s not exaggerating, I’ll just lay at home by myself every single day, time has flown by and I’m almost off to college now.

The problem has to be me right?"
lonely,Believing the lie that looks don't matter when it comes to romantic relationships has made me suffer.,Believing the lie that looks don't matter when it comes to romantic relationships has made me suffer. - Looks do matter when it comes to finding committed relationships and it was hard pill for me to swallow. Accepting this truth the sooner the better. When I thought I'll find a man who will love me for who I am on the inside without caring about how I look (I'm fat) I ended up getting rejected countless of times and finding men who want nothing to do with me beyond just trying to hookup. The more I tried to deny the fact that looks matter when it comes to relationships the more I got hurt. I need to lose weight to find real love with a man.

lonely,A sudden realization...,"A sudden realization... - No matter what I do to improve myself no one will ever look my way. I guess luck and looks are more important than trying to be confident about yourself. I feel lots of people are selfish in their own ways. Heck I have some selfishness in myself, I guess its too much for someone to overlook their ""preferences"". A little confession about myself is they I pay for someone to gain their attention to me and its not a therapist... Sometimes, I feel that a part of me is dead inside and its never coming back."

lonely,What is your goal in life?,"What is your goal in life? - About 7 months back my relation of 5 year came to an end. It was not really a surprise but the timing couldnt be more off. I just came back from work as we were send home because of Covid  and my ex-gf decided to drop the bomb. Within 3 days she and her stuff were gone. 

To be honest I don’t miss her (that she already was in a new relationship after 3 months kinda helpt). I do miss someone next to me though and really feel the loneliness creeping in. In my childhood I was depressed because of medical reasons and being bullied because of it. So the loneliness has kinda always followed me and with COVID going on has never been stronger. Also with the realization that my future plans have changed drastically I am struggling with the question, what is my goal in live and who do I do it for?

I would like to hear your thoughts about this.

lonely,FML,"FML - Last night I went out to eat with my only friends (ya know not feel lonely) , let's call them ""Sam and Michelle"".  We went to eat at a restaurant close to our mall, while we ate they texted each other and it was Hella awkward, I figured out that they liked each other and I didn't say anything (I don't want to get in there business) . When we left the restaurant they walked away and started talking and I was like alright ill meet you at the truck, I went and leaned against the truck and waited on them. A couple minutes later he comes back and here's how the convo went.

S: hey bro imma have to abandon you for a bit
Me: yeah sure I'll sit in the truck and wait on you
S: naw bro imma take the truck
Me: OK imma go walk around the mall
S: OK I'll be back in 5 minutes
M: OK

45 minutes later Michelles mama shows up and she's like hey where is Michelle and I'm like I have no Idea.

10 mins later she starts running towards her moms car and im here sitting on a bench waiting on Sam to show and he doesn't. So I ubered home... FML"

I don't even mind it anymore. - The other day I went to the bathroom to spend my lunch break, because my school friend was absent that day. And I just listened to music and waited for the break to pass. I've basically given up on creating any acquaintances or relationships. I think something is wrong with me. I really tried and got new friends. But they're expecting too much of me. I can't spend so much time with them. Back then I always wanted my friendships to become deeper and to be less superficial. Now I feel like it's better to keep them superficial, otherwise I will burden my friends with my issues."

lonely,Musings at 5am,"Musings at 5am - I am surrounded by suffering on a global scale yet I am seemingly only concerned with the pain brought upon me by the absence of companionship in my life. This is at the same time telling of my deep longing for love, a clear indication of something my heart truly desires for; and the source of a great deal of frustration, proof that in the end I am incapable of forgoing my own needs for the a greater cause.

I want for love. This desire seemingly appeared out of nothingness around when I grew out of childhood. It tucked itself away in a little corner of my heart observing until one day it erupted and took over my being. I fought my own desire, as I have become accustomed to sate my frugal nature, but alas I could not win. Over the course of a few years it consumed my very being.

My journey during these changes, taught me the folly of seeking love out of mere sexual attraction. I found myself lying next to someone in bed at dawn and at the same time wishing I was alone. I took this lesson to heart, but was soon distracted by another desire that had appeared in my soul: the quest for my mark on the world. So I set forth hoping to accomplish both. It was however down a path that took me further away from one.

I must say at this juncture, that for all this I have never been alone. I have people I treasure in my life. I am neither inept at the art of navigating a club at 2am nor am I so insecure that I find it difficult to express myself. Nay, my problems are of love. My problems are one that my peers, for whom romance seems to come as naturally as breathing, do not understand.

So now I lie in bed at 5:30 am in the middle of global crisis— a quarter of a century old. Outwardly performing well in comparison to my peers: a person who has made great progress in the game of capitalism. Yet, I find that for all my work and my effort to be a force for good in the world I am still lacking. Lacking in human warmth to replace the cushions I find myself embracing in the dark."
lonely,"Loneliness keeps me stuck in heartbreak, does time really help?","Loneliness keeps me stuck in heartbreak, does time really help? - My last relationship ended April 2019. Until May 2020 i stayed in the city where my ex lived in hope to get back together. but it didn't end up that way. I had no friends there, all my friends (all 5 of them, now more like 3) lived 250 miles away. I was alone most days that year, except for working in a warehouse early AM and when i would see my ex girlfriend once a week or so. 

It has changed me a lot and i am very easily troubled by loneliness now. I actually thought i used to be mentally tough lol. 

It's been what 17 months and i have ups and downs in mood, and even months have gone by where i feel emotionally stable if nothing else. I moved back around my friends in May and it helped a lot initially. Felt like a new start and everything, finally. But now i've been here 6 months and have settled back into a monotonous depressing life, and hate this apartment already.

A couple of times i have met a girl i became interested in, talked a little bit, not ended up as anything. Every time i feel lonely i still think of my ex. It's like she's become the symbol of how it feels to have love around you. Like my body remembers how it was and wants to go back there when i wake up feeling lonely or try to go to bed at a reasonable time.

It's been so long, we don't talk anymore, she asked not to a long time ago. I so easily turn to the memories when i'm lonely, i try not to. I truly want her to just be happy and do what she wants to, but i don't know how to be that myself. I'm so tired of feeling bad, of feeling slight relief from therapy sessions and friends but then returning to this feeling. Having days of no social interaction is tough. 

I don't even like interacting with people that much, thats why i'm here with no one i suppose. But i don't like being alone either."

Ended up talking for about an hour with random strangers. Some of them checked my profile and saw my post on this sub (about how unhappy I am currently). And then they all just gave kind words and support.

Support that I wish I had IRL. It just made me think about how weird this world is now, that I can receive support from strangers without knowing anything about them, without judging who they are or what they think. Just, human to human empathy from across the world.

Big thanks to them whoever they are.  
So if you feel lonely, try it. Get in a chat room, who knows what kind of good person is in there too ?

And myself is all I have at the end of the night. Just like you. Fuck them, they never cared anyway so why should you? Just do you because you are loved by the universe and so what if they don’t want to be with you or around you, it’s their loss anyways."

and when i do connect it always ends up to where we end up not talking or being as close so sometimes. its like whats the point of even trying you know? 

i dont like feeling talked over or talked down to. ive tried discord servers relating to my interests and it all turns out the same. maybe its me maybe im the problem and i dont know how to solve it 

im done im just done. and i talk with my mom about it and she understands how i feel and that she can relate to it but for some reason, it just doesnt sit well with me. it just makes me feel more alone and boxed in. maybe its because shes my mom and that im not connecting with someone my age? idk

im just. done and tired. wish i could wipe myself off the face of the earth. but i know that that wouldnt solve anything. i had therapy today and everything is sore and a bit triggering. im just venting. 

all of my friends. they have their friends. they have their groups. it feels like theyre my whole world and im just a small part of theirs ya know? which i know isnt true. but it could be. 

this shits so hard to navigate. just want to feel safe and connected to a couple of people and not instantly feel inferior or small when the littlest thing happens to show they have other friends.

lonely,25m - seeking longterm friendships.,"25m - seeking longterm friendships. - hi! i’m a twenty-five year old from the us, more specifically the east coast. quarantine blues have been hitting me recently, and it’s made me realize that i miss having someone to talk to whenever, really. a friend that i can message, or call, when i’m bored. someone that’ll given me equal effort. 

# *a b o u t  m e*
**personality**: i’m an infj fo the core. if there’s anything that i fail to mention, you can find it by searching up 16personalities. generally speaking, i’m a laid back person that can be a little shy at first. i’ve been told that i’m easy to talk to, and people feel at east with me. my voice is soothing, yet deep and i “sound like i’m narratoring audio books, even when i’m pissed off.” &lt;— a friend told me that, which quickly became my go to description of my voice lmao. i’m not white to anger, and i like bringing others happiness. i like to have fun and can be immature, but i can be serious when needed. 

**animals**: i have three dogs and one cat, all of which i love dearly. let’s exchange pet pictures and share funny stories!!

**video games**: at the moment, i mostly play valorant and dead by daylight. i also own among us, fall guys, and phasmophobia (which i have yet to play). if i’m feeling lazy, i like lounging around while playing animal crossing—still looking for a terraform pro to give me a few lesions. 

**music**: i’m the type of person to listen to the same songs and albums on repeat. recently, those have 
been ‘nectar’ by joji and ‘blood harmony’ by finneas. i prefer sad, mellow songs over upbeat ones. if you’ve got any suggestions, that’s an easy way to my heart. 

**shows**: i haven’t watched anything new recently, apart from ‘cobra kai.’ i’d like to check out ‘away’ as well as a few other netflix originals, or shows that i haven’t gotten the chance to watch yet. tell me your favorite show(s) and let’s watch them together!

**movies**: i’m planning on rewatching the ‘scream’ movies, and i’d love to have someone to watch them with! once i’ve finished those, i plan to move onto the ‘halloween’ films and go from there. just like with music and shows, i’m open to new things.

you’re an animal lover. ideally, you game too..

above all, i’d like to form meaningful connections with people. if you think we’d get along well, send me a chat. looking forward to hearing from you, don’t keep me waiting too long. :)"
lonely,The added emptiness as a result of political divide,"The added emptiness as a result of political divide - *  I’m not getting into politics specifically, nor am I going to express my political view. *

This year for many has been difficult because of Covid alone. The isolation it’s caused, the distancing of people you usually see or hang out with. 

Now, being an election year, you’re isolated more from those who support the opposing political party. I’m not old enough to have experienced many elections, but it wasn’t like this not too long ago. I’ve been shunned by those who have opposing beliefs than I. Those who I once called close friends are now people who don’t speak to me. I never decided who I spoke with or became friends with based on a political leaning. I’ve felt empty for a long time. Now, its just an added emptiness to an ever expanding thought of darkness of feeling continuous abandonment. 

As a male, society teaches us to put our mental health  in a box and put it aside. My box is almost 6 feet down &amp; now society has me feeling that I should put my political views in a box because it takes away even more and adding more to the loss, the isolation, &amp; the pain."
lonely,"I've lost everyone in my life, maybe I deserve that","I've lost everyone in my life, maybe I deserve that - People have fallen out of my life. I work really hard at being a good person. I volunteer, I asked my old friends how they were doing, I help as much as I can. But everyone always ends up leaving me. I've felt so much loss during this life.

That now I'm starting to think its what I deserve for some reason. I don't know why I deserve it, but if the common problem is me then it only makes sense.

I don't know why so it must be me. What's wrong with me?"

So I made a post saying thanks to you all
Who remembered then people remembered.
It made me feel lonely

lonely,Hardly any real social interaction since July 2019,"Hardly any real social interaction since July 2019 - All my close friends from live in another state. I try to make new friends but I always feel like I’m saying &amp; doing the wrong thing. I started a new grad school and I feel like nobody wants to be friends with me so I hole up in my apartment all day and talk to no one. I have a boyfriend (5 years) but I haven’t seen him in a year even though he lives in the same state and I think that makes my loneliness worse. I text him and he responds but at this point I feel like I’m texting into the void, hoping for some kind of response and clinging to that brief moment of rare happiness and social interaction in my day when he responds. He likes to put face to face interaction with everyone else before me which makes me feel 10x worse. I just want someone to laugh with and feel another persons warmth. I’m thinking about joining a Dungeons and Dragons campaign to ease the social withdrawal."

lonely,I want to be soft...,"I want to be soft... - This might get downvoted to purgatory but it’s been on my mind. 

I was watching a reality tv show where multiple people are dropped off in a remote location and they have to survive off the land for a certain number of days in order to win a substantial amount of money. 

One of the female contestants was having a rough go and she was remembering how she would work through her troubles w/ her partner and seek comfort in them during difficult times. 
As she was crying about not having her support system I realized I was annoyed and had zero sympathy for her. 

In the same moment I realized how callused I’ve become. There have been countless times where all I wanted was someone to lean on and talk me down off the ledge I’d worked myself up to and had zero help. I’ve been alone for almost all of the important/tough decisions and moments in my life and simply had to deal.

Being soft like this contestant feels like a luxury that most people are privileged enough to experience. I want to be soft like that with someone but I’ve been alone and hardened for so long that I honestly don’t know if I’m even capable. 

Has anyone else noticed this happening or has happened in themself?"
lonely,Am I lonely because I don't drink?,"Am I lonely because I don't drink? - I've never been a partier or bar hopper or anything. During college I think I went to like 2 parties and hated every second of it. I don't even particularly enjoy alcohol, and alcohol doesn't enjoy me either as it enflames a minor medical issue I have. I'm 25, and I feel like I lost friends/my current friends don't invite me to do anything because I don't drink (pandemic aside, of course). 

What set me off tonight in my own thoughts is that weeks ago, I asked my friend, who I've known my whole life, to get dinner with me on her day off at a restaurant she's never been to but has been wanting to go to. We made plans days in advance, and then of course the morning of she canceled on me. Like she always does when we make plans. But I know she went off with one of her more exciting friends that day because of good old social media. I still haven't heard from her from when she canceled on me. And I guess she has parties every weekend that I've never been invited to...but ""we should do something soon!"" Yeah right. But she's always the first one to say she wants to do non drinking things. Mhm.

Idk, I'm just feeling sorry for myself tonight. I just feel like I can't relate to others...either they still just want to party or they are starting families. Or going back to school to be a doctor, in my other friend's case. But it seems like whenever I say I don't drink, I get viewed like a toddler or intentionally not invited to do anything. I hate this whole drinking culture. 

TL;DR - I personally don't drink, feel like others don't want to hang out with me because of that. Just feeling sorry for myself/venting/looking to blame something."

23 m handicapped

I broke my neck when I was 18 and I’ve never had a girlfriend or had sex let alone a first kiss or anything. I was pretty well liked and had a lot of friends growing up throughout high school but I never had my feelings reciprocated by any girl I liked which really hurt my self esteem, they were always just interested in my friends. Now I’m a quadriplegic and am permanently in a wheelchair and all I think about is if girls weren’t into me before why would they ever be Into me now when I look how I do now and with a shit ton more baggage. I can’t have sex I can’t do anything that I want to do and can’t live the way I want to. I’m so scared of being alone forever it makes me feel so anxious and like I just don’t matter. I mean I can’t really blame anyone if the roles were reversed I probably wouldn’t be into someone in my position."

I [] have not felt whole since the last time I dated someone, 3+ years ago. I feel like a hopeless romantic that has truly given up hope. I am not content with having friends that are just there to reply to your shitty attempt to socialize. I don't feel alive, I'm just not dying, stuck in like a purgatory of life

idk if it's because I didn't socialize much before that relationship and I kinda socially matured depending on my girlfriend, or if it's just because I don't talk to enough people (I have a few friends but whether or not I talk to them is a coinflip every month)"
lonely,I want to tell a guy that I like him...,"I want to tell a guy that I like him... - So I’ve been pretty torn up recently about this guy I’ve been hanging out with. He is really nice, caring and the complete opposite of the last guy I was with. Overall I just like spending time w him. 

We went camping this weekend and I don’t know how to feel anymore. Sometimes we can have the greatest laughing fits together and other times we will just sit in silence because we’ve run out of things to talk about. I found him to be ‘touchy’, even when he didn’t need to be, and I’m not sure how to take that. I am a perceptive person, but when it comes to guys I can never tell if they like me or not.

He told me about his anxiety and other issues he’s dealing with as well. What does this all mean? Does it mean nothing? Am I reading too much into this? 

I really like him, but sometimes I feel like he doesn’t like me like that and other times I feel like he does. Maybe I shouldn’t worry about this so much :/ if he really DOES like me do you think he’d ever say it? (Considering his anxiety?)"
lonely,How do you manage?,"How do you manage? - So it's actually my first time posting here but I felt the need to vent a little. So first off life is pretty tough especially when it comes to my social life. Ever since I was a kid, I've always tried to seek out some form of companionship and every time such attempts ended in faliure. It grew pretty frustrating when I'd see other kids getting along and even now it still bothers me that I can't form any meaningful connections. I have tried, I really have but it appears that I fall short everytime and I have tried to self evaluate but the flaws I find are ones which seem beyond my control. So I spend a lot of days alone which I hate a lot because usually being alone means I'm left with my thoughts and this only leads to reflection on traits that I despise about myself. This often makes me feel like I'm doomed to a lonely existence which bums me out at times. Is there anyone else that feels this way and how do you cope?"
lonely,Chaos inside,"Chaos inside - I recently noticed that my thoughts, like my room and  a lot of other things about me are completely chaotic, while I always try to look my best on the outside. 
This has left me feeling very lonely. I feel like I cannot let anyone visit my home or tell them what I'm really feeling because they might think bad about me and abandon me, which has happened before. I recently had a friend commenting about my messy room in disgust behind my back, and it really hurt me.

I ask her if everything is alright she said it's not me but she's not ""ready for anything"". All I say is that's fine if you ever need anyone to talk to I'm here. 

Then I check up on her and realize she blocked me on instagram and now I feel like shit. This is just one example... I don't do anything rude, I'm not creepy, I am friendly and nice and I get treated like shit..."

lonely,I feel so alone when I need help the most,"I feel so alone when I need help the most - Recently I’ve been finding it really difficult to go to school. I’m pretty sure I have social anxiety and the thought of going back while everyone is judging me freaks me out. But nobody seems to understand that I can’t just stop acting like this. My nan and grandad are whining saying I need to go in for my GCSEs but my mom has been the worst.

At first she was supportive saying I could have the day off but now she’s pressuring me to go in when I know I can’t. She just doesn’t understand that I mentally can’t do school right now. She doesn’t see to care about my mental health so long as I go into school. Just the other day she told me that I was being stupid and needed to just get over it. I haven’t told her but it really hurt because I know I’m being silly but I can’t help it. Like I wanna go in and get good grades but I can’t help this anxiety that comes over me when I think about school. 

I feel like my most support is my five year old sister who doesn’t even what’s going on. My mom just brushes me off, my Nan and grandad just whine and get mad, and my brother teases me about it. I’ve never felt more alone when I need help the most. 

My mom wonders why I can’t talk to her and it’s because when I do, she brushes me off. She doesn’t understand that I’m not okay and I’m not normal. That I can’t just get over it.

I don’t know how much longer I can do this. I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone without them brushing me off. And school just isn’t helping. I don’t know what to do

TLDR; my mom keeps invalidating me and making me feel worse about myself when I really need some support. Any advice would be appreciated but I’m not expecting any"

lonely,Watching her fade away,"Watching her fade away - I've (36/f) been lonely for a really long time. I decided to do something about it and got on tinder last November. I wasn't looking for a hook up just someone to talk to and possibly date. I matched with this beautiful girl so out of my league I was certain she was a bot. She wasn't. We hit it off but as always, there was a catch. She is from Sweden. I know everyone's catfish flag just went up but that isn't the case here. We started face timing and pen paling. She sends me things from Sweden and I send her things from the US. After a few months of talking we decided we liked each other and we made plans to meet in Egypt in March. Then covid hit. Leaving when we might be able to meet up uncertain. Forcing agates we continued to talk. Wewould always start the day with a ""good morning"" and end it with a ""goodnight"" ...until last week. I noticed that I was talking to her with very little responses. Then one day there wasn't a good night. And the next day there wasn't a good morning followed by another silent night. I don't know what is happening or why she's suddenly gone. I asked if things were OK and she told me that she's fine. I left it at that. Writing this seems foolish at 36 years old but here I am. I don't know what to say day to her anymore. The emptiness that she had filled is starting to make itself known. The kind that tears at your chest and reminds you that you have no one to hold. That no one has ever cared enough to stay. 

I'm not looking for sympathy. It's just that I literally have no where else to go with these thoughts and feelings. I don't know if I'm losing her but it feels like it did the other times I watched someone slip. I guess I'll find out. Eventually."

I know rationally that there are a lot of people out there who must feel like this in some way or another, but sometimes I have a gut feeling that no one in the world is as lonely as I am. I feel like all my life I've never felt comfortable enough to be myself around other people. Sometimes I feel like I will never be able to have meaningful friendships in my life again. The loneliness gets so overwhelming that it really truly feels like nothing will ever be okay again, that I will never experience joy or happiness again. It's honestly the worst feeling. And worst of all, I feel like it's all my fault because I didn't try hard enough or because there is simply something wrong with me and I'm too different to other humans in some way. I feel inadequate in so many situations in my life. Even though I'll be 27 next month, I feel like I've wasted so much time doing nothing at all with my life.

I have been working out every day, washing my face with aloe every night, meditating (as corny as it sounds, it's making me feel happier and less stressed out), and partaking in more social activities to help make me less socially awkward and more outgoing and confident. I have already been seeing results! I have lost close to 75LBs, my acne is clearing up, and I'm feeling more happy and comfortable talking to people! This proves that there is hope for everyone!

lonely,Story of a lonely girl,"Story of a lonely girl - You might see this as immature because this takes place in my current life: high school. 

Ever since I left elementary school, I have realized that many of my friends were changing. They started to develop new interests and started wanting new friendships. Although I only had 2 friends before, 2 or even 1 was enough for me. They began slowly drifting away. It was subtle until it finally hit that I was losing them, losing them to a more popular crowd. I understand why they would want that. Who doesn’t want more friends. No one wants to be the kid that no one remembers in high school. So they left. This broke me. I felt I had no one. No one to talk to. No one to laugh with. No one to share happy moments. I felt truly lonely. 

I read an article that mentioned, “Relationships are the most important overall contributor to happiness.” Knowing this made me feel even worse about myself. It made me feel like I wasn’t capable of happiness. It made me want to think about everything wrong with me, the reason why I could get or even keep any friendship. I started to think about every flaw I had. ‘Too ugly. Too boring. Too annoying. Too needy. Too pathetic.’ I thought about my looks. ‘Maybe it’s my nose. Or lack of breasts. Maybe it‘a cause I’m too hairy for a girl. Or cause I don’t try enough.’ I thought how I could change, but not in a good way. “I should start wearing makeup to hide my ugly face. I should start wearing cloths that are more revealing. I should start acting like someone else, like the pretty, popular girls.” 

All these thoughts raced through my head until I just gave up. I didn’t care how I looked. I didn’t care how I felt anymore. I just wanted it all to be over. I fell into a depression. The loneliness took over me, leaving my heart empty. I needed someone. I needed a friend. That part of me was gone and all that was left was a hole. 

I continue to struggle, not knowing what to do. I started trying more. To be more interesting or social but it seems I’m just not a likable person. Nothing seems to work. Now, I sit by myself writing this story: The story of a lonely girl."

I don't deserve to be loved, and I never will be when I'm trapped under my shell. But I don't know how to break out. I want to be able to be outgoing and meet someone special, but don't know the steps to that. I'm not even sure I have the willpower to take those steps.

That isn't to say your friends or my friends don't care...but they don't exactly help by saying that either. How is ""learning to enjoy being single"" supposed to help me not be single? How am I supposed to ""love myself"" when that empty pain in my chest is surely from the lack of emotional intimacy?

I'm not sure if this is the place to go for advice, or if it's just a place to vent. Maybe I just need to know that I'm not the only one feeling these frustrations? 

I don't want to give a sob story. My situation is not other peoples' fault or responsibility. I know it's my fault, my own failing. I just don't know how to do it."

lonely,How to be alone,"How to be alone - Hey everyone,

I understand that during times of hardship we want to look at things externally to validate us. The only way to really achieve the inner growth you are looking for is to accept your loneliness. When you accept loneliness you then become alone. Being alone is a choice that you make to push past the current situation you find yourself in at the moment. I made a video detailing the process of being alone, and how to succeed while doing it. Go check it out!

lonely,I feel terrible,"I feel terrible - 


I’ve been talking to this girl since august. We’ve known each other since we were kids and recently we’ve been reconnecting. She’s always texting me good morninggg and we text 24/7. She seemed to really like me 

We hungout the other night and everything was going great until she dropped a bomb  she’s in this long distance relationship with a guy she met online. She was complaining saying how he’s a douche and she’s not sure how to cut things off and was even saying stuff like “I just don’t connect with him how I connect with you” 


So I texted her saying we can’t talk anymore and she hasn’t texted back since thankfully

But I still feel like shit. I feel so stupid for being lead on. I had no idea she was talking to someone else this entire time. Apparently texting someone “good morninggg” everyday and talking for the last months doesn’t mean anything."

It looks so easy for other people. How are people so at ease with giving and receiving love when that sounds so inaccessible to me? I’ve had opportunities to be in relationships but I’ve always sabotaged everything. I’m so damn mad at myself for being this way. I make my life so much more complicated than it could be.

""You can make friends easily on social media even  as a kid, so what's the problem?""

COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)

These days you can't do really anything at 12 on social media

You have to be atleast 13 years old or older to use social media

I'm not even old enough to use reddit actually.

I wanted to make friends on discord but ofcourse you have to be 13+.

The more I'm there, the more I hear how alone they feel and they don't have anyone. Being an addict too, in recovery , I know that deep down it's not true. 
 It's probably a mutual codependency thing, and I am just hurting myself.  But I don't want to be another person that abandons them, I care.

When the lockdown started I lost my connection with University, where there are the most of my friends, and I kept going out with my last friend who lives in the same neighborhood.

Now I am living with the void. All the world is fucked up outside because of the pandemic, and I am in my house doing math and listening to music. And I know that this will be my future for the next two years. At least I am here and I have something to keep busy. I am maybe something like Newton but less talented.

Finished with that can of worms. I do photography, play games like Total war, crusader kings, modern warfare,  and a wide variety of sorts. I like a veteren's amount of anime, Kdramas, and Movies(into more of the classics i guess). I'm a praying man but that don't mean i need you to be a christian as well.

I do not have facebook, instagram, snapchat, kik, tiktok, or discord and I do not want them and will not get them just because I am being pressured. I am easygoing enough that I can interact with a lot of personalities without judgment..as long as you are a good enough person. Why does this seem like such a big deal? Maybe because I was in abusive relationship in which my boundaries were often ignored. I do not know. I do know it sucks having to constantly deal with this."

I can't make friends cause I have severe social anxiety and everyone stops talking to me because I'm boring. My brain fixates on the problems I have so it becomes the only thing I can think about and this makes it extremely hard to talk to people too. I can't leave the house and haven't been out except for on drives in 8 months due to fear of covid. I literally have not a soul to talk to and I'm dealing with one of the hardest phases in my life right now. I'm in a rough spot and I feel like the only thing to help is to have someone but I can't and don't and won't. Since everyone leaves I know there's gotta be something wrong with me. I can't work on it because the depression says what's the point if they're gonna leave anyways. I started taking prozac so I'm praying it gets me out of this hole I'm stuck in atm. My heart feels heavy and I'm tired of crying every single day. Any advice on how to ease this?

lonely,Sometimes I Feel Like There's Something Wrong with Me (vent post),"Sometimes I Feel Like There's Something Wrong with Me (vent post) - Some behaviors and thought patterns I've noticed in myself after honestly examining myself:

Tendency to overthink

Fear of being inadequate

Tendency to distance myself from others

Desire for order in my life (I don't like conflict, but I understand it's inevitable and I accept it)

Desire for love and affection (I really want to hug someone. Specifically in an ""I love you so much way"", not just a friendly way, ya know? I'm not sure if this thinking is toxic/delusional).

Perfectionistic mindset, which I think ties into being afraid of being inadequate

Social confusion/awkwardness, anxiety, poor mood

Another thing -- I guess my brain is like, on overdrive ALL the time? Like, I have trouble sleeping, and feel hyperactive mentally throughout the day. My brain is almost like a wheel that just keeps on rolling. Not much rest. Always thinking of something. I also tend to pace a lot around my house when not really doing anything

Not looking for a solution, as the title says I just wanted to say what's been bottled up in me for a while. I've already been to therapy and I'm working on these issues. Currently working on my driver's license at the moment. Once I (hopefully) get it and COVID clears up I plan on maybe hosting meetups for others in my age group plus. Just something where people can meet up and chat about games and other nerdy stuff. On another note I've always had the desire to help people. It's one of the most meaningful things there is to me, so I might also do volunteer work and see how that goes. Just gonna try different things out. Damn, I could go for a loving hug right now. Hell, even a friendly one wouldn't hurt."

I've talked to God about these things and yes he listened and took the pain away but I need to talk to someone.. to feel alittle bit more closure and relief... maybe even a personal connection to someone since that's another thing I'm lacking these days..  who knows maybe you've seen some of the same stuff and we can help eachother."

Wash,rinse, repeat  I hardly feel anything anymore it’s as if I just go through the motions. I haven’t cried in years so when I’m sad I’ll just play sad music and lay around in my room. Nobody knows anything is wrong with me everyone thinks my life is fine. I’ve had to be the strong one for my family a lot and shoulder everyone’s problems so I don’t think anyone even knows I’m capable of also feeling sad or upset. I play therapist for all my friends but I hate opening up so when I get asked about myself I just say “I’m fine”. It’s gotten to the point where nobody even asks how I am because everyone’s used to me being “fine” as if it’s my default setting when I haven’t been anything close for years. I realize I should open up but I feel like there’s no point so I just wallow on my own and act fine with everyone else."
lonely,Everybody is Temporary,"Everybody is Temporary - I'm fun to be around in short stints.  I'm not the person anyone wants around for too long.  Its something about my face or something about my voice or something about my personality.  Nobody see's me as a more permanent fixture.  For a few hours during a weekend, I don't feel so lonely.  I can even be fooled into thinking friendship is the cure to loneliness.  But when the night is over or the weekend ends, and we go back to our routines, they go back to their families and I go back to an empty studio apartment.

I used to begrudge Mondays because they signaled the start of the school/work week.  Now I begrudge them because they are the furthest point from when I get to return to the illusion of a meaningful existence to *someone*.

I wonder what it's like to have someone think about me, unprompted.  Someone that's maybe happy to come home to me.  Someone that thinks about me on their drive home.  Someone that wants to go on walks with me without the facade of an event.  Someone that wants to sit across from me for meals."
lonely,Extremely lonely in a relationship,"Extremely lonely in a relationship - I hope the kneejerk reaction to this isn't ""at least you have a relationship"". I just want some solace. While we live in the same house and are wfh due to covid, I never see my partner because he's working 24/7. Literally from 9am until midnight or later, while skipping lunch and having dinner at his desk. He wants to, he doesn't have to. He also sleeps in the spare bedroom. I'm literally always alone. Always. I have my cats but it's just not the same as meaningful human interaction. I haven't had a kiss for maybe a year? A hug only when I force one which obviously isn't fun. I've talked to him about it, he just... tells me he doesn't have time to listen because he's busy working.

I have my own work and hobbies. I have a few close friendships too but can't see them due to covid.

My parents moved abroad so I can't spend time with them either. When my mum came to visit I tried to discuss my loneliness but she threw it back in my face. We had a disagreement about petty household stuff. She escalated it and said it's obvious my bf leaves me alone because I'm so horrible. And that I've become weird because I'm always alone. When I was younger I had a couple close friends at school but not loads of superficial friends. My dad laughed at me and called me ""lone wolf"".

So obviously I don't want to discuss my loneliness with anyone anymore. Just you guys.

I cry every night because my life is just stressful work and extreme loneliness. I would have definitely hurt myself if not for my cats. Just so someone would be forced to talk to me kindly."
lonely,Why do I even bother with r4r? All it does is make me hurt worse.,"Why do I even bother with r4r? All it does is make me hurt worse. - I've been posting on r/r4r for months now, with nothing to show for it. I was just ghosted, again, this time by someone who was close to me and with whom I had a lot in common. I was stupid enough to let myself get hopeful, again. I can now state with confidence that the only thing that subs like r/r4r have added to my life is the pain of being ghosted again and again and again by people I was hopeful about.

I get it. Reddit isn't a priority for people who have lives worth living. A foray into r4r is a temporary embarrassment for them. Talking to me is something they'll laugh about later. I just wish I'd never even known how unpalatable I must be, even to people whose only exposure to me is through text on a screen. I wish I could just blame my loneliness on COVID, but the sad truth is that it has barely changed my life. I didn't have friends or romantic prospects before, and I still don't. I rarely left home except for chores, and I still don't. Even in college I spent 99% of the time I wasn't in class in my bed staring at a screen. Every time I've tried to do anything else has reminded me why - I'm just worthless. I just give off a stench of pathetic wherever I go. Everyone I come into contact with knows not to waste their time with me."

lonely,I never realised how lonely i actually was till my friend decided to respawn,"I never realised how lonely i actually was till my friend decided to respawn - If you don't believe in shifting then just don't read this please. 


A while ago one of my two really close friend decided to respawn to her DR (i am sorry if you don't know what shifting or DR is, if you are interested google it) and stay there forever. They didn't do it yet but they will do it soon. They won't be exactly dead since their clone will be in this reality, they even told me i could shift and meet them at their DR whenever i wanted to, but i don't feel better at all.. The idea of a clone scares me, I could never talk to their clone the same way, even tho it is just different version of their consciousness. It is not the same. 
I do feel betrayed that they would leave me here (i knew them for more than 10 years) but i get why they would want to do it. I feel selfish for wanting them to be unsuccessful  but yet i tell myself that they are selfish for leaving me here and telling me on such a short notice. They didn't even want to tell me at first. 
They would left me just like that and i wouldn't even know ( which when i think about it would possibly be better).
I feel horrible, 
 i don't know what to do. My other close friend lives quite far from me and we don't see each other very often. So i won't have anyone near me who i can talk to about anything and everything. 
I have never felt so lonely.

I also can’t really speak clearly so most of the time I have to repeat the things I am saying.

I also overthink everything like I’ll have lots of situations playing in my head about people that don’t even know me and about literally the smallest things for, example what I’m going to do when I’m meeting and I’ll have like 5 different situations of that playing in my head. 

And I catch feelings way to quick like if I have just a normal conversation with some girl I probably caught feelings already. 

And there I am laying in my bed at night listening to my Juice WRLD playlist crying myself to sleep, feel like the only thing that is keeping me alive are the people that care about me. :)"
lonely,a tip that helped me,"a tip that helped me - With social media and all kinds of crap in the world its easy to get social anxiety as you feel you aren't enough physically or look good.

Or maybe its because you feel you are lesser because of your race. 

You need to start thinking about others as others as an energy.

No matter what we look like on the outside whether you are old, young, ugly, beautiful. we all have a special and unqiue energy inside of us to share with others.

Knowing this really helped my self confidence as i understood that it wasn't physcial looks that made you friends it was being yourself and connecting and vibing with other people's energy.

so if you are constantly feeling lonely and sad then maybe you need to approach life differently, improve yourself, and embrace your own energy. 

because at the end of the day that is the only thing that stands through our life. We all become old but we all keep our energy. 

by making energy the source of your confidence and knowing who you are as a person then that confidence and happiness will be everlasting

hope this helped :) Good vibes"

All I have found since then were two girls who thought it would be a good Idea to play games with me and then dump me like trash. 

Im not that good at meeting new people... Especially women. I don't like going out at all... The next problem is that I'm not very confident about my looks and all so I'm too afraid to go towards women on the street or wherever... 

I can't stand the lonelyness anymore guys. It consumes me more and more everyday like darkness that comes over me.

lonely,Scrambled thoughts,"Scrambled thoughts - I get lonelier by the day. No one is ever around to hear my troubles. My heart just aches for the smallest bit of love. 

I used to have a girlfriend. We were together for a decade. But she too left. It’s been five years since she was here. I still can’t seem to runaway from her ghost. 
There’s another girl I’m into. But she’s not interested in me anymore. So I guess I’m not into love.. anymore. Maybe forever. 

I wish I could believe in a god. Maybe then I’d be less lonely. Sometimes I feel, all I have are the voices in my head. I don’t know how much I can trust them. They’ve plotted against my well being before. They see all I do but still don’t help. They remind me of parasites. Living off any happiness that enters my soul. See, cause the happy feeling is always fleeting and they’re always hungry. Hungry for more. The more I feed, the hungrier they get. I’m running out of energy and patience. 
There are times I fantasize about ending it all. Sometimes with a knife. The imagery seems painful so I switch to a quicker way. Like a gun. That just seems like a lot of work. Other times I’ve thought of overdosing on Xanax pills. But I don’t have enough anymore. Falling from a building? Better hope it’s tall enough. Last thing I want is to survive a fall like that. 
Then I wonder if anyone else has the same thoughts as me? How do two lonely people find each other? Are we destined to be forever alone? How can I be so afraid of living, that death seems like the prize?"

It's almost like some form of disrespect, in the sense that they tell you everything, you talk for hours but when you ask them to call you because you're struggling they say they can't. 

I'm *this close* to just give up on humankind, give up on all my pursuits of finding my forever-person. 

Personally, I feel very alone. There's no one in my life I can tell what I'm going through.

It sounds awful to base my life’s worth over the search for somebody, but that’s what I’ve let it become. I work late, long hours on afternoon shift. I only see my family on weekends when I’m off, and I live with them. Yet with the limited interactions with them and my circle of friends, I can never truely smile. For the past three years I’ve lived an isolated life inside my bedroom and I think I might not be able to take it anymore. I just want a fucking hug, but I can’t even get a message back. 

And fuck it I’ll say it, I’m sure other guys feel the same way about themselves too. I’d be a fucking amazing boyfriend. So why am I still living in the shadows, I’ve got a good job, money in the bank ready for a home deposit, and a fucking tonne of love to give. What more can I do, I’m exhausted already.

Are you up for the challenge? :) - I've made a form to find friends where 25 questions are asked (most are multiple choice). And based on the answers you get matched up with other users.

&amp;#x200B;

We ask two things for each topic, (1) Your answer (2) Answers you want to be matched up with. So we ask about whether you want to voice call 📞, share pictures 📷, your continent 🗺️, your age, if you play games/books often, if you're studying or working and so forth!

&amp;#x200B;

This makes it super simple and quick to find people that both want to talk to each other. You are instantly shown matched people, and then you can send them a friend request, once they accept then contacts details are shared with the both of you.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck everyone! Any questions please ask away :)

Problem is my mental health is horrid, and honestly his isn’t the greatest either. We both have a lot of work to do on our selves. I figured we could grow and learn together considering we’re both young. It’s not quite working out like I thought it would. I have no friends to turn to, and my family just moved three hours away. They’ve never cared to listen to my problems anyway though. I don’t even know what I’m doing here... looking for advice? A friend? Just some people to acknowledge I exist?"

Thing is, I don’t think therapy is helping and I’m continuing to sink in this black hole of depression. I really want to start a fresh, move from my country and go study abroad. I feel like my environment is becoming toxic and I’m tired of dealing with the same people. Loneliness sucks. Feeling lonely is the worst. If I could just get out of my country and move to somewhere new where no one knows me, that would be the best thing ever."

I don't have any friends. I don't talk to anyone.  I kinda like it. I don't have any dreams, goals, ambitions and expectations.

lonely,Be my Covid partner,"Be my Covid partner - It's like ""summer love"" but ""covid partner"" :D  I know there are other subreddits intended for this but I think you understand me better.

Basically my problem is that I'm from a poor family that moved quite a lot. This gives me hard time when I try to socialize, I don't feel like I fit into people surrounding me. I gave up on social networks long ago cuz watching other ppl lifes only gives me envy and low sef-esteem. I do get connected with people from time to time but they wander off eventually - make families or move to another cities or spend time with more significant friends. I haven't lost hope to get irl friends yet and I have some ideas but covid events drop my chances to zero. I have noone to talk to about lot of stuff and get somewhat equal initiative from next time. So here I am slowly losing my sanity from loneliness, finally having a courage to make this post to look for buddy to hang out online with :D What happens after covid? I'm not clingy, and if you get irl friends and start to spend time with them - I wouldn't mind. I can understand, this is something I crave for too. 

For females - I don't expect romance. I think I crave for it, but I have a little faith in LDR. Well unless there are plans to hang out irl. 

I'm straight white 30M. I work as a software developer (mobile apps, but I know a lot of stuff besides that). As a hobby I do hardware development (arduino and stuff) and digital painting (i've started a course this year). I watch quite a lot of memes and youtube vids. I play PC games regularly. Right now it's Overwatch primarily, I play both competitive (stuck in gold) and casual. Also I have a big Steam library and I don't mind to try something new. My music taste is wide but picky, most of my fav songs are from metal subgenres. If my appearance matters - I look okayish :D A bit chubby, but I'm working on it. I'm available online almost all day when I'm not sleeping, and I'm free after work during about 14:00-18:00 UTC.

I'm laid back and somewhat empathic. I can listen you up but I won't let you dump all negativity on me, neither I will do same to you. Let's instead do something together - talk about things or share memes and music or waste some spare SRs at Overwatch or draw another one rare Pepe or teach each other something new or make a piece of software, maybe even a game, idk :D 

Send me DM. But please make sure first you are about my age (25-33? idk I feel younger than my age), we have some common grounds (not just gaming) and schedule. Mic is must have with time. Please don't do it if you have a significant other or a family - this only makes me envious, besides you should spend time with them, not with a stranger from the internet :D"

lonely,Social medias &amp; loneliness,"Social medias &amp; loneliness - A little bit about myself. 

I’m 20 years old (M) and I’m studying psychology at the University of Ottawa. Since the age of 14, I’ve hated social medias (Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, VSCO) because I feel like it distances human beings instead of bringing us together. I’ve outgrown my generation (and technology) and I feel extremely alone. 

Some problems with social medias

1. Social medias programs us to value our self worth based on other people’s opinion of us. Most of the time, when someone posts a picture on Instagram for example, they want to be approved by their followers, they want to get likes. If they don’t get the likes they think they deserve, some feel sad and others go as far as deleting the picture and feeling bummed out for the rest of the day. 

2. No one cares about what you do. With stories becoming a thing on snapchat and instagram, people feel the need to keep their followers know what they’re up to for the day. People want to show others that their life is exciting even if it’s not true. 

Social medias makes me feel alone.

As I earlier said, I absolutely hate social medias. Sadly, when I delete my social medias and go for a walk or a bike ride, there’s rarely people my age outside. I feel like social medias define who they are and that most of them are stuck in that false world, in their homes. When I do see people of my generation outside, they’re often on their phones walking like zombies. I feel like there’s not a lot of people who feel the way I do and it makes me feel like I’m alone. It also happens that I’m spending time with someone and that they pull out their phone and visit their social medias while I’m there, waiting for them. With social medias growing at this rate, I’m scared that this problem will just get worse and I dont want to feel the way I do for the rest of life. I just wish I could meet people with the same mindset as mine."

lonely,Never had real friends.,"Never had real friends. - 20 years of my life I never had a another human that I can call my best friend nor I have a significant other. I made friends and lost them throughout my years. Had some good old times but it never last. My friendships never lasted. Sometimes I cry sometimes I think I don't need any of them. I grew so comfortable being alone, making friends irl is so difficult for me. One of my favourite songs is castle on the hill and it always makes me cry. It's something I wish I had."
lonely,Lonely,Lonely - I’m blown away by how much of this sub (or at least the posts showing up in my feed) talk about how their loneliness is tied to not having a partner or not having sex. Like I have suffered with loneliness my entire life in some form with a lot of rejection issues. It’s a feeling I just can’t shake. I have been in relationships and felt lonely. And now I am in a point in my life where I am breaking down daily from this sensation of being truly alone and worthless. I feel like friendships are fickle and lack depth and that dating is futile Becuase I lack energy. My loneliness is both tied to my depression and my mental health but also a lot of things I’ve been through growing up. I just want to be happy with my own company. I don’t want to find happiness in someone else or a hug or sex or a relationship. I truly just want to feel happy with my own company when I’m sat in a room by myself. I want to stop sleeping when no one spends time with me Becuase I hate being left alone.

We talk about our mental health, joke around, meet as much as possible, she is even helping me to finally start going to therapy. But it's not enough for me, as selfish as that sounds. I truly wish that we were together. Because of this, I started feeling hopeless, that I will never got into a relationship ever again or not find a person like her, that there is truly nothing left for me anymore. I've fallen for the right person at the wrong time. It's a part of me that she will never know."

You didn’t care that I was fat and ugly or that I was a failure and a zealous self righteous idiot. You guys made me happy and you cared about me.

lonely,Do i stand any chance with my crush?,"Do i stand any chance with my crush? - 

So i have this crush who’s in my class, well he’s very out of my league, he’s tall and beautiful, and he got these 2 sparkling brown eyes and shiny brown hair, he haven’t hadn’t a girlfriend since like gindergarden which is kinda nice i guess
Even though we’ve been in the same class for 3 years now i have almost never talked to him, i’m way to shy, but the times we do have to talk because of school he always says my name before saying something to me, i haven’t heard him doing this to anyone else so i dunno if that’s a sign or not

I’m too scared to look at him but the times i look at him i mostly catch him looking at me first, for example in the school cafeteria, i remember this one time i sat at the table across him w some people and i looked up and he looked at me smiling 🥺 kinda sounds creepy but my heart literally melted

It would be very weird if he liked me because he’s kinda popular ( not w the girls though cuz hes kinda awkward and not like other guys and he has a baby face - very cute i must say ) and he plays sports, and i’m this awkward shy girl who’s never had a boyfriend, i don’t have a single friend ( like i’m alone all the time at school ) and i am kinda fat, but i guess some people like that? I dunno, even if he did like me i am that kinda person you deny having a crush on until ur like 40 years old and don’t have anyone else to marry so u marry me instead 🤠👍

Without a girl who I think is beautiful for who she is and loves me back and at the end of the day I can call a friend.  As I sit alone in the dark laying in bed listening to the fan spin, all I can think about is how much I wish I could hold someone close.  Have my arm wrapped around her waist with are fingers intertwined.  A girl that is close enough so I can smell her beautiful hair and feel her comforting warmth as fall rolls in.  Then I could finally drift off to a pleasant sleep because I would no longer feel alone.  Instead I’m thinking about all the videos on YouTube of beautiful couples acting cute together compilations.  Wishing that was me.  Thinking about the pretty girls in school who I use to flirt with, positive that at least one of them liked me back.  Only if I had the balls to ask them out.  Maybe.  Just maybe.  They could be the girl that I have my arm wrapped around tonight.  But instead my bed is cold."

My drinking problem has come back because even after a year and a half I want her back. Prove to her I am a worthy man. I'm a social worker. I work with juvenile male sex offenders. I've always been about working for the greater good. According to my ex, I'd never be able to provide. An independent woman but still wanted the man as the bread winner. Due to my drinking my family has stopped talking to me. I'm barely hanging on. All I want is to help and love. But life keeps putting me down.

But the fact is it was negatively impacting my own mental health. I would like to meet nice people who fall into the same category as me. Lonely. Seeking a friend. Real honest relationships. I don't have much hope in it but idk you never know. My life isn't all put together right now. I fell apart like humpty dumpty and now I'm trying to put myself back together again. I use different outlets to help such as music, song writing, being mindful just being outdoors going for tea. It all gets repetitive though. I really do enjoy my own company but often times I find myself just wanting something else. Something more because I feel so unfulfilled. Theres a person who I speak to but I consistently block. Because they don't care. It's hard to cut them out but idk maybe it could be easy if I met someone real instead. I can't even tell what is a lie and what is the truth when it comes to them. It's hazardous. Anyways. I live in Canada Ontario &amp; I'd like to meet local people as well. I can't meet anyone right away but if I meet someone I connect with a lot maybe in the future I would. For now I just seek a virtual friendship. I don't wanna go back to those dating sites to find friends. I don't want to waste my whole life waiting for a reply."

Safe from hate/Love, Pain/joy 
Until you feel nothing at all

A baby’s cry means nothing 
A dead corpse is trivial 
Mothers neglecting children is dally 
Loneliness becomes your routine friend 
Death seems like tranquility 
Sleeping is never pleasant

lonely,Almost completely alone.,"Almost completely alone. - I guess the best way to say it is I’m almost completely alone. All my “friends” if you could call them that are stoners and screw ups who only really talk to me if they need something like a ride. I live with my parents I’m 19 but I get the vibe they’re reaching the tail end of their tolerance of wanting me. Being honest I don’t blame them for not liking me. So I’ll be transferring to a different college this spring. As for romantic relationships I’ve been in one it was hell and I’ve avoided them since. 
Unfortunately I live in a smallish southern town and I’m a nerd. They’re isn’t shit to do unless you’re into hunting or doing drugs. Neither of which particularly interests me. Hopefully things will be better in college next semester but given my luck I truly don’t have high hopes. 
As for things getting better in college with my luck it’ll be more of the same at best or dealing with dickholes on the daily at worst for the sweet sweet price tag of 15000 dollars plus tax and interests. A year. 

Either way I don’t blame people for not liking me anymore. As of lately I’ve gotten more bitter and unpleasant. In fact I’ve stopped really seeing people as people and more a means to an end. Wanna get a raise and better job security go hunting with the boss even though I don’t like that. I’ll smile and give them compliments if that’s what they want to hear. Just as long as their willing to pay me. As for college academically I do fine I don’t expect that to change. As for romance I don’t see myself in another relationship unless it’s a means to an end. Not to mention where I am currently doesn’t have an exactly great selection of either gender to choose from.

I guess the best way to say it at this point is while I am lonely I’m not willing to open myself up to any vulnerability romantic or otherwise.  Man this who thing seems contradictory reading it out. Oh well at least I said it to someone."

Why is it basic options like even just hanging out in the same room with a loved one has never ever existed when it's seen as simply a given even in your early years of life?

I have to just let them do it because I don’t want to seem like a sensitive person. All the friends I used to have are fading away and don’t talk to me anymore. I am stationed across the country from all my family and remaining friends. Everyone I talk to just thinks I’m weird. I came to this thread hoping someone will listen to me because I don’t want people to feel bad for me if I tell them how I actually feel. I honestly am so lost in my life rn.

lonely,Is this normal or at least somewhat relatable?,"Is this normal or at least somewhat relatable? - I’ve had countless one-sided crushes over the years. For some reason, when my crush is single and winds up with another guy, it feels like my heart has been broken, almost as though she was my girlfriend and cheated on me. All my life, that’s been my typical response to that scenario, but when I take a few steps back, it seems insane and seems like it’s not how healthy, well-adjusted people would respond to missing out on dating opportunities. When I occasionally think of them being intimate together, I start getting really uncomfortable, and my breathing seems to quicken, like I want to run away, but I can’t, because it’s in my head."

lonely,Am I being strung along?,"Am I being strung along? - Hi all.

I confessed my love to my best friend at the beginning of this year. At first it seemed to be working, but I ended up going to quick and we fell out as a result shortly after. Ever since then I have been trying to recover the friendship we had before, but I can't shake my feelings for her. Currently, we seem to have almost fully recovered our friendship, and she considers our dynamic to be ""more than friends"" and that we have a ""spark""; however, when I bring up the possibility of a relationship, she says that she needs time because she believes she's in the wrong place mentally to begin a relationship, which is completely understandable.

Where I begin to question her mentality towards a relationship with me is that she doesn't want to commit or make promises and wait for the right time, and she seems to be considering the possibility of other options. Before I confessed to her, she had a crush on a housemate but he doesn't share the feeling. We have talked about her feelings towards him fairly recently and she said some feelings for him remain, but she has mostly given up on him.

At this point, I'm beginning to drive myself crazy about whether we are going to end up together or not, I really love her and think we are ""meant for each other""; after all, shouldn't your loved one be like a best friend to you? When I ask her if I should just move on and focus on just being a good friend to her (ultimately friendzoning myself, but I'd rather know where we stand than to carry on with uncertainty), but she doesn't want me to give up on her. It's like she's just keeping me around as a last resort and when I push her on this and ask if she's holding out for someone else, she then changes how she sees us happening from ""we either happen, or find someone else"" to ""we either happen or we end up alone"".

I'm at a crossroads where I'm not sure which path I should take. Continuing to hope it will work out seems to be setting myself up for a fall, but deciding to move on from her seems like resigning myself to loneliness forever. I'm not a very outgoing guy, nor am I attractive, and so I doubt I would have another chance with a girl, definitely not one as great and likeminded as her. I find myself thinking, if even she doesn't want me, who else ever will.

Another option could be that I'm just being totally unfair here and this all lies completely with me. I'm completely open to that possibility, so please let me know if you think so.

I look forward to your responses and thank you for taking the time to read this post :)"

lonely,Whats worse than not knowing if your ex still likes u or not?,Whats worse than not knowing if your ex still likes u or not? - It was supposed to be a break and i fking pushed her and she said breakup. We are friends now. I asked her what i did wrong and she said its because shes not emotionally prepared. She was like don’t wait for me but i like her so much. She was hinting we can try again in the future. I asked her what she liked from me and she was like i always thought u were cute.Maybe we met at the wrong time.She probably accepted cuz she had a crush on me idk if she still has it or not. I noticed having a crush and loving someone is different.Im not going to let my own feelings to ruin our friendship. I am still young and i have time. I just don’t want my regret to go over my life.

lonely,Is it impulsive to download Tinder just because I’m feeling lonely,"Is it impulsive to download Tinder just because I’m feeling lonely - I deleted tinder months ago and am thinking about downloading it again after a few lonely days this week.  But I’m hesitant to make a new account because:

- I would prefer to meet someone by chance, opposed to on a dating site. 

- I still get sad over my breakup back in February sometimes. I saw my ex with his new gf recently and I was unexpectedly very emotional. It took awhile to feel better and in this moment I was relieved to be single. Otherwise my reaction would’ve been pretty inappropriate. 

- Im not over the guy I met shortly after my ex and I split. There was something special there that I can’t seem to let go of. It’s been 4 months since I’ve seen him and he still pops into my mind every day. Unlikely scenario but if I was with someone new and he came back in the picture, I’m not confident that I would be able to ignore him. 

- I have enjoyed this time by myself. I only have to plan my schedule around my dog and I. If I want to go to the movies on Saturday and play video games alone all day Sunday I can without checking with anyone first. I would never think this way when I’m in a relationship. I have always put more energy into my partners than myself. But because of that it’s been kind of nice to just worry about me for a minute. 

- I’ve had.my heart broken twice already this year and I’m terrified of going through it again. 

It doesn’t seem fair to date someone when I’m not sure if I can fully commit, I’m still reminiscing about my past relationship, and im longing for someone else. But I do miss not having a SO. When I see couples in public holding hands it makes me question why I’m not trying to pursue that. I have a lot of love to give. 

Am I just being impulsive? Do I push through this moment of loneliness or do I try it again?"

I've never had a guy come up to me and ask for my number, but it happens to her so often.

i can't count the number of times she came home and a guy had done her a favor. for example yesterday she went to a garage to get her car fixed and the guy didn't make her pay and told her she could come tomorrow again to see him.
it's really cliche but it happens to her so much 

I just can't comprehend how pretty guy walk up to her and ask for her number, how she has so many friends and so much more I want to be her... it sounds so wrong but it's true

yes I'm jealous, I just want someone that loves me and asks me if i'm okay. I want someone that cares about me that's it

i'm not sure if I should even post this but whatever, I have no one to talk to and even if I did how could I even say that about my sister.

I've always said that I don't want to use dating apps to find one and that I want to leave it to chance and fate.

No one messages me, I thought that might change when this pandemic stuff happened and everyone was doing video calls etc, but nothing.

I have a lovely, supportive boyfriend whom I live with, he's great but I don't have the friendly connections he has, I don't have best friends, just people I know.

lonely,"No one truly cares about me, and I have no real friends.","No one truly cares about me, and I have no real friends. - I'll cut the crap because I'm probably just a typical sad college student. Anyway. I'm in my second year of college (where I absolutely hate my course, but that's a different thing) and it's just getting depressing that no one truly gives a crap about me - like I don't think I have a single ""real friend"" with whom I can discuss anything at any time and with whom I have a ton of stuff in common with. 

I've lost the 2 people I was closest with in the past year and a bit - I broke up with my first and only (so far) girlfriend (who was basically my best friend before we went out) in June last year and haven't spoken to a single girl romantically (which obviously also means my sex life quite literally hasn't existed for over a year now), and me and my best friend of over 10 years parted ways, because that friendship was getting toxic. And those were the only 2 people in my life who I felt actually cared about me, and with whom I could share a lot of my issues.

I've also drifted with a lot of my friends (well, by friends, I mean people who I saw on an almost daily basis and got along with), and almost never see anyone who I went to school with, outside of college. It doesn't help that I live far away from all the people who I liked to at least some extent.

Anyway, nowadays the people I interact with most outside of college are people that I don't, and most likely will never meet in person. I am in a few chats across multiple platforms, some to do with my interests, some just general chats, but in those I'm just one of many people. As for my social media? I could probably delete them all for a week and come back to messages from maybe 3 people max, if I'm lucky.

I guess it's sort of freeing to not rely on other people like I used to, but it gets very lonely and depressing. I really don't know what I'm expecting by writing this, but it just feels good to write about my problems (because once again, no one in my life would ever care enough to listen to these kinds of things from me), so if anyone does read this, thank you very much."

It’s like I want to be social but the people who I think in my corner are pretty 1 sided, as I mentioned before it’s like if it’s not me hitting them up they don’t hit me up.

I mean at this point i'll take having a convo with some random person then sit in my room playing games so if anyone is up for a chat hmu

lonely,18 F - Too High Expectations?,"18 F - Too High Expectations? - Dear Friends,

First of all, I would like to thank you for reading my post. It means a lot to me.

Unfortunately,  my heart keeps aching for someone every single day. At the end of a  hectic week, I want nothing more than to be within the loving arms of my  significant other. To just keep staring at each other and continue  smiling endlessly. To feel safe, secured, protected. To have plans  together, to have something to fight for. To guide each other through  dire times.

All these things sound  great, but in my opinion, not many people want to go into a  relationship with the intention of eventually getting married and having  a family, and that hurts me deeply.

I  consider myself a high-caliber woman, and I feel like my expectations  are too high. I have tried looking for my soulmate online. After I make a  long post in which I invest all my emotions and time, I get a dozen of  ""hi, how are you?"" replies, and that really puts me off. I never seem to  get responses that are actually meaningful, ones that would make me  interested and leave me wanting to chat more.

I  would like to find myself a man who is at peace with himself,  intelligent, educated, and who does not consider himself a loser or a  failure. The thing is, if you just keep being desperate, if you keep  telling yourself that you are just ""average"", that you are bad at  everything you do, how can you expect a change? If you manage to  identify the problem, work on it.

What  do you think, are my expectations too high? Should I lower them? Will I  be able to ever find myself someone that I am on the same level with?  And if yes, where should I be searching?

Take care,

Altagracia"

lonely,25F from amazing Cali,"25F from amazing Cali - Sometimes I’m happy and mostly I’m not. The only time when I’m happy is when I’m drinking which is sad. I’m from a place that has millions of people but I can’t find a decent looking person. I’m lonely as fuck and have no one, unlike others. When I say lonely I mean LONELY. No friends, barely see my parents, have no more connection with my sister since high school and don’t have a boyfriend, obviously. I’ve never had a boyfriend from where Im from and always had to resort to out of the country to be in a relationship. Why not have another one? 

I see literally everyone with a partner and I’m like “how the fuck are people able to do that? When will it be my turn?” It makes me sick at the sight of a couple who is my age or younger than me. I just can’t stop thinking about it. I try to distract myself by studying or watching tv shows but it doesn’t work. 
I try to get my shit together and change myself in the best possible way. Eating healthy, exercising, studying, paying off all my bills, saving money, etc. hey, it’s still not enough. 
Anyway, I’m looking for a relationship..not here where I live, because I’ve already gave this place a chance. I’m talking: bars, meetups, tinder (trash), hinge, and so on. I don’t feel like I belong here and I’m completely different from everyone else.

I tend to have a negative aspect of the world based on my life experience, but I’m trying to change that.  

So I want to travel next year to Europe when this covid shit is over because I think this is what I need. If you’re from Europe maybe you can show me around and we can become friends or more. I’m ranting. If you like black girls, hmu 
Send a picture of you since you can already see me. Thaaaanks 😄"

Among other things it's that I definitely come off as very weird and lifeless probably, hell maybe even programmed ffs. That's probably creeping my crush out even though she really seems to like talking to me irl (not so much over text, so that's confusing as well).

I really don't know how to do social interaction too well. Some of the people in my class started thinking that I'm ""special""...

I feel like it would be beneficial if I just didn't really tall to too many people and just kinda did my thing, that would be better for everyone. No awkward bullshit and constant overthinking for me, no unsettling weirdo who can't even look you in the eyes for them."

But the actual thought of the future -

What can I do to be less depressed? - Hi everyone, I (35F) moved to a new city 2.5 years ago. Since living here I have a couple of work friends I used to go out with a couple of times a month for happy hour. Since working at home I don't really see them. My closest friend in state lives in a town about 3 hours from me, but she is loved up and living with her boyfriend and now I see her maybe every other month. I also have two other friends that I see maybe once a month. Since COVID started I have averaged socializing once a month. Nobody ever texts me. Nobody ever calls me. I feel so incredibly lonely. I wonder why I have no friends anymore. 

When I was in my 20s I had a big group of friends. We were together 3 or 4 nights a week. We did everything together for years. I was never lonely. This last year or so is the first time in my adult life I've really felt like I have nobody. I can see that I'm getting really depressed. Sometimes I don't leave the couch for 2 days and I'm just sinking into this type of sadness that I don't really know what to do with. 

Any advice would be much appreciated."

lonely,"Alone in a Foreign Land, Forgotten and Ignored","Alone in a Foreign Land, Forgotten and Ignored - I’ve been alone most of my life. I was married for a decade, had three kids. Left my ex a few years ago because she was selfish and quite happy with me being miserable. Anything I tried to change she blocked. Eventually I realized she didn’t care about my well being as long as she had everything she wanted, which didn’t include me. And my wants, needs, and desires were bad, because they weren’t hers. I always struggled with depression, and she fed my negativity to keep me controlled.

My family and I long ago became estranged. Barely ever talk. Usually only if I call. I have a big family, during the collapse of my marriage I tried to reach out to them for support. I would hear all the things you want to hear when you call family “we love you” “we’re here for you”... but after a month they stopped answering my calls. They never called me. No one calls me.

My friends all decided to dump me as well, as none of them were interested or cared about my problems. I had to make new friends, and it’s hard when you’re in your 30s, when you work long hours, when you’re broke. I had a little bit of success, for a time. I joined a gym, I joined social groups. But no relationship ever stuck. People would find girlfriends or boyfriends and I’d be left out. No one was ever available, I was never invited to things, I might get one or two dates with a woman and be told “wow you’re a wonderful guy! But I met someone else/you’re not for me/I’m moving away/someone else will make you happy. Goodbye.”

After a few years of therapy to recover from my devastating divorce, I finally left the miserable city I lived in and moved to Europe, hoping to meet people, date again, and travel... and instead I landed here just in time for Coronapocalypse and all of that becoming impossible. I lost touch with the couple of people I knew, through the move and the virus. 

I had a close friend, and moving her brought us closer in distance. We were talking about adventures, we were moving towards dating. We had stolen weekends and vacations together for the last couple years. We talked all the time, texts and phone calls for hours on end. Held each other close when we were together. Told each other about our love. It’s hard to describe, but I felt confident about her and I this year.

She got a boyfriend in lockdown and told me to stop talking to her. She was the last person I called friend. I love her, deeply. We have something special. But this damn virus we couldn’t spend time together.

So here I am. Alone in a country where I can barely order dinner in the language, let alone talk to anyone casually. It’s all the same though. I meet people. I get phone numbers, but nothing is ever set up. People tell me they’re having parties or going out with a group but I’m never invited. 

I tried online dating. I get scams and solicitation for services. Any real people I talk to never have time to meet up. Or just go silent.

My coworkers don’t care, they have family and lives. Heck when there was a day the trains in my area had issues and it took me two hours to get to work, multiple colleagues said “oh I thought about calling and offering you a ride to work. But I didn’t.” I wasn’t just forgotten, I was remembered and then actively excluded.

The only people I can reliably talk to are my current and old therapist...and I pay them money to listen.

No one cares.

I’m not just alone. I’m pushed away."

In theory, the idea of being intimate with someone sounds really nice.

My body goes in a flight response and I push away people who could potentially be good for me like an automatic response. I think my fear of intimacy is also caused by my fear of being vulnerable, *sigh*"

none of them wanted me...and...just...what did i do wrong? what am i doing wrong? what is wrong with me? why do i always fuck up?...why am i such a fuck up?

i wish i could live inside my head...then i wouldnt have to worry anymore, i wouldnt feel sad, i'd have someone that wants me, someone that wants to ve with me and likes me for who i am...i...well...i wouldnt feel lonely anymore

i dont know if im asking for much...i just wish i could have what everyone has...

i see them all, they're happy and smiling...they dont have to worry about the future, they dont have to go there alone, even if times are rough, they have someone that'll be by their side no matter what...they arent alone...they're living their best life, living their dreams, and being their best selfs...i just want to do that too

but everytime i try to be better, i turn out worse than before...i...why cant i be better?

I feel like a plant left in the closet receiving no light at all. - Seriously, loneliness effects your immune system and health. I know because I’m watching myself rot away little by little.

I have a good job, I supervise 30 people and I pretty much love my crew. At work for the most part I’m at least happy I’m around people, even if work is stressing me out, there’s always a few people there who make my day.

But my outside of work life is a complete disaster. I’m actually sad to leave work because then I’m alone. I hardly have any friends who reach out, they barely text or call, when I reach out they barely reach back. It’s just so soul sucking. I live in the middle of nowhere, and while I have hobbies that occupy my time, there’s far too much time of just me stuck alone with my thoughts and how fucking lonely I am.

I’m so depressed I don’t even spend my money, I just keep banking it because I’m too unmotivated to even buy the things I could buy. 

I need a girlfriend, someone to spoil with attention and affection and look forward to their conversations and hear all about their life, to look forward to their texts and know that they miss me or are thinking about me.

Because far too often I feel like I’m in no one’s thoughts, like I’m invisible or worthless or am not even worth a phone call or a few lines of text messages.

Seriously, what good is a great paying job or a nice place or having lots of musical and artistic talent if you don’t have someone to share it with, if you don’t have a muse in your life. If this is my future then I’d rather die now, there’s gotta be a beautiful woman out there eight now who is just as lonely as I am, who just wants attention and to feel needed, ok I’ve been ranting far too long but I’d give anything in the world to truly feel loved."

 I'm tired of being so pathetically lonely, but I guess we can't all be successful in having relationships. I used to think if I got skinnier or if I just looked prettier people would like me, but I realized it's not my physical appearance that's the problem. I'm just a downer of a person with a dull personality and little interesting traits about me. If I met me I wouldn't want to be my friend either tbh. I guess I was just hoping it was my physical appearance since that's easier to change than my personality.

lonely,"""I'm the embodiment of misery, and I'd kill to have some company"" - Lil Skele, Company","""I'm the embodiment of misery, and I'd kill to have some company"" - Lil Skele, Company - I was never the popular kid in high school. I was always to myself and the small group of friends I had didn't even feel like friends. It was more like I sat with a group of friends that all had their own lives and I didn't. At a last ditch effort to do something exciting, i lived abroad for a year and actually had the time of my life. Made friends, had relationships that felt real, and people actually cared what I had to say. Fast forward 2 years, I'm back in my hometown; no one from high school even considers me a friend; I've lost contact with almost all of my foreign friends and the ones i do talk to are never consitent; I'm working a job I hate; my motivation and self esteem is at an all time low and there are so many things I wanna do (write, workout, learn another language, etc.), But I can never bring myself to do it. The only contact i get anymore is at work (main reason I'm scared to quit), and I wish i could say that if it weren't for quarantine, i would be doing more but I seriously doubt it. I just want to be better and feel like I matter. I want to be able to love myself enough to where others don't mean that much to me. I know my family loves me, but I can't help but feel like I'm just an extra to everyone else. Doesn't help that I thought I had made a new friend, but she began ghosting me after like 2 weeks of texting each other everyday. Shouldn't have gotten my hopes up again huh?  It's gotten to the point where I'm so desperate for someone to just talk to me I'll make myself look stupid or try super hard to get a reaction, or when I'm actually having a conversation with someone, i can only think about how I'll be able to keep talking to them. Am i creepy? Maybe I'm just cringey, idk."

I have plenty of people I would consider friends, but they are people I can play a game with, send a meme to, or a person who feels comfortable venting to me. 

I genuinely enjoy being there for people and making others laugh, and I’ve gotten the “group dad/daddy” joke put on me for basically any friend group I’ve been apart of (most online ones) but I’m realizing bro this shit sucks. I was fine being an emotional crutch for others, I’m rather stable in my own emotions as well but I think this is the longest I’ve gone without someone I’m genuinely connected with. I’m single, I don’t have a person I consider my best friend, nor someone I naturally look forward to speaking with daily. 

The friends I have, I interact with in the moment it feels like, they don’t bleed into other parts of my life like I feel a close friend should, or maybe I’m just lonely over being single and hard staring at everything. 

Anyway, I’m not sure what I want with this post, maybe I’m just venting/speaking into the void. However if anyone is looking to chat/looking for memes and music recommendations, I’m your guy. Always up for a new person to talk to"
lonely,Nothing makes you realise how lonely and meaningless your existence is than your birthday.,"Nothing makes you realise how lonely and meaningless your existence is than your birthday. - I turned 20 today, and the only ppl who've wished me are my parents. I waited till 2 am, not one person wished, even though most of them were up. I had to indirectly remind a person, after which everyone started msging in the group, which is the most shallow thing for me. And if it was just that they forgot, I would've been absolutely ok with it. But this happens ever year. I make sure to write down ppl's bday in my notepad and wish them at the stroke of 12, because ik how much it can mean to someone. But I never get anything in return. None of my college 'frnds' knew. I have only 1 school friend left, he hasn't wished even till now even though I even gift him every year. I truly have no friends or anyone who cares for me. 
As I'm getting older, it's getting tougher to make frnds too. I just feel empty, hollow and destroyed. I've wasted 20 years of my life, no meaningful relationships except my parents, who themselves act very toxic at times. 
I make sure to make everyone feel spcl, but I never receive even the bare minimum. 
I'm scared for the future, scared that this is gonna be me for the rest of my life. I just wanna end it.

It hit me real hard and I just isolated at home, smoking pot. Over time, I lost contact with friends since I wouldn't give any news, being so ashamed of my situation I didn't want to see anyone and have to answer questions like ""So what do you do ?""

I'm quitting pot, it's been a few days. (Not the first time I try to quit.) Smoking helps forget issues and allows to just enjoy the moment (movies, games, videos..). Now that I'm not smoking I'm incredibly bored, and loneliness is becoming unbearable. Unlike what you would expect right now, I'm not a pessimistic, negative, exhausting person. Quite the contrary I hope. I just fell in a comfortable hole and stayed there for too long.

I wish to share things I love with other people. Techno/House/Electronic/Piano and music producing, D&amp;D, video games (SC2 atm), science and people like Christopher Hitchens, lucid dreaming, animation and design... If any of this resonates with you then please ...! :)

Anyway, good luck to you, I really hope you too will get better."
lonely,I Miss My Friend,"I Miss My Friend - Ive had depression for about 4 years. Its made
me question the people in my life and has lead to me pushing away important people in my life. However, now instead of me leaving, my friend wont give me the time of day. It makes me really sad to think about because i miss her so much. Everything else in my life is fine. The depression is nearly gone with medication and yet I still feel so strongly for my friend. I know that it wouldnt be peaches and cream if they came back, but I want to work through any struggle to be with them. Any advice on getting someone back? I would thank God profusely if He brought us together."

I found a group of people who would always listen to what I had to say and I thought they understood this. But after I dated one of them, they broke up with me, and I was talking to a mutual friend in the group and it turns out they all just thought they were letting me dump all my problems on them and all I wanted to do was vent. They never bothered to talk with me or communicate with me and now I've just decided to shut them out emotionally.

 I spent a lot of time trying to talk about things with them and figure out how they felt so that I could respect their needs, but it turns out they just refuse to tell anyone what they need and pretend everything is fine until they can't handle it anymore. So many people I meet are like this and I hate it. 

I'm having a hard time typing this out cause I'm on mobile and I'm feeling depressed and can't be bothered to get on my computer, so I guess I'll have to end it early. Doesn't matter anyway."

lonely,Anyone else has experienced unrequited feelings so many times that they are terrified to have a crush? Help,"Anyone else has experienced unrequited feelings so many times that they are terrified to have a crush? Help - Kindly read the whole thing please: I swear if you looked up my name in the dictionary it would have “rejection” as it’s definition no lie. Any real feelings I have ever had have been unreciprocated. I’ve never been in a relationship and I’m nearly 23. No one gives af. The only time I’ve been in “love” (more like intense all consuming infatuation) was back in high school and I was rejected. It was so painful that it has made me afraid of men. Which might sound really, really stupid, but I literally do not have one positive dating experience with men at all in my life. This is NOT by any means a hate on men. At all. But I am scared of them and fear they will hurt me because I have a HUGE history of unrequited feelings in general and being tossed aside. It sucks. 

I avoid men and literally do not have a single male friend. At all. I’m bisexual so it’s actually fine to not date men as I’m also into women (though I haven’t found anyone there either tears). But I’m starting to have a crush on this guy and I could not be more terrified. He’s super nice and awesome and I actually feel a deep connection with him. He is also bisexual and he’s playing my husband in a play lol (ironic af). We're watching Love, Victor together (a gay romance as we're both bi lol) on Sunday and it's our first hang out together. It sounds very datelike I know BUTTTTT I don’t know how to put it, I have no actual proof, but I have a gut feeling that he would never return my feelings. I have a history of liking blond white boys that will never like me back lol it’s classic me and he seems like he’ll be the next one. My feelings are growing though. I’m thinking since we were planning on hanging out that it’s a good opportunity to expose myself to my fear of men and to train myself to overcome it and accept being friendzoned without taking it personally. But honestly….does it always have to be this way?? Do I have to be rejected by HIM TOO like everyone else? What’s wrong with me? I’m tired of being so afraid to even have feelings for someone as if it is the plague and I’m going to get hurt. It makes me feel sick. And I’m tired of hating myself just for having emotions. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. Any advice?"

We broke up after four years but I haven't loved anyone else the way I loved him. That was a decade ago and I still haven't gotten over him I've just pushed him to the back of my mind, out of site. In the last 11 years I've dated maybe four guys and only one of them lasted more than two weeks. The one that did last more than two weeks I was with for four years. Apparently four years is the longest I'm allowed to be happy. The four year rule has also been true for my jobs. At four years for some reason it always goes to shit. The last long relationship I was in ended because the guy got on drugs really bad and didn't care about anything else anymore. Shouldn't have been a surprise my life is shit. I can't find a full-time job I've always worked part time and I can't even keep a part time job. Men don't even glance in my direction. I've tried dated sites for the last 11 years and I have went on four dates and none of them went past that. Now a days I don't even get messages anymore again that shouldn't surprise me I'm not meant to have happiness. Some force out there is determined to have me die alone never knowing the comfort of coming home to the love of my life. I'll never have anyone to love. I'll never have happiness.

I just don't feel like I can talk to anyone. My family isn't an option with these things and my friends don't quite seem to be all that interested. I've talked about it and while it helped for a bit, that only lasted like half a day before it was just back to ignoring it. Before that, even seeing each other every day, it felt like no one really cared to sit down and understand. It was like a quick sorry you feel bad then oh well. Today I guess I hinted at the fact that I don't feel listened to and my friend replied that people have their own things to deal with and can't always listen. That's definitely true. I just feel really bad like no one is around to care, not even the people who say they are. Am I just being selfish? Should I stop feeling this way? What should I do to try and get out of my state?"

lonely,I’m being honest when I say I have no friends.,"I’m being honest when I say I have no friends. - I hate how popular/normalized it is for people to be like “I have no friends.” For awhile I was stupid and couldn’t detect sarcasm/a simple joke, so I legitimately thought a hell of a lot of people have zero friends. I was so wrong. It made me feel better about genuinely having 0 friends, only to find out I was giving myself false confidence because I’m not smart enough to understand that it’s just a common phrase no matter the amount of friends one actually has.

I am not lying when I say I have zero friends. I am a freshman in college, around 3 months in now, and I do not have a single friend. Everyday I eat lunch, do homework, and sit in my room utterly alone. Now I would excuse myself if I went to a campus like NYU where they’re self-isolating, but I go to Purdue. Classes are mainly in-person, restaurants are open, clubs are meeting, and I do not have a single person. I can’t even make excuses for myself because of corona, it is entirely my fault, yet I have no clue what I am doing wrong.

Sometimes in life, I sit around, and I believe I am destined to be lonely forever."

lonely,Can moving to a bigger city solve a chronic loneliness problem?,"Can moving to a bigger city solve a chronic loneliness problem? - Grew up in an awful city for most of my life. Super conservative, most people are very low on openness, and the most interesting/kind/good natured people seem to be leaving the city and even the country. There are few communal activities going on and the culture is to generally to keep to yourself and socialize within your family and immediate circle. There is also a mild form of caste system going on, and a fair amount of classism. I had cultural problems in my city of birth. It’s religious (and I’m not), it tolerated nothing less than conformity. Needless to say, few young, open-minded and educated people truly like it here. The few friends I was able to make left. I’ve had what I can comfortable call a chronic loneliness. It’s too damn much and I sense it’s ruining my life and memories. I don’t want to go on like this. Two decades of my life have been tainted with loneliness. 

Would going to a bigger, more cosmopolitan city make me feel less lonely? I’ve always felt best when I’m somewhere diverse. I’m not diversity obsessed, but difference of origin makes me feel at ease, and accepted. I traveled a bit and lived somewhere multicultural. It made me feel somewhat better. Then I had to come back to my city of birth. And it’s painful. 

I’m considering making plans to move somewhere like London in a year or so. It’s very ambitious but feasible for me. I thought about this deeply and I theorized that being in that kind of environment would open some doors. More hobbies and communities, which would allow for more friendships. I generally adore cities, and find most difficult aspects about them tolerable. But I worry that people in cities are too busy for deep friendship, that the culture favors making “convenient” acquaintances (which is fine, but does not bring me happiness). I also think that in big cities, as people go into their thirties, they want to move somewhere cheaper and more spacious, so I’d end up losing the connexions I value. I worry that my escape plan will not solve my problem and will only present me with another, more expensive form of loneliness.

What do you think? Should I change my perspective? Drop my goals for friendship and just embrace the void?"

I was sort of forced into rebuilding burnt bridges with old friends I had cut ties with so I'm guessing that'll help, but yeah I just wanted to say this somewhere so iys not jumping in my head for eternity, have a great day to anyone who reads this and actually cares :)"
lonely,Walked away but now im alone with no distractions,"Walked away but now im alone with no distractions - Ill try not to go too deep on this but i probably will because i always do. This year has been bad (for everyone really), but this last week has torn me apart. I was supposed to move to Florida with my best friend. I'm male and my best friend was female. Things fell through completely and i put myself under trying to make it happen. This was Wednesday. After she told me that it wasnt going to happen, she ignored me because i was upset and she was too. I felt bad but it also somewhat upset me because she wasnt willing to stick thru it with me and talk to me, when i would always stay and talk to her thru anything that was wrong with her. 

We used to talk and play games every day. In complete honesty, i was in love with her and she told me she was in love with me too and admitted she really believed i was her soulmate. We've known each other for almost 3 years now. She has lied to me before, about wanting to be with me and stuff like that. But i always looked past it, because i just wanted her to be happy. She told me she never wanted me to leave and you know, things like that. But after this all went down on wednesday, she just kind of blew me off. I started to think. I started to think of all the times she put me down, lied to me to benefit her and all the things i did for her that she wouldnt do back for me. Dont get me wrong, she was the BEST FRIEND i have ever had. But i realized that the more i went on holding onto some false hope, the more my mental health just collapsed worse than it already was.

So i walked away. I told her i wished her the best and told her i loved her but i needed to go because i wasnt who i wanted to be. To be honest, i dont know how she felt. idk if it affected her. All i got was a ""Idk what to say"" and a ""I love you"" and that was that. I know im supposed to feel good because i had the balls finally walk away. But i have no distractions. It was a wake up call for how alone i actually felt. When she wasnt there, there was nobody else i could play with or talk to. If i go on discord, i see her name. If i want to play games (cod or fortnite) i see her. All of my favorite games i played with her and every time i open them i just remember everything and feel all the pain come flooding back. 

The point of this is, i was wondering if anybody would want to play and maybe hang out and just help me distract myself. I currently dont work but have applied to jobs to hopefully distance myself from everything but for the time being i just dont want to be alone. I want to be able to play games and distract myself without having constant reminders or hell just have someone to talk to and be friends with."
lonely,What's the point of living like this?,"What's the point of living like this? - Hi, my situation is like this: I recently started college, I'm kinda introvert but not really socially awkward, so I don't think I will have real problems making friends and all of that, but I have some physical traits that make me impossible to think that I will have a partner ever, I will start to work out but just to feel better, work out won't really fix my looks as much as to find a partner. I can handle it, I mean, more or less.

So I don't really fear for my next years, I fear how my life will be in my 30's, when every person close to me start to get married and form a family, and inevitably I will slowly living a more lonely life.

Has anyone here live a situation similar to that? how do you handle it?

lonely,"My first semester of medical school has made me feel incredibly lonely. COVID, a nasty break-up and my classmates are not helping.","My first semester of medical school has made me feel incredibly lonely. COVID, a nasty break-up and my classmates are not helping. - I (22M) just started my first semester of medical school at a DO school in the Midwest. And just like everyone, the transition to medical school from college has been incredibly tough. Academically, the change has been very substantial obviously, but that's actually not the thing that's been making me feel depressed. It's the social aspect, or the lack thereof. Coming from college, an incredibly social environment, to medical school, where it feels like everyone eats, sleeps, and breathes anatomy atlases and biochem textbooks, has been a tremendous change. I always prided myself on being a person who didn't let my studies consume my life during college. I had a steady relationship, took leadership in a cultural club, had hobbies, went out, and did so many just ""fun"" things.

At my med school, all the first years are ""nice"" people, but that's about the extent it goes. No one cares about meeting new people or making any little effort to prioritize people. I try to organize hangouts and events, but everyone flakes on me. They will tell me to my face they want to hang out and then leave me on read. Perhaps, that's me being naive, idk. Everyone always talks about this collaborative environment in med school because all the competition of getting in is done, but I have yet to see that. There are lots of gunners in my class and frankly, people who don't want to talk about anything non-medicine related.

To make matters worse, I just got broken up with before class started. She was someone I thought was going to be my soulmate, but of course she cited med school as being a major factor to why she had to cut it off. No one wants to date a person who has to study all the time.

To make matters worse, COVID has just accentuated all the loneliness that would have been there anyway. Online class does little for me in terms of mood. I try to get out of my apartment to study in different places, but it all feels the same. Just study, study, study. Don't get me wrong, I love what I'm learning, I just don't love it enough where it can be the only thing that makes me a whole person. There are no in-person events because of COVID and our school seems to not care about the whole situation. They've increased tuition yet they are so bad about communication and our online classes have so many technical issues. I do most of my learning from Youtube.

The lone bright spot in all this has been my roommate and one other friend who feel the same way as me. That was a lot of complaining, but I just don't know how to go about this, with no future in sight. How do I stop feeling incredibly lonely?"

I created 2 accounts on bumble, 1 being a normal account about myself saying how im looking for a long term relationship and some stuff about myself, 2 being one where I made myself look like a jackass saying how I love to get high and get drunk at parties and just looking for a good time. The 1st account still has absolutely nothing... aside from when I accidentally said when setting the account up I like guys and girls, I had like 11 dudes swipe right. The 2nd account, just what is wrong with people I had so many single mothers swipe right on me and its like the fuck.

You see, I've had a rough time with girls - both in the sense of relationships and friendships, I just end up feeling like I gave so much effort and received little back - I'm sure a lot of people can relate with that.  


My last relationship was more of a tragedy, where the girl I was with had a horrible life.   


Just when I motivated her to LIVE and she was finally starting to be happy, she got hit with lung cancer and sadly died not long after - most of the relationship was me taking care of her mental health but she still made me happier than others.  


Before my relationship with her, I've had very one sided relationships where I just felt I offered so much more effort and value, one particular ex has thanked me several times for teaching her how to better think and behave etc her parents were a very bad influence and as a result she already had 7 ex's at a young age.  


In my very first relationship I was heartbroken due to this depressed suicidal girl that ghosted me because ""she wasn't good enough"" and at the time I didn't have much confidence so I thought it was my fault and it killed me - but furthermore, the close female friends I had did not emotionally support me with the heartbreak and I was incredibly disappointed with that, months passed and they didn't even ask how I felt (they later realized it and apologized, but it was too late by then).  


Bad experiences with girls aside which btw I have tons more to tell, but getting to the point.  


These experiences are not just related to friendships and relationships but also just ATTEMPTING to make female friends which let me tell you, it's not a fun experience in a world full of competitive males am I right?.  


I am lucky enough to have a childhood friend who even though sometimes he has moments where he prefers other people over me, I am still happy that he chooses me at all to play games among other things.  


Here is the thing, like I said he is a guy - after this last relationship that broke me, I realized that it's much easier to at least fill those lonely spaces with a GUY friend.  


And really, I feel this also extends to girls - but my main message is to the lonely guys out there struggling with girls in any kind of way.  


DO NOT, focus so much on girls - on ALWAYS having the potential of there being romance, that you underestimate the power of friendship with a GUY - or in general.  


I'm telling you, in life you will suffer and suffer - it will seem like it will never end, and THAT'S why you need someone RELIABLE, consistent - that isn't just in it for superficial or emotional reasons.  


I have been a victim of this mentality, of wanting to find long lasting love so badly that I look around and have no one - it's truly a PRISON.  


There is happiness beyond just love, your value as a human is not dependent on a girl and neither should it ONLY be praised by a girl.  


I have found that despite guys being often worse with emotional talks, they are more loyal to other guys because they just want to CHILL - they just want to hang out and have fun, play some games laugh till it hurts.  


And this very well might be the same for girls, so girls if you are so focused on finding this hero in shining armor or whatever you are looking for - STOP for a second, and think first ""do I have someone to fall back on if this goes bad?"".  


Because that's the thing, a best friend will be more likely to stick around no matter what happens - with no ""love has expired, so loyalty has expired"" contract.  


I see this time and time again, and as I said I am a victim of this myself and will likely make mistakes regarding it again - but I feel it's very important, let's recognize the value of the same gender - of friendship.  


We see poems, songs, everything written in honor of love - but we see equally as much pain messages related to love.  


Love is magical when it works, but when it leaves it HURTS - and if you have nothing else in your life, no one else - it's gonna feel even worse.  


So as my final message, recognize the value of friendship - and recognize the value of having someone loyal, regardless of gender.   


Instead of just looking to meet girls, think about this.  


You had a relationship of one year, ended horribly.  


How many guy friends would you have met in that time, that would still be hanging out with you - playing games / making you laugh etc?.  


I rather have at least 3 loyal guy friends, that I can fall back on to take my mind off the pains of this world - than to dedicate all my time to a relationship and just end up lonely in the end.  


So before you go around putting all this effort into finding a girl, which often consists of a lot of heartbreak - make sure you got homies first, make sure the aftermath of a failed love won't leave you miserable.  


Hopefully that helps someone, whether it be guy or girl - I am working on this myself.  


Cheers and good luck to you all if you decide to put this mentality into action.  


And to anyone interested regardless of gender, feel free to message me - I DO NOT GHOST, if it seems like I did I probably got distracted AF."
lonely,Rock bottom,"Rock bottom - The last time I felt like I had a friend that I could connect with was back in seventh grade. I am now 20 years old.  I moved half the country to study, and havnt been able to make any sort of meaningful releationship since despite trying my best. This was half a year ago. Be it at work, uni or whatever. It's hard feeling like this is all  I amount to, that I was meant to be alone. Forget female companionship, I'd give a lot to have any type of friend.

I dont know what to do.

I feel like I cant reach back to my family. I havent shared much of my hardship with them, because I know the impact its gonna have on their already hard life. My dad is in the later stages of Parkinson, and my mother is bipolar. They arent together any more, and are both struggling economically while living separately. My older brother struggled similarly as me, and he left to study, came back, left, only to come back again, failing. I have seen the effects with my own eyes. I don't fault him for it, but giving in dosn't feel like an option for me.

I havent left my house in over 10months to see anyone (I know corona had made it longer but it's still a long time) I started college a few months ago and I've never been more disappointed. I'm in a particularly bad college, there isnt anyone I could see myself being close with, 80% boys (I'm a girl) and the girls all seem to be friends from highschool.
my out of school friends in different colleges make me so jealous. out almost every day with their new friends. I am so fucking lonely, watching vidoes of them together, them telling me about their new friends. making me feel like I dont even exist to them anymore.
I try to make plans with my out of school friends but it never works out, and because of how long I've been inside my anxiety is out of control, I cant go anywhere or do anything without being sick and completely freezing up.  It's gone on for so long, college was the only thing i was looking forward to and it's pointless. Due to Corona we cant mix with other classes or year groups, so it's only my small class, and I'm only in 1 day a week.

But from a young age ive been degraded by my mother ether on how i talk how i dress who i talk too hell i could never bring friends over to play. And when i turned 8 she opens a buisness and my life revolved around just the buisness and working there i do have to say i get my work ethic from doing it but its a unhealthy work ethic that i put the work over my own health that has also landed me many times almost dieing from sickness ( staph infections) even had surgery on my leg that the infection almost was to my bone i could have lost my leg. With having this unhealthy work habit i would eat whatever was available that was fast and easy most was fast food or junk food and i hated it but i didnt have anytime because or the business i would miss out on alot of things of my youth and teenage years  because of my mother and her dumb buisness my typical day would consist of waking up going to school then right after that going to work at the buisness till late at night and rinse and repeat. Now that im an adult ive done the samething ive even became a full hermit and now that im 28 and in 2 years ill be 30 i see my cousins that are all younger then me about to get married and have families and im here with nothing.

lonely,My family doesn’t recognize my academic achievement,"My family doesn’t recognize my academic achievement - This is going to sound arrogant or prideful, but hear me out. I have always been a people pleaser, and I hate creating conflict. This means that I find it very hard to ask for things from other people, even close family members. For example, my Aunt was using my desk that had my computer on it. Instead of asking her to move so I could do homework, I waited for 2 hours for her to move. I am taking 5 AP classes this year, one of which is a special advanced course that less than 0.1% of the kids in my district can participate in. As far as recognition, they’ve responded with “you got a B on your test, why isn’t it an A?” I feel like even if I was the perfect student that got all the extra credit, and 100% on everything, they would still somehow find a place where I was lacking. This makes me feel like my academic achievement means nothing to them. Is this normal? Should I ask them for recognition? Never once before have I tried to get any sort of reward for straight A’s or anything like that. Please help"

lonely,Always second place,"Always second place - Nobody ever wants me first. I have no friends or people who care about me. Just the same things everyone is obliged to say because it’s socially correct. 

I’m tired of being friends with people who are “fake” or who don’t say their true feelings/aren’t blunt or straightforward.

I’m tired of people acting like they care. Going “Wow” or “that’s crazy”. Honestly just say you don’t give a shit it would make my life so much better. Just shut the fuck up and don’t make me feel like strangling you. 

I consider suicide everyday. I hate myself so much I just jerk off and hope it makes me feel better. It just makes me feel a million times worse after the “after climax clarity comes”. 

I have no friends who hold the same opinions or has the same personality as me. Or I should say at least similar. I’m tired of making exceptions for friends or people because I’m desperate. I care too much and try so hard not too. I’m so done with everything I’ve attempted at suicide twice but didn’t do it good enough I just ended up failing because I pussied out. 

I’m just so frustrated and I’m giving up. I just want to not care and do whatever I want and let nothing stop me. Once I get my life together by losing more weight and get my new job I just want to fix everything.

I had a bunch of friends and a lover in this state when I left but now that I'm back nobody is interested in as much as a conversation. Let alone the fact that I now live in the middle of nowhere by a small, ghetto town. It hasn't been all bad, I've got my license, got into better shape, and I learned a lot recently. But for this whole year the only person ive talked to is my landlord, a very kind 76 year old vietnam vet who offers me work. I'll be leaving to Army basic training this month cuz why tf not? And I sure as hell wont be dating anyone while I'm in the service. I'll probably make some good friends in there but I can't shake this feeling that I'll never have someone to be close with again.

lonely,"I'm just alone, confused and sat in the dark","I'm just alone, confused and sat in the dark - I'm 18, I graduated college this year just before the pandemic really took off. 

This post is meant to act more as a question then a story or personal record. Or somewhere inbetween the two. (If that makes sense)  

So I've been lonley my whole life but not alone. I've had friend groups and been invited to parties so I know I haven't had it rough like others have. I also am aware that I'm decent looking (on a good day) and I'm grateful for that. I still was never added to group chats or really involved in conversations. My friendship groups picture at the end of highschool was taken by me, instead of being a part of the picture. And the entitled me back then was furious because I thought I deserved friends, I thought I was a great person and therefore I am entitled to friends. 

Here I am a few years later and I'm alone at 3am. I did come to terms with my loneliness a while ago and even though I have friends I don't have any close connections as I struggle to form them. It really came to show in highschool when my group never messaged me or called me. I was just another person they knew. And in college I was so afraid of this happening again I actually confronted my friend group about this. Told them I was scared of being forgotten over night. They assured me that I was unforgettable, too kind or funny and I believed them that it was okay. But literally a week passed since college ended and I was forgotten. I see then hanging out together on social media the whole group and I'm watching from a phone screen at home. 

The reality im facing now is that I'm not scared to be alone anymore, it's me being scared to become part of a group again. I fear being abandoned, cast aside and forgotten but just as much as that scares me, being alone indefinitely scares the life out of me. I'm scared to go out and get laid because I don't wana form an attachment and any slight chance of it happening is horrifying to me. I am afraid of intimacy and affection because it's not somthing I'm used to. Other peoples touch is somthing I'm not used to. This feeling of limbo being afraid or both isolation and being in a group of people has really been messing with my mind.

I currently have nothing to my name. No job because of the pandemic, no close friends due to my own nature.  All I have rn is myself, and I want to hear from people who are like me? How they handle or cope or any methods they use to try and beat this feeling. Simply knowing others are like this is very soothing."

Finally my family &amp; I went separate ways and they act as if I don’t exist. So I tried to build my own family and make my own love. But I have now found that I am still alone.. unloved.. it doesn’t matter how much love I give to my spouse or what I do I never get that unconditional love that I so desperately need. I feel that hole growing wider and wider. There is pain like a constant nagging pain that is growing as well.. am I crazy. Why can’t I just be strong and be fine with myself not needing anyone. People just hurt you and take take take.. I have seen it time and time again I experience it but I continue to put myself in harms way! I am broken so deeply broken, just need a kind word. A warm hug, a soft whisper of hope. Is there anyone out there ? Can I trust? Why can’t I be loved? What’s wrong with me? I’m sorry I feel hopeless and I’m hurting.

lonely,my friends hate me,"my friends hate me - I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense I just wanna let it all out

So my friends don't like me, and it's obvious.
Generally, they pretend like they like me but today was different.

First when I arrived at school I saw my ""bestfriend"" ( i don't even know if I can call her my bestfriend, two years ago we were really close but now she's becoming more and more distant and always going with my other friend for teamwork ) I went up to her and said hi but she looked at me like I was an alien. I speak french where I'm from so I don't really know what word I should use but she looked at me like she didn't want to be seen with me and as if I had just said something weird. Yeah I told you guys, I'm bad at explaining.

So, we went to our classroom together and I tried to talk to my other ""friends"" but they all just ignored me. They looked at me but didn't answer and continued talking together. They were all in a circle but I was left out, when we left the classroom I was behind them, I mean it's always like that but I felt like they were trying to block me from talking to them.

Later that day, we had gym class. My friends always tell me they don't want to be with me because I suck but that's not the point,  luckily that day, the teacher made the team so I wasn't alone. I was with my friend, let's call her Anna. I thought she was the only one who liked me or didn't hate me in the group but maybe I was wrong because we were talking and we started laughing and I turned around for a second and when I looked back at her she had stopped smiling and it seemed as if she had just roll her eyes or sighed.

I have so much more to say but I don't want to make this 2 years worth of lecture. 

So last thing, I have this friend i've known since primary school. We used to tell eachother everything and she's the only one I really considered as a bestfriend. We were really close but once we went to high school she looked ashamed of me. She became popular (she always was) and more and more distant. She would never mention me and stuff because she didn't want people to know we were friends. Maybe i'm just overthinking it but oh well. She's the only one I told about my depression. When I told her, less than a year ago, she was so supportive I thought she started caring for me again. But no, randomly I would text her things like ""thank you so much for being here for me"" and she'd say aww thank you. She used to send me texts like these two but eventually she stopped. I never stopped but she kept leaving me on delivered for longer and longer. ( we don't go to the same school and we live kinda far away so this is our only form of communication ). Now, she leaves me on delivered for at least 20 hours. I confronted her but it took her 2 days to read the text. ( I text her on snapchat and she has her snapmap open so I can clearly see she's on but doesn't want to respond ). When she answered she said sorry. Just sorry. That's it. Now we haven't talked for 4 weeks so that's just great. The only friend I care about is gone.

Oh god, this is so long. Sorry, I just wanted to let it all out I had been holding it inside of me for so long and I have no one to talk to so hi reddit!

I hope you have a great day and thank you so much for reading it means the world to know that someone finally listens to me."

&amp;#x200B;

So it all started at a dance when I was in the 8th grade, which was September 2017. There I met a girl who I started really liking after a few months of being friends. To say the least, she lead me on for months, really only talking to me when she was upset but if I just wanted to have a conversation about anything she would be really dry. Eventually I asked her out and got rejected. Now at the beginning of 2018, I got extremely depressed as I did everything I could to make it work and the first thing I did was  blame it on my appearance, which is a possibility but really the whole thing just killed my confidence. After months of still being friends and being ignored by her more and more, blaming myself for everything and acting like she did nothing wrong, and being on the brink of suicide and having the cops show up to my house, her friend tells me that I basically make the girl feel like shit by being so nice to her. Which blew my mind and made me feel worse. But regardless, I wanted the best for her, so I said that I wouldn't talk to her again if it would make her happy. There is no happy ending to this section, as eventually (September 2018),  we started talking again as friends and made up until I let her know about the night the cops came to my house. She said I was lying because it didn't make sense. So then I just cut ties with her and realized that, despite the many things I did that were stupid or shitty during that time, she also did many things that were unreasonable that made my mental state worse and I shouldn't beat myself up about it. Also the entire time this happened, I was being picked on by my group of friends and my childhood friend went after the girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

On to the next, which will have to be split in two. In May of 2018, I met a girl online that you could say I fell in love with. She lived across the States from me. She was just like me in many ways at the time. She was cute, pretty, nice, she complimented me which no girl had ever done before as I am overweight, she had the same dark sense of humor and we became very close after just a few weeks. She had a boyfriend, though. I would never try to break up someone just to be with them, even back then when I made the worse decisions. Eventually they break up because, catch this, the mother fucker was using her for things that anyone, especially a 13 year old should be used for. So this just destroyed her. I had only known her for about 3 weeks at this point. Then, in late May of 2018. I stayed up until 3 in the morning with a girl I had only known for a couple weeks trying to make sure she didn't die. And I am not saying she was ""on the brink"" like I was. We were facetiming and she had about 50 fairly deep horizontal cuts across both undersides of her arms, which I saw. She also took about 8 pills of some medicine she either was taking or had found. I guess at this point I have repressed it but none the less, it is the most traumatizing thing I have had to witness. This just made me love her and want to take care of her, but as a dumb 14 year old on the opposite side of the country, all I could do was tell her how to treat the wounds and research if the medicine she took was a lethal dose. Thank god it wasn't, and that didn't kill her. We stopped talking after she got back with the same guy later, believe him when he said that his friend who had told her what he was doing was lying. He made her block me so I didn't talk to her until maybe July, probably early August of 2018. I never forgot her although I had gone in and out of a different relationship with a girl I really wasn't happy with in the mean time. So after, I soon got together with this girl from across the country. It was most likely because she was so traumatized to realize the truth. After a few weeks, we broke up and she told me that she needed to get over her ex, so if I waited a few months then maybe we could work it out. I know now that if she truly did get better over that time, then it is most unlikely that she would have ever gotten to me, once she understood the only reason she dated me was so she didn't feel so alone. Still, this was probably the biggest mistake I have ever made. I am going to cut  in really quick and say. I treated her horribly. I didn't know it at the time but all I can say is that I am no better than her piece of shit ex. Ok maybe not as bad but I still did some scumbag shit. Anyways, I was still very depressed so I left looking for anyone that would date me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, now for the last girl I dated. We had been friends for year but got really close around June of 2018. We stayed friends for the rest of that year, until October, about 3 weeks after the last girl and I broke up. My depression was getting worse by the day. I went on a date with this girl and her friends. They ruined it and I was barely able to talk to her. This spat and stepped on what was left of my confidence. That weekend I did a civil war reenactment, which was one of my favorite hobbies before covid. On the way home I cried because the friends that I only saw at those reenactments were the only people that made me happy. I had nothing other than that which gave me purpose.  About a week later, the girl I went on the date with asked me out and we have been together ever since. At least that is what I would have said if things went well. This girl has had the hardest life of anyone I have ever met and had bad depression and anxiety. We were together for almost 2 years, just up until last week when I broke it off because I just wasn't happy anymore. She made me block every girl because it gave her anxiety, including the girl from across the states. For a year and a half our relationship, despite the deep and true feelings I have for her and she for me, I was very upset and unstable and depressed. It really sucks and I wish I was just happy with her because she really was amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now, late late September 2020, after all that I am alone, and it gives me the chance to find someone new who will fit me better. But something was eating me up inside. I realized that the girl who I had fallen in love with first 2 years ago, I treated like shit, and I had to make it right somehow, especially with the possibility that she had commit suicide. (One last note, this girl was also being bullied and harassed daily and was jumped by a gang of girls and sent to the hospital multiple times, and also wound up in the hospital from attempting suicide on at least one occasion when I was talking to her.)

&amp;#x200B;

Here we go. The last 7 days of my life and what has brought me to this Subreddit. I had to get back in touch with the girl from across the country. Now, I will just refer to her as A so it is a little less confusing. I had lost all contact after blocking A as a result of my last ex. I did remember lots of things about her, including the town that she lived in, her full name, and most importantly, the names of her friends. After days of trying to find her social media, and coming up empty handed or finding ones that A doesn't use anymore; I was about to give up. I couldn't eat, sleep, or relax for 5 days straight. But then, a few nights ago, I was talking to my friends and they suggested that I look for a school yearbook online by going to her schools website. This lead me to success but making me realize that I could use the location to my advantage. I found an instagram run by students that went to her school and I looked through the followers. I had found her friends!!! I remembered their names and because of this, I was able to finally get back in contact with her. This made me so happy, but I had another obstacle ahead. What if she doesn't want to talk to me, she ignores me, or she thinks I am a creep for tracking her down. Lucky for me, she was super nice and we had a great conversation. I was able to apologize for all the stupid things I did. I finally felt like I was getting the closure I needed but then A said somethings that changed it all for me. She didn't remember hardly anything from those months that we knew each other. All she remembered was that I existed and some of the things we had done. I reminded her of as much as I felt would be comfortable for the conversation, including the night where I stayed up with her, which she just vaguely remembered. Of course, she assumed that I wanted to come back to her to try to date again. Honestly, now that , I have a drivers license and my own car, if I got the chance I absolutely would, but I knew going in that not only is she probably dating someone at the moment, but she also would probably never date me again. To this day I still have terrible confidence, and even though I don't think I am ugly, I do believe my weight and appearance have a big role in why she would probably never date me again, especially when she doesn't even remember those things I did (I still apologized to her for them anyways). She does in fact have a boyfriend judging by the date with hearts on her instagram. This doesn't really upset me since it is what I expected. But. The way that she talks to me is extremely weird. She asked what I looked like, to which I made some self-deprecating joke because of my low confidence. She replied that she looks the same. Just to be nice, and because I still believe it, I complimented her on how she looked and she really appreciated that. We went on talking about other things but the conversation never came to a natural end. She just started taking longer and longer to respond. Being on instagram and posting but never looking at my message. She didn't ""mute"" me, which makes it so that it doesn't give you pop up notifications for a conversation. Then eventually she just left me on read. That was last night and I slept horribly. So today I woke up to see a message from A, where she apologized and said that she had fallen asleep. This makes me feel better and I reply. She has never replied or even looked at my message, despite me also asking her something, so there would be a reason for her to respond. So this whole day. She had been posting and ignoring my message and now even though there are some very obvious answers why. Maybe she just doesn't want anything to do with me. Maybe she doesn't want to be friends. Maybe she hates me for what I have done in the past. Or more realistically, maybe I am just not that important to her or she isn't that invested in our me/our conversation so she is being really dry. None of these answers make me feel good and just worsen my mental state. My friends are busy so I can't talk to them. That is why I came here. This has made me feel extremely lonely and awful and I just can't see how my future could get better from this feeling. This has all made me realize that I missed out on being with the most amazing girl I have ever met and I fucked it all up because I was stupid. I don't know what to do with my life at this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for this being so long, and if you didn't read the whole thing I don't blame you. I can't really put together a TL;DR for this as it would still be extremely long. If you did read it, please. If you have any thoughts on what I could do to either feel better, or try to make a friendship with this girl work, or anything that could help me not feel so lonely. I just hate myself, who I was. Even if no one reads this, it at least felt good to get this all out. Be safe guys and if you are feeling like me then I hope you get better..."

years now and Im supeeeer lonely. I wish I could talk to anyone, have friends or just someone who would just care about me. All my previous friendships were tragic because of my lack of Social skills and dumb decisions

The thing is, I don't want to meet anyone new. Im going to a new enviroment/community and there are a lot of New people there. But i don't want to talk to them. I don't want to have any contact with them. I don't want to meet them or even talk to them.

My loneliness is killing me. Im depressed. But I also really enjoy being alone????

lonely,"I get attached to things that are not people, because I'm so lonely, how do I stop?","I get attached to things that are not people, because I'm so lonely, how do I stop? - Reasons for loneliness are 90% about me being scared of people, as in ""they'll hurt me for sure"". My problem is that I get little pangs of happiness (or whatever it is) by feeling attachment to everyday objects, I buy things for an emotion of ""chose me! no, not that identical bottle of shampoo, please, me"" (I even feel guilty for the other shampoo bottle and get stuck for minutes on end and buy two) and I deal with items as as if they are like ""no, don't throw me away"" etcetera. I'm even happy with the bot answers on reddit, you know: someone who interacts with me and will not hurt me for sure. I know it's weird, and I am tired of it. 

However the world is big and unpredictable and I am a bit overwhelmed by this business of having to expose myself to a number of people in an embarrassing way before I find someone who likes me. Not liking light chats doesn't help, I'm an introvert. I also have a few precious interests that are quite important, I don't want to share that with strangers, and I don't care about a lot of common generic topics... this gives me a reputation of snobbery that I find hurtful, I don't know why people think I feel my interests are ""better"", they are just precious and private and I don't care about other things to the point of wanting to chat, smile and fake it as if it's worth the effort. Not to mention that being needy has landed me in trouble... yes, too quick to befriend the wrong people. Any advice?"

lonely,Just a little overwhelmed with nobody to vent to,"Just a little overwhelmed with nobody to vent to - Everyone has these expectations that I can't seem to meet. I have family that says they're there for me when I need them, yet when I need them they're not. They make plans, they break plans, when I put aside everything just to spend time with them. Even if it meant just going out to lunch.

Even in my relationship, I was alone. It was absolute hell living through it every day, but I loved him, didn't I? He didn't love me. I keep telling myself that nothing was my fault, I wasn't the one that was in the wrong, but I still get sad. Someone I really cared about ended up hurting me in ways I never thought possible and it crushed my soul.

I make friends that I can't seem to keep because I'm just not ""normal"". I'm broken. No matter how I try to look at it, I'm not ever going to be anyone's definition of ""normal"". People ask me about myself, my past, the present and they either judge me or shun me. We talk for a bit and then they disappear. We play a game for a bit, then never again. 

""Oh you work *there,* sorry to hear"" but I have a job that I somewhat enjoy. A job that allows me to live on my own. A job that offers medical insurance that allows me to get the medication I need in order to function so that I can work. People are so quick to judge and then they bail. 

""You can talk to me about anything"" but when I talk, they don't respond. My mental state isn't the best, but I still try to socialize with people no matter how painful it is. 

I miss talking, I miss laughing, I miss everything. With pets, I'm never truly alone, I just really miss people sometimes."

Right, this is my first time posting on any form of social media so it's probably gonna sound way too personal but whatever, needed to rant and get things off my chest. I have absolutely no friends. I have no job. I don't know how to talk to people and lose any chance of getting a job because of it. My awkwardness around people is throught the fucking roof. I share too much. I don't understand or use social media so I automatically lose contact with anyone who's ever shows interest in me. I've been alone for so long I've forgotten how to interact with others and not come off as desperate. I've lost hope in myself. I frequently think of not waking up. It's slowly killing me seeing others seemlessly mingle and get to know each other. Whenever someone asks about my social life I lie as if it's all hunky dory. I don't know if this is normal but I'm dying. I remember as a kid giving myself to the age of 21 before I end myself out of sheer neglect. I am past that age and am now trying to get better but it's so damn hard with no one around. Every time my efforts to socialise are passed under the rug, I feel like it'd be nice to just fall asleep and never wake up. I am so so tired. It's gotten to the point where it is effort to breathe. I don't know what to do, so I thought if I could at least type it out it won't be so bad in the end. Anyway just sharing.

TLDR: im a complete loner and ive lost all fucking hope in living like this"

Last week he threatened my brothers and me to send us to   another state so we would never see eachother again, even though he does not have the money to do it, I still hate him alot, he smashed the door really hard because we couldn't hear and they were calling us for food and then he shouted at us. I just hate him alot, I will never forgive him for beating me as a kid. And my mom, keeps calling us lazy, that we don't do anything ""productive"", and if we do something, then she simply says we can't do it right. I seriously hate my mom and dad, I wish I could just go away forever from them and never come back.


On the other side, I was never a social person, I never had many friends that would last me a decent amount of time, they would just change me for other person, I had people that would consider me their ""Best friend"" but I just never knew about one again after we graduated,  another had to go live to another state, then this one simply stopped talking to me and changed me, then when I entered highschool, I obviously didn't know anyone there, but I easily made some new friends, but this one was the first one I made in that school, he started talking to me and that, we talked alot and hanged out alot of times, I would invite him to my house alot too, and we would play videogames or do other fun stuff, but after awhile I started talking to another person which I still am friends with and talks to me occasionally, the 3 of us were best friends basically, we we would hang out and talk alot the 3 of us aswell. After awhile, the guy who I first talked to (let's just call him Angel for now) Angel, started talking more to the other one, I felt kinda jealous but It wasn't much so I thought I could get over it, but it was just more and more, he still talked to me alot though, just not alot more, I felt lonely, and they would do stuff I never did with him, without atleast probably remembering I exist or inviting me. I just didn't like it alot, when (lets call the guy I was kinda jealous of Sawyer), when Sawyer didn't assist school, Angel would just talk to me more instead, it felt good that he was talking to me more again, but it still didn't feel right, Angel even told me he liked talking to me more than Sawyer, but I just knew that it wasn't true, the last day of school before quarantine started, Sawyer did not assist school, but Angel and I did, he was obviously talking to me more, but I tried to ignore him, I simply didn't want to talk to him. He didn't say anything at all, but near when school was over he started noticing and was acting somewhat serious, he talked to me just about something else which had happened in the past that was funny, I felt like I was forced to laugh, but well, school was finally over and I walked home with another one of my friends, when I got home, I messages Sawyer telling him almost everything about this but he said he did not know what to say. A few hours after, Angel messaged me if we wanted to play Minecraft, I agreed but I said I had to go after awhile and he said it was okay. After that I was thinking of blocking him or not, I wanted to keep talking to someone, but I did not want someone who treated me like this and lied to me. I did block him after thinking it, feeling guilty, but I can never have friends that will last to me for a good while, so what was the point of still talking to him? Every person I know that has called me best friend has always left me behind. It's maybe just me not knowing how to appreciate friendship and doing something wrong. Or I am too jealous..

lonely,I can't feel proud of anything because of how lonely I am.,"I can't feel proud of anything because of how lonely I am. - I was valedictorian for my school, and the only thing I remember thinking was how little people actually cared about me at graduation. I did close to nothing social in high school. I only went to one party, smoked weed once, and never even touched a girl. How I am supposed to be proud of the work I did in high school when none of it amounted to something I actually wanted? Being valedictorian had no positive impact on my life and meant nothing to me. If anything, it ruined my life by preventing me from socializing and having a normal childhood.

I then went on to go to a top 10 university, and nothing in my life changed. Despite having a 3.97 gpa, college was easily the worst time of my life. No one at my university gives a shit about intelligence, and I was of course deemed a nerd and loser, just like in high school, for taking my academics so seriously. Despite being in a fraternity, I still have never touched a woman and had very few friends. And much like high school, I can't even be proud of my achievements. I am getting interviews from medical schools, which has been my lifelong dream, and I can't even get excited because I hate being so alone and hate being such a virgin. I feel as though the world has left me behind and that I will never catch up to live my life to the fullest.

I went from a good student to a drug addict, a steroid user, and not being able to change or brush my teeth for months because I was so depressed. I went from being a good person with hope for the future to someone who hates himself and feels robbed of having normal life experiences. I've even planned my own suicide because I genuinely just can't live this way anymore. Nothing I do in life will ever bring back the time I lost or the mistakes I made. I'm nothing but a loser and an imposter, and everything is finally starting to catch up to me.

Everyone else was right. Being a virgin is my fault and I have no one else to blame for being this way. I also never asked to live this life. I never asked to be the smart kid, I never asked to be valedictorian, I never asked to be one of the smartest students in my college. All I wanted was a normal life, and if it really is the case that I am the person who robbed myself of that chance, then I have no problems with killing myself and ending the life that I fucked up.

That is not a mental illness, it's called being a human being. No human deserves to live like this, and I am entitled to these emotions. I am tired of people saying that I am depressed and need help. No, what I needed was the security and knowledge growing up that someone out there at least loved me enough to be physically intimate with me. Without that knowledge or experience, I cannot be happy. I have never been happy due to my loneliness and virginity, not some made-up mental illness. And as a psychology major, calling this a mental illness is just disrespectful to those who actually have them. All of this is my fault, and people have made it apparent to me that I deserve to kill myself. Maybe if I actually do it, I'll be able to make others happy in a way my intelligence never could."

lonely,Why was I such a freak growing up :(,"Why was I such a freak growing up :( - i was looking back on how i was throughout middle school, high school, and the beginning of college and i realized that i was definitely not someone i would want to be friends with. i was such a weird, antisocial freak and i think a part of me still is and because of that i dont think i got to develop like a normal teenager and now its like a part of me is broken and i wont ever have the chance to go back and fix it and make those memories and friends like a normal person"
lonely,Today was my worst birthday.,Today was my worst birthday. - I feel more alone than ever.
lonely,I have an imaginary girlfriend,"I have an imaginary girlfriend - Yes, it's as weird as it sounds. She has a name, a personality, and a face. I've always been prone to daydreaming, and sometime last month I realized how much daydreaming about love puts my loneliness at ease. It eventually resulted in an imaginary girlfriend who I imagine everywhere with me. I hold conversations with her both in my head and aloud. I have an intuition that this behavior is harmful because of how real it feels despite being imagined, surely a recipe for disaster. It genuinely feels like someone is keeping me company, and the behavior is only escalating. Last night my daydreams (nightdreams?) kept me awake for four hours.

Is this actually as unhealthy as it seems? I want to stop for my own sake, but at the same time I feel like I'll miss the personality I've created."
lonely,everyone hates me,everyone hates me - i need someone to talk to i feel so alone and i need friends
lonely,I lost everything.,"I lost everything. - In the span of a day I lost my entire friend group and someone who I thought was the love of my life. I lost it all on Sunday and I’m doing my best to pick up all the pieces. 

My ex boyfriend, let’s call him Joel. I loved Joel and the way things ended were incredibly confusing and gave me the impression that he was going to better himself before coming back to me. I saw pictures of him on a girls Instagram account and he owed me a lot of money so I thought to myself “well, if he’s in a new relationship I might as well try to get my money back”. So I reached out and he said he would write me a check and that was that. A couple days later I saw him put it in the mailbox and drive off and I wrote him a goodbye letter about how saddened I was about how everything went down and how I still cared but was still hurt. I wished him good luck and blocked his number. Within 30 min he reached out to me on social media saying he was still in love with me and thought about me every day. I was excited to hear from him so I unblocked his number and we talked a lot. We talked about our lives and how badly we wanted to share things about our summers (I started a business and he became a race car driver) we both didn’t know what to do and we both wanted to fix this. I was excited to fix everything but the next day, I heard nothing from him. 

Meanwhile on top of that I have this friend, we’ll call him Mack. Mack has had feelings for me for about a year but I never reciprocated those feelings back and even told him he shouldn’t like me cause I’m a mess. Mack bought me food a lot, like every day when he would pick me up from school. It got to a point where I felt guilty and would ask if this was okay, he always said yes. Sometimes I’m not the nicest to Mack but I always apologized for my actions within an hour. While Joel was ghosting me I was freaking out to Mack about it and he was giving me rude responses so I asked what his problem was and he responded with nothing to which I said bye because I was stressed and didn’t understand why he was acting like that.

The next morning I had noticed that Mack had blocked me on everything. My first thought was that he was being dramatic and making my problem about himself which is exactly what I told our friends. They all told me that I was a shitty, manipulative friend and by that point I was completely lost. I asked them all what they were talking about and they said that I walk all over Mack to which I asked if this was about the food because I always made sure if that was okay. They told me that I constantly made everyone uncomfortable with my jokes and draining Mack mentally. I told them all I had no idea of any of this and that the jokes were all lighthearted and that they all made jokes too. They then told me that they tried to talk to me about it but I yelled at them? I’m sorry but I have no memory of that maybe I did do that but I feel like I would remember my friends telling me I’m hurting my other friend. They all blocked me shortly after. 

Meanwhile while Joel is ghosting me, I text the girl I found the pictures of him on her social media. We’ll call her Harley. I texted Harley in case she is Joel’s girlfriend and to let her know everything he said to me. She responds, telling me that this isn’t the first time this has happened with Joel and that they have been dating on and off for 4 years. Apparently the night Joel and I had plans for our first date he also had plans with Harley and then ghosted her. When Joel began to ghost me, he went back to Harley. Harley’s friend who we’ll call Scarlett then reached out to me and told me how Joel and his friends have been emotionally abusing girls they all went to high school with for 7+ years and that they’ve too insecure to be alone and constantly lie. I felt sick to my stomach and confronted Joel who then threatened to kill himself and proceeded to block me on everything. Harley and I kept talking about how identical our relationships were and how he told both of us we were married in a past life and took us to all the same places and it was really sad. The next morning I discovered Harley had blocked me on everything and I assumed she forgave Joel and went back to him. Scarlett told me she was going to block me too and that Harley is trying to forget that all of this happened. By this point I was all by myself. 

A part of me is trying to understand where everyone is coming from, another part of me thinks I didn’t deserve any of this. I don’t know, maybe I am a terrible person, maybe I’m destined to be alone, maybe I’m self destructive and selfish. I thought my intentions were good, I didn’t mean to hurt anyone. If you’ve read this far, wow you must have a lot of time on your hands. Am I crazy? Is there something wrong with me? I don’t know what to do."
lonely,Read this and tell me if you relate?,"Read this and tell me if you relate? - I suffer from social anxiety, I dunno why, its just a thing I have to deal with in life, when I was younger, (Im 17 btw), it wasn’t a real big deal, but recently it took a turn. I found myself bunching up my blanket last night almost subconsciously so I could hold something, so it could feel like something was there, so I didn’t feel alone. 🥺 This paced through my head all night, and I didn’t fall asleep until 4 in the morning. I just couldn’t believe that a physical human connection was that important to me, even if I kept telling myself it wasn’t. So back to my question, if you relate to this or ever have, how do you deal with it, how do you get through the day without constantly thinking about the fact that the thing you long for the most probably isn’t coming anytime soon. 😣"

lonely,"""Everyone deserves love""","""Everyone deserves love"" - That's what they say, right? yet they don't give me the same attention they do to pretty people and people they love. Tried making online friends but they always take minutes to reply to each message while I give them my full attention. We discuss times we can both chat in case they're busy but they still act the same. Tell me, if I was their boyfriend/girlfriend/crush would they ignore me the same way? No, because I'm worthless to them. I'm a piece of trash. I don't matter to any of them. If I deserve love then I would have gotten it but no, they only say that to make others feel better. None of them believe it. 

""We're all equal"" LIES! No one believes that, they just say it. If you're weak, ugly and stupid like me, you don't matter as much as the strong, handsome, smart people. That's a fact."

So I’ve been stupidly watching romance movies. Watch all these couples (Christian &amp; Anastasia, Edward &amp; Bella +Jacob, Kay &amp; Patrick etc.) and all I can think is, why am I still alone? Why can’t I find someone who loves me, who wants to be with me? I always watch these types of movies at the worst times, and it always makes me feel worse."

lonely,My heart is getting colder,"My heart is getting colder - I’m losing touch with what being accepted and appreciated means; it’s been so long without friends or people that just agree with me on something that when it eventually happens I’m so shocked I can’t even believe it. I’m starting to believe in the core of my soul that I’m unlovable and I’m not worth anything, and I believe it so much that even the world itself is pointless to me right now. Hope and motivation are gone, there is just anxiety. I don’t want to do things, I don’t want to talk, I don’t want to workout, I don’t want to study. What even is the point?

It just makes me feel isolated because I know if I didn’t initiate conversation with anyone I would just be left on my own. Im just feel so god damn lonely and I know it’s no one else’s fault but my own."

lonely,This feels like a chronic illness,"This feels like a chronic illness - I was very social naturally ever since I was born. I love people and they often loved me back.
I chose to leave everyone far away, I told myself I would be fine, I told myself I would meet new people and I'd be flexible and adaptable enough to be even happier here eventually.
Instead, I had a mental breakdown, my relationships got neglected as I kept my distance from everyone, not wanting them to see what I'd turned into when faced with just not having them..
I fucked up.
It's been 3 years and all that's happened is a pandemic. I cry almost every day now because I miss having people in my life--I go SO LONG without having a 1 on 1 conversation now, I never could have imagined getting stuck this way. I feel like my life is swirling down a drain in slow motion and hope has been a distant memory. I just want it to end so, so badly but I don't see how it ever will. I know this is vague but I'm weak again and just needed to vent.."

lonely,What does it take to be able to share my life with someone?,What does it take to be able to share my life with someone? - I’m just tired of being alone. All I’ve ever really wanted is a solid relationship. Someone to share experiences with. Someone to live for. There’s been many times where I’ve found it difficult to push on for myself. I simply don’t care too much about myself but I care about others. Just to have something to push and motivate me. I’ve never been able to share my deepest thoughts and feelings with anyone. I hate being lonely but it’s my destiny. Sometimes I’ll have a good stretch coming to terms that I’ll be forever alone but others times I’ll be stuck thinking and wishing I had someone.
lonely,When you start re-reading your own work email conversations to feel in touch with people.,When you start re-reading your own work email conversations to feel in touch with people. - I just realized the reason why I go back and re-read work emails is because it makes me feel like I have some sort of connection with someone.

lonely,IDK,"IDK - Does anybody feel like you're alive just to get used. And by used I mean, you need to go through your everyday life (work, chores, etc.) just because other people need you?

I feel like that. At first, I'm okay with it. Providing for your love ones makes me happy. I've been doing it for a long time and I feel satisfied. Until these last few months, I kept thinking of what I want to do and always come up with nothing. I want to live my life but what's gonna happen to them?

lonely,Being loved and feeling loved are not the same.,"Being loved and feeling loved are not the same. - A lot of people seem to encourage people by telling they are loved by someone and while I believe their intention is good, I don't think the problems are being understood.

While some people may not have anyone who loves them, most people do. There are many people who say they moved away or have family and just feel lonely anyway.

It's because they don't feel the love, even if it's there. I think your love language would have a notable impact as well.

It doesn't matter if you are loved so much as you feel loved."
lonely,Separation anxiety is terrible,"Separation anxiety is terrible - I know quite a few people on this subreddit are unfortunate enough to not be able to find partners, and I feel for those of you who are in that situation, I really do. Please don’t let this post make you feel bad about it.

I have not seen my girlfriend since quarantine started and we got out of school over 6 months ago. We had our 1 year anniversary at the end of August. She’s very busy, so generally when we texted, it might take a couple days for her to respond, but she tended to always answer. When we started school again, she had to do virtual learning, so we still didn’t get to see one another.

Well, her grades weren’t doing well, so her parents decided to take her phone. No texting. Not even a little. After a week, knowing her parents read her messages, I asked when she might get her phone back. Her dad left me on read. After another few days, I was frustrated because I was really anxious and needed to know how she was. I called her dad impolite for leaving me on read. Critical error in judgement, to be fair, this is not a rational man we’re dealing with, but also, all he had to do was say “when her grades improve” or literally anything else, I needed to know she was doing okay. Still, admittedly a bad decision. He left me on read again. 

I realized I could email her. I did. Her parents had been yelling at her nonstop even though she’d started doing her work, and when the week started, her dad sat her at a table, told her to do all of the work available for the week, hit her if she spoke at all, and would not let her up to do ANYTHING. Get water, use the bathroom, nothing.

During that email conversation, she was still at the table, and she just stopped responding after a couple emails. I assume her dad realized she was emailing, probably read the conversation, and gave her some repercussions for speaking to someone when she was grounded, which I blamed myself for since I contacted her.

My mental state went down the shitter, because that is legitimate physical and mental abuse, and I could do nothing about it, so I messaged her dad again a day later after what I believe was a 24 hour long panic attack. I apologized for being moody, explained that I was just worried and cared a lot about her, and begged for any word on how she was doing.

He told me some bullshit about how “her studies had been unduly interrupted by distractions of late” and that if I cared about her future, I would care how she was doing in school. I do, but total social isolation and threats are not gonna make her perform better. Anyways, he told me that calling him impolite was in “poor taste,” and that I could write her, because it would give me time to choose my words carefully, giving me their address.

Physical letters, baby, that’s what it came to.

So, I wrote a lovely letter, some song suggestions, enclosed with it a colored pic of me and my new puppy, and a nice sketch of me about to give her a hug, since my art skills aren’t half bad. I put as much love and as many things to latch onto as I could in it, since mail is slow, and I knew it might be a while until I got to send her something again, even though she lives about 14 minutes away.
I sent the letter 2 days after he said I could write her, and that was a week and a half ago.

I still have not gotten a response. The mail system is already stupidly slow, which has worsened because of the pandemic, but I also have to remember that her dad is an ass and he might have interfered because he hates me. He could have given me the wrong address, burned the letter, refused to mail her response, whatever. I know I’m definitely just paranoid, but I can’t help it.

I haven’t been able to sleep. I’m touch starved and miserable. I used to have severe depression and some signs of anxiety, then fixed myself and got better, having the best year of my life before the pandemic. This situation has made me backslide so insanely hard I cannot describe it. I cannot function lately. It’s 3 AM, and I’ve been tossing and turning and shaking for 3 hours because I just want to see or hear from her and I can’t. 

Everything is gonna be fine when the pandemic is over, and I have the rest of my life to live with her assuming we stay together, but that’s so far away. When you feel this way, time itself stretches. The last month has felt longer than the year before it did. I don’t know what to do, and I just really needed to get all this out. Sorry it was so long."
lonely,My lonely is different,"My lonely is different - I’ve been alone in ways that others haven’t. I (late 20’s F) spent the first 13 years of my life as an only child, raised by a single mom who also isolated me, in home and social life.
I watched friends go to parties I never got to (birthdays I got invited to, had to decline)
I was sooo happy every chance I got to be around other children and absolutely destroyed when I was forced to stay inside for something I did that didn’t make sense (parent was controlling even at a young age) this caused me to not be able to talk to people like everyone else can.
I actually love being alone. I can stand being lonely. 
I grew up as a very lonely child. I talked to inanimate objects, sometimes I still do. I prefer my company over others mostly. But I am human. I still get lonely, too. 
My lonely is different because I’m USED to it. My lonely isn’t wah I wish I had friends. My lonely is “does anyone understand?”
“Can anyone hear me?” My lonely is the loudness that is my personality and person being converted into quiet, little rocks. Enough to fit into whatever space society demands of me.
But, I am lonely now. My lonely is chronic as it started in the isolated childhood. I do, and can admit I isolate as an adult. It’s not intentional and I crave intimacy, but my most intimate relationships are spacey because I’ve been spacey. All I want is to be seen, heard, felt, understood. I feel lonely with others and by myself. I feel lonely so often it’s normal for me. My lonely isn’t like others when they’re missing someone far away. My lonely is like a personality trait. 
My lonely is so loud, she’s quiet."

lonely,Hey everyone,Hey everyone - I would like to talk to some people online for a while. I'm taking a break from using the phone and so I'd enjoy some down to earth casual talk like talking about our days and maybe sharing interests or ideas.

I really love to stay organized well idk if I love it but I have major ocd I think which causes me to create or edit lists everyday on my cell which is one of the reasons I'm trying to just give it a rest. Also people don't even talk to me unless they need to cause they feel upset or bored or they feel obligated but I don't like that.

There is no one here not a soul around so I grasp at straws and reach out on reddit but nobody hears my plea for help. The ones who respond usually leave in a few days and I don’t blame them because I am just another lost soul and I don’t belong here. People have their own problems and don’t want some fuckin loser discussing his feelings and listen to him talk about the fact he spends every waking moment wishing he was dead and even though he doesn’t believe in god he prays every night for some higher being to let this end. Not many people understand what its like to live trapped in your own mind with your demons screaming on repeat. 

His mind is a trap yet he continues to fall for it and slowly starts to fade as his life falls apart. The replies of the distant few leave him scattered and confused not knowing what to believe or whats real and wishing he could go back and rewind to a time where he could remember how to feel. When asked he says everything is fine yet hopes for just one person to read between the lines. He’s broken beat and down screams for help yet the rest of the world wont make a sound so when he falls asleep he longs for the sweet release he yearns for the peace he prays to end up where the dead dwell but awakens again to this living hell."
lonely,dreams; or nightmares?,"dreams; or nightmares? - It's been a fucking year and it feels like shit I'm still thinking about him. I had a summer fling with someone who was my ex's best friend; and also dated two of my best friends. 

It was like that forbidden kind of love that made me more infatuated with him. Now it ended kinda abrupt because of uni. We could have been on the stage where we could have been admitting that we like each other. I'm so fucking heartbroken and to even hear the news that he was dating the girl we were hoping he wasn't with. (girl is crazy. dont get me started)

He got me so fucked up that I kind of tried to get him back to me. I kind of chased him but I couldn't do shit cause I was miles away.

I set my boundaries and gave him additional chances though eventually it crumbled because he couldn’t respect my time. I started back on dating apps after giving it time and of course 2 weeks in he messaged me asking to see and talk to me again bringing up all these feelings I had buried. Mind you I have been single for 3 years prior and my last relationship was my baby daddy so this dude wasn’t easy to drop. 

I sent him a long response about lack of respect and effort. A few days passed and I decided it was best for me to unmatch so I don’t get drunk/sad/lonely enough to message him again asking him back. It’s lonely enough to cut off communication with someone once, let alone twice going through the same heartache again, but it’s lonelier to realize anyone in between can’t make you feel the way they did and you set fire to the bridge that would bring you back to them."

I don’t understand the world. I don’t know why people have to be this way. I’ve been told so often that good things happen to good people and that I’m a good person. So why do I feel this way? I feel so alone and left out. I feel so disconnected from everyone and spaced out, floating above the clouds, like a balloon. I have dreams, I have aspirations for my life and I want to live it. Last night I wished my life just ended. Then I realised I didn’t want to die, I just wanted to NOT feel this way. I want to belong somewhere, I want a couple friends to support me and love me. I’ve been used and thrown away by every single person in my life. I am grateful for what I have in my life: my family, the roof over my head and the education. But I feel so empty. I just long for deep emotional connection with someone and it somehow never happens. I don’t understand. Even if I know nothing is wrong with me, the way it all is makes me wonder if something is wrong with me. I’m convinced I have a problem. I just want to be happy, loved and protected. I want to achieve my goals, and make myself and my family proud. I want to be strong. I don’t want to give up, but I’m slowly going down that rabbit hole. I got on Reddit just to make this post. This is the lowest point of my 20 year old life."

lonely,How do I make friends at a new job?,"How do I make friends at a new job? - I recently started a new job about 3 weeks ago. I’ve always been a pretty quiet/shy person, but at every job I’ve had, I’ve always made at least a few close friends and have stayed friends with them even after leaving that job. So far at this new job, I’m struggling to make friends. I feel like no one here likes me. I’ve been trying to put myself out there more and say hi to everyone who walks by me or introduce myself to those I have not met yet and most of the time the people walk right by me without even looking at me when I try to say hi to them. Or I’ll try to start a conversation and they give me short answers and don’t seem interested in talking to me. It’s just very frustrating. Since I am new, I have been asking a lot of questions since it is a lot to learn, and I always feel like I am annoying everyone or I’m bothering them when I ask my question. I’ve also made some mistakes here and there which I feel is a part of learning a new job, but they make me feel horrible when they get upset with me for making a mistake. This job does have me being by myself for the most part, and I’m really feeling lonely and missing my old friends. I’m really feeling like an outsider here probably because I’m new but it still really hurts. How am I able to make some friends here that actually care to talk to me?"

I haven’t had a rapport with anyone like that since my crush in highscool. I had almost forgotten what it was like.

Thank you kind stranger for reminding me that I can still flirt."

With all the issue of the pandemic it’s difficult to go out and try to make friends again... but the problem here basically is my mind..all this ugly thoughts only makes me feel worse..I'm trying to distract myself u know? But i just can’t! in spite of everything, the love I feel for this person doesn’t go away, and I feel that life is unfair. Why does someone who just wanted something real has to suffer in this way? I'm tired, I know a relationship is not EVERYTHING, but it was an important part of my life... and I know that I don't want to go back to that place anymore... I can't distract myself with the things I like and everything I do feels empty... Now I feel that I will never be able to trust someone and all my dreams left with that person.."

lonely,Dealing with loneliness during COVID,"Dealing with loneliness during COVID - Due to circumstances, I \[24M\] ended up living alone starting about a month ago, and due to COVID, I work remotely. As a result, I'm alone most of the time. I've always been a bit on the introverted side, but always had coworkers, roommates, acquaintances, friends, etc around which kept me not too lonely and satisfied. Now though, I'm alone most of the week, and it's eating away at my sanity. There are some social things I attend, but they're too spaced apart (and short lasting) and due to feeling terrible most of the time because of the loneliness, I end up skipping a lot of them. My family lives an hour away, and a large part of me just wants to move back in to get through COVID, but I feel like I'd be imposing on them, and they push for independence/living alone. I've just never been in this deep of loneliness, and I can't imagine having to go through another year or more of this (who knows when COVID will end, and if office work will even return for many companies). I'm generally a pretty happy/motivated person and care a lot about life, but that all changed since I've become socially isolated. Depression is really something I've never dealt with until now. I thought about finding roommate(s), but I don't think that'll necessarily fix the problem, especially because we won't necessarily get along well and whatnot. I'm finding I just do not have the ability to function without being around people most of the time. Any advise?"
lonely,Am I alone or independent?,"Am I alone or independent? - I love being alone. I love not having anyone by my side and I feel as though I could only be my raw and true self when no one else was around. I always took it as me being independent. The friends I made could never fulfill me like being alone did. Being with my family was never as exciting as being alone in my room at 3am. In my alone time I don’t do much. I just sit there and think, I listen to the silence and it feels as if i’m the only one on earth. I hate letting others see my tears, I hate telling people my problems and I hate being around others because it’s like my thoughts force me to pay attention to what they might be thinking or feeling. Some call me selfish because I just don’t care for human interaction as much and I really only think of myself. Recently, I lost a lot of relationships and even my own partner, but most of all I lost my ability to communicate with others. I always thought I was independent, like I could take care of myself, live my life on my own, and I never needed anyone by my side, but now I realized that maybe all this time I was just alone and not independent. I pushed everyone out of my life so forcefully that no one wants to come back. I use to think I loved being alone, but I think I just liked the thought that I didn’t need anyone. But I think I do need someone. I think I been alone too long, but I always become fearful of others when I want to be someone’s friend. I’m scared of being alone, but I’m also scared of being with everyone."

lonely,Beginning to miss that special someone,"Beginning to miss that special someone - Hi all,

Hope you're all doing well during these times. I wanted to make a post as over the past month or so, I've been really struggling internally. Some background before I go into it; I'm  a 22M who was used to having a girl to talk to and love everyday for 5 years - we were even engaged.

When that ended (she left me for someone else) it broke me, but motivated me to be a much better person; I went from working at Maccies on minimum wage to being a Network Vendor Engineer on a decent wage for my age, all in a year. The breakup happened 15 months ago. I moved out of my parents house and now I live alone.

Ever since I moved in to my own flat alone, Its been getting increasingly lonely. I miss having someone to talk to all night, to hold, hug, kiss and... Yanno. I haven't had a hug or any intimacy with a special someone since that last relationship. 

The rest of my life is going pretty well, but this loneliness is really crippling me inside. I stopped caring about how I look, I've gained weight, my hair is messy; I just don't see the point. I work hard and have friends, games and table tennis as hobbies, but I still feel lonely. Anybody have any advice? I've really been struggling since my last (and first) relationship ended.

Thanks everyone, really appreciate that you took time to read this. Really just need a hug."
lonely,Pain.,"Pain. - I’ve always had friends but even since I completed 9th grade I’ve been thinking that this wasn’t ever considered a friend. I used to hang out with a group of 5 or 7 guys and we were good friends but they’d always hang out and never once asked me if I wanted to join them. And now that we have started high school it’s gotten even lonelier. 
My ex-friends all went to the same school whereas l went to a school in another city because it was just a better school. Ever since then none of them have texted me once, they only send streaks on Snapchat and that’s about it. 
However, I have now become friends with some guys in my new class but sometimes I just feel left out when they have conversations. And it’s kinda hard for me since I’m mostly introverted and I can’t really get along with anyone else because my class only has 8 boys and 26 girls. 
I’ve tried talking with some girls but we couldn’t keep a conversation going because it was kinda awkward. But I don’t wanna put myself with the girls a lot because I don’t wanna fall in love again just to be broken. 
On the other hand my religion and parents don’t really want me taking to girls or even forming relationships ships because they say i am to young and did I gotta become an adult to get a girlfriend. I get where there coming from but how am I supposed to get experience for the future if I don’t do nothing, u know. 
And don’t get me wrong I’m not bad looking I’ve had some compliments from people before but I’m more on the shorter side because of my genetics, something that I can’t control. Therefore I think some girls usually don’t wanna talk. 
I don’t know anymore life is just pain. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest because it’s been annoying and hurting me lately."

Wasted my day baking and playing videogames and browsing my phone. Not this day,every fucking day

At school concentrating is hard because I'm just thinking about sucide. Just end this loneliness. I can't take this shit. nothing helps. maybe exercise does for 30 minutes then I feel shit again. 

Everything I do feels... Pointless. In the Long run what's the point of getting good grades if your gonna be alone for rest of your life ?

What's the point of doing anything??

Sometimes when I'm doing something I remember this is pointless and just stare into the screen/wall and think : what am I doing ? This is just a drug, a escape from my loneliness. This feels dirty. 

And I start to feel nothing.... 

I'm just tired of this... 

No one understands. my fucking dumb shitty brain last year tried to open up a bit in the class group chat and 1 month later s girl form the group chat said I ""was pretending to be depressed'.

I never said I was depressed. I haven't even been diagnosed. Since that day I slowly isolated myself more and more. till today. I left l the group chats as people there don't see just there for memes and shit like that. When I ask if we have a homework or tedt everyone ignores me. why did they add me ?

This was 1 year ago lmao. I'm so pathetic I'm getting angry at things that happened so long ago...

You are not alone. You are never alone. Here’s the comment: 

Sometimes what you’re looking for is right in front of you, sometimes it’s a bit more complicated than that... but regardless of the scenario... you are never alone. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. There are and will always be people out there willing to lend a helping hand... even in your darkest moments. Relationships are complicated and some are better at social skills than others... but that doesn’t mean you’re destined to be lonely. You CAN find love and happiness, you just might need to change your approach to these. Thinking you’re destined to be lonely is a downfall way too many people accept, when it obviously isn’t true. It might or might not help, but when I ever I find myself thinking like this... I say to myself, “Maybe it’s time stop looking, take a break, breath, and reevaluate some things”"

lonely,Loneliness resulting in not feeling listened to or understood--is it me or is my bar too high or...?,"Loneliness resulting in not feeling listened to or understood--is it me or is my bar too high or...? - I wonder what is wrong with me that most of my so-called friends do not listen to me. (There are maybe three who do most of the time but one is email only, one lives two hours away, and one had a crush on me and I've told her no to that route, so now she doesn't listen to me.)

Anyway, I wonder these things:

1. What is wrong with ME that I have ""friends"" like this? There has to be something wrong. I mean, I have to not be listening to friends to get friends who don't listen to me, correct? But, see, there is a problem with that because I do think I listen.  My job involves listening to and helping people, so I think I'm pretty good at it. I value it so much too that I'm always trying to be better at it. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I am getting what I dish out. Thoughts?

2. Maybe my bar is too high? As I said, for work I listen to people and they listen to me. I see how good it is. I expect this from personal relationships. So maybe my bar isn't too high, but maybe I'm using the wrong measuring stick? What I mean is that maybe personal relationships and professional ones can't be compared? Thoughts?"

I mean, yeah sure, now I’m friends with two persons and I’m acquainted with my other classmates, but I always feel like such an outsider, my friends always talk about things I’m not familiarized with, and when I ask about what they are talking about they dismiss it and ignore me, even tho they claim to be my best friends, I’m don’t know them, truth is, they are the closest I’m gonna get to having new friends, and that makes me feel so, so alone, now, today one of them bailed on me, then I had to go to the volunteer thingy alone, which I don’t mind because I like it, but then, I had to spend time with three of my classmates and two teachers who pity me (mostly one because the other was busy) and I thought it would make no big deal, boi I was wrong, I’m acquainted and, dare I call us, friends with 2 of them, the problem was they are like bffs with the other kid, which I have only interacted a few times, and honestly? I wanted to be his friend because he reminds me of my ex-best friend, is the type of people I used to hang out with, and seems like a real cool person, problem is, my introverted, anxious and quiet ass was too awkward so I couldn’t even maintain a conversation and they ended up drifting away, like everyone else, so I spent the whole day thinking of how alone I am, why did I think I deserve friends? Happiness? Someone I could trust? One year and this is the closest I’m gonna get to socializing with my own classmates? The people I see everyday? They still think of me as the new kid, hell, even the other kid from the same country as me pities me, honestly, I too still think of myself as the new kid, it’s just, its really REALLY hard for me to not to stay quiet around people I don’t know, and the only ones that stick around drift away too because I’m actually a little extroverted when I get comfortable, but nobody’s willing to stick around through all of that,and I can’t talk anymore with the only  ones that did because time zones.

lonely,An Autumn Tale,"An Autumn Tale - *This is just a little example of a romance I made up in my mind (and how it got destroyed). Think this just happens when you're a romantic person but you never experience some in real life...*   


""What are you playing? Sounds nice!""  
I turn my head around, away from the piano, and there she stands, with a big smile on her face, carrying the scent of fresh, cold air into our living room.   
""Oh, I just improvised over some melodies that came to my mind, no big thing. How was your walk with Sammy?""  
""It was great to see her again after her semester abroad, we had a lot to talk about.""

She takes off her yellow beanie, revealing the long, tousled hair under it. Once again I notice that her eyes and her hair have the excact same color. A deep, mystical brown, looking like a whole forest is trapped in her iris.  
""Your hair looks like a mess"", I say with a mischievous grin.  
""Easy for you to say, you have none."" We both have to laugh and she lovingly strokes my head, which is, in fact, completely bold.   
""I'll go make some tea"", she says, ""maybe we could continue with the puzzle?""

She kisses me on the forehead and goes to the kitchen. I get up from my piano stool, making myself comfortable on the couch with a blanket. It's almost dark outside, so I decide to light some candles to avoid switching on the bright ceiling lamp. 

The cover of the puzzle shows a picture of a couple walking down an avenue at night. The leaves of the trees shine colorful in the light of the antique street lamps. The man carries an umbrella. She walks really close to him so she is safe from from the raindrops.

Next to the cover is a small pile of puzzle pieces which still have to be put in their right place. And the puzzle, that is almost finished, except a small part in the middle. 

I can already smell the scent of wild berries as my girl enters the living room with two hot cups of tea.

""Don't you think it's a little too dark to see what's on the pieces?"", she asks.  
""Naah, I think we can manage it. Come here, there's enough space under the blanket for both of us.""  
She snuggles up to me and there we sit, dimmed light, the soft sound of rain outside. 'This is home', I think.

""Ok, seems like only the couple in the middle is missing. Can't wait to finish this finally!"", she says, full of excitement. ""I'll make the guy and you'll make the girl"", she adds. 

We start searching the pile for the right pieces.  
""Uhmm, I think there are some parts missing"", I note after a while.  
""I can't imagine that"", she anwers. ""I did a lot of puzzles and this never happened before.""  
She already put the pieces of the guy together and included him in the puzzle. Only the place where the woman should be is still empty.

""Yes I swear!"", I insist. ""None of the pieces I need are there."" 

I turn my head to her, but nobody is sitting next to me. I close my eyes and picture how it could be one last time. It could be so wonderful. It could be home.

lonely,I Just Want a Sleeping Partner,"I Just Want a Sleeping Partner - Lately, I've really wanted a partner to fall asleep with. Usually I'm okay during the day with my lonely spells, and I can fill the void with funny youtube videos or games, but going to sleep has been so hard. I just want a significant other to make sleeping easier. No amount of plushies help the desire for a hug to fall asleep in. I even want to hear them loudly snoring so I know they're there when I wake up in the middle of the night."

I have all this love to give, but no one to give it to. I've had sexual relations  in the past but that doesn't satisfy me. I crave the romance and the intimacy. Is that too much to ask for? I've always either liked someone or they've liked me one sidedly. The one time I like someone and they liked me back, we moved to different cities and ended up drifting apart. 
And to add to the lack of romantic interests, I seem to have lost most of friends in the past few years. Not because of any fights or anything, but simply because we grew apart and it breaks my heart. I've noticed that if I don't initiate the conversation, I'll end up never talking to the person again. I'm just fucking tired man. 
Okay, rant over. Thank you for reading if you did."

I ask because something peculiar happened to me today.
I posted here today and between all the messages and replies I got 2 people sending me pm. Both of them suggesting me to use this app that apparently helped them to make friends online.
The thing is they both used the same exact 5 messages, and while one of them was a blank account, so probably a bot, the other looked like a legit user, with post and comment history.
They sent me a link too (that ofc I didn't click on) and I checked online but I found really little info about it beside its Google play store and app store page."
lonely,How does having a family feel like?,"How does having a family feel like? - I haven't had a family since I was 4. My parents divorced, everyone started hating each other, that includes grandparents. I've moved more that 6 times in my life. Never was in a nice normal house. Now I'm 18 and don't live with my mom or dad. Both started new families and I'm left alone with grandparents who don't really care. 

Never did any activities people do with thier families, never learned important human/social skills. Always had to go by in life because it was a shitshow really. 

Not experiencing any love or even affection my whole life feels debilitating. When I see other people having nice and loving families I feel depressed. Not because of their joy, but because of my lack of it.

Everyone is always confused how I'm so clueless when we are talking about families. Shows me that my situation really isn't normal. 

When other people go through hardships, they probably have even a bit of support from others, I've never had that, I had to deal with everything alone, and ngl I feel like I won't be able to do it for much longer. 

I don't know how a hug feels, to be honest I don't even know how oxytocin feels. Everyone always tells me I look tired, I guess that this stuff even affects your brain's chemicals.

I'm scared that I won't even know how to show love or affection to anyone, but I crave it. Not like there's anyone that I could show it to. I don't have anyone in my life.

Ahhh it's really hard."
lonely,Date with a new friend turned out to be a date with disaster,"Date with a new friend turned out to be a date with disaster - I feel absolutely devastated after something that happened today. So basically me and this guy have been talking on Bumble, which is like tinder but also for friendships. We seemed similar in a lot of regards, similar interests like anime, vidya, music and stuff, he was always very ""on"". Writing often and asking a lot of questions and I answered in full, like personal details and stuff. I did notice something was off when we talked via text but I couldn't put my finger on it. 
He said that he wanted to meet up and I said sure, which we did today at a local bar. I had forgotten but he said he also was 2 meters tall, which I'm as well but I felt tiny in comparison. He sat down and he was like reaaaaally into asking me personal questions, I felt extremely intimidated but I didnt know what to say, so I answered the best I could. There was something unstable about this guy that I couldn't put my finger on, but I felt that we didnt really have chemistry as friends, I'm more laid back and reserved and he wasnt. Like at all. 
So I went to the bathroom trying to figure out what the fuck I was gonna do, so made up some bullshit and told him that I had to leave and he didnt really ask any questions.
The thing is that I feel absolutely awful, in a lot of ways.
He probably thought we would be best friends, but I felt more like there was a *significant* gap in maturity between us both. Which sucks because you start to grow these huge expectations as well, but truthfully you shouldn't, because in reality if it's too good to be true, it usually is. I'm a pretty weird guy, I have weird interests and weird personality, the few people I keep matching with are people I dont want to hang out with. I also exposed a lot about myself which I now in hindsight shouldn't have done, it's like I feel gross in some way and thirdly and most important; I do remember having a lot of ""friends"" that see me as a second-rate friend and not one of their closest circle, they probably felt what I felt when talking to this guy and it made me think of what garbage human I am.  
I at least told him afterwards that we didnt match that good and he seemed okay with it so at least there's that. 
I just needed to vent this and I know I'm gonna get hate for telling this story, I'm completely fine with that. And if you read this, I'm sorry, it wasnt meant to be."

lonely,The only reason I don't kill is because I don't want to leave my stuffed animals alone....,"The only reason I don't kill is because I don't want to leave my stuffed animals alone.... - I (25F) have been through a LOT. Since I was 8 years old everything went downhill.   
I was a happy kid and had a few good friends. I did good on school and was very good at  athletics. When I became 8 years old we moved to a house 2 km away. Every day after school I would play outside, twice athletics in a week and one match/training every Sunday. But a few week later after we moved I felt not good. I couldn't run as fast as I normally could, I just became bad at everything. I always felt tired and I can't 10 kilos in 6 months times. I had to stop with athletics because after each training I couldn't walk the stairs anymore or barely ride my bicycle back home.   


Since than I also lost my friends, I had to move to a different school and got extremely bullied there. Everyday I come home with tears all over my face. Lucky enough I had a pet rabbit who helped me a lot trough those years, miss you Snuitje &lt;3 r.i.p. but I became more sick each day. Even the whole summer vacation I spend inside sleeping. I could sleep for 4 hours in the day and 8 hours in the night, in total I slept 12 hours a day. I again had to change to a different school, I did got bullied there to, but way less than on the previous school. But sadly enough my older sister also bullied me a lot at home.   
Everyday was a hell. Not only on school but at home too. Because I was sick a lot, my parents took me to doctors, hospitals etc etc.. All claimed that something was not good, but they didn't know what. Sugar? No that was good, thyroid? kinda low, but good enough. for many years I have visited many hospitals and doctors. Never with any result. But they did agree something was wrong.   


I stayed many times at home, which cause that child care came after me and my parents. THEY WERE SO HORRIBLE! They never believed me that I was sick, and even when I had 0% energy, I still had to fight against them, even one day I was extremely sick. I had an appointment at the office of youth Services, and I was as white as a ghost. They told me to go to school after the appointment, but I felt so HORRIBLE SO SICK and I just threw up over their desk. Oh boy they were mad and still didn't believe me. Because I missed some days at school I had many lawsuits, me getting community service and my parents fines, even one time €2000,- Even when we had a note from the doctor that I was really sick, but that they couldn't figure out what....  


So this all happend from the age of 8 till 21 and everyday was hell at home thanks to my older sister who bullied me, stole from me, hitted me etc. My parents fighting because of youth service, because of the lawsuits and because of my older sister..   


All this time I had nothing but my pet rabbit who died when I was 16. and my stuffed animals. I always have them on my bed and I am really attached to them. I don't know why... but all this time I never had friends and still don't have. I did have relationships, but after being in a relationship the changed and started gaslighting, cheating etc. I did have a psychiatrist where I talked about my relationships and she told me that I should stop caring about people so much even if I was in relationship.. and that I pushed these people away because I was ''too nice''   


anyways, thanks to being bullied on my work I got fired 2 months before corona happend. (I was the only Dutch person, so racism was there aswell). Since than I haven't found a new job yet. I only finished highschool but nothing after thanks to my illness back than.   


Everyday since I finished highschool I only talked to my parents sometimes (I still live at home) and when I was in a relationship I had sometimes my than bf to talk to, but that was more listing to them talking about their family and work, and playing games and watching series they want to play and see.   


I do try to work hard everyday to become a better person, and I have been on dating sites to find a good relationship and friends, but I have only been on horrible dates. And the good dates did end in a relationship, but only to be gaslighted a few months later.  Trying to find friends in online gaming didn't work out either.   


So for many many years, I am alone no one to talk to except sometimes my parents. I just spend most of my days trying to sell items online, gaming, reading, listing to music, going outside for walks with cleaning up garbage. Going to the cinema, musea, concerts etc but I have just never been succesful in getting friends. Its not that I am extremely ugly, or awkward or anything, but it just didn't happen.. I have even 0 friends on discord. I even got made fun of by my sister that I have 0 friends and that a girl should be easily be able to have many friends.   


I am sorry for the long post and I am sorry for my bad english.  It is hard to explain everything here, so if you got any questions, feel free to ask me =) I hope you all do a lot better than me! Stay safe and love yourself =)"
lonely,25m - let’s be lonely together :),"25m - let’s be lonely together :) - hi! i’m a twenty-five year old guy from the us, more specifically the east coast. i’d prefer to find people that are also in north america, given time zones. if your sleep schedule is as messed up as mine, i’m willing to befriend people from anywhere, really! i’m an infj to the core; if there’s something i fail to mention, it‘s described perfectly by myers-briggs. i put my all into everything i do, though that has bitten me in the ass more than i’d like to admit. will i continue doing it? absolutely. i’m a loyal friend, easy to talk to, and i enjoy making others laugh.

i love animals. i’ve had pets ranging from puppies and kittens to fish and hedgehogs. i’m a dog person, but my cat changed my view of felines in general. i’ll send you photos of my dogs and cat, but only if you promise to do the same! free pass if you don’t have any, but i might make you send me memes to compensate. 

i’ve found that music is therapeutic for me. what’s on repeat for me? joji’s new album nectar. if you’ve listened to it, what’s your favorite song? in addition to nectar, i like lauv’s album “i met you when i was 18.” and finneas latest release “blood harmony.”

i enjoy gaming. i typically stick to 1-3 games at a time, but i’ll play something else if prompted. at the moment, valorant and dead by daylight are my favorites... as well as animal crossing when i’m relaxing in bed. if you have any terraforming tips, please help. i’m lost out here haha. it’s also worth mentioning that i’ve had internet issues recently, so gaming isn’t *as important* as it typically is. 

i’d love to find someone that i can watch shows and movies with. perhaps we could binge watch halloween movies given the fact that it’s spooky szn? more specifically, i’d like to rewatch the scream and halloween movies to start with. i’ve also gotta watch nightmare before christmas at some point! if horror isn’t your thing, i’m open to other genres as well! 

above all, i’d like to meet likeminded people that i can form meaningful connections with. i’m looking for friends, but if something develops beyond that and i gain someone to mutually annoy for years, i’m down. if you feel like we’d get along based upon what i’ve written, shoot me a chat or a message! 

**please don’t message me with one or two words. as i stated above, i’m looking for meaningful connections.**"

I have “friends” but no one I can actually talk to.

I am sick, and got nobody I could just truly trust and feel good with them. I'm too afraid to chat with anyone, that even claims that is in similar situation and I could understand them.
My life is, I would call it, a stable mess. But with my moods I feel like.. I'd just like to disappear.
I just want to hug to something else than the pillow, talk with someone and be accepted with all my imperfections. Yet I just can't make a step to get to know someone, I know they will get tired of me, that I can't think of anything interesting to talk about and I'm going to be just a fifth wheel.

lonely,LONELY LIKE ALWAYS,"LONELY LIKE ALWAYS - I've never been lonely. I've been in a room -- I've felt suicidal. I've been depressed. I've felt awful -- awful beyond all -- but I never felt that one other person could enter that room and cure what was bothering me...or that any number of people could enter that room. In other words, loneliness is something I've never been bothered with because I've always had this terrible itch for solitude. It's being at a party, or at a stadium full of people cheering for something, that I might feel loneliness. I'll quote Ibsen, ""The strongest men are the most alone."" I've never thought, ""Well, some beautiful blonde will come in here and give me a fuck-job, rub my balls, and I'll feel good."" No, that won't help. You know the typical crowd, ""Wow, it's Friday night, what are you going to do? Just sit there?"" Well, yeah. Because there's nothing out there. It's stupidity. Stupid people mingling with stupid people. Let them stupidify themselves. I've never been bothered with the need to rush out into the night. I hid in bars, because I didn't want to hide in factories.

lonely,No friends,"No friends - Not entirely true.. I do have one online friend who is is supportive and caring. I'm lucky to have them.

But no actual irl friends. I've always had trouble making friends and making friendships last. After middle school I've had only one friend. Later on we kinda only had eachother so we stuck around eachother. They now made new friends and we've drifted apart. By my fault. I don't know how to make new friends. I'm always paranoid that people don't actually like me or want to hang out with me, and if they do put up with me they take every chance to make fun of me and are judging me every second.

So I choose to not go anywhere and isolate myself. So I know I won't ever make any new friends. It's too scary. I'm too boring.

It's a horrible feeling knowing you don't have anyone to sit down with and just talk about everything.

I have had to fight an uphill struggle for any amount of affection that wasnt pity, or faked to get what they wanted. I have been told im attractive, but those people who told me that have never been among those who they claim would find me attractive, so how can I beleive them when no one else has ever thought so? The thought of a simple hug I dont have to let go of until Im ready to, is one of my greatest fantasies. The few, genuine ones I have had left me in a state of shock days after becuase of how foreign it was to me, but not in any bad way. More like the feeling of the first time you got a buzz mixed with the phantom feeling of having braces removed. I avoid sleep so I don't dream about being alone like I usually do, or dream at all becuade if I dream Im not alone I have to wake up and return to a painful reality. I have been to hospitals, seen therapists, and psychiatrists. Receive medication, and treatment. I try to live everyday, but it never gets easier, it never feels any less painful just to live. I have no freinds becuase no one thinks about me enough to ever even check on me or talk to me once I lose the energy to do all the work in maintaining a friendship. Hope is something I have long since abandoned as desperate foolishness. The thoughts of ending it all, my situation, doesn't even get me emotional anymore. It has become like breathing. Is there a point that people become unsalvageable? Have I reached it? Am I close? Why has no one ever loved me? How can I justify hanging on to these miniscule odds of finding someone to genuinely care? Will anyone even care about this post? Someone tell me what to do, if thete is anything to be done, but please by whatever you beleive in, don't tell me to just ""not give up"" becuase it has been said so many times that it has lost all meaning. I am losing the energy more and more everyday to tell myself to keep going, and I dont have much more. I dont know what to do..."
